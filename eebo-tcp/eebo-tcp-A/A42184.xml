         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER, To whom it may Concern.</head>
            <p>MY Intention, is not to expoſe Phyſick, but thoſe who have done it: They are indeed of the Faculty, and I am ſorry for it. The Twelve tho Select, yet had One Traitor among them; and is it ſtrange that a greater Number ſhould contain a leſs Proportion of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy? Whoever reproacheth an Art for the Crime of an Artiſt, condemns his own; for none is Exempt: He that chargeth me with anothers Fault, is as guilty as my ſelf of the Fact, and juſtly of the Slander. But if I muſt ſuffer in my Art, whilſt publickly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Cenſors Violence; 'tis by Ends, not true Judgment muſt be the Occaſion. They have acted ill; what is that to the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or College? Suppoſe Four of it had jointly been Felons, muſt all the reſt be Thieves? They have indeed expoſed the College, but originally by Paſſion; they perſiſt in their Injuſtice, ſupported by Pride: But ſome do the ſame with an Intent to deſtroy it.
<pb facs="tcp:32023:4"/>
They have evidenced their Spight againſt one, ſhew their Teeth at ſome few: But others ſtrike at All, whether in or againſt their Interest. What mean elſe thoſe Libels publickly diſperſed to the diſgrace of the Faculty? The Authors ridicule Phyſicians; a pretty Way to ſecure themſelves from Contempt: They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly juſt to themſelves, whileſt injuſt to the Art they pretend to, and as qualified for Wit and Railery, as the late Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were for their Office. 'Tis meer Baregarding Stuff, like that of the pretended great defender of an Art he neer learned, tho ever teaching it. I am ſorry to ſee ſo great a Body buckle to one whoſe only indeavour is, by indirect means to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Great, when juſtly he cannot. This knight Errant in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, defends he knows not what; attacks he can't tell whom; and hates all but his Dulcigna, his ſweet imaginary Greatneſs; hath nothing of his own, but what no One would claim: But this Plagiary Jackdaw may e're long be Plum'd by a <hi>Leaden</hi> Dr. it's wings clipt, and it's ſelf expoſed to the Contempt of Boys; becauſe it pretends to ſoar with the Eagles: There are notwithſtanding, and will be ſtill honeſt Phyſicians of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, in ſpight of all forreign Oppoſitions, or inteſtine Broils. All Bodies, by the Inſtigation of ſome few Boutefeus, may be guilty of Miſmanagement; none are exempt from Fault: Pray allow us but to be equally Obnoxious with the reſt of Mankind. All then I deſire is, That there may be a difference put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Innocent and Guilty, as I have endeavour'd it in my Tract; which whether it will pleaſe you with the Preface I know not: All will neither be pleaſing to, nor underſtood by All: But take it as you pleaſe to underſtand it: I ſhall ſoon be out of Pain; either by ſlighting both Criticiſms and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, or by a ſpeedy Anſwer.</p>

            <head>THE Late CENSORS Deſervedly Cenſured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE worthy Late Cenſors, after ſo many fruitleſs Attempts, to Exempt themſelves from the Juſtice of the Law; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baffl'd in all their Applications, either to His Majeſty, the Right Honourable the Lords, or other inferiour Courts and Perſons; and finding that the more they ſtir, the more they are bemir'd and ſtink: Have now at laſt, as their utmoſt Effort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought themſelves of the late Expedient of Popularity.</p>
            <p>In Order hereunto, to ſupport their tottering Credit and Cauſe, they oblige the World with a ſingle Sheet for three Pence; Intituled it as if addreſſed to the higheſt Court of Juſtice: And being fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in all their Appeals, make it now to the Mob, make them their Judges and Peers.</p>
            <p>They take no Notice of their own Remarks upon the Proſecutors Reaſons, nor of his Reply; being aſham'd of the One, and juſtly afraid of the other.</p>
            <p>For that Reply, as it fully anſwers all their idle Pretences, hath been ſatisfactory to the Lords and Commons; ſo cannot be anſwer'd, containing only Matters of Fact, backt with irrefragable Reaſons, and ſhrew'd Circumſtances; confirm'd by Oaths of Credible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Which laſt, is the higheſt Argument of Truth in any, but ſuch, who to palliate their evident Injuſtice, have ſtill, this their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Recourſe, to that <hi>Crambe biſcocta,</hi> their <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Conſciences,</hi> in Oppoſition to the Laws and Juſtice of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:32023:5"/>
Furthermore, being fully convinc'd, that no One of the Late Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors could endite even ſo ſilly a Paper as I am about to Anſwer, for reaſons beſt known to them that know them; I was at laſt forc'd to conclude, that it muſt be the Product of a <hi>Noddle</hi> ever tipſy with Good-Ale, and Brains ſtill crowing by the ſeminal Influence of ſome hundreds of Eggs devour'd <hi>Anno Vertente,</hi> which unleſs check'd by <hi>Cortex</hi> and <hi>Opium,</hi> had e're now grown fledg'd: Eſpecially if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Stile, ſo like that of the publick betrayer of the <hi>State, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims</hi> and <hi>Secrets</hi> of the <hi>College,</hi> and to uſe his own Words ſo <hi>inimical</hi> to Truth and Sincerity, more then (in his own great Sence) unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Cantharides</hi> can be to the Body.</p>
            <p>Yet retaining ſome Reſpect to their ſeeming <hi>Gravity</hi> and qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sadneſs,</hi> though now out of the <hi>Santo Officio,</hi> not coopt up in the <hi>Inquiſition Chamber,</hi> but breathing the free Air as yet; I waited and ſought in the publick Papers a required Recantation: This three Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sheet, as well as the two Penny State of Phyſick, Meriting at leaſt an equivocating Denyal. But ſeeing now they own it, and their ſour Temper cannot be alter'd, and continues nettled at good uſage; they muſt be cruſh'd to make them inoffenſive, ſeeing they Sting when tenderly handled.</p>
            <p>And tho' that Paper <hi>deleterious</hi> to it ſelf doth, like other <hi>Poiſons,</hi> carry it's own <hi>Antidote</hi> with it, anſwering it ſelf by it's own Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Contradictions and Falſhood, to any unbiaſſed Reader that hath been inform'd of this Affair; yet for the ſake of thoſe that are diſtant from Town, and out of the reach of their <hi>Heptamiliary Quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> Power, I thought to foul my Fingers, anatomize it exactly, and expoſe it (as it juſtly deſerves) in the Publick Theatre of <hi>England,</hi> to the View and Scorn of all.</p>
            <p>But finding, tho' without any accurate Search, That the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal conſiſtent Parts are, 1. <hi>Contradiction.</hi> 2. <hi>Falſhood.</hi> 3. <hi>Ignorance.</hi> 4. <hi>Ill Manners.</hi> 5. <hi>Like Conduct.</hi> Yet all ſo complicated, as to make but One intire <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot of <hi>Nonſence;</hi> it needs not be diſſected now I think on't, it merits not ſo great a Hand: But ſeeing it is round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cover'd with a limber <hi>Conſcience,</hi> blown up with <hi>Bombaſt,</hi> and got amongſt the Mob, let it e'ne be kick'd about, till it be deſervedly loſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>1ſt.</hi> of the Reaſons they pretend to Anſwer is the following Reaſon;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> 
               <q>Becauſe the ſaid Cenſors did not only take upon them an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Truſt and Judicial Authority, wherein the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32023:5"/>
of the Subject is highly concerned without qualifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but alſo executed the ſame with utmoſt Violence againſt an innocent Perſon, as may more plainly appear in their Proceedings againſt Dr. <hi>John Greenfield,</hi> a Member of the ſaid College, who having been accuſed by a vexatious Woman of ill Practice ſeveral Years before was twice acquitted by preceding Cenſors: But theſe Gentlemen proud of their Authority, and having no regard to the Juſtice and Judgment of their Predeceſſors, and in Contempt of two conſecutive Acts of Grace from the King and Parliament, did, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, fine the aboveſaid Dr. <hi>Greenfield</hi> for that imaginary Crime, without ſuffering the ſaid Doctor to clear himſelf by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and having ſigned a Warrant and appointed an Officer of their own Creation, did commit him to <hi>Newgate</hi> without Bail or Main-prize, and there detained him till the firſt Day of the enſuing Term, when and where the Honourable the Judges of the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> convinced them of their illegal Proceedings and diſcharged the ſaid Dr. <hi>Greenfield</hi> in open Court.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this they reply, that it is <hi>a Malicious Charge, drawn up and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd againſt the Cenſors of the College of Phyſicians</hi> [who] <hi>took no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon themſelves, but what is veſted in them by two Acts of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi> &amp;c. The preſent Cenſors having qualifyed themſelves, and the reſt, ſince the including Act of Grace acting inoffenſively; the preſent cannot, the former need not fear a <hi>Proſecution.</hi> The Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Charge is ſolely againſt the late, nam'd in the Reaſons and Title of this Tract; which Charge as it is true, cannot be <hi>Malicious,</hi> and not againſt any Cenſors, but thoſe that were ſo, now only Cenſorious, with that indeleble Character I hope: But if their biennial Power, be perpetuated in their Conceipt, and once a Cenſor muſt e're be ſo; let them e'ne be ſtill the Kings of <hi>Branford,</hi> let them imagine the Power of the two Acts to be <hi>veſted in them,</hi> appropriated to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and inſeparable from their Quality; whilſt they are deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of that Place, Power and Truſt they have ſo notoriouſly abus'd: But <hi>Morta la Beſtia, morto lo Veleno;</hi> let them rattle with their Tails, their Fang-teeth are out. Yet though their Anthority be gone, their Sence continues the ſame. They boaſt of a great <hi>Power veſted by Law;</hi> but no <hi>Truſt</hi> at all; deny the taking of an Office upon them, but own they are choſen into, and accept of the Place; think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves warranted by two Acts of Parliament in the executing of a Power, in Contempt of Four others: I mean the Two of Grace, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32023:6"/>
both the qualifying Acts.

            </p>
            <p>A ſolemn Oath is a ſacred Tye and Motive to Juſtice; but where this is wanting, that always aggravates the Crime, can never juſtifie the Action. Finding then, that a gentle Rebuke in general Terms will not avail, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the former Reply, That <hi>their Oath was not binding to act illegally,</hi> and <hi>where it doth ſo, the Conſtitution is faulty;</hi> a ſeverer Laſh muſt ſtop this full mouth'd Cry upon a wrong Scent.

But ſeeing 'tis not this, pray tell us what Oath it was that bound you, to reaſſume the Cognizance of an Affair twice determin'd before, by the ſame Authority; to commit the Innocent, when you were diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by two Acts of Parliament to act ſo by a Criminal; to declare that a Poiſon when given by Dr. <hi>Greenfield</hi> with its due <hi>Corrector,</hi> which muſt be a harmleſs <hi>Medicine,</hi> becauſe given by two of you Cenſors without an <hi>Antidote;</hi> to refuſe the admitting of Witneſſes, which were afterwards ſatisfactory to a ſuperiour Court; to deny the Tryal of his <hi>Corrector</hi> upon other Animals; to exact the utmoſt Farthing the Law allow'd you; to fine and impriſon too, a Collegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, in an unpreſidented Manner; to ſend him to <hi>Newgate</hi> for the firſt Offence (as in your great Wiſdoms you thought) when choice of Priſons of leſs Scandal might ſerve, to be deaf when intreated not

            <p>Next you multiply your <hi>Power</hi> by a Piece-meal Recital.

Let us examine you a little, tho' not now at the Cenſors board. Were you <hi>Profound, Sad, Diſcreet, well vers'd in Learning and deeply skill'd in Phyſick:</hi> You'l ſay perhaps, theſe <hi>Epithets,</hi> are requiſite in Perſons to be admitted into that Society, not in the Cenſors that govern the ſame, according to the expreſs Words of the Law. The Fact I ſhall not diſpute; but certainly they are to be choſen out of ſuch, and continue the ſame. The 1 <hi>ſt.</hi> indeed may be allow'd; for your Senſe is out of the reach of, <hi>diſproportionate</hi> to, and <hi>incommenſurate</hi> with that of the reſt of Mankind. <hi>Sad</hi> you are in the preſent acceptation of the Word, your Actions ſhew you ſuch, and the preſent fear of a due Reward, doth and will make you no other. But now in <hi>ſober Sadneſs,</hi> what is become of the Third?

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32023:7"/>
your piece meal Loyalty was ſuch, that the Omiſſion of it you count but a <hi>Peccadillo.</hi> The preſent Cenſors got here the Start of you, and triumph over your Ignorance. It was no doubt the greateſt Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imaginable, to Commit a Brother for <hi>Mala Praxis,</hi> yea very great <hi>Mala Praxis</hi> as the Judicious <hi>Go—le</hi> expreſſed it at the Board, the giving of <hi>Poiſon</hi> I mean, when ſome of your ſelves were guilty of the ſame; Guilty I ſay, in your own <hi>Conſciences,</hi> becauſe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd it in another; though he be Innocent, having prov'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo in the Superiour Court: But this is not all, had this Affair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd within the <hi>College</hi> and <hi>Newgate</hi> Walls, and not been expos'd by you ſo often in the Publick Courts, inforc'd by repeated <hi>Libels,</hi> ſpread amongſt the <hi>Mob,</hi> perſiſted in to the utmoſt in Oppoſition to the Senſe of Mankind, and Contempt of definitive Juſtice; it might have been pardon'd. <hi>Humanum eſt errare, in Errore perſiſtere Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</hi> But again to puſh it more home, tho' in milder Terms, you will ſay he was Fined and Impriſoned, for not duly executing the Practice of Phyſick; but who was it Gentlemen? A Graduate Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, your fellow Collegiate, unqueſtionable when admitted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo for many Years, till it pleas'd you to have it otherwiſe. Reflect upon it, I pray, as the reſt of Mankind to my knowledge doth now: What Phyſician ſhall we truſt, when neither his being of the <hi>College</hi> doth warrant his Skill, nor his continued Practice approve his Judgment in Adminiſtring? Whom ſhall we except, when all are liable to the ſame Miſtakes? This doth not only affect you, but the whole Faculty of Phyſick, however diffuſed, divided or diſtinguiſh'd in this Famous City, and through the Univerſe. Would the leaſt Mechanick Society have acted ſo publickly againſt a ſingle <hi>Member,</hi> if his expoſing tended to the Diſrepute of all the Reſt: For tho the Character of an honeſt Phyſician be in it ſelf real, where is there a Fence againſt Suſpicion; tho' groundleſs when ſtarted, it's <hi>Flight</hi> and <hi>Pitch</hi> is incertain; and you only can be Exempt when at the Board, and that only in your own Conceipt, not deciſive Judgment. <hi>Dat Veniam Corvis, vexat Cenſura Columbas.</hi>

            <p>Your <hi>Profit</hi> indeed as worthily manag'd, together with the College Stock, but ſmall; but upon Examination of Perſons to be admitted Certain.

I muſt now rake up this ſhameful Affair, being forc'd to it by your no better Denial. This Woman (one of the looſer Gang of Pedlars, that offer good Pennyworths of Muſlin, under pretence of a Seamans <hi>Covert Baron</hi> and <hi>Long Reach)</hi> lay <hi>Perdu</hi> for about ſix Years, to regain her forty Shillings; and ſeeing her yearly Applications to conſecutive Cenſors, were not prevalent to cauſe the Doctor to refund, what he but too dearly earn'd; tho' ſhe found her Partizans baffl'd, and the Doctor diſcharg'd by the Judges; yet thought (forſooth) to jump into an Eſtate, by ſuch a favourable Opportunity, and commenc'd a Suit of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> againſt the Doctor, but unluckily it was ſome time after he had brought his, in the like Summ againſt the Cenſors, for falſe Impriſonment. This was a plain deſign to quaſh both the Actions, there being no <hi>Overplus</hi> to be contended about in either: But the Doctor thought it Unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; ſhe goes on and puts him to the Expence of 50 <hi>l.</hi> by dilatory Courſes; Summons the Cenſors to give Evidence in what they had Condemn'd before on her behalf, influenceth their numerous Party, (more then ever were ſeen in any Court) to defend her Cauſe tooth and nail, and at laſt upon the Verdict againſt her, pays the Coſts as ſoon as demanded. Do you think all the World is at <hi>Blindmansbuff;</hi> and every one you ſee at <hi>Ecco lo Cieco,</hi> and your ſelves under Covert cauſe winking? No, Dr. <hi>Burwells</hi> menial Servant, that poor addica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Officer of yours <hi>John Cole,</hi> hath related the Fact to an Eminent Phyſician, a little before his own Death: That by an expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of your Attorney, he waited on Mr. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and conducted him to that Womans Houſe, in order to commence that Suit.

The Doctor ſtill reſerves a <hi>Cardinal</hi> Evidence <hi>in Petto,</hi> till his numerous Scruples, about a <hi>Maintenance of a Suit, Champeatie, and Common Barretrie,</hi> are fully ſatisfy'd. Now I ſhall readily grant you, that the <hi>Advertiſement</hi> you ſpeak of, was <hi>Impudent</hi> and <hi>Scandalous,</hi> and lying as to Matter of Fact; but I muſt acquaint the World, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Doctor, nor any of his Friends I am ſure, had any Hand in it.

            <p>Now we will go on to the Matter of Fact, as by you related. <hi>The Doctor brought the ſaid Woman thirty ſix Grains of Cantharides, to be taken to Cure an Ulcer of the Bladder, whereof ſhe took thirty Grains in</hi> 12 <hi>Hours, upon which enſued,</hi> Firſt, <hi>great Pains and Torments with bloody Urine; and then voyding of <hi>ſeveral</hi> Quarts of perfect Blood, with <hi>Skins and Fleſh</hi> That ſhecontinued twenty two Weeks in great Torment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:32023:12"/>
The Truth of this, as it was declar'd and prov'd in Court, when the Doctor caſt this Woman, or the Cenſors rather; is the following, <hi>viz.</hi> Upon the Doctors extraordinary Succeſs in curing Ulcers in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the <hi>Cantharides</hi> (which is a Diſtemper hitherto accounted incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable), he was recommended by ſome of his former Patients to this Perſon, and found her troubled with it, and a <hi>Scyrrhus</hi> in the <hi>Vagina Uteri</hi> and <hi>Cancerous Piles</hi> withal; he ſends her eighteen of the Pills, with their Corrector <hi>Camphire</hi> ſeparately; but with poſitive Orders not to take them but in his Preſence, in order to give more or leſs, as the Caſe upon particular Signs ſhould require: She impatient of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, takes ſome of them in his Abſence, and without the <hi>Corrector,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſome <hi>Pains</hi> and bloody Water enſued; but no more then what is but too uſual, upon the bare applying of a Bliſter. The Doctor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent for in haſte, chides her, but takes off the Pains and bloody Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter immediately; ſends her into the Country, and attends almoſt daily upon her, for his forty Shillings. Not one ill Word againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor all this while, all the Clamour was againſt Mrs. <hi>Salloway</hi> the Midwife; who clear'd her ſelf from injuring the Perſon, by Doctors <hi>Coatſworth</hi> and <hi>Gibſon</hi> call'd in, they finding then <hi>Cancerous Piles</hi> were the Cauſe of her Pains, for the Ulcer was gone. This Clamour being obviated, the Doctor was thought on about two Years after, at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of one of the Cenſors, whom the Doctor had exaſperated, as he eaſily will be. The Doctor being clear'd; the Woman muſters up her tatter'd Crew to Swear that horrid Nonſenſe, produceth the <hi>Affidavits;</hi> the Cenſors Condemn him upon them; the Court of <hi>Kings Bench</hi> upon impartial hearing Acquits him of the Fact.</p>
            <p>This being ſo, you are egregiouſly out both as to <hi>Fact,</hi> and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Thing, 1ſt,</hi> That above thirty Grains of corrected <hi>Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides,</hi> have been given by the Doctor with Succeſs, both before and ſince his Commitment, was fully prov'd in Court. <hi>2ly,</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what the Womans Evidence Swore, it appear'd as plain, by their contradiction, and the time of taking, that ſhe took leſs then fifteen Pills. <hi>3ly,</hi> It was evident by the Doctors conſtant Practice in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that it was againſt his Order ſhe took any, it was at her Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril ſhe did it, and ought to have far'd worſe. <hi>4ly,</hi> Thoſe that know the Symptoms upon the giving of <hi>Cantharides,</hi> will tell you, that <hi>1ſt.</hi> there enſues a plentiful diſcharge of Urine, then a deſire to make Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a leſs quantity of it; <hi>next,</hi> Strangury; <hi>laſtly,</hi> bloody Water with Pains; but <hi>Perfect Blood</hi> never: <hi>Experience</hi> and Famous <hi>Authors</hi> declare this expreſly: I will not now Name them, but may e're long.

and the <hi>Labia Pudendi</hi> perhaps: by the Skins the bits either of the <hi>Vagina</hi> or the Bladder it ſelf, torn off in pieces by theſe <hi>Venomous Animals, deſtructive to Life, inimical to Nature, Muliebris</hi> they muſt mean. Egregious Anatomiſts, worthy ever to remain in the Theatre, for the perpetual improvement of that Art: Eſpecially if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Nice <hi>Obſervations,</hi> as to the Number of the Quarts of Blood: <hi>Several</hi> they ſay. An indefinite Quantity will bleed an <hi>Elephant</hi> to Death; and tho this Woman had nine Lives like a Catt, and each of them ſuſtain'd by a proportionate and diſtinct Quantity of Blood, that Number muſt have deſtroy'd her at laſt: But ſhe is ſtill alive, and the better for the Doctor, as was prov'd in Court. 'Tis a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous Humor that attends her, and the Doctor beggs you his <hi>Seniors,</hi> to take ſome pitty upon her, and Cure her of this, as he did of the <hi>Ulcer,</hi> and he'll refund the forty Shillings: 'Tis worth your Pains Gentlemen, half an Examination Fee, a whole Angel a piece. But this <hi>Several</hi> is ſet down to impoſe upon <hi>All,</hi> being as wide as ones Fancy, and as incertain, as your Judgment of Things: It muſt then be reſtrain'd, and it moderately reaching from <hi>Four</hi> to the <hi>Teens,</hi> we'll take the middle Number, and reduce it to <hi>Eight:</hi> Nay I'll bate you two, and conclude it <hi>ſix</hi> by the <hi>Affidavit,</hi> as reported from you; which is about <hi>fifteen</hi> Pounds of Blood, if you conſider the difference of <hi>Troy</hi> and <hi>Avoirdupoize,</hi> with that of the ſpecific Gravity of the Blood, as diſtinct from Water; the firſt being bulk for bulk heavier then the laſt. <hi>Perfect Blood</hi> you ſay, that is the <hi>Red Maſs,</hi> without the Mixture of the <hi>Serum,</hi> which is the tranſparent and fluid Subſtance, wherein the other, or wherewith if you pleaſe, is naturally carried, and diluted in the Veſſels: This diſtinct from the bloody Water, and the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plentiful Urine, was meaſured like Size, I ſuppoſe, to find the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt. Now it having been agreed amongſt the Anatomiſts, that the Quantity of Blood in Men, is from ſixteen to twenty four Pounds <hi>Troy,</hi> by which Blood they mean, the red Subſtance and the Serum together, as they both circulate in the Veſſels; and the Proportion of the One to the other being almoſt <hi>Equal;</hi> this Woman muſt have loſt, and that in twelve Hours time, at leaſt thirty Pounds of Blood; if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bloody Water too: Which muſt be <hi>ſix</hi> Pounds more then any one could have; and yet ſhe was better the next day then before, and alive to this.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Perfect Blood,</hi> as they call it, muſt be here diſtinct from the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> I will prove by the following Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This <hi>Perfect Blood,</hi> came after the bloody Urine, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinct; it muſt be taken from the bottom of the former, and is the coagulated <hi>Red Maſs:</hi> For the reſt was Urine, tho bloody beſure.</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:32023:13"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This monſtrous Excretion of Blood, being originally caus'd by a <hi>Diuretic,</hi> muſt firſt cauſe a plentifull evacuation of Urine; which is nothing but the <hi>Serum</hi> having paſt the Kidneys; next bloody U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, that is the <hi>Red Maſs</hi> broke by, and diluted in the <hi>Serum:</hi> Now if you mind the Gradation, the Third, that is the <hi>Perfect Blood,</hi> muſt be the <hi>Red Maſs</hi> ſubſiding, fluid when excreted, but coagulating after and ſettling to the bottom, and ſo meaſured; or elſe where is there a diſtinction between the Second and Third.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If it were not ſo, the juſt Proportion between the <hi>Red Maſs</hi> and the <hi>Serum,</hi> could not be known; and ſo not Sworn to: Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if you conſider the Tagg-ragg and Bobtail, that made the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for you, and the Depoſition too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This <hi>Poiſon,</hi> as you call it, working by ſeparating the Parts of the Blood, and not by coagulating the whole <hi>Fluid;</hi> the <hi>Serum</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, upon <hi>Eroſion</hi> of the Blood Veſſels, imbib'd as much Blood as it could retain; which is the <hi>bloody Urine;</hi> the Reſidue that ſubſided, muſt be wholly devoy'd of it, which is the <hi>Perfect Blood;</hi> fifteen Pounds in all of the <hi>Red Maſs;</hi> which, with thirteen Pounds of <hi>Serum,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to dilute it in the Veſſels, makes twenty eight: And ten to one, four more of both, our of the bloody <hi>Urine;</hi> makes thirty two, <hi>Quod probandum erat.</hi> Yet this Heroic <hi>Virago</hi> fainted not at all, after ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous a loſs of Blood.</p>
            <p>

            <p>But whatſoever Anatomiſts have ſaid on this Subject, was meerly conjectural: comparative Anatomy, firſt (that I know of as to this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair) inſtituted by Mr. <hi>Boile,</hi> detects a great deal leſs Quantity of Blood in Men. He tried the Experiment upon Sheep and other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, took the exact weight of the Blood iſſuing, and of the Animal, which compar'd with that of Man, by a <hi>Synonymous</hi> Rule, he found the <hi>Proportion</hi> to be but ſixteen Pounds at moſt in any. You may try it upon Goats, as my Friend hath done, for the ſake of the Experiment and the Blood it ſelf; and upon all imaginable Allowances, you will find this Aſſertion true. Conſequently then, this Woman by your <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious Accompt,</hi> voided as much more of Blood, as ſhe could have in her, beſides what muſt of neceſſity have circulated in the Veſſels, and the habit of her Body, to ſuſtain her Life.</p>

Had you but conſider'd the Menſtrua; how careful Nature is in the Evacuation of that, tho' ſuperfluous Blood; how gradually ſhe doth it, in ſmall quantities and ſeveral days; tho then of no uſe to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, becauſe it was intended for another: What a ſmall Exceſs is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Flooding,</hi> and accompanied with <hi>Fainting;</hi> and a little greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers Life: Or but minded, what loſs of Blood is <hi>Fatal</hi> in <hi>Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagies,</hi> even diſcontinued for ſome Days: Or ſeen Executions by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading: You would never have impos'd upon the World ſuch <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> You conſider'd as much, the horrid <hi>Torments</hi> you talk of: Nature was then upon the <hi>Rack,</hi> as you make us believe; which of it ſelf, when her <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Skins</hi> came away by Bits, was more then enough to have deſtroy'd this miſerable Creature.

            <p>To prove your Aſſertions, you boaſt of five <hi>Affidavits:</hi> You may have as many Scores, if you pleaſe, and keep them for your private Uſe. The ſame Witneſſes that atteſted theſe, were examin'd upon Oath in Court; and either retracted what they had Sworn before, by not alledging what you here aſſert; or were not believ'd in what they there depos'd: They were not then before you, but before a juſt Judge and an honeſt Jury; who minded as well the Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Witneſs, as the Poſſibility of the Thing it ſelf: Or elſe, how could there have been a point blank contrary <hi>Determination</hi> of this Affair? They clear'd the Doctor of the ſelf ſame Fact you condemn'd him for, yet heard the ſame Witneſſes againſt him: But they had no Party to quell; no wild Deſigns to carry on; no Perſon to hate; no Paſſion to ſatisfie, but that for Truth and Juſtice: And they were upon their <hi>Oaths</hi> too, as well as your Worſhips; they talk'd not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo much of, but acted according to them: But why was there ſo great a Difference in the Sentence pronounc'd?

You may ſtill be preſent, and Swear in your own Cauſe, as Evidence for the King: Do but indict Mr. <hi>Speers</hi> of Perjury (with the reſt to make the ſhorter Work) as you have threatned; and the Matter of Fact will appear in its proper Colours: The Number of the Bills is increas'd, and there is but ſuch an Opportunity wanting to produce them, and ſhew the World, how juſt you were in condemning the Doctor for the ſame Fact, you your ſelves were ſo notoriouſly Guilty of; but with this remarkable Difference, that tho the Doctor knew the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides</hi> not to be a <hi>Poiſon,</hi> yet was careful to correct their <hi>Acrimony:</hi> You have <hi>declared</hi> them an <hi>Acute Venom;</hi> but adminiſtred them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Caution</hi> (ſo much as to your ſelves), <hi>particular Diet,</hi> or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote;</hi> unleſs it be that of <hi>Plinie,</hi> and <hi>Diuretics,</hi> as in one of the Bills, to increaſe their Force, Malignity and Venom, as you call it; which appearing fully, by the Bills themſelves and the <hi>Latin directions,</hi> and ſolemnly atteſted, in a Publick Court: Pray be not ſo laviſh of your <hi>Tenders of Oaths,</hi> for fear of the worſt: At leaſt give us ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction firſt, how far your <hi>Negative Depoſitions,</hi> as to Fact, and that in your own Cauſe, can be valid, againſt a Poſitive Oath of ſober and credible Witneſſes, who have and will aſſert directly the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of what you pretend to.</p>
            <p>Reaſon <hi>Third,</hi> 
               <q>The ſaid Cenſors having thus notoriouſly acted like Ill Men, Informations, by order of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> were brought ſeverally againſt them (in Obedience to and Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Law) for not having qualified themſelves, for a Place of ſuch high Truſt and judicial Authority; but by the great Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the ſaid Cenſors to evade them, the Suit hath prov'd very Expenſive, the ſaid Cenſors applying themſelves to His Majeſty, by way of Petition, for a <hi>Noli Proſequi;</hi> but His Majeſty being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>Reaſon <hi>Fourth,</hi> 
               <q>Dr. <hi>Burwell,</hi> one of the ſaid Cenſors, being Try'd the ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Here you are diſpleas'd with the Proſecutors aſſerting, That you have acted notoriouſly like Ill Men. But if a notorious Injuſtice, back'd by a Barbarous Treatment of a Brother; perſiſted in to the laſt, with the utmoſt Aggravations, of privately Aſperſing, and publickly Calumniating, of an innocent Perſon, highly injur'd by your ſelves before; and that in Contempt, of the Law, the Deciſion of the Jury, the Advice of Friends, and the Senſe of Mankind, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſuch a Denomination; be pleas'd now to accept, not the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude only, but the Thing it ſelf. It was then your <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> not the Proſecutors <hi>Malice,</hi> that occaſion'd the Informations. You have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed indeavour'd to evade them, upon as vain Pretences, as you make Uſe of here, and Sued, You ſay, for a <hi>Noli Proſequi, being inform'd by your Councel; that you were not within the Act:</hi> But you know, That His Majeſty, upon true Information of the Matter of Fact, was pleaſed to deny it: From which it doth plainly appear, that the Proſecution was neither <hi>Malicious,</hi> nor <hi>Unreaſonable:</hi> For you were left to the Law, by his Majeſties Conſent to, and expreſs Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, ſo juſt a <hi>Proſecution:</hi> And you have experienc'd, by your repeated fruitleſs Attempts, that the Right Honourable the Lords are of the ſame Mind.</p>
            <p>The Verdict againſt Dr. <hi>Burwell,</hi> was brought in <hi>Special:</hi> But it was the <hi>Proſecutors</hi> deſign'd Favour, to you not deferving any, that the leaſt Obnoxious Perſon was pitch'd upon amongſt you, to give you all time and ſcope of <hi>Repentance:</hi> To that End, he order'd his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, not to oppoſe the <hi>Special Verdict,</hi> when deſir'd: Furthermore, I am fully ſatisfied, if it had been any of the other Three, the Jury would have brought him in Guilty, for Reaſons you may learn in time. Notwithſtanding all this, you have revil'd the Proſecutor for being ſo tender, ſlighted his Favours, and continue to do ſo.</p>
            <p>You expreſs your ſelves wiſely, <hi>That the Matter is to be argued by</hi> (not before) <hi>the Judges;</hi> but in your Wiſdom, <hi>know not how this Caſe will be then determined:</hi> Yet, by an unaccountable Stubbornneſs, haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard your Ruin, in a Caſe ſuppos'd by your ſelves to be doubtful: You ſtop your Ears to the Advice of Friends, and the Counſel of thoſe, who not only gueſs at, but know your Danger; ſlight all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32023:17"/>
laugh at thoſe, who in Pitty would gladly have been your Mediators. Three of you indeed may think your ſelves Secure, and hope for an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation timely enough, tho' <hi>Burwell</hi> be ruin'd; but you are not ſafe, tho' he ſhould eſcape; your Pleadings muſt be different, your Caſe worſe, your Defence as to any Point Inſignificant: But if the Old Gentleman ſhould perſiſt in, and fall a Martyr to his Obſtinacy, you muſt not, you cannot, in Reaſon and Juſtice expect any other Fate; as you were his Accomplices, more <hi>Active, Deſigning</hi> and <hi>Spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> you muſt expect at leaſt the ſame, deſerve a worſe Uſage. Go on in your Defiance; the Proſecutor hath hitherto, and I believe, will not Fail to meet you One by One, wherever you are pleas'd to carry the Suit: But my Advice to the Former (if he thinks fit to take it) is to deſert you, that would expoſe him ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the laſh of the Law, and <hi>agree with</hi> his kinder <hi>Adverſary, whil'ſt in the Way with him, leaſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 25.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now take another Book in Hand, to prove that Dr. <hi>Greenfield</hi> alſo ought to be conſider'd: I mean that of <hi>Alius Medicus,</hi> alias Dr. <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

He ſaith, in the 93 Page, <hi>That Good Name is better then Life, eſpecially if Lively-hood goes away with it.</hi> But what Regard had he to that of Dr. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> or what Compaſſion for his Family? The Doctor was trapann'd by a feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meſſage and Name, into a Coffee-houſe he conſtantly us'd, to be hurried to <hi>NEWGATE,</hi> from amidſt his Friends, Patients and numerous Acquaintance; was follow'd from thence to his Houſe, there taken from the Imbraces of his Wife and Children, from under the Noſe of his Father in Law, the Reverend Dr. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riton:</hi> He was committed the ſame Day he had cut a Child of the Stone, by Perſons regardleſs, of the Life of One Innocent, as well as the Prayers of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Dr. <hi>Greenfield</hi> I mean; that a Priſon of leſs Scandal, or the Lodge of the College, might ſerve, till he could make his Application to the other Cenſors; that to Dr. <hi>Burwell</hi> proving in vain. His Commitment was inſtantly publiſh'd in the <hi>Post-Boy, NEWGATE</hi> nam'd, his Crime not ſpecified, but declar'd in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Ill Practiſes,</hi> with a Notorious Falſhood, <hi>for refuſing to pay his Fine,</hi> which was never demanded, nor intended to be the only Satisfaction, for that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary Crime; as appears by the Cenſors Warrant and Defence. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors adds in the ſame Page, Good Name <hi>is like a Venice Glaſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if once crack'd though ſoadred or plaiſtred, yet is deſpis'd, undervalued, and in a Manner good for Nothing.</hi> Yet he will not ſuffer the Doctor ſo much as to indeavour it; but, by repeated publick Aſperſions. Eſſays (though I hope in Vain) to ſhiver it in Pieces. He adds further, <hi>It is like Virginity in Women, it enhanceth their Price,</hi> &amp;c. In Days of yore, Women were bought for Wives, now only for Whores: But ſeeing he hath raviſh'd this Metaphoric Girl, and indeavours to violate her ſtill; he will be kindly us'd, if he only pays really, and ſuffers not otherwiſe for the Fact: And if the firſt Aſſault merits a round Summ; the repeated Violations, as they <hi>enhance</hi> the Crime, muſt likewiſe the <hi>Price.</hi> He goes on and tells us, That <hi>private Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is a Sort of Civil Gunpowder, that blows up whole Families at once.</hi> Surely Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is <hi>uncivil,</hi> it doth it much more: <hi>And ſeeing it might have famiſh'd the Doctor, his Wife and Children, deſerves their Curſes againſt him</hi> (the Cauſe of it) <hi>as well as their Cries,</hi> Theſe are that Authors Words, not mine, and I firmly believe, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall now conclude with ſome few <hi>Queſtions</hi> to, and <hi>Remarks</hi> upon, about half a Score of that Reſtleſs Party, Active to no Purpoſe. You pretend to advance the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of Phyſick, by expoſing that Faculty; ſhew your ſelves <hi>Impartial,</hi> by <hi>puniſhing your own Members;</hi> without any Regard to your own, or the Colleges Honour: For who can rely upon a Phyſician, if his Admiſſion amongſt you, doth not warrant his Skill and Honeſty to boot. You pretend to attack your Enemies abroad, by creating more within your own Bowells, out of thoſe who are beſt able to preſerve and defend you. You are over <hi>Head and Ears</hi> in Debt, yet laviſhly waſte the ſmall Reſidue of your Stock in fruitleſs Attempts, and as needful Suits. In order to retrieve this, you talk of uniting your Body; yet perfiſt in affronting the moſt Eminent of the <hi>FELLOWS,</hi> and the whole <hi>BODY</hi> of thoſe you call <hi>LICENTIATS.</hi> Pray where is your Conduct in all theſe Particulars? You aſperſe the Latter publickly and privately, as inſufficient for Practice; yet they really are, and eſteem'd by all, equal to the beſt of you. Pray who will enſure your Skill, when you your ſelves decry that of your Equals? You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame them, as fit only, <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> to practice only in ſome <hi>particular Caſes:</hi> Yet the College hath given them as Ample à Diploma, as any you have, to practice in <hi>All.</hi> Pray what means this Abuſe? I had almoſt challeng'd your Honeſty. You will ſcarcely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow them any Priviledges; yet the College hath granted them the Uſe and Benefit <hi>(<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſum Fructum)</hi> of all, either granted, or to be granted hereafter to it ſelf. Pray where is your Juſtice? You ſuffer them not to have the Priviledge even of tranſgreſſing Slaves, to ſpeak for themſelves (I mean) though ſtanding before your Worſhips, and in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, deſiring to be heard. Pray what do you make of them? You Affront your own <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> by re-examining, and ſometimes rejecting thoſe, whom they have approv'd of, and honoured with the Decree of a Doctor: Beſides, you Vilify the forreign <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demiae.</hi> Pray where is and was your Breeding? You fly from <hi>Poſt to Pillar,</hi> from <hi>Charter</hi> to the <hi>Act;</hi> now fix here, now there; as you think, this or that will beſt bear you out, in your jarring Intentions. Pray where is your Foundation? You reject the four Chiefs from being ſo much as Arbiters of your Differences, or Judges of the By-laws you make. Pray where is your Diſcretion? You challenge the Juſtice of the Jury, ſlight the Advice of my Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice.</hi> Pray where is your Manners and Wiſdom? You impoſe Laws, Oaths, Bonds, Fines, Obligations, upon <hi>freeborn</hi> (not your) <hi>Subjects,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Repreſentatives, their Conſent, or Authority. Pray keep, leavy and pay them your ſelves; if you pleaſe, and what you will or can. It is your boundleſs <hi>Ambition,</hi> and conceited <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> that is the Cauſe of all the Miſchiefs that attend the <hi>College</hi> and <hi>Faculty.</hi> It was indeed otherwiſe, when ſuch low, wandring and retrograde Orbs, were chek'd and kept under, by the Preſence of thoſe Immortal Lights, whoſe Glory is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally fix'd.

Audiſne haec Amphiarae ſub Terris abdite?</hi> Nay, Dr. <hi>Go----le,</hi> can you bear to hear your ſelf talk, and your great Patron and Benefactor revil'd with the ſame Breath? But now what calls it ſelf a College, muſt ſeek for its Renown amidſt the adverſe Party, and ſhelter it ſelf amongſt the <hi>Malcontents:</hi> It had only <hi>Goddards dropps</hi> for the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Spirit of <hi>Elliots</hi> Bones for the Support of that Government; till of late it got a <hi>YOUNG</hi> Man for its Defence. Yet when at the Board, every one of you is a <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> each of you thinks himſelf a <hi>Jove;</hi> to be adored, by thoſe call'd <hi>Licenciates,</hi> with <hi>Capp and Knee,</hi> in a <hi>Profound Silence.</hi> But you found of late, that thoſe your Equals, will no longer bear ſuch like <hi>Indignities.</hi> You muſt ſhew your ſelves firſt to be Men, by reflex Thoughts on your paſt Actions: Till then, I ſhall take Leave of your <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> (as <hi>Philip</hi> accoſted your haughty Predeceſſor aforeſaid) and that you may hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
