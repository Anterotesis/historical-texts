            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But there is yet arguments to procure <hi>Mr. Walfoord,</hi> and <hi>T. Williams, Roſie Crucians</hi> by election, and that is the miracles that were done by them, in any ſight; for it ſhould ſeeme <hi>Roſie Crucians</hi> were not only initiated into the Moſaicall Theory, but have arrived alſo to the power of working miracles as <hi>Moſes, Elias, Ezekiel</hi> and the ſucceeding Prophets did, as being tranſported where they pleaſe, as <hi>Habakkuk</hi> was from <hi>Jewry</hi> to <hi>Babylon</hi> or as <hi>Philip</hi> after he had baptized the <hi>Enuch</hi> to <hi>Arotus,</hi> and one of theſe went from me to a friend of mine in <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and came and brought me an anſwer to <hi>London</hi> the ſame day, which is four dayes journey, they taught
<pb facs="tcp:118922:3"/>
me excellent predictions of Aſtrologie, and earthquakes; they ſlack the plague in Cityes; they ſilence the violent winds and tempeſts; they calme the rage of the Sea and rivers; they walk in the Air, they fruſtrate the Malicious aſpect of Witches; they cure all diſeaſes; I deſired one of theſe to tell me whether my complexion were capable of the ſociety of my good <hi>Genius?</hi> when I ſee you again, ſaid he, I will tell you (which is) (when he pleaſes to come to me, for I know not where to go to him) when I ſaw him then he ſaid Ye ſhould pray to God, for a good and holy man can offer no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor more acceptable ſacrifice to God, then the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf, his ſoul.</p>
            <p>He ſaid alſo that the good <hi>Genii</hi> are as the benigne eyes of God, running to and fro in the world, with love and pitty beholding the innocent endeavours of harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſingle hearted men, ever ready to do them good, and to help them; and at his going away he bid me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of my ſeeming friends who would do me all the hurt they could, and cauſe the Governors of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be angry with me, and ſet bounds to my liberty, which truly hapned to me, as they did indeed: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things more he told me before we parted, but I ſhall not name them here.</p>
            <p>For this <hi>Roſie Crucian</hi> Phyſick or Medicines, I happily and unexpectedly light upon in <hi>Arabia,</hi> which will prove a reſtauration of health to all that are afflicted w<hi rend="sup">h</hi> that ſickneſs, which we ordinarily cal natural, &amp; all other diſeaſes, as the Gour, Dropſie, Leproſie and falling ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and theſe men may be ſaid to have no ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in the body, and that <hi>Walfoord, Williams,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Fraternity now living, may bear up in the ſame likely Equipage, with thoſe noble Divine ſpirits their predeceſsors, though the unskilfullneſs in men commonly acknowledge more of ſupernaturall aſſiſtance
<pb facs="tcp:118922:3"/>
in hot unſetled fancies, and perplexed melancholy, then in the calme and diſtinct uſe of reaſon; yet for mine own part, but not without ſubmiſſion to better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I looke upon theſe <hi>Roſie Crucians</hi> above all men truly inſpired, and more than any that profeſſed or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended themſelves ſo, this ſixteen hundred yeares, and I am raviſhed with admiration of their miracles and tranſcendent mechanicall inventions, for the ſalving the Phaenomena in the world; I may without offence therefore compare them with <hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> thoſe skilfull and cunning workers of the tabernacle, who, as <hi>Moſes</hi> teſtifies, were filled with the ſpirit of God, and therefore were of an excellent underſtanding to find out all manner of curious work.</p>
            <p>Nor is it any more argument, that theſe <hi>Roſie Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are not inſpired, becauſe they do not ſay they are; then that others are inſpired, becauſe they ſay they are; which to me is no argument at all; but the ſuppreſſion of what ſo hapned, would argue much more ſobriety &amp; modeſty; whenas the profeſſion of it with ſober men, would be ſuſpected of ſome peice of melancholy and diſtraction, eſpecially in theſe things, where the grand pleaſure is the evidence and exerciſe of reaſon, not a bare beliefe, or an ineffable ſenſe of life, in reſpect whereof there is no true chriſtian but he is inſpired; but if any more zealous pretender to prudence and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, wanting either leaſure or ability to examine theſe <hi>Roſie Crucian</hi> Medicines to the bottom ſhall not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding either condemn them or admire them; he hath unbecommingly and indiſcreetly vetered out of his own ſphere, and <hi>I</hi> cannot acquit him of injuſtice or folly: Nor am I a <hi>Roſie Crucian,</hi> nor do I ſpeake of ſpite, or hope of gain, or for any ſuch matter; there is no cauſe, God knows, I envie no man, be he what he will be, <hi>I</hi> am no phyſitian, never was, nor never mean to be: what <hi>I</hi> am it
<pb facs="tcp:118922:4"/>
makes no matter as to my profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, theſe holy and good men would have me know that the greateſt ſweet and perfection of a vertuous ſoul, is the kindly accompliſhment of her own nature, in true wiſdom and divine love; and theſe miraculus things that are done by them are, that that worth and knowledge that is in them may be taken notice of, and that God thereby may be glorified whoſe witneſſes they are; but no other happineſs accrues to them from this, but that hereby they may be in a better capacity of makeing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers happy,</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Admire the goodneſs of God towards us in the frame and ſtructure of our bodies, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Artifice whereof, <hi>Galen, though a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt,</hi> was ſo taken with, that he could not but adjudge the honor of a hymn to the wiſe Creator of it. The continuance of the whole, and every particular, is ſo evident an Argument of exquiſite skill in the Maker, that if I ſhould purſue all that ſutes to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it would amount to too large (yet an entire) Volume. I ſhall therefore write all that is needful to be known by all men, leaving the reſt to be ſupply'd by <hi>Anatomists:</hi> And I think there is no man that hath any skill in that Art, but will confeſs, the more diligently and accurately the frame of our body is examined, it is found the more exquiſitely conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our Reaſon, Judgement, and Deſire; ſo that ſuppoſing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118922:5"/>
the ſame matter that our bodies are made of, if it had been in our own power to have made our ſelves, we ſhould have fram'd our ſelves no otherwiſe then we are: To inſtance in ſome particulars; <hi>As in our Eyes,</hi> the <hi>Number,</hi> the <hi>Scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of them is ſuch, that we can excogitate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be added thereto, or to be altered, either for their <hi>beauty, ſafety,</hi> or <hi>uſefulneſs;</hi> but as for their beauty, I have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted largely of it in my youthful merry Poems, &amp; now am not minded to tranſcribe my tender nice ſubject, and couple it with my ſeverer ſtile; I will onely note how ſafely they are <hi>guarded,</hi> and <hi>fitly framed</hi> out for the uſe they are intended: The Brow and the Noſe ſaves them from harder ſtrokes; but ſuch a curious part as the <hi>Eye</hi> being neceſſarily liable to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief from ſmalleſt matters, the ſweat of the Forehead is fenced off by thoſe two Wreaths of Hair which we call the Eye-brows; and the Eye-lids are fortified with little ſtiff bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as with Palliſadoes, againſt the aſſault of Flyes and Gnats, and ſuch-like bold <hi>Animalcula;</hi> beſides, the upper-lid preſently claps down, and is as good a Fence as a Port-Cullis againſt the importunity of the Enemy; which is done alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very night, whether there be any preſent aſſault or no, as if nature kept Garriſon in this <hi>Acropolis</hi> of mans body, the <hi>Head,</hi> and look'd that ſuch Laws ſhould be duly obſerved, as were moſt for his ſafety.</p>
               <p>And now for the uſe of the Eye, which is ſight, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that this Organ is ſo exquiſitely framed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that not the leaſt curioſity can be added: For firſt, the <hi>Humor</hi> and <hi>Tunicles</hi> are purely <hi>tranſparent</hi> to let in light, and colours unfould, and unſophiſticated by any inward tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. And then again, the parts of the Eye are made <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex,</hi> that there might be a direction of many raies coming from one point of the object, unto one point anſwerable in the bottom of the eye; to which purpoſe the <hi>Chryſtalline hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> is of great moment, and without which, the ſight would be very obſcure and weak. Thirdly, The <hi>Tunica uvea</hi> hath a <hi>Muſculous Power,</hi> and can dilate and contract that round hole in it which is called the Pupil of the <hi>Eye,</hi> for the better moderating the tranſmiſſion of light. Fourthly, The inſide
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118922:5"/>

Fifthly, The <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica Arachnoides,</hi> which invellops the <hi>Chryſtalline Humour,</hi> by vertue of its <hi>Proceſſus Ciliaros,</hi> can thruſt forward, or draw back that precious uſeful part of the Eye, as the nearneſs or diſtance of the objects ſhall require. Sixthly and laſtly, The <hi>Tunica Retina</hi> is <hi>white,</hi> for the better and more true recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpecies of things, (as they ordinarily call them) as white paper is fitteſt to receive thoſe Images into a dark room; and the eye is already ſo perfect, that I believe it is not needful to ſpeak any more thereof; we being able to move our head upwards and downwards, and on every ſide, might have unawares thought our ſelves ſufficiently well provided for; but Nature hath added Muſcles alſo to the Eyes, that no perfection might be wanting; for we have oft occaſion to move our Eyes, our Heads being unmoved, as in reading, and viewing more particularly any object ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; and that this may be done with more eaſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy, ſhe hath furniſhed that Organ with no leſſe then <hi>ſix ſeveral Muſcles;</hi> and indeed, this framing of Muſcles, not onely in the Eye, but in the whole body, is admirable; for is it not a wonder that even all our fleſh ſhould be ſo handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed and contrived into diſtinct pieces, whoſe riſe and inſertions ſhould be with ſuch advantage that they do ſerve to move ſome part of the body or other? and that the parts of our body are not moved onely ſo conveniently as wil ſerve us to walk and ſubſiſt by, but that they are able to move e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way imaginable that will advantage us; for we can fling out Legs and Arms upwards and downwards, backwards, forwards, and round, as they that ſpin, or would ſpread a Mole-hill with their feet. To ſay nothing of <hi>Reſpiration,</hi> the conſtriction of the <hi>Diaphragme</hi> for the keeping down the Guts, and ſo enlarging the <hi>Thorax,</hi> that the Lungs may have play, and the aſſiſtance of the inward <hi>intercoſtal Muſcles</hi> in deep ſuſpirations, when we take more large gulps of <hi>air</hi> to cool our heart over-charged with love or ſorrow; nor of the curious Fabrick of the Lainix, ſo well fitted with Muſcles for

               <p>But we ſee by experience that <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>grief</hi> proceed not in all men from the ſame cauſes, and that men differ very much in the conſtitution of the body, whereby that which help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and furthereth vital conſtitution in one, and is therefore delightful, hindereth &amp; croſſeth it in another, and therefore cauſeth <hi>grief.</hi> The difference therefore of <hi>Wits,</hi> hath its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the different paſſions, &amp; from the ends to which the appetite leadeth them. As for that difference which ariſeth from <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> and ſuch accidental diſtempers, I have appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them for the ſecond Part of this Book, and therefore I omit the ſame as impertinent to this place, and conſider it onely in ſuch as have their health, perfection of body, and Organs well diſpoſed.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>OTher things I have to ſay, but I will rather inſiſt upon ſuch things as are eaſie ahd intelligible even to <hi>Idiots,</hi> or ſuch <hi>Phyſicians</hi> that are no wiſer, who if they can but tell the Joints of their hands, or know the uſe of their teeth, they may eaſily diſcover it was Counſel, not Chance, that created them; and if they but underſtand theſe natural Medecines I have prepared in this Book for their example, they will know that they ſhall be cured of all Diſeaſes without pain, or any great coſt; and <hi>Love,</hi> not <hi>Money,</hi> was it that made me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this Task. Now of the well-fram'd parts of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118922:6"/>
I would know why we have three joints in our Legs and Arms, as alſo in our fingers, but that it was much better then having but two or four? And why are our <hi>fore-teeth ſharp,</hi> like Chizzels, to cut, but our <hi>inward teeth broad, to grind?</hi> but this is more exquiſite then having them all ſharp, or all broad, or the fore-teeth broad, and the other ſharp; but we might have made a hard ſhift to have lived, though in that worſer condition. Again, Why are the Teeth ſo luckily pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? or rather, Why are there not Teeth in <hi>other bones</hi> as well as in the Jaw-bones, for they might have been as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as theſe. But the reaſon is, Nothing is done foollſhly, nor in vain. I will ſhew you <hi>how to prolong life,</hi> and to <hi>return from age to youth;</hi> and <hi>how to change, alter, and amend the state of the body;</hi> but that I intend in a Treatiſe entituled <hi>The Wiſe Mans Crown:</hi> To keep the body in perfect <hi>health</hi> is my preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, <hi>and to cure all Diſeaſes without reward;</hi> for there is a <hi>Divine Providence</hi> that orders all things. Again, (to ſay nothing of the inward curioſity of the <hi>Ear</hi>) Why is that outward frame of it, but that it is certainly known that it's for the better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>hearing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might add, That <hi>Nature</hi> hath made the <hi>hind-moſt parts</hi> of our <hi>body</hi> (which we ſit upon) moſt <hi>fleſhy,</hi> as providing for our eaſe, making us a <hi>Natural Cuſhion,</hi> as well as for <hi>Inſtruments of Motion</hi> for our <hi>Thighs</hi> and <hi>Legs;</hi> ſhe hath made the hinder part of the <hi>Head</hi> more ſtrong, as being otherwiſe unfenced againſt falls and other caſualties. She hath made the <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> as being more fit to bend, more tough, and leſs in danger of breaking then if they were all one intire bone, without thoſe griſtly Junctures. She hath ſtrengthened our <hi>fingers</hi> and <hi>toes</hi> with <hi>Nailes,</hi> whereas ſhe might have ſent out that ſubſtance at the end of the firſt and ſecond Joints, which had not been ſo handſom and uſeful, nay, rather ſomewhat troubleſome and hurtful. And laſtly, She hath made all bones devoid of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> becauſe they were to bear the weight of themſelves, and of the whole body; and therefore if they had had ſenſe, our life had been painful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and dolorous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118922:7"/>And now I have conſidered the fitneſs of the parts of mans bodie for the good of the whole, let me but conſider briefly his ſences and his nature, and then I intend more ſolidly to demonſtrate the cauſe of all Diſeaſes, and with that the Cure, becauſe I intend a Method of <hi>Roſie Crucian Phyſick,</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>in my way to Bliſſe.</hi> By our ſeveral Organs, we have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conceptions of ſeveral qualities in the objects; for by ſight we have a conception or image compoſed of colour and figure, which is all the notice and knowledge the object im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth to us of its nature, by the excellency of the eye. By <hi>Hearing</hi> we have a conception called <hi>Sound,</hi> which is all the knowledge we have of the quality of the object from the Ear: And ſo the reſt of the Sences are alſo conceptions of ſeveral qualities or natures of their objects.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Image in viſion conſiſting of colour and ſhape, is the knowledge we have of the qualities of the object of that Sence, it is no hard matter for a man to fall into this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, That the ſame colour &amp; ſhape are the very qualities themſelves; and for the ſame cauſe that ſound &amp; noiſe are the qualities of a piece of Canon or Culvering charged with ſulphurous Powder, fired, or of the Air: And this opinion hath been ſo long received, that the contrary muſt needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a great Paradox. The ſame qualities are eaſier in a bell; and yet the introduction of ſpecies viſible and intelligible, (which is neceſſary for the maintenance of that opinion) paſſing to and fro from the object, is worſe then any Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, as being a plain impoſsibility. I ſhall therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to make plain theſe points.</p>
               <p>That the ſubject wherein colour and image are inherent; is not the object or thing ſeen.</p>
               <p>That there is nothing (really) which we call an Image or Colour.</p>
               <p>That the ſaid Image, or Colour, is but an apparation unto us of the motion, agitation, or alteration, which the object worketh in the brain, or ſpirits, or ſome internal ſubſtance of the Head.</p>
               <p>That as in viſion, ſo alſo in conceptions that ariſe from the other ſenſes, the ſubject of their inherence is not the object, but the continent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:118922:7"/>That conceptions and apparitions are nothing really, but motion in ſome internal ſubſtance of the Head; which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not ſtopping there, of neceſſity muſt there either help, or hinder the motion which is called Vital; when it helpeth it is called Delight, Contentment or Pleaſure, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing really but <hi>motion about the heart,</hi> as <hi>conception</hi> is nothing but <hi>motion in the head;</hi> and the objects that cauſe it are called <hi>Pleaſant,</hi> or <hi>Delightful;</hi> and the ſame Delight, with reference to the object is called <hi>Love;</hi> but when ſuch motion weakneth or hindreth the vital motion, then it is called <hi>Pain,</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that which cauſeth it, <hi>Hatred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of pleaſures, whereof one ſeemeth to affect the corporeal Organ of the ſence, and that I call ſenſual, the greateſt part whereof is that by which we are invited to give continuance to our <hi>ſpecies;</hi> and the next by which a man is invited to meat, for preſervation of his indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual perſon. The other ſort of Delight is not particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any part of the body, and is called <hi>The Delight of the mind,</hi> &amp; is that which we call <hi>Joy.</hi> Likewiſe of pains, ſome affect the body, and are therefore called <hi>The pains of the body;</hi> and ſome not, and thoſe are called <hi>grief.</hi>

more ſubtile and tenuious then the animal ſpirits themſelves, mingled with them, and diſperſed through the veſſels and poroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the body; for there can be no penetration of dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But I need no new arguments to confute this fond conceit; for what I ſaid of the <hi>animal ſpirits</hi> before, is applicable with all eaſe and fitneſs to this preſent caſe; and let it be ſufficient that I advertiſe you ſo much, and ſo be excuſed from the repeating of the ſame things over again.</p>
               <p>It remains therefore that we conclude, That that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes <hi>Spontaneous Motion</hi> upon the body or more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the <hi>animal ſpirits:</hi> That which imagines, remembers, and reaſons, is an immaterial ſubſtance, diſtinct from the body, which uſes the <hi>animal ſpirits</hi> and the <hi>brain</hi> for <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in ſuch and ſuch operations. And thus we have found a <hi>ſpirit</hi> in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion and ſignification, that hath apparently theſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in it, it can both underſtand and move corporeal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>And now this prize that we have won will prove for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in this new Method of Phyſick and Philoſophy of very great conſequence; for it is obvious here to obſerve that the ſoul of man is as it were <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Of Plants; that the meer motion of the matter may do ſomething, yet it will not amount to the production of Plants. That it is no botch in Nature that ſome Phaenomena be the reſults of Motion, others of ſubſtantial forms.

               </argument>
               <p>HOW weak is <hi>Man</hi> if you conſider his <hi>nature,</hi> what faculties he hath, and in what order he is in reſpect of the reſt of the <hi>creatures?</hi> And indeed, though his body be but weak and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd, yet his inward abilities of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and artificial contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, is admirable, both for finding out thoſe <hi>ſecret Medicines</hi> which God prepared for the uſe of <hi>Man</hi> in the <hi>Bowels of the Earth,</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Minerals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> where I ſhall touch onely theſe four heads, their <hi>form and beauty, their ſeed, their ſignatures,</hi> and their <hi>great uſe,</hi> as well for <hi>medicines</hi> as <hi>ſuſtenance;</hi> and that we may the better underſtand the advantage we have in this cloſer contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the works of nature, we are in the firſt place to take notice of the condition of the ſubſtance, which we call matter, how fluid and ſlippery, and undeterminate it is of it ſelf; or if it be hard, how unfit it is to be changed into any thing elſe; and therefore all things rot into a moiſture before any thing can be generated of them, as we ſoften the wax before we ſet on the ſeal.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, unleſs we will be fooliſh, as becauſe the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form motion of the <hi>Air,</hi> or ſome more ſubtil <hi>corporeal Element,</hi> may ſo equally compreſs or bear againſt the parts of a little vaporous <hi>moiſture,</hi> as to form it into round drops (as we ſee in the dew, and other experiments) and therefore becauſe this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118922:11"/>
more rude and <hi>general</hi> motion can do ſomething, to conclude that it does all things; We muſt in all reaſon confeſs that there is an eternal <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> whereof the matter is thus uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully formed and changed.</p>
               <p>But meer rude and undirected <hi>motion,</hi> becauſe naturally it will have ſome kind of reſults, that therefore it will reach to ſuch as plainly imply a wiſe contrivance of counſel, is ſo ridiculous a <hi>Sophiſm,</hi> as I have already intimated, that it is more fit to impoſe upon the inconſiderate <hi>ſouls</hi> of <hi>fool</hi> &amp; <hi>children,</hi> then upon men of Mature Reaſon, and well exerciſed in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> or the <hi>grave</hi> and well <hi>practiſed, ſeraphically illuminated Roſie Crucians.</hi> Admit that <hi>Rain,</hi> and <hi>Snow,</hi> and <hi>Wind,</hi> and <hi>Hail,</hi> and <hi>Ice,</hi> and <hi>Thunder,</hi> and <hi>Lightning,</hi> and a <hi>Star</hi> I mention for example, that may be let in amongſt Meteors, by ſome called <hi>Hellens-ſtar,</hi> and is well known at Sea; I have ſeen it <hi>melt Copper Veſſels</hi> a-board a ſhip; it cometh of an heap of ſuch vapors as are carryed by violent croſs Winds up from the Earth; and ſuch like <hi>Meteors</hi> may be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold,</hi> or of the motion and reſt of certain ſmall particles of the matter; yet that the uſeful and beautiful contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Branches, Flowers, and Fruits of Plants ſhould be ſo too, (to ſay nothing yet of <hi>Minerals,</hi> and the bodies of men) is as ridiculous and ſupine a collection, as to infer, That becauſe meer heat and cold does ſoften and harden Wax, and puts it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome ſhape or other, that therefore this meer heat and cold, or Motion and Reſt, without any Art and Direction, made the <hi>Silver Seal</hi> too, and graved upon it ſo curiouſly ſome Coate of Arms, or the ſhape of ſome Bird or Beaſt, as an Eagle, a Lyon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay indeed this inference is more tolerable far then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe effects of Art being more eaſie, and leſs noble then thoſe other of nature.</p>
               <p>Nor is it any deficiency at all in the Works of <hi>Nature,</hi> that ſome particular <hi>Phaenomena</hi> be but the eaſie reſults of that general motion communicated unto the matter from <hi>God;</hi> others the effects of more curious contrivance, or of the <hi>Divine Ar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, the <hi>Rationes Seminales</hi>) incorporated in the Matter, eſpecially the Matter it ſelf being in ſome ſort vital, elſe it would not continue the motion that it is put upon, when it is occaſionally this or the other way mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118922:11"/>
and beſides the Nature of <hi>God</hi> being the moſt perfect ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life that is poſſibly conceiveable, it is very congruous that this outmoſt and remoteſt ſhadow of himſelf, be ſome way, though but obſcurely vital: Wherefore things falling off by degrees from the higheſt perfection, it will be no uneven or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable ſtep, if deſcending from the top of this utmoſt Creation, <hi>Man,</hi> in whom there is a more fine conception, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexive Reaſon, which hangs on, as every man hath ſo much experience as to have ſeen the <hi>Sun,</hi> and other viſible objects by reflexion in the Water and Glaſſes; and this as yet ſhall be all I will ſay for this reaſon; I will give you more then I promiſed in the Contents, by four propoſitions concerning the nature of conceptions, and they ſhall be proved; and alſo of the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>ſence,</hi> that <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> may be there where the thing ſeen is not: But becauſe it may be ſaid, That notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Image</hi> in the <hi>Water</hi> be not in the object, but a thing meerly <hi>phantaſtical,</hi> yet there may be colours really in the thing it ſelf, I will urge further this experience, That divers times men ſee directly the ſame object double, as two Candles for one, which may happen from diſtemper, or otherwiſe without diſtemper if a man will; the <hi>Organs</hi> being either in their right temper, or equally diſtempered, the <hi>colours</hi> and <hi>images</hi> in two ſuch <hi>characters</hi> of the ſame thing, cannot be inherent therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thing ſeen cannot be in two places.</p>
               <p>One of theſe <hi>Images</hi> therefore is not inherent in the <hi>Object</hi> but the ſeeing, the <hi>Organs</hi> of the ſight are then in equal temper or diſtemper, the one of them is no more inherent then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſequently, neither of them both are in the <hi>Objects,</hi> which is the firſt propoſition mentioned in the precedent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Image of any thing by reflexion in a glaſs, or water, or the like, is not any thing in, or behind the glaſs, or in, or under the Water, every man may grant to himſelf; which is the ſecond propoſition of <hi>Des Cartes.</hi> For thirdly We are to conſider, firſt, That every great agitation or concuſſion of the brain (as it happeneth from a ſtroke, eſpecially if the ſtroke be upon the eye) whereby the Optick Nerve ſuffereth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great violence, there <hi>appeareth</hi> before the <hi>Eyes</hi> a certain
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118922:12"/>
                  <hi>light,</hi> which light is nothing without, but an apparition onely; all that is real being the concuſſion or motion of the parts of the Nerve; from which experience we may conclude, That ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of light is really nothing but motion within. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from Lucid bodies there can be derived motion, ſo as to affect the Optick Nerve in ſuch manner as is proper thereunto, there will follow an Image of light ſome-where in that line by which the motion was laſt derived to the eye, that is to ſay, In the object, if we look directly on it, and in the Glaſs or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we look upon it in the line of reflexion, which in effect is the third propoſition, namely, That image and colour is but an apparition to us of that motion, agitation, or alteration, which the object worketh in the brain or ſpirits, or ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſubſtance in the head.</p>
               <p>But that from all lucid, ſhining, and illuminate bodies, there is a motion produced to the eye, and thorow the eye, to the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Nerve</hi> and ſo into the <hi>Brain,</hi> by which the apparition of light or colour is effected, is not hard to prove. And firſt, it is evident that the Fire, the onely lucid body here upon Earth, worketh by motion equally every way, inſomuch as the motion thereof ſtopped or incloſed, it is preſently extinguiſhed, and no more fire. And further, That that motion whereby the fire worketh, is dilation and contraction of it ſelf alternately, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Scintillation, or glowing, is manifeſt alſo by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; from ſuch motion in the fire muſt needs ariſe a rejection, or caſting from it ſelf off that part of the medium which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to it, whereby that part alſo rejecteth the next, and ſo ſucceſſively one part beateth back another to the very eye, and in the ſame manner the exteriour part of the eye preſſeth the interiour, (the Laws of refraction ſtill obſerved.) Now the interior coat of the eye is nothing elſe but a piece of the Optick Nerve, and therefore the motion is ſtill continued thereby into the <hi>Brain,</hi> and by reſiſtance or re-action of the <hi>Brain,</hi> is alſo a rebound into the Optick Nerve again, which we not conceiving as motion or rebound from within, do think it is without, and call it Light, as hath been already ſhewed by the experience of a ſtroake: We have no reaſon to doubt that the Fountain of Light, the Sun, worketh by any other ways then the <hi>Fire,</hi> at leaſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118922:12"/>
in this matter; and thus all viſion hath its original from ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is here deſcribed; for where there is no light, there is no ſight; and therefore colour muſt be the ſame thing with light, as being the effect of the lucid bodies, their difference being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, That when the light cometh directly from the Fountain to the eye, or indirectly by reflexion from clean and polite bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſuch as have not any polite bodies, and ſuch as have not any particular motion internal to alter it, we call it light; but when it cometh to the eye by reflexion from uneven, rough, and courſe bodies, or ſuch as are affected with internal motion of their own that may alter it, then we call it <hi>Colour;</hi> colour and light differing onely in this, that the one is pure, and the other perturbed light; by that which hath been ſaid, not onely the truth of the third propoſition, but alſo the whole manner of producing light and colour, is apparent.</p>
               <p>As colour is not inherent in the object, but an effect thereof upon us, cauſed by ſuch motion in the object as hath been deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; ſo neither is ſound in the thing we hear, but in our ſelves; one manifeſt ſign thereof, is, That as man may ſee, ſo alſo he may hear double &amp; trebble by multiplication of Ecchoes, which Ecchoes are ſounds as well as the Original; and not being in one and the ſame place, cannot be inherent in the body that maketh them; nothing can make any thing which is not in it ſelf; the Clapper of a Bell hath no ſound in it, but motion, and maketh motion in the internal parts of the Bell; ſo the Bell hath motion and not ſound, that imparteth motion to the air; and the aire hath motion, but not ſound; the air imparteth motion by the ear and nerve unto the <hi>Brain;</hi> and the Brain hath motion, but not ſound; from the Brain it reboundeth back into the Nerves outward, and thence it becommeth an Apparition without, which we call ſound; And to proceed to the reſt of the ſences, it is apparent enough, that the ſmell and taſte of the ſame thing are not the ſame to every man, and therefore are not in the thing ſmelt or taſted, but in the men; ſo likewiſe the heat we feel from the fire is manifeſtly in us, and is quite different from the heat which is in the fire; for our heat is pleaſure or pain, according as it is great or moderate; but in the cool there is no ſuch thing: By this the laſt is proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that as in viſion,
<pb facs="tcp:118922:13"/>
ſo alſo in Conceptions that ariſe from other ſenſes, the ſubject of their inherence is not in the object, but in the Sentinent; And from hence alſo it followeth that whatſoever accidents or qualities our ſences make us think there be in the world, they be not there, but are ſeeming and apparitions only; the things that really are in the world without us, are thoſe motions by which theſe ſeemings are cauſed; and this is the great deception of ſence, which alſo is to be by ſence corrected: for as ſence telleth me when I ſee directly, that the colour ſeemeth to be in the object; ſo alſo ſence telleth me when I ſee by reflection, that colour is in the object. But now I am out of the way from the outward Creation of Man, in whom there is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of more fine and reflexive reaſon, which hangs on, though not in that manner, in the more perfect kinde of Brutes, as ſence alſo (loth to be curbed with too narrow compaſs) layes hold upon ſome kinde of plants, as in thoſe ſundry ſorts of <hi>Zoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyta,</hi> but in the reſt there are no further footſteps diſcovered of an animadverſive forme abiding in them; yet there be the effects of an inadvertent forme (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) of materiated or incorporated Art or ſeminal Reaſon; I ſay it is no uneven jot to paſs from the more faint and obſcure example of Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical life, to the more Conſiderable effects of general Motion in <hi>Mineralls, Metalls,</hi> nor yet to ſay any thing of the Medicines extracted, mortified, fixt, diſſolv'd and incorporated with their proper Veagles, becauſe we have intended it our laſt buſineſs to return to Mineralls, Mettals, and ſundry Meteors, whoſe eaſie and rude ſhapes have no need of any particular principle of life, or Spermatical form diſtinct from the reſt, or motion of the particles of the matter.</p>
               <p>But there is that curioſity of form and beauty in the more noble kinde of Plants, bearing ſuch a ſutableneſs and harmony with the more refined ſence and ſagacity of the ſoul of Man, that he cannot chooſe (his intellectual touch being ſo ſweetly gratified by what it deprehends in ſuch like objects,) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that ſome hidden cauſe much a-kin to his own nature that is intellectual, is the contriver and perfecter of theſe ſo pleaſant ſpectacles in the world.</p>
               <p>Nor is it at all to the purpoſe to object that this buſineſs of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118922:13"/>
                  <hi>Beauty</hi> and comelineſs of proportion is but a conceit, becauſe ſome men acknowledge no ſuch thing, and all things are alike handſome to them, who yet notwithſtanding have the uſe of their eyes as well as other folks; for I ſay, this rather makes for what we aim at, that <hi>Pulchritudo</hi> is conveyed indeed by the outward ſences unto the ſoul, but a more intellectual faculty is that which reliſhes it; as an <hi>Aſtrologicall,</hi> or better, a <hi>Geometricall Scheam</hi> is let in by the eyes, but the <hi>Demonſtration</hi> is diſcern'd by <hi>Reaſon:</hi> And therefore it is more rational to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that ſome intellectual principle was the Author of this <hi>Pulchritude</hi> of things, then that they ſhould be thus faſhion'd without the help of that principle: And to ſay there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Pulchritude,</hi> and ſome ſay, there is no <hi>way to felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> The firſt, I anſwer, is becauſe ſome mens ſouls are ſo dull and ſtupid. And the ſecond is that they never knew <hi>The way to bliſs,</hi> The firſt cannot reliſh all objects alike in that reſpect; The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond knows not <hi>Happineſs,</hi> nor the <hi>way to long life,</hi> nor the <hi>means to Health,</hi> nor how to <hi>return from Age to Youth, &amp;c.</hi> which is as abſurd and groundleſs as to conclude there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> becauſe a natural fool cannot reach unto it. But that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>The way to Bliſs, Long life,</hi> and a certain way to <hi>Health,</hi> not as yet known in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I will demonſtrate in a Treatiſe by it ſelf; <hi>The way to Health</hi> I ſhall ſhew you anon in this book, the reſt in another Part, as I promiſed you.</p>
               <p>Now that there is ſuch a thing as Beauty, and that it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the whole generations of men, to be in Trees, flowers and fruits, and the adorning of buildings in all Ages, is an example, and undenyable teſtimony; for what is more and ordinary with them then taking in flowers and fruitage for the garniſhing of their work?

               <p>Now therefore it being evident, that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Beauty, Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Comelineſs</hi> of proportion, (to ſay nothing of the delightful mixture of colours, and that this is the proper object of the Underſtanding and Reaſon; for theſe things be not taken notice of by the Beaſts) I think I may ſafely inferre, that whatſoever is the firſt and principal cauſe of changing the fluid and undeterminated Matter into ſhapes ſo comely and ſymmetrical, as we ſee in flowers and trees, is an underſtanding Principle, and knowes both the nature of man, and of thoſe objects he offers to his ſight in this outward and viſible world, and would have man ſearch and finde out thoſe ſecrets by the which he might keep his body in health many hundreds of years, and at laſt find <hi>the way to Bliſs;</hi> for theſe things cannot come by chance, or by a Multiranious attempt of the parts of the matter
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118922:14"/>
upon themſelves, for then it were likely that the ſpecies of things though ſome might hit right, yet moſt would be maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ridiculous; but now there is not any ineptitude in any thing which is a ſign that the fluidneſſe of the matter is guided and determined by the overpowering counſel of an eternall mind.</p>
               <p>If it were not needleſſe, I might inſtance in ſundry kinds of flowers herbs and trees; but theſe objects being ſo obvious, and every mans fancy being brauched with the remembrance of <hi>Roſes, Marigolds, Gelliflowers, Pionies, Tulips, Pauſies, Primroſes,</hi> the leaves and cluſters of the Vine &amp;c. Of all which you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that there is in them beauty and ſymetry, and uſe in Phyſick, and gratefull proportion; I hold it ſuperfluity to weary you with any longer induction, but ſhall paſs on to thoſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions behind, of their ſeed, ſignaure and uſefullneſs, and ſhall paſs through them very briefly, and then I ſhall come to minerall Medicines, theſe obſervables being very neceſſary firſt to be known by way of an Introduction, and as ordinary and eaſily Intelligible.</p>

               <p>EVery plant hath its ſeed; Roſie Crucians therefore ſay there are ſecret Myſteries lye hidden in them, which ſhould be our delight to find out; for Divine Providence made all good for the uſe of man: And this being no neceſſary reſult of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter, as the whole contrivance of the plant indeed is not; and it being of great conſequence that they have Seed for the continuance of propagation of their whole Species, and for the gratifying of mans Art alſo, induſtry and neceſſitie, (for much of Husbandry and Gardening lies in this) it cannot but be the Act of <hi>Counſel</hi> to furniſh the ſeveral kinds of Plants with their Seeds, eſpecially the Earth being of ſuch a nature that though at firſt for a while it might bring forth all manner of <hi>Plantts,</hi> (as ſome will have it alſo to have brought forth all kinds of <hi>Animals</hi>) yet at laſt it would grow ſo ſluggiſh, that without the advantage of thoſe ſmall compendious principles of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Grain of Seed would yeild no ſuch births, no more then a Pump grown dry will yeild any Water, unleſs you pour a little Water into it firſt, and then for ſo many Baſons full, you may fetch up as many Tankards full.</p>
               <p>Nor is it material to object that ſtinking Weeds, and <hi>poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Plants</hi> bear <hi>Seed</hi> too, as well as the moſt pleaſant and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for even thoſe ſtinking <hi>Weeds,</hi> and <hi>poyſonous Plants</hi> have their uſe in <hi>Roſie Crucian Phyſick,</hi> as you ſhall know hereafter; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our common Phyſick-Mongers often uſe them as their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy guides them, grounded upon no other reaſon then woful and deadly experience; ſometimes the induſtry of man is exerciſed by them to weed them out where they are hurtful, which reaſons if they ſeeme fleight, let us but conſider, that if hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane induſtry had nothing to conflict and ſtruggle with, the fire of mans ſpirit would behalf extinguiſhed in the fleſh, and then we ſhall acknowledge that that which I have alledged is not ſo contemptible nor invalid.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Who knows but it is ſo with poyſonous <hi>Plants,</hi> as vulgarly is fancyed concerning Toads, and other poyſonous
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118922:15"/>
Serpents that lick the Venom from off the Earth? So poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Plants may well draw to them all the Maligne Juice and nouriſhment, that the other may be more pure and defae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, as there are Recepticles in the body of man, and Emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to drain them of ſuperfluous Choler and Melancholy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is very well known by them that know any thing in Nature and Phyſick, That thoſe Herbs that the rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant would call <hi>Weeds,</hi> are the materials of very <hi>ſoveraign Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> that <hi>Aconitum Hyemale,</hi> or <hi>Winter Wolfs bain,</hi> that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is rank poyſon, is reported to prevail mightily againſt the biting of Vipers, Scorpions, and mad dogs, which Sir <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Heydon</hi> aſſenteth unto; and that that plant that bears death in the very Name of it, <hi>Solanum Lethiferum,</hi> prevents death by procuring ſleep, if it be ayplyed in a Fever; nor are thoſe things to be deemed uprofitable, ſay the <hi>Roſie Crucians,</hi> whoſe uſe our heavy ignorance will not let us underſtand; but they will teach us as followeth.</p>
               <p>We come now to the ſignatures of plants, which indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects us more properly and adaequately then the other, and is a Key (as <hi>Roſie Crucians</hi> ſay) to enter man into the knowledge and uſe of the Treaſures of nature; I demand therefore, Whether it be not a very eaſie and Genuine inference from the obſerving that ſeveral herbs are marked with ſome mark or ſign that intimates their vertue, what they are good for; and there being ſuch a creature as man in the World that can read &amp; underſtand theſe ſigns and characters, hence to collect that the Author both of man and them, knew the nature of them both; and beſides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence would onely initiate and enter mankind in the uſeful knowledge of her Treaſures by the Seraphical illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Roſie Crucians, leaving the reſt to employ the vulgar that they might not be idle; for the Theater of the World is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of mans wit, and therefore all things are in ſome meaſure obſcure and intricate; that the ſedulity of that divine ſpark, the ſoul of man, may have matter of conqueſt and triumph, when he hath done bravely by a ſuperadvenient aſſiſtance of God.</p>
               <p>But that there be ſome plants that bear a very evident ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their nature and uſe, for example, <hi>Capillus veneris, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trichon,</hi> or <hi>Maiden-hair;</hi> the Lye in which it is ſodden or infus'd,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118922:16"/>
is good to waſh the head, and make the <hi>hair grow</hi> in thoſe places that are <hi>bare;</hi> the <hi>decoction of Quinces,</hi> which are a downey and hairy Fruit, is accounted good for the <hi>fetching again hair</hi> that hath been fallen by the <hi>French Pox;</hi> the Leaf of <hi>Balm and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leluia,</hi> or <hi>Wood-Sorrel,</hi> as alſo the <hi>roots of Anthora,</hi> repreſent the heart in figure, and are <hi>Cordiacal.</hi>

                  <hi>Walnuts</hi> beare the whole <hi>ſignature</hi> of the <hi>head;</hi> the outward green <hi>Cortex</hi> anſwers to the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and a Salt made of it is ſingular good for Wounds in that part, as the <hi>Kernel</hi> is good for the <hi>Brains,</hi> which it reſembles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vmbelicus Veneris</hi> is powerful to provoke <hi>luſt,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Culpep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> affirms; as alſo your ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Satyrions,</hi> which have the evident reſemblance of the genetal parts upon them; <hi>Aron</hi> eſpecially, and all your <hi>Orchiſſes,</hi> that they have given Names unto, from ſome beaſt or other, as <hi>Cynoſorchis, Orchis Miodes, Tragorchis, &amp;c.</hi> the laſt whereof notoriorious for its Goatiſh ſmell, and Tufts not unlike the Beard of that Lecherous Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, is of all the reſt the moſt powerful incentive to luſt.</p>
               <p>The Leaves of <hi>Hypericon</hi> are very thick pricked, or pointed with little holes, and it is a ſingular good Wound-herb, as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alſo for de-obſtructing the pores of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scorpioides, Echium,</hi> or <hi>Scorpions graſſe,</hi> is like the crooked Tayle of a <hi>Scorpion;</hi> and <hi>Ophiogloſſum,</hi> or <hi>Adders Tongue,</hi> hath a very plain and perfect reſemblance of the Tongue of a Serpent; as alſo <hi>Ophioſcorodon</hi> of the intire head and upper-parts of the body; and theſe are all held very good againſt poyſon, and the biting of Serpents; and generally all ſuch plants as are ſpeckled with ſpots like the Skins of Vipers, or other venemous creatures, are known to be good againſt the ſtings or bitings of them, and are powerful objects againſt poyſon.</p>
               <p>Thus did divine providence by natural <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> read ſhort <hi>Lectures</hi> to the rude wit of vulgar man; others of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphically illuminated Fraternity,</hi> being entred, and ſufficiently experienced of theſe, found out the reſt, it being very reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that other herbs that had not ſuch ſignatures, might be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good for Medicinal uſes, as well as they that had.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the uſefulneſſe of Plants, and of the Works of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu ſhal now briefly take notice of the uſefulnes &amp; profitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of plants both for Phyſick and Food, and then paſs on to the conſideration of the inſpired <hi>Roſie Crucians,</hi> what their Medicines are: As for the common uſes of Plants, <hi>Herbals</hi> teach you ſomething; but I refer you to the <hi>ſingular Medicines of Roſie Crucians</hi> in my Book of <hi>The way to bliſs</hi> for the ſalvation of your health, Animals know as much by inſtinct and nature; and that which is moſt obſervable here, is this, That brute Beaſts know as much as many Phyſicians do that are taught by Herbals onely; and theſe deny the power of God in the Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the power of Nature in the skill of man, that it ſhould be impoſſible to make <hi>Trees bear fruit in December, and Apple-trees to grow to bloſſom, and bear Apples contrary to kind in March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beaſts have knowledge in the vertue of Plants as well as men, for the Toad being overcharged with the poyſon of the Spider, (as is well known) hath recourſe to the Plantane-Leaf. The Weaſel when ſhe is to encounter the Serpent, arms her ſelf with eating of Rue. The Dog when he is ſick at the ſtomack, knows his cure, falls to his graſs, vomits, and is well. The Swallows make uſe of <hi>Celandine,</hi> the Lennet of <hi>Euphragia</hi> for the repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſight. And the Aſs when he is oppreſſed with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, eats of the Herb <hi>Aſplenium,</hi> or <hi>Miltwaſt</hi> &amp; ſo eaſes himſelf of the ſwelling of the ſpleen. The Raven makes uſe of <hi>Cinquefoyle</hi> for the prolongation of his life to ſomtimes ſix or ſevenhundred years; and therefore I think it is that the <hi>Roſie Crucians</hi> preſcribe the oyle of <hi>Ravens, Swallows,</hi> and <hi>Harts</hi> for the uſe of man to annoint himſelf, to continue his fleſh and well-complexioned body from wrinkles and lameneſs; and <hi>Dictamnum Cretenſe</hi> is much uſed, as I told you in my <hi>Wiſe mans Crown; Cretian Ditta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> cures Wounds of what nature ſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:118922:17"/>Which thing I conceive no obſcure indigation of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for they doing that by inſtinct and Nature, which men who have free Reaſon cannot but acknowledge to be very pertinent and fitting, nay ſuch that the skilfulleſt Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will approve and allow; and theſe creatures having no ſuch reaſon and skill themſelves as to turn Phyſicians, it muſt needs be concluded by vertue of that principle that contrived them, and made them of that Nature they are, enabled them alſo to do theſe things.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider the Fruits of the Trees, where I think it will appear very manifeſtly, That there was one <hi>worker of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and inſpirer of Roſie Crucians;</hi> I might now reach out to Exortick-Plants, ſuch as the <hi>Cinamon-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Balſome-Tree,</hi> and the Tree that bears the Nutmeg, invelopped the Mace; as alſo the famous Indian Nut-Tree, which at once (as the Roſie Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſay) affords almoſt all the neceſſaries of life; for if they cut but the Twigs at Evening, there is a plentiful and pleaſant Juice comes out, which they receive into Bottles, and drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Wine, and out of which they extract ſuch an Aquae Vitae as is very ſoveraign againſt all manner of ſickneſſes, the branches and boughs they make their Houſes of, and the body of the tree being very ſpongy within, though hard without, they eaſily contrive into the frame and uſe of their <hi>Canoes,</hi> or <hi>boats.</hi> the Kernel of the Nut ſerves them for bread and meat, and the Shells for Cups to drink in; and indeed they are not meer empty Cups, for there is found a delicious cooling milk in them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides there is a kind of hemp that incloſes the Nut, of which they make Ropes and Cables, and of the fineſt of it, Sayles for their ſhips; and the Leaves are ſo hard and ſharp pointed, that they eaſily make Needles or Bodkins of them for ſtitching their Sayles, and for other neceſſary purpoſes; and that Providence may ſhew her ſelf benigne as well as wiſe, this ſo notable a Plant is not reſtrain'd to one coaſt of the World as the Eaſt-Indies, but is found in <hi>Affrica, Arabia,</hi> and in all the Iſlands of the Weſt-Indies, as <hi>Hiſpaniola, Cuba,</hi> where our men are victorers; and ſeveral other places of the new-found World.</p>
               <p>But I thought fit to inſiſt upon theſe things by way of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, but to contain my ſelf within the compaſs of ſuch

               <p>Gentle Reader, be pleaſed to ſtay a little; If the <hi>Stars</hi> have no light, and ſo no power but from the <hi>Sun,</hi> that moſt wholſome and proſperous creature, then they hurt him moſt wrongfully, and reprove themſelves very rightly. And again, if they be but a piece of the finer part; and firſt nature, as it were, of the World, as I have ſhewed in my Book of the <hi>The Wiſe Mans Crown,</hi> then they be the wholſomeſt things in the World; ſo far be they from poyſoned ſlander: And ſo let their Lights be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo groſly mingled in their meetings, and thereby that ſtate of the Weather changed ſuddenly, and from thence our bodie's troubled and turned into Diſeaſes, becauſe they were not prepared and made ready for it, yet the things are good and proſperous; and by knowledge of Aſtrology, or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Planets, and races of the ſtars, we may prepare our ſelves, and prevent all, if we cannot have that happineſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with our <hi>Guardian Genius.</hi> Now for lower reflexion, it is not worth the anſwering when there is ſo much waſte ground in the World; then let us paſs over to that other <hi>Breach;</hi> may we not ſhun the leaving baits in our Dyet, and take ſuch meat as is moſt temperate and near our Nature, and then dreſs the ſame after the moſt kindly and wholſome manner, ſeaſoning it well with labour, mirth and ſleep?</p>
               <p>And to be plain, I have ſhewed in another Treatiſe of mine, entituled, <hi>The way to bliſſe,</hi> ſo much noted by our Writers, what a jewel of health it were to uſe all raw &amp; temperate meat, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ we be wiſe &amp; vertuous, and this Dyet would perhaps change our Nature of fire, but like <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> a quite contrary way; taking the beſt, when as none is loſt, and leaving the worſt, which is that we now take, a Way I ſay, to ſtrip of all groſsneſs and foulneſs of bodies, the only hurt of themſelves, and is the Food of all Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>I will tell you another way which you will think ſtrange, but you ſhall find it true; if the meat be temperate, as I bid you

chuſe it, there is no hurt can come thereby, (if you keep mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in your ſelves) ſave from your leavings; theſe in ſo clear a Dyet firſt will be very few; but if you would be ruled by my <hi>Counſel which Nature taught me,</hi> thoſe few ſhould never hurt you.</p>
               <p>Of all the Leavings in the body, there are three which the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver maketh moſt troubleſome unto us, (for the reſt are eaſily diſpatched) a light and eaſie, or rather a <hi>fiery</hi> (as ſome call) <hi>Choller;</hi> a cold and heavy mud, called <hi>Melancholly;</hi> and the third is <hi>Vrine,</hi> which I wil treat of in the next Chapter but thoſe two the worſer, and this fault is not in themſelves, but all by reaſon of the needleſs and hurtful bowels in our bodies, (as the Seeds-man uſeth to ſow good and bad together) which being of the ſame kind and quality with thoſe humors, do draw and pul them ſtil unto them (as all other parts and things do) for their Food and nouriſhment and ſo by the narrow paſſages to and fro, their greedineſs in pulling and holding, and a hundred ſuch means, ſubject to great miſchances, have brought in as many miſchiefs, whereas Nature the great expeller of her unlike, and Enemies, if ſhe had free choice and liberty, would otherwiſe with caſe, and without hurt, expel thoſe Leavings, eſpecially ſo ſmall a number of the better ſort in ſo clean a Dyet; nay, ſet the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of thoſe parts, (thoſe parts are <hi>Melt-Gall,</hi> and <hi>Reins</hi>) if there be not ſufficient ſtore of other ſoul meat at hand, like a poyſoned or a purging Medicine, they uſe to draw good Juices, and to make Food of them; what is not manifeſted in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhall methodically be demonſtrated in the enſuing, for I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be ſerious in this part of my Book, and will ſhew you what Nature taught me.</p>

               <p>NOW the <hi>Aire</hi> it ſelf, eſpecially when it is ever more as the <hi>wet Sunbeams</hi> declare, ſo ſprinkled with ſome <hi>Fine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign fatneſs,</hi> may ſeem ſufficient food to nouriſh the finer part of our <hi>Frame,</hi> wherein the temper of <hi>mankind,</hi> and his <hi>life</hi> (touching that point) ſtandeth, which is as much as any meat can do to <hi>life,</hi> (for it is not fed by common food, as I ſaid above) though not enough for ſtrength, becauſe the groſſer, ſounder, and tougher parts wherein the ſtrength lyeth, ſhall want food in this <hi>Dyet,</hi> and fail no doubt greatly, <hi>yet life ſhall laſt ſtill,</hi> as long as <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>firſt moiſture</hi> holds, in my opinion: or if we think that ſo ſpare a Diet, we may mend it (as the <hi>mouthleſs people do</hi>) with ſmell of <hi>Flowers:</hi> or rather, as we know <hi>Nature</hi> is able to draw <hi>Aire</hi> and other food which ſhe deſireth through the skin into all places of the body; ſo if ſhe had meat applyed to the ſtomach, ſhe would no doubt ſatisfie herſelf that way moſt finely, without the heap of hurts let in at the broad and common gates, as we ſee by example for <hi>Drink,</hi> that all the while we ſit in <hi>Water</hi> we ſhall never thirſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for meat, I have heard <hi>Roſie Crucians</hi> ſay, by applying of <hi>wine</hi> in this ſort they faſted without all hunger for two years together.</p>
               <p>And in like manner I have experienced this, and faſted two dayes when I firſt ſtudied the nature of the <hi>Guardian Genii:</hi> But if that would not ſerve the turn, and we muſt needs receive in

meat at the common gate, yet we may let it paſs no further then the gate, and make the ſtomach in the mouth, which is the uſe of ſome <hi>Roſie Crucians</hi> when they are <hi>Seraphically illuminated;</hi> and to provide enough for life and ſtrength, and a great deal bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our health, then we do, becauſe the clearer part alone ſhould be received, And moreover <hi>I</hi> ſay, for the clear diſpatch of that our ordinary trouble and anoyance which your reverence will not ſuffer me to name, although <hi>I</hi> might among <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> but they know my meaning: But it ſhall not need to ſteal ſhifts and holds if you will believe the <hi>Roſie Crucians,</hi> that we may eaſily faſt all our life (though it be <hi>three hundred years together</hi>) without all kind of meat, and ſo cut off all doubts and dangers of diſeaſes thereof ſpringing; and for my own part, I know ſome that have faſted and lived in the <hi>holy orders of the Fraternity</hi> without all food <hi>ten years</hi> ſpace together. What need we ſay more? if you be both ſo hard of belief, and dull of ſight, and reports of good Authors, nor my own experience will ſink into you, nor yet can you ſee the light of reaſon ſhining before you, take here a few of ordinary matters in the <hi>life</hi> and uſe of men, and weigh one with another; is it not as common in uſe, and indeed needful, to ſpit, and avoid another nameleſs leaving? and to <hi>Drink</hi> but to ſleep eſpecially? If ſome of theſe, nay all may be ſpared, why not our meat alſo? let us ſee a little, and by example, becauſe Reaſon is both too long and too open to cavil.</p>
               <p>To leave drink, which many have all their lives left; <hi>Elizabeth Drewe, a Devonſhire Gentlewoman, is reported never to have ſpat, nor the whole Indian Nation.</hi> Sr. <hi>Iohn Heydon</hi> ſaith, <hi>he knew one that kept the nameleſs matter forty daies together.</hi> And although this anſwereth not the queſtion, yet it ſheweth the truth of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Holy Story,</hi> for if in ſo foul and groſs a thing as dyet is, he could ſo long want it, why not theſe men for ever, in ſo clear and fine adiet, almoſt empty and void of all leavings? For the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort, which make up this foul and ſhameful one we left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as you heard, and the finer in the paſſage from the <hi>Stomach</hi> through the former Gates were drawn all away to the <hi>Liver,</hi> as the like is ever in us and voided otherwaies.

               <p>So we ſee, I ſay, great wordly wonders prove plain and eaſie truths in the ſight of Wiſdome: you have read of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Acourate Structure of mans Body,</hi> of his <hi>Soul,</hi> of his <hi>Senſes,</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> of <hi>Minerals;</hi> and <hi>Roſie Crucian medicine</hi> ſhall be that which <hi>I</hi> will inſiſt upon, and that by the means aforeſaid (where are more than one, if this like them not, they may take another) it is poſſible for all men by kind and cuſtome to keep their health for ever: Let us come to the next point, that is, aſwell to be recovered if it were loſt, and that all diſeaſes may be cured. This is a point much harder then the firſt, even ſo beſet and ſtopt with all kind of lets and incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that a man can ſcarce tell which way to ſet his foot forwards.

               <p>
                  <hi>A Medicine heals us, and kills our enemie,</hi> either by dulling or conſuming it; for when it meets with a contrary of even ſtrength (as when oyl and poyſon &amp;c. joyn) then in ſtrength they neither eat up nor deſtroy one another, but both are dulled and weakned, and make one heavy thing which nature caſteth out for an unlike and unkindly dead thing, which they call an excrement, or (Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;) but in caſe it be of more ſtrength and power then our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, then it quite deſtroyes, devours, and turns him into his own nature. And this conſumer is either like the thing that hurts us, in which ſort even as every herb of ſundry qualities draws and feeds upon his own <hi>juice</hi> in a <hi>Garden;</hi> ſo one Poyſon doth cure another, and all purging and drawing things do heal us, and all <hi>Roſie Crucians hid</hi> and <hi>Divine properties</hi> do work by plain reaſon; or elſe it is unlike and contrary to their cuſtome; after which manner as <hi>dry ſticks, and Tow, and vinegar quench wild fire,</hi> or other <hi>Fat Fires,</hi> before <hi>water,</hi> whoſe fatneſs feeds it, for the ſtrong contrary quality quelling and eating up the weaker; ſo doth any cold and dry thing as <hi>Bolearminick, Terra Lemnia,</hi> &amp;c. cure a Rotten poyſon: and ſo are a great number of cures done; which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118922:24"/>
onely courſe, in a word, the <hi>Roſie Crucians</hi> uſe for <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and not indeed without good ſucceſs; we heard even now of two hinderances of healing, which our common <hi>Phyſicians</hi> did take unawares, and <hi>Paracelſe</hi> pretends to have found out before me, gave any hint to the World of our experienced inventions, of <hi>Gold diſſolved and made potable, being incorporated with its proper Veyle,</hi> which we now uſe by the name of <hi>Aurum potabile;</hi> but <hi>Paracelſe</hi> ſtraieth much in the making of it, and knows it not no more than that <hi>tattered Doctor Freeman,</hi> ſo ſhamefully <hi>called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Phyſicians:</hi> Whither in their poiſons, on the other ſide, when they think all cures thereby performed.</p>
               <p>Now when the Conſuming Medicines have done their duties, Nature expells them for poiſon and unlike ſtrange things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Roſie Crucian Axiomata,</hi> as well as the <hi>Grecian Rules,</hi> becauſe all their Medicines were not approved by the Fraternity, and were by their confeſſion ſuch: But if they had either thought of the dulling nouriſher, which as I told you, takes the nature of the leaving or excrement, or had known the <hi>Roſie Crucian</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Medicine,</hi> they would have made another reckoning; But let them go, and us ſee out in time towards the <hi>Haven of Health,</hi> If the Art of Healing be nothing but deſtroying hurtful things, And their ſtronger enemies (but equality will ſometimes ſerve the turn) or likes together; and the world be full of both theſe kinds of Creatures, following the nature of their Parents of four beginnings, which are as we ſee, ſome like, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another.</p>
               <p>Then ſure the <hi>Roſie Crucian</hi> Art of <hi>Healing</hi> is not (as ſome may ſay) impoſſible, truly it wanteth nothing, but a man well skilled in the Nature of things, <hi>A ſervant of God, and Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Nature by name;</hi> for (I think) I need not put in a <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> to know what other part the Cauſes of the diſeaſes, which muſt be known and matched, becauſe as Sr. <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> the <hi>Seraphically Illuminated Roſie Crucian,</hi> and learned <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> well ſaith, He that knoweth the changes and chances of things in the <hi>great World,</hi> may ſoon find them in the <hi>Little.</hi>

               <p>But our nought-Healing Bill-men, that daub Medicines upon every Wall and Poſt, and ſome Leaches, will ſtep in, and ſay, diſeaſes are in ſome ſo great, and in all ſo many, and mans wit is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118922:25"/>
ſo weak and ſhallow, and the Medicines ſo hid and drowned in the deep of Nature, that it is not poſſible to find them all; or if they were found, to apply them with ſuch diſcretion as Nature might abide thoſe poiſoned Fraies and Battels within her. And again, admit all this untrue, yet there be ſome diſeaſes ſent from <hi>Witchcraft and Sorcery,</hi> and other means which have their cauſe, and ſo their Cure. I have read of ſom that have vomited uppieces of Cloth with Pins ſtuck in them, <hi>Nails, Needles,</hi> &amp; ſuch like ſtuff; and this is <hi>ingeſted</hi> into the <hi>Stomach,</hi> by the <hi>preſtigious</hi> Sleights of <hi>Witches;</hi> Others I have ſeen vomit up Hair, Glaſs, Iron, and pieces of Wood with Pins ſtuck in it; anothers Corps was diſſected, and <hi>ripping up the Ventricle,</hi> there they found the Cauſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which was a <hi>round piece of Wood, four Knives,</hi> ſome <hi>even and ſharp, others were indented like a Saw. Others do Miracles</hi> by caſting <hi>Flint-ſtones behind their Backs</hi> towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> or ſtriking <hi>a River with Broom,</hi> or <hi>flinging of Sand in the Air,</hi> the <hi>ſtirring of Urine in a hole in the ground,</hi> or <hi>boyling of Hogges Briſtles in a pot;</hi> ſome by <hi>whiſpering ſome words in the Ear of an horſe or wild Stagg, could direct him a journey according to their own deſire.</hi> But what are theſe things available? to gather <hi>Clouds,</hi> and to cover the <hi>Air</hi> with darkneſs, and then to make the ground ſmoke with peals of <hi>Hail</hi> and <hi>Rain,</hi> and make the <hi>Air</hi> terrible with frequent <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and ratling Claps of <hi>Thunder:</hi> But this is from the power of the <hi>Divel</hi> (as ſome fancy) which he hath in his Kingdome of the Air.</p>
               <p>For the Remedy of theſe miſchiefs, I have ſeen a man was preſent, when ſome have vomited up <hi>Needles, Thimbles, Shreds of Cloth, pieces of Pots, Glaſs, Hair;</hi> another would ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for <hi>money</hi> to be <hi>run thorow</hi> with a ſword when I was not there, but it appeared to me a Fable. I have ſeen a Roſie Crucian Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian cure theſe afflicted People. But if you will ſay, There is a touchſtone whereby we may diſcerne the truth of Metals, but that there is nothing whereby we may diſcover the truth of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> recorded every where in Hiſtory. But I anſwer there is, and that is this:</p>
               <p>Firſt, If what is recorded was avouched by ſuch perſons, who had no end nor intereſt in avouching ſuch things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if there were many eye-witneſſes of the ſame matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:118922:25"/>Thirdly and laſtly, If theſe things which are ſo ſtrange and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous leave any ſenſible effects behind them; Though I will not acknowledge that all thoſe Stories are falſe that want theſe Conditions, yet I dare affirme that it is meer Humour and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenneſs in a man to reject the <hi>Truth,</hi> of thoſe that hear them: For it is to believe nothing but what he ſeeth himſelf, from whence it will follow, That he is to read nothing of Hiſtory, for there is neither Pleaſure nor any uſefulneſſe, if it deſerve no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p>Another Remedy for theſe <hi>Supernatural diſeaſes,</hi> is, Let one watch the <hi>party Suſpected,</hi> when they go home to their <hi>houſe,</hi> and preſently after, before any body goe into the houſe after him or her, let one pull a handful of the <hi>Thatch,</hi> or a <hi>Tyle</hi> that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Door,</hi> and if it be a <hi>Tyle,</hi> make a good <hi>Fire,</hi> and heat it <hi>red hot</hi> therein, ſetting a <hi>Trivet</hi> over it; then take the parties <hi>Water,</hi> if it be a <hi>Man, Woman,</hi> or <hi>Child,</hi> and poure it upon the <hi>red hot Tyle,</hi> upon one ſide firſt, and then on the other, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain put the Tyle into the Fire, and make it extremely hot, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ever and anon, and let no body come into the houſe in the mean time.</p>
               <p>If they be Cattle that are bewitched, take ſome of the Hair of every one of them, and mix the Hair in fair water, or wet it well, and then lay it under the <hi>Tyle,</hi> the Trevet ſtanding over the Tyle, make a luſty fire, turne your Tyle oft upon the Hair, and ſtir up the Hair ever and anon; after you have done this by the ſpace of a <hi>quarter of an hour;</hi> let the fire alone, and when the Aſhes are cold, bury them in the ground towards that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Heaven where the ſuſpected Witch lives; this Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> ſaith he hath experienced.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Witch live</hi> where there is no <hi>Tyle,</hi> but <hi>Thatch,</hi> then take a great handful thereof, and wet it in the parties <hi>Water,</hi> or elſe in common <hi>Water</hi> mixed with ſome <hi>Salt,</hi> then lay it in the <hi>Fire,</hi> ſo that it may <hi>molter and ſmother</hi> by degrees, and in a long time: ſetting a Trivet over it. Or elſe take <hi>two new Horſe-ſhooes,</hi> heat them red hot, and nail one of them on the <hi>Threſhold</hi> of the <hi>Door,</hi> but quench the other in the <hi>Urine</hi> of the party ſo <hi>bewitched,</hi> then ſet the <hi>Urine</hi> over the <hi>fire,</hi> and put the <hi>Horſe-ſhooe in it,</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>Tryvet</hi> over the <hi>Pipkin</hi> or <hi>Pan</hi> wherein the Urine is; make
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118922:26"/>
the urine boil with a little ſalt put into it, and the Horſe nailes, until its almoſt conſumed, viz. the <hi>Urine;</hi> what is not boiled fully away pour into the fire: <hi>Keep your Horſ-ſhoe and Nails in a clean Cloth or Paper,</hi> and do likewiſe three ſeveral times; the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be far more effectual if you do theſe things at the very <hi>change or full Moon,</hi> or at the very <hi>hour of the firſt or ſecond Quarter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they be Cattel, you muſt mix the hair of their Tails with the <hi>Thatch,</hi> and moiſten them being well bound together, and ſo let them be a long time in the fire conſuming.</p>
               <p>You have heard the Cauſe of ſome of theſe diſeaſes, and have heard the Cure by <hi>Sympathie</hi> alſo; but theſe are without the compaſs of Nature, and ſo let them paſs with our fickle ſtanding, which is daily and hourely ſo beſet with deſtinies, that a man can warrant nothing.</p>
               <p>Truly deſtinies are ſo deep and bottomleſs, (to return ſtraight <hi>Homer</hi>-like upon them, and therefore it were beſt indeed to let them goe, and the applying of the <hi>Medicines</hi> with them) The rather becauſe the other, (I mean the former) is ſo ſlight a matter to a diſcreet <hi>Phyſician,</hi> ſuch a one as is pointed out by their old and famous Leader <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who both in this and all other duties of his Art made ſuch ſpeed, and ſo far paſſed all his fellowes (as none ſince, which is a good time, could ever overtake him) no nor yet come ſo neer as to keep the ſight of him, whom they had in chaſe and followed.</p>
               <p>Then for thoſe <hi>Supernatural cauſes,</hi> which I ſhall not ſtand here to ſearch (for ſo they are called) if they flow from <hi>unclean and wicked Spirits</hi> (as ſome think) they are not the Stuff of the things that hurt us, though ſomtimes they dwell in and poſſeſs the body, but windy matters, much like unto thoſe fierce and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den changes of the Weather, proceeding from the Influences of the Planets and fixed Stars, and working the like effects in mens bodies, ſo that ſith the neareſt cauſe is Natural, let the reſt be what they will, and the Cure be done by Natural means, as we ſee by experience amongſt us: And therefore <hi>E. A.</hi> that pretends this, and puts the fault in the Faith of the wicked, which is a thing as far <hi>above Nature,</hi> yet holds its Cure with a <hi>Natural Medicine,</hi> which we call a <hi>Quinteſſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:118922:26"/>Although I am not willing, that ſometimes this <hi>ſickneſs is ſuch</hi> as he bids us ſometimes withſtand it with another as ſtrong a belief ſet againſt it, but for my part, I cannot reach it with my conceit (let deeper heads then mine or the <hi>Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, Doctor Owen,</hi> think upon it) how theſe beliefs and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and other parts and powers of the ſoul or mind of man, can ſo flye out of their own kingdome, and <hi>Reigne</hi> over <hi>a forraign body,</hi> when we know the <hi>Soul and minde</hi> is ſo faſt bound in <hi>the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy indurance,</hi> and ſo like to be, untill it be the great pleaſure of the <hi>Omnipotent and the Omniſſent God,</hi> the <hi>chief good,</hi> who hath committed them, to let them looſe at once, and ſet them full at <hi>Liberty;</hi> and this may be diſputed with <hi>Grace and knowledge</hi> on my part; Let this man therefore buzze againſt my <hi>knowledge,</hi> which he would have to be more <hi>then Grace,</hi> I <hi>appeal</hi> to the <hi>Naturall faculties</hi> of any <hi>free judge, whether there be not as much Grace in me as there is honeſty in him:</hi> All men cenſure as they like of Stories; ſo let them paſs amongſt old wives tales for me, we will ſeverely follow our task.

with my tarrying, it is worth the handling, taketh hold upon this reaſon, becauſe (as <hi>Roſie Crucians</hi> do witneſs) ſome beaſts of ranker venome, do witch and hurt after the ſame manner; as an old Toad by ſtedfaſt view, not onely prevails, but benums a <hi>Weaſell,</hi> but kills a young child.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Naturall effects of Medicine: the force and power of mineralls in diſeaſes; with examples alſo that every diſeaſe-breeder hath the cure or remedy in it: examples that poyſon prepared cures poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned people: Roſie Crucian Arts: the virtue and power of the Planets and heavenly Stars poured through the influence of the moon upon the Lower Creatures: of Hot Stomachs: of the Etherial firſt moiſture of of man: examples alſo of Roſie Crucian Natural and ſupernaturall cures: of the underſtanding of theſe experienced truths by the wit of man: <hi>of Paracelſus and Culpeper.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>LEt us come to the next and chiefeſt point; And there we muſt not ſay for ſhame, that theſe helps and remedies lye hid in nature, too far for the wit of man to find, unleſs we will accuſe our own ſloth and dulneſs: For <hi>nature</hi> hath brought them forth and laid them open aſwel as the Poyſons and hurtful things, or elſe ſhe were very croſs and ill-willing to him for whoſe ſake it ſeems ſhe doth all things.</p>
               <p>Nay further (as Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> ſaith) her good will is ſuch, as ſhe hath not only laid them open, but given us wayes to come by them, and means of ſpeech, hands and wit alſo, far above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther living creatures. And yet ſhe hath not left us ſo, but leſt by chance we might go wide and miſs them, to ſhew her mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love and affection towards us, ſhe hath guided (as Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> ſaith) many witleſs Beaſts, even by common ſenſe, unto their ſpeedy helps and remdies in their diſeaſes: That we by the plainneſs and ſhame of the example (as Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi> wiſely ſaith) might be taught and moved to ſeek out the myſterious truths of nature <hi>in Celeſtial bodies,</hi> as wel as beaſts that ſeek and find us Medicines helpful in the like diſeaſes, for our <hi>Terreſtial Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi> As to name a few not unworthy meaning; ſhe maketh the beaſt <hi>Hippotamus</hi> in time of his fulneſs and fatneſs to go to a reed, and by rubbing a vain to let himſelf blood, and to ſtop it again by laying mud upon it; A ſick <hi>dog</hi> to ſeek an Herb and purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and the <hi>bear</hi> to do the ſame after his long faſt in <hi>Winter;</hi> ſhe leads the <hi>Panther,</hi> when he is poyſoned, to her foul and nameleſs

leaving; and the <hi>Tortoyſe,</hi> after he hath eat a Viper, to Summer Savery: And the Hedg-hog is ſo good a natural Aſtronomer, that he fortifies his hole againſt foul weather; the Hog will gather Moſs and ſtraw to cover himſelf a little before it rains; The dog knows the influence of Mars when he doth ſleep by the fire, and will not go out a dores when he is in any evil poſition: and many ſuch like examples hath nature laid before us for our inſtruction; by which at laſt wiſe <hi>Plato, Philo, Apollonius, Pythagoras,</hi> and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men of <hi>Greece,</hi> as they themſelves report, be they <hi>Elias or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha,</hi> from whom the order of the <hi>Roſie Croſs</hi> came, (as ſome ſay) or elſe as others will have it, from <hi>Moſes, or Ezekiel,</hi> or whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and by laying reaſon and further proof together, firſt made the Art and rules of <hi>Healing,</hi> to know whence diſeaſes came, and how to recover them. And then ſeeking all about for remedies to ſerve each turne, by little and little they matched the moſt part of the leſſer rank with ſingle Medicines, and the greater ones they doubled and coupled many together, inſomuch as at laſt, which was in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> time, they were able to heal all (ſaving four,) of the greateſt and deepeſt diſeaſes, the <hi>Gout,</hi> the <hi>Dropſie,</hi> the <hi>Leproſie,</hi> the <hi>Falling ſickneſs;</hi> which are now healed by the <hi>Roſie Crucians onely.</hi> But this race is below the <hi>Seraphically illuminated Fraternity:</hi> now not a <hi>Phyſician</hi> that is lined with Pluſh in <hi>England, Spain, Germany, or France;</hi> but holds that <hi>Long-life,</hi> Health, Youth, not attainable, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with one conſent, amongſt the other four, call them impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>But to come to the point; what wrong this was both to <hi>skill</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> they do eaſily ſee and laugh at, which know that in this labour, they did not onely overſee and skip the <hi>Minerals,</hi> the ſtouteſt helps in the whole ſtore-houſe of <hi>Nature</hi> (although they could dig them out well enough to other and worſer uſes) but alſo, which is in all, did let the <hi>Roſie Crucian</hi> skill of preparing <hi>Medicines,</hi> whereby weak things are made almighty, quite eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to make up the <hi>Roſie Crucian Art of healing,</hi> and to make it able (as they ſay) to help and cure all diſeaſes came in, or rather went before them, into mans body; The <hi>Egyptians</hi> in great ſavour too with <hi>nature</hi> both for their ſoil and bringing up,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118922:28"/>
ſo notably commended above all <hi>nations,</hi> (having for example, to move and teach them even the great weight of the world as Sr. <hi>Iohn Heydon</hi> ſaith) for wits to deviſe, and bodies to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
               <p>Whereby in ſhort time they unfolded the knot why the <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi> were of greateſt force and power againſt diſeaſes; and ſoon after, which was a divine light, and in-ſight, they perceived the huge labour of ſeeking ſuch a huge ſort of ſingles and mixtures to be vain and empty, and pittiful among wiſemen.</p>
               <p>Becauſe firſt, there is nothing hurtful and a breeder of diſeaſe, but it hath the heal and remedy for the ſame about him: For the <hi>wings</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> of <hi>Cantharides,</hi> the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the <hi>Root Bezar,</hi> the Aſhes of Scorpions, Toads, and Vipers; and divers other ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger poyſons, both by nature and skill dreſt and prepared, do cure and heal their own and all other Poyſons; nay as all ſtronger likes do cure their likes throughout the whole world of diſeaſes, even ſo when a man hath found out the thing that hurts him, he may by eaſie skill mingle and break the temper of the ſame further; that is, make it able to eat up and conſume it ſelf as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, without any further doubt, toil and labour; But eſpecially becauſe there is no one thing in the world, take what you will, that hath not the vertues of the <hi>Planets</hi> arreſted and faſtened upon it, and alſo of the qualities thereof within it ſelf, that is not as good as all, and may ſerve inſtead of all, and that is not able to cure all diſeaſes; which thing weighed, and with diſcourſe of wit and reaſon fully reached, they went to practiſe, and by the like ſharpneſs of wit, they found out the kindly and ready way to dreſs and make fit theſe three kinds of Medicines aforeſaid, which contain all the Art of healing, all the reſt are but waſt words and grievous toyl, to tire a world of wits about a bootleſs matter, as ſaith <hi>Des Cartes.</hi> But eſpecially they reſted in the laſt, which is enough alone, and yet not without great forecaſt, to chuſe one of the beſt, and that the very beſt of all, for their eaſe in dreſſing. Though Dr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> of late was not content with this, but ran through the reſt, aſwell to ſpite his enemies, the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> as to make himſelf famous in <hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Alehouſes,</hi> as <hi>Paracelſe</hi> in his time did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe ſteps he ſtrove to follow againſt the rule of <hi>Roſie Crucian wiſdom and vertue;</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:118922:29"/>
and the example of his anceſtors.</p>
               <p>But hath every thing all the vertues and influences taken from the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> by the <hi>Moon,</hi> to the earth; That is, all the curing and healing power of all the things in the world? very well you muſt remember that I proved above all the <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>powers</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> poured down through the <hi>Influence</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> upon theſe lower <hi>creatures,</hi> to be nothing elſe (as <hi>Captain George Wharton</hi> truly ſaith) but one ſelf ſame life and Soul, and <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> heat in all things, And again, that all diſeaſes flow from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and as it were diſcord of the Natural conſent of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; then that thing which is endued with ſtore of life, and with exact and perfect temperateneſs, ſeated upon both a ſubtile and ſtrong body, (which the thing in the bottom is) able alone by ſubduing his weaker enemies, thoſe diſtempered diſeaſes, by ſtrengthening his fellow life, <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> in our bodies. And laſtly, by orderly binding together the frame that was ſlipt out of order, to do as much as all the powers and forces of all the <hi>Plants, Weights, and minerals</hi> in the world, that is, to put to flight all trouble of diſeaſes, and reſtore the body to perfect health and quierneſs.</p>
               <p>But how is all this done? we talk of high things, and huddle up too many great matters together. It were good for us to work them out diſtinctly; when this <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi> we ſpeak of, and ſtrong tempered <hi>medicines,</hi> ſlip into the ſtomach, it ſtayes no long digeſtion, being already digeſted, nor look for any ordinary paſſages to be opened unto it, but as ſoon as it is raiſed out of ſleep by his fellow, the natural heat, by and by he flyes our, and skowers about, as faſt as the <hi>Dolphine</hi> after his prey, or as nature her ſelf, whom Mr. <hi>Booker,</hi> as I take it (ſaith) to pierce bounds, and all to the purpoſe, that is to ſeek his like food, and ſuſtenance, whereby to preſerve his ſtate and being, which is the purpoſe of all things in the world, as was ſaid above.</p>
               <p>Now there is nothing ſo like and neer a perfect temperature in the world, as the <hi>Etherial firſt moiſture</hi> in man; But what this is, you may read in my book entituled <gap reason="foreign">

it preſently reſtoreth a man half dead, and as it were, pulls him out of the throat of <hi>death;</hi> then it runs to the reſt all about, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing by that means the natural heat, and firſt moiſture of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the body; when this is done, he turns upon the parts themſelves, and by encountring with them in the ſame ſort, according to his might, feeds upon them, and brings them a certain way towards his own nature, even ſo far as we will by our uſage ſuffer; for if we take it with meaſure and diſcretion, it will bring our body to a middle mean and ſtate, between his own exact temperature and the diſtemper of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, even a better ſtate then ever it had before; if we uſe it out of meaſure, it takes us up too high, and too near his own <hi>nature,</hi> and makes us unmeet for the deeds of the duties of an <hi>earthly life.</hi> But in the mean while in the midſt of this work, we muſt know that by his exceeding heat and ſubtleneſs which is gotten by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Crucian</hi> skill, and which make up the ſtrength above all things, it divides and ſcatters, like ſmoke before the wind, all diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and hurtful things, and if they cannot be reconciled and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to goodneſs, nature throws them out as dead, and unfruitful leavings.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>EUgenius Theodidactus</hi> hath ſhewed you this <hi>Heaven,</hi> Nay this <hi>Sun</hi> of ours, which is nought elſe, as I told you in one of my books of <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> but an <hi>Oyl full of heavenly Spirits,</hi> and yet in Quality of his body juſt, even and natural, fine and piercing, cloſe and laſting, able as well to rule this little World, as Mr. <hi>Thomas Heydon</hi> ſaith, the great <hi>Sun</hi> is able to governe the great World.</p>
               <p>But what is he, ſaies Mr. <hi>Iohn Cleeveland,</hi> that can ſee this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Art and Way, whereby God made his great and mighty work, viz: <gap reason="foreign">

I anſwer, None but <hi>Roſie Crucians,</hi> to whom I am a friend, and they God hath enlightned and unſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their eyes, they have found the way lying open in all places, and in all <hi>Natural changes,</hi> they ſee them paſs and travel, I ſay ſtill, the courſe that <hi>Heydon</hi> calls ſoft and witty, that is, kindly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and if he be not ſwift and raſh as many, ſuch as <hi>Thomas

               <p>If you perceive not, conſider the way whereby we made our <hi>Ether</hi> in our book abovenamed, and matched our own firſt moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, a thing <hi>Etherial,</hi> I ſay, and almoſt Temperate; mark what I ſay, there is a further end in the matter, hold on the ſame means whereby you came ſo far through <hi>The wiſe mans Crown,</hi> and are gone ſo far <hi>in the Way to bliſs,</hi> which is that I ſpake of, and you may reach it.</p>
               <p>Then you ſee the way to cure all diſeaſes by the third way of <hi>Egyptian healing,</hi> which they doe, and we may well call it the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians Heaven, and yet it is a way far beneath the <hi>Roſie Crucian</hi> Art of Healing, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>But if they will not yeeld yet to reaſon, but mutter ſtil <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Street</hi>-like, that theſe Heavenly Medicines of ours are very high for the reach of mens ſilly wits, here ſtrowed below upon the ground for other leſſer and baſer uſes, and that no man ſince the firſt man, or if I will ſay <hi>Moſes,</hi> was the firſt, that firſt found out theſe inventions as they call them, after <hi>Adam;</hi> and that none but the <hi>ſucceſſors of Moſes</hi> have been ever yet known to have found and wrought the ſame; I will not ſtand to beat reaſon into ſuch giddy-braindmen, but go to the other two waies of healing, which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> found out and uſed, and called the firſt Mineral Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and theſe <hi>Moſes</hi> taught the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of mount Sinai, when he took the Golden Calf which he had made, and calcined it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated it with a Solar Veagle, and made the children of Iſrael drink Aurum potabile.</hi>

kind, becauſe that is too large a <hi>Name</hi> (if it be lawful for us as well as for all other <hi>Learned men,</hi> where a fit word wants to make a new) we may do well I ſay to call it a <hi>Cure it ſelf,</hi> becauſe it is by that way of healing, whereby every ſelf ſame thing further broken may cure it ſelf; and this inward and hidden thing as they ſay, the outward and apparent by the courſe of kind, whereby the ſtronger like eates up in triall and conſumes the weaker.</p>
               <p>If this leave be once granted, we will borrow a little more for the other two likewiſe, becauſe their names, are not pertinent to our purpoſe, and call that <hi>Heaven</hi> a <hi>Cure-all,</hi> for ſo it doth, and the next a <hi>Cure-the Great,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Roſie Crucians</hi> is alwayes to match the greater and more ſtubborn ſort of diſeaſes with the Stout and <hi>mighty minerals,</hi> and the reſt with thoſe hidden <hi>cure-themſelves,</hi> or at leaſt in the lower rank of lighter diſeaſes, with their likes, onely raw, as the <hi>Grecians</hi> uſe them, without any curious dreſſing.</p>
               <p>Let us draw nearer a concluſion of the matter; becauſe <hi>Grecians</hi> themſelves are able, and our <hi>Engliſh Phyſicians</hi> that learn of them, to cure the lighter ſort of diſeaſes, and to heal all but the four aforeſaid, we will leave the reſt for them, and ſo let this ſecond kind of healing go called <hi>our hidden cure themſelves,</hi> and bend all our batteries againſt theſe four which they call incurable, and ſee how by force of our Mineral Medicines, they may be cured: we ſee the Poyſoned ſpirits and breaths of venomous things, with what force they work upon our bodies, things in <hi>Nature</hi> ſet againſt them, and how they conſume them; If you do not ſee by imagination, reaſon with your ſelves, if not remember thoſe above named, that killed with their ſight; Hear one or two more that work the ſame by touch as violently. The <hi>Hare-fiſh,</hi> a moſt cold and dry <hi>creature</hi> (to omit that ſhe maketh a mans head ake by ſight) if you touch her aloof onely with a ſtaffe, that her veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous breath may go ſtraight and round unto you, you die pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. The root <hi>Baazam</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> writes, kills the man that handleth it, and therefore they uſed to make a dog pull it up (as <hi>Ben. Iohnſon</hi> ſaith) who thereby died imediately. To come into the body; that <hi>coſtly poyſon</hi> Mr. <hi>Linacre</hi> talks of, that is in <hi>Nubia,</hi> and one grain kills a man out of hand yet ſtay but a quarter of an hours working, and that one grain divided will

overcome ten men; I hope you doubt not but theſe mighty poyſons if they were like in <hi>Nature</hi> to the four great diſeaſes, and by little and little to be born by Nature, and ſet upon them, would be able eaſily, by their great ſtrength to devour and conſume them; or elſe ſure ſuch heaps of poyſon as the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> give us would not dwell ſo long within us, but would put out life in a moment. Now what are theſe poyſoned <hi>Vapours,</hi> but moſt cold and dry bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, wrought and broken up by naturall mingling, unto great fineneſs and ſubtileneſs, by this peircing ſwiftly all about, and by theſe contrary qualities overcoming? Then let us take the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Minerals,</hi> ſuch as are called <hi>Middle Minerals</hi> by <hi>Roſie Crucians,</hi> or hard juices by Mr. <hi>Berkenhead</hi> (to leave the Metals for a better purpoſe) be they poyſons, as <hi>G. Agricola</hi> ſaith, but what they be <hi>I</hi> care not, and after we have by meer working, cleanſed them and ſtripped them of their cloggs and hinderances, broken and raiſed them to a fine ſubſtance, then match them with their likes, the hurtfull things in our bodies, ſhall they not let all the reſt alone, and ſtraightway cleave to their fellows, as well as a purging <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi> and ſo devour and draw them out by little and little? If there be no likes, I grant they will as well as that, fall upon their enemies, or good juices, and feed upon them.</p>
               <p>Then what do you doubt is not a Mineral body far better? And therefore if it be raiſed to as great a fineneſs, much ſtronger in working then the gentle and looſe temper of a <hi>wight</hi> or <hi>plant:</hi> wherefore theſe our Mineral Medicines, and ſome other fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Medicines, and <hi>cure the great,</hi> as we call them, ſhall in any reaſon, work more violently upon their likes, then the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>poyſons</hi> of <hi>Wights</hi> and <hi>Plants</hi> do upon their contraries, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the like doth more eaſily yield then the contrary, and for that the lighter here is the ſtronger.</p>
               <p>But if you cannot ſee theſe things by the light of mind, open your eyes, and caſt them a little into the School of <hi>Alchimy,</hi> into the leſſer and lower ſchool, I mean of <hi>Germans,</hi> and you ſhall ſee the Schollars, eſpecially the maſters, by ſtripping the Minerals, and lifting up their properties, but a few degrees, to work wonders; as to name three or four, by quenching the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> in the oyl of Iron, his proper food, they make him ten times ſtronger, able to pull a nail out of a poſt, &amp;c. And by this natural pattern they make
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118922:32"/>
Artificial drawers, not for Iron onely, but for all other things, yea and ſome ſo mighty, as they will lift up an Ox from the ground, and rent the arm of a Tree from the body, as Mr. <hi>Comer</hi> doth witneſs; who reporteth again that he ſaw a fleſh-drawer, that pulled up 100 weight of fleſh, and a mans eye out of his head, and his Lights up into his <hi>Throat and choaked him.</hi> They make <hi>binders</hi> alſo to <hi>glew two pieces of Iron together,</hi> as faſt as the <hi>Smith</hi> can joyn them To be ſhort they make <hi>eaters</hi> alſo, that will conſume <hi>Iron ſtones</hi> or any <hi>hard thing</hi> to nought in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they <hi>diſſolve Gold</hi> into an <hi>oyle;</hi> they <hi>Fix Mercury</hi> with the <hi>ſmoke of Brimſtone,</hi> and make many rare deviſes of it; And all theſe wonders and many more they do by certain reaſon: I could tell you, if I could ſtand about it. In the mean time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if theſe or any other ſuch like Minerals were raiſed higher, and led to the top of their fineneſs and ſubtleneſs, and matched with their like companions, or with their contraries, if you will, thoſe great diſeaſes in our bodies, what ſtirrs they would make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, how eaſily they would hew them, pierce, divide, waſte, and conſume them?

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Roſie Crucians make a Chirurgeons inſtrument; that it ſhall pierce through any part of the whole body, without ſenſe or feeling, and ſound the depth of a wound. The difference of Common Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians Raw, Blunt, and herby medicines, and Roſie Crucians: What a Phyſician ought to be, what they ought to learn, and what they ought to practiſe, and then I ſhall love them of the order of the Roſie Croſs.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt I wear away time in vain, to ſpeak ſo much about tis matter; and yet ſith all are not of like Capacity, I will adde one yet familiar example; when a <hi>Surgeon</hi> goeth about to ſearch a wound that is deep, if he thruſt at it with a <hi>Butchers prick</hi> he would move <hi>Laughter;</hi> let him take a <hi>Thorwe,</hi> and it wil pierce ſomewhat prettily; but to do it throughly, and at his pleaſure he will uſe, (though to the great grief of his <hi>Patient</hi>) a fine and long inſtrument of Mettal. But a right <hi>Surgeon</hi> the common ones are but Butchers, ſuch a one as is a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> nay a <hi>Roſie Crucian</hi> alſo, would touch his <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> with a <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> that is commonly found, to make it pierce throughout the body without all ſenſe or feeling; Even ſo good <hi>Phyſicians</hi> ſuch an one, as the <hi>Lord Marques of Worceſter</hi> had, whom he taught many fine inventions: he told me of a <hi>Golden</hi> ball that this Lord made, that let him throw it into a River or Pool, it would ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again from the bottom at what hour he pleaſed. This <hi>noble Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> ſhewed me a key of the lock, that would tell him who touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Nay if it fortuned to be pickt he could know who did it, and what was taken away (before their faces) and many rare things I have ſeen this princely Philoſopher do, which his excellency was pleaſed to ſhew me; ſuch as theſe are hard to be found in this <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> where none of theſe can live without great envie. If one of theſe <hi>Roſie Crucians</hi> be to encounter with our greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, theſe four we ſpeak of, he would not I hope, if he were a true <hi>Roſie Crucian</hi> be ſo mad as to thruſt at them with the Raw and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118922:33"/>
blunt <hi>Herby</hi> Medicines ſuch as Dr. <hi>Scarborough,</hi> preſcribe, no nor although they be ſharpened by <hi>Iacob Heydon,</hi> by plain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations: neither would he, I think for pitty, ſting the <hi>poor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieni</hi> with <hi>Eugenius Philalethes</hi> Martyrdome of rude and rank <hi>Minerals,</hi> and unleſs they were made into a fine clean natural and temperate quality, which would work mightily, and deſtroy either of theſe four great diſeaſes, <hi>Leproſie, Gout, Dropſie,</hi> and <hi>Falling ſickneſs:</hi> but feed, Comfort, or at leaſt not offend, and hurt his patient; they labour in vain that practiſe otherwiſe. Theſe are the <hi>medecines</hi> which I onely uſe, and which a good and wiſe <hi>Phyſician</hi> ought onely to ſeek and follow, and if he cannot find it, let him uſe the <hi>cure themſelves.</hi> But ſuch a thing as this; I ſay, brought to this equality, and fineneſs of frame and temper, (were it at the firſt, <hi>wight, plant or mineral</hi>) was it which our <hi>father</hi> and <hi>founder Moſes,</hi> (the chief of the Roſie Croſs) ſaid is like to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the ſtrength of all ſtrengths piercing and ſubduing all things.</p>
               <p>This was it that warranted his <hi>Sons</hi> the <hi>roſie Crucians</hi> to avow ſo ſtoutly, that Art was long and Life ſhort, and all diſeaſes <hi>cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> when <hi>Hippocrates the Father of Common Phyſicians,</hi> was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the infirmity and endleſs matter of his weak body, and envious mind tinctured with Covetouſneſs, and fickle Medicines, to cry to <hi>Roſie Crucians,</hi> but they would not hear ſuch hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fellows, nor give him <hi>long Life,</hi> he ſaid therefore that <hi>Art</hi> was <hi>long,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> was <hi>ſhort.</hi> And whereas he and his off-ſpring were fain to leave many diſeaſed helpleſs, to the great ſhame of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Plague</hi> of <hi>mankind,</hi> is it any marvel when as they prick at them (as I ſaid) with a Butchers-prick? Nay, ſee what they do by their practice, they be ſo far from all help and comfort to the Patient in greateſt danger, that they increaſe his wiſer eys many waies, except the great eaſer of all pain, and their common Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine <hi>Death,</hi> be quickly adminiſtred: Firſt, they make the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſuffer the puniſhment due to their own ſlothful Idleneſs, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening his ſtomach with that labour of looſnening and ſundering the Fine from the Groſs, which they ſhould before have taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>Glaſſes:</hi> and then by doing theſe often, they clean tire his feeble Nature (as it would tire a horſe) when as by ſtripping the foul and groſs ſtuff, that dulls the working, and reteining the

Vertue in a narrow ſtrong body, they might doe as much at one time as they doe now in twenty, and becauſe their Medicines applyed are of ſmaller power and weaker than the things that hurt us, they feed nouriſh and ſtrengthen the diſeaſe and ſickneſs, but for all this if ſome of this company and ſide of Leeches have been and are yet ſometimes able to heal all diſeaſes in our body (though with much ado, as you have heard) ſave the four named remedileſs, yea and thoſe aſwell in their ſpring as before their ripeneſs, as they themſelves report. Is there any <hi>Proportion</hi> in <hi>Geometry?</hi> Let the <hi>College of Phyſicians</hi> lay meaſures why the <hi>Roſie Crucian mighty Medicines</hi> which I call <hi>Cure-the-greats,</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe in power, <hi>as much as the ripeneſs of a diſeaſe is above the Spring,</hi> ſhall not overmatch the ripe as well as the green Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: Wherefore there be no doubts left, but this plainly true, That albeit the <hi>Grecians</hi> is weak and halting in this kind of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet is the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> or (as now they terme it) the <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> and Mineral skill ſufficient to cure all diſeaſes: Then I have paid the whole ſumme of my promiſe, touching the ſecond means and helps to <hi>Bliſs</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> which is Life and Health.</p>
               <p>Before I cloſe, I think it very meet, while the time and place very fitly ſerveth, to do a good deed, and this ſhall be my intent to admoniſh and exhort the Grecian Leaches, and their <hi>Scholars</hi> the <hi>English, Spanish, and French Phyſicians,</hi> whom if they follow <hi>Hippocrates, Plato, Pythagoras,</hi> and his fellows, I love for their Learning, and pitty for their miſleading others (although it be grievous, I know to old Scholars, wone in a kind of Learning, to unlearne all as it were and begin again, for their own Credit and Virtue, yea and profit ſake alſo, if they eſteem that beſt, to leave thoſe <hi>Gilded Pills and Sugred Baits,</hi> and all other <hi>crafty ſnares,</hi> wherewith the World hath been ſo long caught and ſo long tormented, and to ſeek this onely heavenly Society; as (to you that are learned) eaſily may temper your ſelves, and be acquainted with the ready, true, plain and certain way of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſeaſes. I think in former time they were not greatly to be blamed and accuſed but of dulneſs and weakneſs of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in not applying and ſeeing this perfection, and ſupplying of all their wants; but ſince they have been ſo often warned not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118922:34"/>
with words only, but with examples of Learned men, <hi>Matheo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Fernelius, Severinus Danus, Philo Iudaeus, Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and other ſuch like which have and doe revolt, and flie away from them daily, yea and by the certain deeds of <hi>Paracelſe,</hi> it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qity to ſit ſtill: Well, few words will ſerve to wiſe and vertuous <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> ſuch as are of themſelves forward.</p>
               <p>But there is another, and I am afraid, the greater ſort, leſs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, more Idle and Covetous, full of windy Pride and Words, but empty of all good learning, and they are no friends to <hi>Roſie Crucians,</hi> nor they to them, and theſe no gentle warning of any, no though a <hi>Roſie Crucian</hi> himſelf ſhould come and bring <hi>Truth</hi> her ſelf along with him in perſon, would prevail: who care not it ſeems if half mankind ſhould periſh for want of help and ſuccour, rather then loſe their gains; And which not onely ſpeak foully but write fooliſhly, againſt this overflouriſhing vertue, but alſo like the giddy people of my time, where they catch the State, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the men that hold and poſſeſs it; whereas if it were a good Commonwealth (quoth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) the matter would be ſo far from <hi>Baniſhment</hi> or <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> as they would eſteem ſuch a <hi>man</hi> as well as the <hi>Laws</hi> (for he is himſelf a Law) exempt from all obedience, and judge him worthy to be followed and obeyed as a <hi>perpetual King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This untowardneſs and crookedneſs in men <hi>cauſod all our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healing Anceſtors the Roſie Crucians</hi> from time to time, never to abide their Sentence, but to the great hurt and loſs of mankind go into willing <hi>Baniſhment,</hi> you have eſtabliſhed a kind of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> among you (to purſue the ſame, like a little —) wherein you rule alone over the weak and ſorry ſubjects of mens Bodies, then their health and ſafety you ought to ſeek onely, beſides e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to maintain a contented eſtate alſo, which <hi>Plato</hi> allowes his <hi>Governours,</hi> and not profit only (that were Tyranny) both for humanity and Religion ſake, for to omit Religion, which they do lightly omit, if a Phyſitian begin once to make a prey of men, he is not onely no man, but a moſt Fierce and cruell Beaſt, not fit to be compared and matched and matched any where, if you ſeek all over the world as with the <hi>miſhapen monſter</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deſcribes, and calls <hi>Martichora,</hi> which being by nature or cuſtome, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118922:35"/>
very greedy upon mans fleſh, is with manifold and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful helpes furniſhed, and armed unto it.</p>
               <p>Firſt with a face like a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>voice</hi> like a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> two fit things to allure and call him in) and then if he flye, with the ſwiftneſs of an Hart to overtake him, he darts like a <hi>Porcupine,</hi> to wound him afar of; and with the tail of a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> as it were a poyſoned <hi>ſhaft,</hi> near hand to ſting him: furthermore, leſt all this might not ſerve, by occaſion of <hi>Armour,</hi> he hath feet like a <hi>Lion,</hi> fiercely and cruelly to tear him, and three rowes of teeth, on each Chap for the in devouring. Apply you and the Apothecarries, the reſt your ſelves, in ſecret for my part, as I am not a Roſie Crucian, ſo I am as well as they, ſorry to ſee evil done. And I am loath to ſpeak evil of it, and ſure were not the great grief and envy I do bear; and alwayes did, to ſee deſert trodden down by ſuch unworthineſs, and ſome little hopes I have to hear of the amendment, and ſo of the return of the truth, and good men out of baniſhment and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, you ſhould have found me in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall:</hi> as I have been an <hi>Atturny</hi> in Terme time, and mean to continue my practiſe there ſo long as I live, except in the Vacation, which I intend to ſpend <hi>in Chimical</hi> and <hi>Roſie Crucian Medicines</hi> for the good of <hi>honeſt plain meaning men</hi> and my ſelf <hi>Eugenius Theodidactus.</hi>

               <p>But ſome may ask what I mean by <hi>R.
