            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Touching the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration and recitall of the ſpeciall or ſeverall confuſions, incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and miſchiefes, which in the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in the ſecond place, of matter of Eſtate inward, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I briefly anſwer, that there is no feare of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93510:37"/>
confuſion in true and perfect Vnion. Which thing the mighty <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> renowned for fortitude and policy, well knew, who is much commended by <hi>Plutarke,</hi> that (where <hi>Zeno</hi> chiefe of Stoickes framed an Idea of beſt Common-wealth, ſuch as was not divided by countries and contrary cuſtomes, but was as all one, of one kinde of life, and as one flocke feeding in one paſture,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93510:37"/>
under one ſhepheard) <hi>Alexander</hi> I ſay, put that in practiſe which <hi>Zeno</hi> but imagined: for ſaith <hi>Plutarke,</hi> not as <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Alexanders</hi> Maſter taught him, ſo did hee, living as a father to the Grecians, and cruell Commander over Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, reſpecting ſome, and neglecting others: but he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled all into one, mixing mens lives, lawes, names and marriages together,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93510:38"/>
and perſwading that none were Aliens and ſtrangers among his ſubjects, but ſuch as were evill men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting all good men, as one man.</p>
            <p>Now I conclude this point, that there is no confuſion, incongruity, or miſchiefe to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Vnion, where our moſt rightfull King ſitteth, not by conqueſt of ſword, but by right of royall blood, in the ſeate of his moſt noble
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93510:38"/>
Progenitors: and not as <hi>Alexander,</hi> who by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſate in the ſeate of <hi>Darius</hi> among Perſians: nor as <hi>Xerxes</hi> who joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Aſia and Europa together with a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den bridge over Helleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont: but as all other moſt mighty Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and the beſt kings have (by a golden bridge of likeneſſe, of love, of equity, of laws, and of common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of ſociety and joy, (all which were both

profitable and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) joyned together two or more king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, for their owne greater honor, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects more undoubted happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Which thing likewiſe that noble and valiant Trojan <hi>Aeneas</hi> long ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence put in uſe, who by Vnion, even of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers nations, <hi>Omnis eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem nomine, &amp; eodem jure Latinos vocavit.</hi> And thereby as <hi>Livie</hi> report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of him, he made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93510:39"/>
and divers nations as one people, moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and moſt friendly together.</p>
            <p>Doe not divers Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames come from one Sun, and all they of one nature? Are not divers lines drawne from one Center, and all they of one faſhion? Are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers boughes from one tree, and all of the ſame ſubſtance? And may not divers people under one Prince, though they are divided in perſons,

yet be united in Lawes? and though they bee ſundred in Countries, yet be knit together in hearts, ſpecially if emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation cauſe no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, nor diſorder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, nor ſtrife miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, only with ſaving each mans honor, with continuance of each good cuſtome, and with furtherance and eſtabliſhing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of weale publique?</p>
            <p>The king is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

Parent, who by Vnion, <hi>non ſervos, ſed cives cogitat</hi>: and as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> was ſaid to be <hi>Rex omnibus idem</hi>; ſo would his Majeſty be <hi>idem om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi> one head to one body. Wherefore if hee deſire to unite the two kingdomes, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them one, and as one beloved ſonne (whoſe life is deare, and whoſe happineſſe joy to him) that all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as one ſonne, in common apparant uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93510:41"/>
might participate common patrimony of juſt Lawes for Weale publike, let none be ſo hardy (with the harlot in the daies of <hi>Solomon</hi>) to ſay to the King our common parent; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the childe, and cut it into two parts; leſt ſuch diviſion part that into two, which God in nature firſt made one: and now in his greater goodneſſe hath reſtored, in the royall perſon of our gracious

King into one: what God hath ſo joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, let no man put aſunder. For hereof may ariſe plaine incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, and fearefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, which may farther grow into confuſion and miſchief.</p>
            <p>Only I pray them, which object againſt the happy Vnion, to ſet before their eyes, and to conſider with their hearts, the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the divers people
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93510:42"/>
of the kingdome of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and the kingdome of Iudah: for albeit the two kingdomes were united in the perſon of <hi>David</hi> their king, yet for want of more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Vnion in lawes and love, there aroſe heart-burnings on both ſides: for Iſrael complained: The men of Iuda have ſtolne the king from us: and they of Iuda chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, that the king was nearer in blood to them, than to Iſrael:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93510:42"/>
and Iſrael againe reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they had ten parts in the king, and therefore had more right to him. But what in the end grew of this contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; emulation? conſider I pray, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and miſchiefe: there was not any one among the Tribes in the ſecond generation that followed the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> but <hi>Iuda</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Omen avertas Deus.</hi>

thither the Tribes goe up, and there the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples feet ſtand, even in the gates of Ieruſalem; which Ieruſalem is a City that is at unity in it ſelfe: at unity concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of religion, at unity in matters touching publike ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and government: therefore the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Pſalme 122. I was glad when they ſaid to me: We will goe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:93510:47"/>Laſtly, the exception taken againſt Vnion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Kings oath at his Coronation, which is never iterated, is grounded on the ſelfe ſame reaſon: as if it were alſo alleadged, that becauſe his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſweareth to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ancient and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall lawes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon circumſtance of time and occaſion he might not alter any Law: but let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93510:47"/>
Kings oath concerneth the Lawes and not the title, and we know the Lawes may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though the title be altered.</p>
            <p>And as for Subjects, I doubt not, but they may without danger, at the pleaſure of the King, ſweare their allegeance and doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and obedience after reſtitution of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, reformation of law, and Vnion of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:93510:48"/>And ancient Records doe no more leeſe their force by the change of England into Britaine, then by change of King IAMES into King CHARLES.</p>
            <p>And there is no more incertainty of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, inſtruments, and writs, than when a plaintife deceaſeth after ſeven yeares ſuite, his heire is put to begin, &amp; commence his ſuite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, &amp; in other name.</p>
            <p>The heart of objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93510:48"/>
againſt Vnion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing halfe broken, let us enter into the third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of matter of State inward, where is objected a poſsibility of alienation of the Crowne of England to the Crowne of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in caſe his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Line ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But bleſſed bee God, our gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne King is bleſſed with a plentifull iſſue, and hath yet much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope. And I hope
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93510:49"/>
(for which I pray night and day) that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties royall Iſſue ſhall not faile, ſo long as the Sun and Moone endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Nevertheleſſe, if ſome will not labour of the common bane of good wits, which is rather to diſpute, than obey; and rather to reaſon beyond reaſon, than yeeld to reaſon, (<hi>more magis quàm judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi>) they may herein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo eaſily anſwer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that in uniting
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93510:49"/>
the two kingdomes, the ſecond place in ſtile may be rather drawne to the next of blood in our Land, than the kingdome of England bee transferred to one farther off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Seem.</p>
            <p>Which thing, neither <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh nor <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the one ſeeking to marry his eldeſt daughter Lady <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> to King <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth of Scotland, hoping if his heire male
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93510:50"/>
failed, by that meanes to unite Scotland to England. And the other having his whole drift, to match his Sonne Prince <hi>Edward</hi> to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> foreſeeing in his providence the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable benefit of uniting the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: for which cauſe many of the Nobles of Scotland, gave faith to doe their beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. But it is a ſtrange doubt, and caſt beyond the Moone, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93510:50"/>
that Vnion of the two kingdomes doth ſo confound the State, and change the tenure, to bring it ſo into caſe of purchaſe, as it will neceſſarily ſubject Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to Scotland, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if his moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Majeſty, of his ſingular tenderneſs and love to this his Realme of England, be pleaſed to effect and eſtabliſh, that in caſe his Royall Iſſue (which Almighty God of his infinite
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93510:51"/>
mercy defend) ſhould faile, that then by this happy intended Vnion, the Realme of Scotland ſhould for ever be and continue indiſſolubly united, and annexed to the lawfull and rightfull inheritance, and ſucceſsion of the Crowne of England, in the blood royall of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now touching mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of State forreine, in anſwer to the firſt objection: I am well
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93510:51"/>
aſſured, that our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine affaires were at worſt in the opinion of all, at the deceaſe of our late Queen, and our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe utterly decaied with many Princes: ſo as we need a kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent renewing, which may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded as wel under title of King of all Britain, as of England.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond it is eaſily anſwered, that the King loſeth no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of place, as is imagined, ſpecially an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93510:52"/>
(as in the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions is alleadged) guiding it, and not greatneſſe. For the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to King <hi>Arthur</hi> of Britaine, will bee worthy in the opinion of the whole world, of better place, then King Egbert of England.</p>
            <p>To the third, that if the name of England (as is imagined) be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, the name of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and great Britain will be illuſtrate, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable in times paſt to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93510:52"/>
all the then knowne Nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>Touching matter of Honour, it is certaine and evident, that the name of England, though it hath beene worthily moſt famous and great, yet is not equall to the title of great Britaine, when England and Scotland are reunited, either by reaſon of honor, or of power. All Hiſtories remembring unto us, that the Britaines long
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93510:53"/>
time reſiſted the mighty force of Romaines, Lords, and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the world. And albeit ſome fathers can be content to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite their own daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to continue their names, (as is inferred in the objections) and therfore inforced, ſhold be much more in States, ſpecially where the name hath beene fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous: yet for my part, I account ſuch parents unkind and unnaturall,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93510:53"/>
where ſelf-love of their name, maketh them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get themſelves, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their owne fleſh. I will not urge here the law of God, of nature, and of moſt nations where daughters inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, &amp; names grow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. But this is a vaine reſpect only of name, wherof is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; to get a name on earth, and to think their name ſhould never be put out: whereas ſo many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ſo many people,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93510:54"/>
ſo many perſons, have either loſt or left their former name, and moſt willingly have been called by another name, <hi>Gaudet cognomine terra: (<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgil Eneid. lib.</hi> 6.) That countrey rejoyced to be called by a new name: how much more ſhould our Land imbrace this name of Britaine; and yet not new, but indeed his old proper name renewed, and as it were redivived and reſtored from the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93510:54"/>
dead. Or be it ſimply loſſe only of a bare tranſitory name; yet as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Chapter 56. ver. 3. Let not the Eunuch ſay, Behold, I am a dry tree, my name ſhall periſh with mee. Let us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regard that name which God promiſeth to them that ſerve him, ſaying, (<hi>Eſay</hi> 65. ver. 5.) Even unto them will I give in my houſe and within my pallaces, a place and a name better
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93510:55"/>
than of ſons and of daughters: I will give them an everlaſting name which ſhall not be put out.</p>
            <p>The argument of Oblivion deſerveth no anſwer, but ſilence and forgetfulneſſe: and yet I doubt not, but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous acts of Noble Engliſh men, will as well by Chronicle bee remembred to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the glory of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Britaine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord remaineth to this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93510:55"/>
day, neither will either be forgotten to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>The Stile of England now placed before Scotland, doth no way prejudice the Vnion by loſſe of precedency: for when all is one, there is no ſubſequence: onely Honor is due to him, who is to be honoured; and much honour to him, that is much to be honored: which thing in the Vnion may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily bee provided for,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93510:56"/>
and other pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the popular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to whom (as is objected) change of name will be harſh and unpleaſing, is in mine opinion a wrong done, and imputation laid upon the people, who I know (for the moſt part) being a wiſe nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and (I am ſure) moſt loving ſubjects to the Kings Majeſty, have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93510:56"/>
learned obedience and duty, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather joy in the content of their good and gacious King, then any way murmure at his demand: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Empire, (as <hi>Livie</hi> ſpeaketh) is <hi>firmiſsimum,</hi> when <hi>eo gaudent obedientes,</hi> who doubtleſſe with one voice and heart ſubmit themſelves, and ſay to their Soveraigne: <hi>Eſto nobis ſolus arbiter rerum jure, &amp; nomine regio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:93510:57"/>And as for Harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſtrange name, uſe will eaſily make it familiar. As <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Multa renaſcentur quae jam cecidere, cademque</l>
               <l>Quae nunc ſunt in honore vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabula, ſi volet uſus.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This pretended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing harſhneſſe is no more, than the nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a Virgin, who is as loth, and maketh it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93510:57"/>
dainty to leave her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward married to a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, taketh greateſt comfort in the name of her husband, in whom ſhee glorieth, and by whom ſhee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth all her world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joy. And yet need not England be ſo nice as if ſhe were a virgin, who like a widdow hath ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> changed her name: but may take pride, as widows do, to bee called by her moſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93510:58"/>
honourable and moſt glorious name.</p>
            <p>Thus having briefly run over the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and withall carried in open view in mine anſwer due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of evident utility, and urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, I will be bold with additions of more reaſons, yet a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to proceed in the perſwaſion of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired happy Vnion. God, alwaies bleſſed and to be honoured for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93510:58"/>
evermore, who is Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Vnity, and Vnity in Trinity, three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and but one God, doth by influence of his holy Spirit, give divers gifts and graces to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, of what country or condtion ſoever they be, &amp; governes them by holy Law, and uniteth them in the ſame faith, though diverſly ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Chriſtian world: that hereby the gods on earth,

whom he hath placed to rule over many and divers kingdomes upon earth, might learne by the ſame Lawes in things humane, and ſame religion in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters divine, to preſerve Weale publike, and Chriſtian Society a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men.</p>
            <p>But the ambition, and frowardneſſe of many, deſirous rather to be diſtracted into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers names and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and to be ruled by

divers lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, doe oft times hazard the Common good and peace of the Weale publike: where two kingdomes ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided under one Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, are not unlike the rich treaſures of pearle and gold, laid up in one Ship, by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of divers windes to be driven upon rocks with extreameſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: as is ſaid in <hi>Tully,</hi> of dividing and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing deſires into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall

parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in ſuch diverſities and differences: <hi>Hoc eſt diſsipare, &amp; non di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguere, frangere, &amp; non dividere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which thing is to be feared by not uniting, but keeping the two kingdomes ſtill in parts, when upon every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content in Scotland, as at a backe doore paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage may be given for a forreine enemy, ſoone to weaken a divided power: as <hi>Cyrus</hi> the

Perſian ſoone emptied that great and deep ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, otherwiſe unpaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his ſoldiers, by drawing it into divers channels. And why ſhould not we feare ſuch and greater evils, if as <hi>Virgil</hi> laid infamy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, calling us, <hi>toto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſos orbe Britannos:</hi> ſo we be content to adde greater infamy to our ſelves, and become <hi>toto in orbe diviſi,</hi> divided within our ſelves in the ſight and view of

the whole world?</p>
            <p>But I hope and wiſh for better things, that by Vnion in name of Britaines, we may leave to be any longer divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Engliſh and Scottiſh; as rivers of divers names meeting in the Sea, receive one and the ſame name: the rather, becauſe the elements of fire and water, of earth and aire, being of repugnant qualities, yet joyned in one body, doe agree in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93510:61"/>
one forme, as in a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> uniting and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them together: much more, divers kingdomes oft times heretofore at war and diſcord, yet now being united into one body, of one name and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, qualified by equall mixture, of Law, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Honors, Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and ſuch like, may be made perfect in one forme, and have a bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not as Engliſh and Scottiſh, but as Britains,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93510:62"/>
knit together in that third and renowned name: that the Maxime may be verified in us: <hi>Qua in aliquo tertio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniunt, optime conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſſe, that ſome lawes of ours may bee thought too ſtreight for them, and ſome liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theirs unfitting us: but let all be wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alike, pulling ſome up, and letting ſome downe, and in pleaſing harmony we ſhall find,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93510:62"/>
as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith: <hi>Commune &amp; aequabile inter omnes jus</hi>: where will be no ſtrife, as was betweene <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining and deceiving one the other of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and patrimony; but all love, and unity, and concord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as if all were not twins, but one man, even one heart in one body.</p>
            <p>And now if <hi>Iphicra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that valiant Leader were againe living, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93510:63"/>
asked, whether he were under the now imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Majeſty, this or that, Engliſh or Scottiſh, or among, or over them, an horſeman, an archer, or a Leader; he might truly anſwer, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he did in like caſe: No, not any of theſe, but I am he, who knoweth under him whom I ſerve, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and governe all theſe, as if they were but one man: <hi>Vnius Ducis imperium ſimul ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiunt

            </p>
            <p>So powerfull is the force of Vnion, that <hi>una Via</hi> being director, for law, and <hi>Cor unum</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former for obedience: the law enjoyning obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and obedience executing Law, the Prince cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

what the people will not obey: and the people will obey what the Prince commands, and Vnity among them will uphold all: <hi>Vnum imperii corpus unius ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo regendum videtur</hi>: &amp; ſo likewiſe, <hi>Ejuſdem ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris eſſe debent, qui ſub eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Rege victuri ſunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But rule of two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes without uniting them, is to give occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to either part to look backe for an olde grudge, <hi>Vbi antiqui odii

ſtrive to ſhake off the one, and to be weary of the other; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that equity and equability of like lawes to a divers people uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one, will make them (which otherwiſe feare ſervitude) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy freedome: and thoſe which ſeeme moſt free by former priviledges &amp; immunities, to feare ſervitude, if they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe their bounds: for ſuch Vnion and equity is <hi>communis cuſtodia, &amp;

There is between Engliſh, and Scottiſh ſmall, or no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, nay now none at all,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93510:78"/>
in union all being Britaines, not ſo much as between Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadites and Ephraimites in pronouncing Shibboleth, for Sibboleth, but all are of one language, and even of one <hi>Canaan language,</hi> only a little River Twede is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon limit, or rather ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary bound to both: and all from Twede Southward, is Britaine within Twede, and all from Twede North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is Britaine beyond Twede, yet both on this ſide, and that all but one Britaine (<hi>non nos mare ſeparat ingens, exiqua prohibemur aqua</hi>) as all France hath formerly been divided into two parts, the one beyond the Alps,

the other within the Alps: and all India Weſtward within the River Gange, and Eaſtward beyond Gange. And all Scithia within Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, and without Imaus.

wanted good Councell to adviſe them to marry toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo to make of both one kingdome of Britaine: and that only envious men, and they who neglected the Weale publique, did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this union of peace.

So was the ancient honour, and glory of great Britaine; great, and mighty, high to heaven, faire, and fruitfull, and of power over the whole Land from one end to the other: but the higheſt, who hath power over all, did (for the ſin of the inhabitants) hew downe this goodly tree; yet left the ſtumpe of the rootes in the earth. And out of it the tree is growne

up againe to former beauty, that we might learn to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the K. of heaven, as did <hi>Nebuchadneſar</hi> reſtored to the honor of his kingdome, to his glory, and beauty againe, to his Counſellors, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to the eſtabliſhment of his Throne with augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glory.</p>
            <p>And here let us now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate to all eternity the ancient name of famous great Britaine, as a Panthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all bleſſings in peace, proſperity, and honour: for as Pantheon was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at Rome, round, and like to the capacitie of heaven, wherein were put all the images of their gods.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93510:98"/>
So I ſay, in the name and ſtile of great Britaine, as in a Pantheon, are placed all worldly bleſſings, like Stars ſhining from heaven, and having their influence into the whole body of common weale, even <hi>perfection of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Superſtitious antiquity framed falſe Gods, one indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this vertue, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that: this a wiſe, that a warlike, and another a juſt God: yea, for ſo many vertues, they framed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goddeſſes, where one Temple might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to two goddeſſes, but diſtinct vertues muſt be worſhipped with diſtinct
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93510:98"/>
worſhip. So as <hi>Marcellus</hi> dedicating one and the ſame Temple to Honour, and Vertue, was thought to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt religion. But our happy, and better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed age, reducing all to one, truly to worſhip one true, and only God; ſo in civill things, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it offereth only one above and for all, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſeparate, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from it, may bee counted, as <hi>anathema,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, divorced, or <hi>as a barren handmaid to bee ſold to the Vſurer,</hi> unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, imperfect, or as it were, not at all.</p>
            <p>And now, as union into
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93510:99"/>
the name of great Britaine, is like a Pantheon, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth manifold abundant bleſſings meeting together, and concurring in one, ſo let us account our ſelves moſt bleſſed in our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne unitor King <hi>Iames,</hi> in whoſe Royall and princely Succeſſor, our gracious K. <hi>Charles,</hi> and his noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny, is laid up all our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and dwelleth all our happineſſe; even as that worthy <hi>Scipio,</hi> is ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be borne, that there might be one, in whom all vertue ſhould ſhew it ſelfe effectually, and abſolutely perfect: <hi>Hic eſt Scipio, quem dii immortales naſci voluerunt,

ut eſſet in quo ſe virtus per om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes numeros efficaciter oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the voice of truth it ſelfe; England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are ſo naturally united in the name of great Britain, that the one nearely allyed to the other, can no longer bee an alien, or ſtranger one to the other, except it may bee ſaid, that, <hi>Quia meus eſt, non eſt meus, ipſaque damno eſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi proximitas.</hi> So this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conjunction ſhould bee no union, becauſe it is both naturall in the Soile, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the Subject. But albeit the Romanes put into the Temple called Pantheon that precious gem named <hi>Vnio,</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:93510:100"/>
divided and cut in two, yet we with all our goods and geare, ought willingly be borne into the boſome of great Britaine, <hi>quae fundit in omnes imperium,</hi> not diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting union into parts, but knitting up all parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one, as <hi>Cicero's</hi> Oratour all ſciences, and <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> good man all vertues, as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> was counted like perfect in all vertues, or as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Plato</hi> ſealed up in man, the leſſer world, whatſoever vertue was in the whole world, or rather as <hi>Eden the plentifull garden of God ſealing up the ſumme of all perfection and glory, Ezek.</hi> 28. was fraight and deckt with <hi>all
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93510:100"/>
manner of precious ſtones, the Ruby, the Tapaze, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond, the Chryſolice, the Onix, and the Iaſper, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir, the Emerande, and the Carbuncle, and gold.</hi> Even now may it be ſaid of this univerſall name of Britaine, as it was ſaid of Rome. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii virtutumque omnium lar,</hi> and <hi>virtutum omnium latiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum templum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ancient time it was counted ominous, if a ſtone fell, or a dog came among brethren. And <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to curſe thoſe, who by ſelf-conceits, and head-ſtrong opinion attempted to ſet aſunder thoſe things which nature coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93510:101"/>
And now if any facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tribune of the people interpoſe himſelfe to divide us, and to diſturbe the peace of Iſrael, thinking there is good fiſhing in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that the honours, and benefits they hunt after, are attained in <hi>Perturbata Republica:</hi> whereof they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſpaire in a peaceable State, <hi>Quia in concordia ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num nullos ſe uſquam eſſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:</hi> verily ſuch are not unlike <hi>Medea,</hi> who ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed her brothers limmes, that they could not be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered againe: <hi>Cujus etiam vultu laeditu pietas:</hi> as the Mariners at Sea well obſerve in the two Stars <hi>Caſtor,</hi> and

            <p>The principality of Wales ſhall witneſſe this truth, which never received any thing any more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall for the people there, then uniting that Countrey to the crown &amp; kingdome of England. For whileſt it was alone without his brother, it was ſubject to ſtorme, full of contentions, war, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood, but joyned with his brother, it floriſhed with peace, and at this day is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93510:102"/>
bleſſed in the uniformity of government there eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And in mine opinion, it is well obſerved in the Chronicle of Wales, how God was not pleaſed with the firſt change of the name of Britaine into the name of England; for preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the terrible and cruell invaſion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and after that the conqueſt of the <hi>Normans.</hi> But memorable is it, that the Britaines ruled all the whole Iſle together, with the out Iſles of <hi>Wight, Men,</hi> in Engliſh <hi>Angliſee, Manaw,</hi> in Engliſh Man, Orkney, and Ewyſt, 1137. yeares before Chriſt, and after the yeare of his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93510:102"/>
688. even to the death of <hi>Cadwallader,</hi> the laſt King of Britaines, and of the noble race of Trojans. Which when in ſucceeding age many mighty and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Kings of England, conſidered, they laboured by all meanes to recover and reſume the name and ſtile of Kings of great Britaine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ccounting it diſhonorable, to leeſe any jot of the honour of their moſt princely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors. And therefore K. <hi>Knute,</hi> King of England, mighty in his dominions of Swethen, from Germany to the North poles, with Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and Denmarke, having obtained proſperous ſucceſs
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93510:103"/>
in warring againſt Scotland, is recorded after his death, the mightieſt Prince in the Weſt parts of the world, and of all the noble Iſle of Britaine. And ſo <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, for the good ſucceſſe he likewiſe had in Scotland, is recorded King of all Britaine; and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, ſurnamed <hi>Curtmantle,</hi> is alſo for like ſucceſſe, recorded King of all Britaine. And if they be renowned and honoured with name and ſtile of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, which by rightfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent or by conqueſt, were inheritours but to one part only, though by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in war, they alſo
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93510:103"/>
claimed the other; what rightfull title muſt we then acknowledge, moſt juſtly now to belong to his moſt excellent Majeſty, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall crowne of both, who by lineall deſcent inheriteth both.</p>
            <p>Here I wiſh I had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eyes as <hi>Argos,</hi> to looke into their deviſes, who ſeeke to divide England from Scotland, and Scotland from England, renouncing the name of great Britaine, leſt joyned in one, they might as the forenamed ſtars, appeare together, ſhine together, and bring joy together. I would then not ſpare to lay open, (as <hi>Cneius Flavius</hi> did reveal
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93510:104"/>
to the world the tricks and miſteries of Lawyers of that time, and therefore was ſaid to put out their eyes, and to cut their purſes) how alſo theſe Adamants hinder the naturall power, and vertue of the Load-ſtone: whom I call Adamants, aſwell for repugnant qualities, as that they be truly Adamants, even Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather in diſobedience, diſſention, and ruine of all, to lay hands upon that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, then to draw the Iron, nay golden chaine of linkes of love, in obedience to the King, and for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peace, and preſervation of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:93510:104"/>But herein ſuch imitate the deviſe of <hi>Q.

Such
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93510:105"/>
dividing into parts, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning of the parts, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, diſmembring, and by diſmembring, ſpoiling, making the ſtone <hi>Scyros,</hi> which whole and firmely compacted, doth ſwim and floate above the waters, to ſinke, and be drowned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is divided. But our two famous kingdomes with all their provinces, ſhires, and countries united into the name of great Britaine, are like the goodly and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant river <hi>Danubius,</hi> which paſſing by many Countries keepeth his name, till it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>Illiricum</hi>: where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving into it ſixty other ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of divers other names, leeſeth not only his owne

and all their other names of parts, but is called <hi>Iſter,</hi> one for all containing all.</p>
            <p>Here I require both of Engliſh and Scottiſh, is either of them now, as a people disjoynted one from the other? Or as Sand without Lime?

Nay here in the glory of great Britaine is renowned, that King <hi>Iames,</hi> with our gracious King <hi>Charles,</hi> and his Royall iſſue doe gather together that, which was ſcattered, and unite that,

            <p>It is not reaſonable that brethren from one parent,

ſhould be divided in one houſe, though they be ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in diſtinct place: but be as fingers to one hand, knit together by common joynts for mutuall offices: even as the brethren <hi>Molionides,</hi> are poetically imagined to have but one body: or rather the three <hi>Cerions,</hi> to have many bodies, but one ſoule, and one minde; not unlike to that of <hi>Pithagoras, Vt unum ex pluribus fiat,</hi> many in name, but one in deed. And as when <hi>Piſo</hi> was commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to poſterity for frugality, I doubt not, but he was wiſe withall; and as when <hi>Lelius</hi> was renowned for wiſdome, I doubt not but he was juſt

            <p>And as there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Idea, and infolded noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things in the minde of man, ſo the other viewing the whole race and tract of things in the world, doth tell us, that as many peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent properties, may be, and are in one man, and hee over them, as ſole Monarch over all the diverſities of worthieſt vertues; ſo a King under his Imperiall power
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93510:111"/>
hath to him ſubjected many ſhires, ſtates, cities, honors, provinces, and kingdomes, himſelf being ſole ſoveraign and Lord over all. Therefore though magnanimity onely, was attributed to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> only modeſty to <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> onely wiſdome to <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> skill to <hi>Philip,</hi> and boldneſſe to <hi>Braſidas:</hi> yet <hi>Alexander,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth, was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and full-fraight with all theſe.

a ſweet Orator, a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, to proſper in his greateſt affaires, to be in greateſt honour, of great wiſdome, a chiefe Senator, plentifull in children, rich of ſubſtance, and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in the City.

            <p>And now farther to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this union into both Nations, the rather, becauſe we are both alike under one head and governour: hath not his Majeſty two eyes, to reſpect both kingdomes; two eares, to heare alike the cauſe of both; two ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to beare alike the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and care of both; two hands, to diſtribute honours alike to both; and two feet, to goe one before the other, yet both alike to ſupport but one body? The inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity only is, if we are not alike dutifull, and thankfull;

neither doe we, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorteth, (Rom. 12.) <hi>Carry like mindes one towards another</hi>; nor make our ſelves in our owne conceits, equall to them of the lower ſort.

one the other; two hands, to catch, and ſnatch one from the other, or to carry fire in one hand, and water in the other, or to build with the one, and to pull downe with the other, or with the one to offer a gift, and with the other a ſtab; <hi>Altera ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu panem, altera lapidem</hi>; but that their eyes, eares, ſhoulders, feete, and hands are, or ſhould be mutuall helpers one to the other, for the common good, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſervice of the whole State.

Britaines will for publique Adminiſtration of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Weale, ſo ſee with their eyes, heare with their eares, beare up the head with their ſhoulders, and walke uprightly, <hi>Having pure, and cleane hands,</hi> that as the fingers in the hand are diſtinctly divided, and yet do clap, and claſp themſelves together, for more ſtrength; ſo all of command and in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority within great Britain, though they have diſtinct of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, yet will ſo concur, and agree together, that though there appeare among them, and their diſtinct publique ſervices, as, <hi>in digitis, diviſio,</hi> it ſhall not be, <hi>ab unitate prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſio.</hi>
