         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Ambaſſador, or Reſident ſent by the Parlament of <hi>England,</hi> call'd <hi>Anthonie Aſcham,</hi> arrived at the bay of <hi>Calis</hi> the 24 of <hi>March,</hi> 1650. with an Interpreter, and three or four ſervants, and not meeting there with the Duke of <hi>Medina Celi,</hi> hee went in queſt of him to the Port <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> and did let him know that hee was ſent by the <hi>Parlament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of an Agent to the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Duke lodg'd him thereupon, and according to his accuſtomed attention and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by which hee alwayes operate's, ſent to tell him, that in regard it was the firſt negotiation between <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Parlament</hi> of England, hee could do nothing in the buſineſs, till hee had firſt given an account to his Majeſtie, as hee did the 27 of March, which came to <hi>Madrid</hi> the ſecond of April, and the ſame daie the King referred the letter to his Council; and the fourth of April there was order ſent to the Duke, to treat him as <hi>Reſident,</hi> and ſee him convoi'd to the Court accordingly in ſafetie. The twentieth of April the Reſident (having been ſick before) began his journey, beeing accompanied by the Camp-Maſter D. <hi>Diego de Moreda,</hi> and the ſecond of June they came to <hi>Toledo,</hi> whence the Camp-Maſter ſent to the Court for further Order, and Order was ſent that hee ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his journey, and that the Reſident might take a Houſ where hee pleas'd in the Court: ſo they arriv'd at Court Sundaie following at five in the evening, and Munday next after, at ſix in the morning <hi>John Baptiſta Riva,</hi> who was (hee

ſayed a <hi>Genuës</hi> went in Company of a Servant of the Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, to <hi>Hieronymo de la Torre</hi> Knight of the Order of <hi>Calatra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and Secretarie of State, the ſaid <hi>Riva</hi> complain'd of the illneſs and incommoditie of the lodging: But when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and his train lighted at their lodging, 'twas obſerv'd there paſſed by ſom that went muffled, thereabouts, who were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-heard to ſay, <hi>Eſſos ſon,</hi> theſe are they: ſo <hi>Riva</hi> delivered the Secretarie two letters from the Parlament, ſaying that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident</hi> came under the protection of his Majeſtie. The Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie anſwered, they had don ill not to have given account at the verie point of their arrival, the Reſident beeing the perſon hee was, &amp; being in the <hi>Catholick</hi> Court hee was ſecure enough; and hee would advertiſ his Majeſtie of his coming accordingly, which hee did within a quarter of an hour, charging the Camp-Maſter's Servant, that hee ſhould tell his Maſter, to continue in aſſiſting the Reſident; but an hour and half before this, the fore-mentioned Delinquents, did proditoriouſly, out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſ malice, murther the ſaid <hi>Reſident,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta Riva,</hi> according to the circumſtances which ſhall follow. Now theſe men well knew, that the ſaid Reſident came to treat of peace, and they ſpontaneouſly confeſs they knew it, and that hee entred into this Court, by order from his Majeſtie, and with his paſſ-port; ſo that beſides, the treacherie and malice of the Act, they committed capital treaſon, <hi>Crimen laeſae majeſtatis in primo capite:</hi> now for everie offence, there is a correſponding puniſhment, and for this certainly there is undoubted pain of death; therefore they have made themſelvs unworthy of the immunitie of the Church, which they pretend.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs briefly doth branch it ſelf into two Articles.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The grievouſneſs of the delict is to be conſidered, and the qualitie of the perſon upon whom it was committed, one, who had a ſafe conduct from his Majeſtie, therefore it is <hi>crimen laeſae majeſtatis,</hi> and perpetrated in a moſt trecherous and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Church cannot give them Sanctuarie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pain of death is to be executed upon them according to the merit of the delict; in declaring the circumſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will leav all curioſities, and go to the pitch of the buſineſs,

hath, and alwaies hath had the pre-eminence of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of all other Princes.</p>
                  <p>Now that <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſtill be our friend, <hi>in ſtatu quo nunc,</hi> and that peace ſhould bee continued with her, proceed's from right, for peace is not only made with the <hi>King,</hi> but with the <hi>Kingdom alſo,</hi> and although the firſt exſpire's, the laſt remain's. For, put caſe that a peace be concluded with a Countrie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out including the King, either by careleſneſs, or ſom other accident, yet the peace ſtand's good, for ſo the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Magiſtates anſwered the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 2. <hi>Faltando el Rey, ſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervan con el reyno,</hi> the King failing, yet peace is to be conſerv'd with the Kingdom. So <hi>Bodin</hi> hold's, and urgeth a pregnant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to this purpoſe, <hi>lib. de Repub. cap. 4. fol.</hi> 63. where he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeth the anſwer, which the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> made to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, King of <hi>England,</hi> deſiring aid from <hi>France</hi> againſt ſom riſing Subjects of his, by virtue of the league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which anſwer was, that the <hi>King of France could not help him; for confederations twixt France and England, were made twixt the Kings and Kingdoms, ſo that though King Edward was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed thereof, yet the league and amity remain'd ſtill with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and with the King regnant.</hi> Juſt ſo the peace twixt the Kings and Kingdoms of <hi>Spain</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> though <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> the King, be wanting, yet it may be kept intire with the Kingdom: And his Majeſtie himſelf inſinuat's ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, continuing ſtill his Ambaſſador in <hi>England;</hi> for when a peace is eſtabliſhed twixt Kings and Kingdoms, people, perſons, and vaſſals, though the King fail, and the Kingdom receiv a differing form of government, yet the peace hold's good ſtill, becauſ it aim'd principally at the people and perſons of both Nations, and upon theſe terms, the peace was renewed twixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> 1630. as the French Mercurie relate's.</p>
                  <p>Therefore theſe Delinquents fail'd much in the foreſaid reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, due to the ſacred perſons of Ambaſſadors, as alſo to the ſafe conduct of his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, by laying violent hands upon his perſon much more by murthering him: <hi>Joab</hi> did treacherouſlie kill <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> who came with <hi>David's</hi> ſafe conduct, whereupon <hi>David</hi> ſaid to all the people that were about him, <hi>Scindite veſtimenta ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra,</hi>

                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:114986:6"/>
and reinforcing his ſorrow, <hi>levavit David vocem ſuam, &amp; flevit ſuper tumulum Abner, flevit autem &amp; omnis populus; David</hi> lifted up his voice upon <hi>Abner's</hi> tomb, and wept, yea, all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wept: Moreover <hi>David</hi> erected a tomb for <hi>Abner,</hi> beeing ſo treacherouſly kill'd, notwithſtanding that hee had his ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and the privilege of an Ambaſſador. The Romanes rais'd Statues to Ambaſſadors that were kill'd. <hi>Interfecto Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Statua debetur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beſoldus,</hi> through all his Chapter of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
                  <p>Moreover it is obſervable that <hi>David</hi> did not onely weep, but hee burſt out into this deprecation, <hi>ſi ante occaſum ſolis guſtavero panem vel aliud quidquam,</hi> If before the ſetting of the Sun, I taſte bread or anie thing elſ, &amp;c. Now, this ſorrow of <hi>David</hi> did much pleaſ the people, <hi>Populus audivit, &amp; placuerunt iis cuncta quae ſecerat Rex in conſpectu totius populi:</hi> as the holie text hath it, The people heard, and were pleas'd with everie thing that <hi>David</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>Here it is to bee obſerved, that the <hi>people</hi> were to bee ſatisfied herein; nor was a bare ſorrow onely ſatisfactorie for this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a due puniſhment muſt expiate the offence, which in regard that <hi>David</hi> himſelf could not do it in his life time, hee left it in charge to his ſon <hi>Solomon</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Facies ergò juxta ſapientiam tuam, &amp; effudit ſanguinem belli in pace;</hi> Thou ſhalt do according to thy own wiſdom (exaggerating his ſpeech with a reaſon) and hee ſhed the bloud of war in peace.</p>
                  <p>So his Catholick Majeſtie (God guard him) hath don out of a reſentment hee had of this treacherous murther, by recommending the buſineſs to ſo great a tribunal; <hi>Facie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ergò juxta ſapientiam veſtram, effudit ſanguinem belli in pace;</hi> proceed according to your own high prudence, by puniſhing theſe Delinquents, who have murtherd the Ambaſſador of the Parlament of England, though hee came with a Roial Paſport, and ſo ſhed the bloud of war in time of peace.</p>
                  <p>Moreover this death of the Ambaſſador, by hindering the procedure of his Embaſſie is no ſingle offence, but it reflect's upon manie. As the great Civilian ſaith; <hi>Si quis autem legatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem impedit, non unius, ſed multornm profectum avertit, &amp; ſicut mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114986:6"/>
                     <hi>nocet, à multis arguendus eſt.</hi> Whoſoever ſhall impede an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie, hee avert's not the benefit of one man, but of many, and as hee hurt's manie, ſo hee is to bee argued by manie. Now manie are the accuſers of theſe men, manie are interreſſed in the buſineſs, and moſt eſpecially the King, our Liege Lord, who gave a Paſsport, and allowed of the Ambaſſador, and of the Parlament of England that ſent him: Therefore theſe men had need to have manie lives to loſe, for to ſatisfie ſo manie whom the buſineſs concern's; ſo <hi>Magalotti</hi> hath it, that the puniſhment is to bee double, in regard of the perſons concern'd.</p>
                  <p>But hence may reſult a queſtion, whether the puniſhment bee to bee inflicted where the Delict was perpetrated, and the King's ſecuritie violated, or whether the murtherers bee to bee ſent to the Ambaſſador's Maſter, whom hee repreſent's: This was an old difference twixt <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Tacius,</hi> who reign'd together as <hi>Pedro Aerodo</hi> relate's the buſineſs briefly, yet elegantly. <hi>Romulus</hi> was of opinion that the Offenders were to bee ſent to the Ambaſſador's Maſter. But this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of the Offendor to the partie offended, was alwaies held to proceed rather from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanitie</hi> then <hi>juſtice,</hi> as it appear's in the caſe of <hi>Rincon</hi> and <hi>Fregoſo,</hi> which is amply related in the Annals of the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, it was a loud clamorous buſineſs, whereof all the corners of Chriſtendom did ring, and everie Chronicler hath it, therefore I will not moleſt you with ſo trite a thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tacius</hi> was of differing ſentiment; for hee would have the delict to bee puniſh'd where it was perpetrated, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which the Doctors give, is, becauſ the Lord of the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie is the more interreſſed, and obliged to puniſh the offence on the partie, to vindicate his own wrongs, as in this cauſ his Catholick Majeſtie is moſt injur'd, becauſ his roial Paſsport is violated, and why ſhould hee have recourſ to a forrein power, to deſire Juſtice, when by the Law of Nations hee may avenge the affront at home by his own. And it is moſt fitting they ſhould receiv puniſhment in this Court, rather then any where elſ, where in regard of the greatneſs of our King, there are continually ſo many Ambaſſadors reſiding, whoſe ſecuritie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114986:7"/>
may bee much confirmed by the exemplarie puniſhment of theſe Delinquents, and in particular, the verie Ambaſſadors of England themſelvs who are ſojourning here now, though op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites to the dead Ambaſſador, in regard of the diſſentions now in England, all which muſt bee don by a juſt infliction of puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>But the Delinquents think to ſcape by the immunities of the Church, where they fled, and ſheltered themſelvs from ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and atrocious a crime, aggravated by ſo manie circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by ſo manie Accuſers and intereſſed perſons; nor according to their defence, do they confeſs to have committed anie offence or ſin at all; but they vaunt to have performed an heroick act. Now 'tis a rule that <hi>Jactantia aggravat peccatum;</hi> boaſting of miſchief, make's the ſin the worſ. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <p>For proof of the ſecond Argument of our diſcourſ, <hi>viz. that hee who commit's a treacherous, or proditorious murther, cannot have the protection of the Church;</hi> the determination of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs <hi>Clement</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſhall ſerv, who ſaith, that <hi>not onely hee who kill's one proditoriouſly, but hee who kill's a reconciled enemie, is deprived of the benefit of Sanctuarie;</hi> Now theſe Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents deſtroi'd this Publick Miniſter of State <hi>per inſidias, appenſatè, animo deliberato, &amp; proditoriè,</hi> fraudulently, by forecaſt, with a deliberate minde, and proditoriouſly, therefore they are far from deſerving the ſhelter of the holie Church.</p>
                  <p>The ſacred Scripture take's us out of all doubt by the act of holie and religious <hi>Solomon,</hi> when in execution of the juſt commandement of <hi>David</hi> his father hee conſulted how to puniſh <hi>Joab</hi> for having ſlain <hi>Abner,</hi> who had <hi>David's</hi> ſafe Conduct, for which hee fled to the Church and to the altar, <hi>fugit ergò Joab in tabernaculum Domini &amp; apprehendit cornu altaris,</hi> and <hi>Banaias,</hi> who had the charge of executing him, returning with this news to <hi>Solomon,</hi> hee anſwered <hi>vade interfice eum,</hi> Go and kill him; <hi>Banaias</hi> going again to <hi>Joab,</hi> told him the King's command, and bid him com out, <hi>Joab</hi> replied, I will not com out, but I will die here; thereupon <hi>Banaias</hi> going back to <hi>Solomon</hi> to inform him what <hi>Joab</hi> had ſaid, the King rejoin'd: <hi>Fac ſicut locutus eſt &amp; interfice eum,</hi> do as hee hath ſaid and kill him. So <hi>Banaias</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jehoida</hi> went up to the altar, and aſſaulting <hi>Joab,</hi> hee kill'd him; Now 'tis a great queſtion among the <hi>Theologues</hi> whether <hi>Solomon</hi> ſinned in doing this: <hi>Abulenſis</hi> excuſeth him giving this reaſon; <hi>Quia non illi profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit tenuiſſe aram, quia nullum homicida inſidiator habet praeſidium,</hi> becauſ the altar could not profit him, in regard that no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous manſlayer hath anie protection; Add hereunto what <hi>Gaſpar Sanchez</hi> and <hi>Ruperto</hi> allege touching the ſame fact, <hi>nihil debet illi fides Altaris, qui per dolum occidendò proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:114986:8"/>
                     <hi>omnem fidem perdidit;</hi> The faith of the Altar oweth him nothing, who loſt all faith in ſlaying his neighbor feloniouſly. But <hi>Cajetan</hi> with others finde no way how to excuſe <hi>Solomon</hi> touching this buſineſs, in regard that hee might by his <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian troops,</hi> and veterane Souldiers have taken him both from the Altar and the Tabernacle, and ſo without anie note of violating Religion, hee might have diſpatch'd him in ſom prophane place, as the Prieſt <hi>Joiada</hi> commanded <hi>Athalia</hi> to bee taken out of the Temple, and kill'd without. This is a great and preciſe leſſon for the Lords <hi>Alcaldes,</hi> for they need not fear to put theſe men to death; in regard they are not now materially in the Church.</p>
                  <p>To prove the minor of the ſecond Syllogiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>theſe men did fraudulently, of ſet purpoſe, with a</hi> deliberate minde, and proditoriouſly murther the Ambaſſador of the Parlament of England ſhall bee thus prov'd.</p>
                  <p>Certain men eſpied the ſaid Ambaſſador, lighting at his lodging the ſame night hee came, the next daie <hi>William Spark,</hi> and <hi>Henry Progers</hi> (who is fled) ſpoke with <hi>John Baptiſta Riva</hi> the Ambaſſador's ſervant, and <hi>Henry</hi> going down, ſaid to <hi>William,</hi> let's go here below (where the other three Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents were) and ſaid, let's kill the Reſident for a deſtroier of our Nation; ſo they ſwore among themſelvs, that if one died, all would die with him in ſo heroick an act: whence this circumſtance may bee drawn, that this murther was committed by former conſultation, and with a deliberate minde: what is formerly related, is confeſſed by the Delinquents themſelvs, and that they came to perform this exploit two by two; for beeing com to the lodging, two remain'd at the foot of the ſtairs, two on the top, and two entred. <hi>William Spark</hi> went in firſt, ſeeing two ſitting at the Table, hee pulld off his hat, and ſaid, I kiſs your hands, which is the Reſident? and when they knew who hee was, <hi>Don John Guillim</hi> came, and ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by the hair, with a naked dagger hee gave him a thruſt that overthrew him; then came <hi>William Sparks,</hi> and gave him another, ſo that they gave him five ſtabs in all, <hi>John Baptiſta Riva</hi> thinking to retire to his chamber, there went four of them after him, and gave him four wounds, whereof
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114986:9"/>
hee preſently expired, whereby it appear's moſt evidently, that the murther of the Ambaſſador was committed, <hi>per inſidias, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſatè, animo deliberato, &amp; proditoriè,</hi> therefore the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not protect them. It was don <hi>proditoriouſly;</hi> in regard that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere eſt unum actibus oſtendere, &amp; aliud in mente gerere, unde homici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium proditorium est caedes hominis nibil tale ſuſpicantis,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtin Barboſa</hi> affirm's. Juſt ſo was <hi>Abner</hi> kil'd by <hi>Joab,</hi> according to the Text, he killed <hi>Abner</hi> in a diſhonourable way, <hi>viz. fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,</hi> when he ſpoke to him peaceably, therefore <hi>Joab</hi> deſerv'd to be depriv'd of the immunitie of the Temple; and juſt ſo was this Ambaſſador kill'd, and it may well bee thought, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv not the ſhelter of the Sanctuarie, <hi>as Joab</hi> did not.</p>
                  <p>But me think's I here the Delinquents, to extenuate their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lict, whiſper that they kill'd the ſaid Ambaſſador for an Heretick, for a diſturber of the publick peace, who particularly fomented the death of the King, and the change of gouernment, and they did operate this to vindicate the death of their King, upon a Regicide, an enemie to his Countrie, and on an Impoſtor. Moreover, one of the Delinquents ſaith, that in this rebellion hee kill'd a brother of his, with whom hee had particular enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to theſe arguments I may ſay, as <hi>John Garcia</hi> ſaid in his <hi>Gloſs. Nobilit. Adducuntar Leviuſcula quaedam argumenta quae meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tò ſubtaceri poterant, ſed ſatisfaciendum eſt doctis pariter ac indoctis.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain light arguments are alleged, which might have been ſpar'd, but wee muſt ſatisfie the unlearned, as well as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and concerning the firſt,</p>
                  <p>They ſay, they kill'd the Ambaſſador for an <hi>Heritick,</hi> ſo was their King, who they pretend hee had help'd to murther; but the Catholick Church never held yet, that it was lawfull to kill a man, only for his Religion; beſides this Ambaſſador had a royall paſs-port, and was attended all the way from the Sea-ſide by his Majeſtie's Servant; And Miniſters of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may have paſs-ports for their ſafetie as <hi>John Huſs</hi> had, and as <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperour gave <hi>Luther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſay, this Ambaſſador came to ſeduce and deceiv by a book of his which was found among his papers, and a medall which hee had, which had on the one ſide <hi>Nebart,</hi> and on the other XII. and the word <hi>Obſtricti,</hi> and they ſay it ſignifie's
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114986:9"/>
thoſe XII. which gain'd <hi>Nebart,</hi> and occaſion'd the warrs: Hence they inferr, that hee came to deceiv, there was alſo found a Crown ſtab'd with a poniard. This ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Joab</hi> propounded to <hi>David,</hi> when hee ſaid, <hi>Ignoras Abner filium Ner, quoniam ad hoc venit ad te, ut deciperet te, ut ſciret exitum tuum, &amp; introitum tuum, &amp; noſſe omnia quae agis,</hi> Thou know'ſt not <hi>Abner</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ner,</hi> for hee is com hither to deceiv thee, to know thy going out, and thy coming in, and to prie into all things thou do'ſt, as the ſacred Text tell's, but this could not excuſe <hi>Joab</hi> for killing <hi>Abner,</hi> who came hither all the way with a ſafe conduct, and it is the prerogative only of that Prince who gave him the ſafe conduct, to know the cauſe of his coming.</p>
                  <p>To com now to a concluſive point, and finall period of this plea, the puniſhment of theſe men for having fraudulently, by propenſe malice, with a deliberate mind, and proditoriouſly murthered the Ambaſſador of the Parlament of <hi>England,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the foregoing circumſtances, and by their own ſpontaneous confeſſions, I ſay the ſpeedy chaſtiſement of theſe men to death (notwithſtanding the depending proceſs, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immunitie of the Church) is required by ſix parties that are intereſſed therein. <hi>Viz.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, The King (whom God preſerve) require's ſpeedie execution, in regard ſom grave Doctors do doubt whither it was a ſin in <hi>David</hi> to delay the puniſhment of <hi>Joab</hi> till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, by bequeathing the execution of Juſtice to his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> as a legacie.</p>
