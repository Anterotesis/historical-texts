            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of all other insupportable exactions former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imposed, and this she did not without wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded reasons: For it is a cleer case that there is ingraven in the breasts of men by nature her self a detestation of slavery, and how unwillingly they put their necks into the yoke of another, specially when it becomes intolerable, when exorbitant exactions are imposed upon Subjects wherby they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extreme fits of desperateness. <hi>Ad extremum ruunt populi exitium, c√πm extrema onera iis imponuntur</hi>; People ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to extreme ruine, when extreme burdens are laid upon them, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> truly taught.</p>
            <p>Hence it came to passe, that in the royall City of <hi>Naples,</hi> that Masse of numberless pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with their families being among other ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells much aggriev'd for that upon <hi>fruits,</hi> and not being able to indure it, &amp; having made it often knowne unto the most excellent Lord the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> Vice-Roy of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by the public cries and lamentations of women and children, and the men of <hi>Lavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro,</hi> and other popular quarters, as he pass'd through the Market place to the devotion of the most holy Mother of Carmine in the Church of the Carmelites, situated along the said Market, and having petitioned him by the means of the most eminent Cardinal <hi>Filo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marino</hi> the Archbishop, and others, to take off
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57138:8"/>
the said gabell; upon a Sunday as his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy went to the said Church he heard a great buzz among the peeple, and little lesse then threatnings, presages of the following com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions which succeeded afterwards, and promising to take quite off the said gabell, he returned with such apprehensions of fear into the Palace, that he not only went no more to the <hi>Carmine,</hi> but he wold not suffer the most solemne Feast of S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which was us'd to be yeerly in Naples; and this was done of purpose for preventing such an infinite crue of people should not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble in one place.</p>
            <p>In the interim the peeple much grumbling and muttering that the promised grace was delayed, put fire one night to a baracca of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Market place where the said gabell was exacted, which was afterwards repair'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this had twice happen'd.</p>
            <p>There wanted not from day to day most pungent and bitter invectives full of popular grievances and of fiery protests against the public Officers, fixed up in the most public pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the City.</p>
            <p>This boldnesse increased afterwards, and with this boldnesse an envie upon the report that was had of the good success the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Palermo,</hi> and a good part of <hi>Sicilie, Messina</hi> excepted, had for their grivances by

            <p>The peeple of Naples being thus allur'd and incouraged by the example of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Kingdom, grew very envious to attain the same freedome, saying, And what? are we lesse then <hi>Palermo</hi>? is not our peeple perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture if they unite, more formidable and warlike? Have not we more reason far, being more burden'd and oppress'd? On, on to Armes, time is precious, 'tis not good to delay
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57138:9"/>
the enterprize, &amp;c. These, and like complaints made in divers Conventicles became now public: Whereupon the Lord Vice-Roy in high wisdome being very desirous to prevent mischiefs, caus'd the six Quarters or Precincts of the City to meet often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <hi>viz.</hi> The fifth part of the Gentry, and the sixt of the peeple, that by all meanes there might be wayes found out to take off that gabell or tax upon <hi>Fruits.</hi> Which designe though 'twas pleasing to all for the satisfaction of the peeple, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was prejudiciall to some of the Farmers, there were secret wayes found to hinder the happy effect of the said bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, but they went about to disswade the Vice-King from the accomplishment of his promise made to the peeple, and either to please him, or for their owne private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest (which is more probable) they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto him, that a few poore Tatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimalians had made all that noise: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they induc'd him to repaire the Toll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house for fruit that was burnt, which he did, but with a purpose to take it quite off, or find some temperate way to satisfie the discontented peeple on the one side, and the Napolitans, Nobles, Gentry and Merchants on the other side, who had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd upon the said gabell above six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57138:10"/>
thousand Crownes upon the account of the Capital million, and eighty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crownes of annuall rent.</p>
            <p>This way of temper was buzz'd abroad to be som new Tax that was to be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Corne and Wine; whereunto th'inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged peeple replied, and protested that they wold never give way thereunto, but they reiterated their instances to have the said gabell upon Fruits to be quite taken off, and not to put any other in compensation of it.</p>
            <p>As matters were thus perplex'd, behold, an occasion did suddenly present it selfe in an instant, the 7. of July, 1647. which made way to the totall execution of the desired purpose, as it shall be clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared very punctually from day to day, and that with as much fidelity and truth, as any pen can possibly promise upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

            <head>Sunday the 7. of Iuly, 1647. The first Day.</head>
            <p>A Young man about twenty four yeers old happen'd to be in a corner of the great Market place at Naples, a spritefull man, and pleasant, of a middle stature, black-ey'd, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lean then fat, having a small tuff of haire; he wore linnen slops, a blew wastcoat, and went barefoot, with a Mariners cap, but he was of a good countenance, stout and lively as could be, as the effects will shew. His professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to angle for little fish with a cane, hook and line, as also to buy fish, and to carry &amp; retail them to som that dwelt in his quarter; &amp; such men are called in Naples <hi>Pescivendoli.</hi> His name was <hi>Tomaso Anello</hi> of Amalfi, but vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly cal'd <hi>Masaniello</hi> by contraction. This man dwelt in the Market place, and under the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his house there were the Armes and name of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, very ancient, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left side of a fountain hard by, which might be attributed to a mysterious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage that he should renew, and set afoot, as he himself wold say often very pleasantly, the priviledges which that unconquer'd Monarque
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57138:11"/>
granted to the City and People of Naples. Besides there's a tru observation, and 'tis about a hundred yeers since, just in the yeer 1547. but in the moneth of May, as <hi>Iohn Antonio</hi> relates in the History of Naples<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> when there was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other commotion in the government of Don <hi>Petro de Toledo,</hi> by reason of the Tribunal of the holy Inquisition which <hi>Philip</hi> the second wold have introduced; another <hi>Masaniello,</hi> a Sorrentine and Bandito Captain was chief of that tumult. But although the Nobility was then joyn'd with the peeple, that subleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not very hurtfull, nor lasted any long time. And if such an union had now bin, so much ruine had not happen'd to King or peeple; for what greater contagion can there be to a City then a disunion 'twixt her inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants? What destroy'd Carthage? the two Factions of <hi>Barchiniani</hi> and <hi>Hanoniani:</hi> What maintain'd war in France for 60. yeers, but the dissention of the House of Burgundy and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans? What brought so much desolation to England<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and caused seven fearfull battells, wherein 80. Princes of the illustrious bloud were slain, but the faction of the Houses of Lancaster and York? And what ranvers'd and confounded the tranquillity of the Florentine Republic but the faction of the <hi>Bianchi</hi> and <hi>Neri</hi>? In summe, the same that a Fever is to a naturall body, the same is disunion in a City
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57138:11"/>
or Kingdom. A City is a ship, and divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the leaks, through which, while the Mariners fight one with the other, the water enters and drownes all: The wise Pilot who steers ought to stop those leaks, and make up the breaches of division, and reserve himself without trusting any other for the helm, and specially not to place there any capricious heads, or factious spirits, and to be sure to keep himself still Lord and Patron of the vessell.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Masaniello</hi> out of a kind of naturall craft having observed the murmurings up and down the Citie, took hold of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occasion.</p>
            <p>One day (which was some four days before the most holy Feast of <hi>Corpus Domini</hi>) he went very angry towards his house, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by a Church where the famous Bandito <hi>Perrone</hi> had fled for refuge with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his, being ask'd by these, what ayl'd him? he answered in great choler, I will be bound to be hang'd, but I will right this City; they laugh'd at his words, saying, a proper Squire to right the City of Naples, <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niello</hi> replied, Do not laugh, I swear by God, if I had two or three of my humor, you shold see what I could do: What wold you do? (said they) he answered, Will you joyne with me? why not? answered they; give me
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57138:12"/>
then your faith, replied <hi>Masaniello,</hi> and you shall see what we we have to do, so they having plighted their faith unto him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>A little after he fell into a great choler, because his fish was taken from him by som of the Court, because he had not payed the gabell, he thought then to make use of the occasion of the murmurings the peeple had then for the gabell upon <hi>fruit,</hi> and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Perrone</hi> he went up and downe the fruit-shops that were in that quarter, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising them that the next day they shold com all united to the Market with a resolution to tell the Countrey-Fruiterers that they wold buy no more gabell'd fruit.</p>
            <p>In the interim that this noise diffus'd it self up and down the shops, the <hi>Elect</hi> of the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Andreas Anaclerio</hi> being chosen that very day, betook himselfe to the Market place where the fruits were distributed to the shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, they cryed out, they wold buy no gabell'd fruit, the <hi>Elect</hi> perswaded that at that time the gabell should be payed, and it shold be speedily taken off, so the tumult ceased for that time. <hi>Masaniello</hi> seeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was don then, he went up and down those quarters, crying, <hi>avant gabell, avant gabell,</hi> for which som laugh'd at him, but others consider'd well of his words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57138:12"/>Moreover, about this time a great number of boyes being gathered together in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place he told them, say as I do, Two tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses, to wit a baiocco for a measure of oyle, six and thirty ounces the loaf of bread, two and twenty the pound of cheese, six granas for beef, six granas for pulse, nine granas for veal, four granas the Greek, two granas the pinte of wine; these words he made them repeat divers times, and being taught and bearing them in memory they cried them up and down all the City, and in the face of the Vice-Roy, for then there was payed for every thing as <hi>Masaniello</hi> had taught the children. Besides, he gave them another lesson, which was this: <hi>Viva Dio, viva la Madonna del Carmine, viva il Papa, viva il Re di'Spagna, e la Grasica, e muora, muora il mal governo.</hi> Let Let God live, let the Lady of Carmine live, let the Pope live, let the King of Spain and Grasica live, and let the ill goverment die, let the ill goverment die. This and such like Doctrines being taught by <hi>Masaniello</hi> to his Schollers, and cried up and downe; caus'd much laughter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>nd jeering at the Master, they held him to be mad and foolish; but he told them, ye laugh at me now, but you shall see shortly what <hi>Masaniello</hi> can do, let me alone, if I do not free you from so many slaveries, let me be held infamous for ever, which words
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57138:13"/>
increased their laughter the more. But he not caring for that, tended his businesse, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he inrolled such a number of those boyes 'twixt seventeen and sixteen yeers old, that they came to be five hundred, and at last two thousand, insomuch that he could not only, make a Company, but whole Regiments: He thus prepar'd them against the great feast of our Lady of <hi>Carmine,</hi> which was neer, of which <hi>Militia</hi> he made himself Generall, giving every one of them in their hands a little weak cane.</p>
            <p>The seventh day of July being come, which was a Sunday, upon which day the Festival of our <hi>Lady of Grace</hi> was us'd to be in a Chappell hard by, and commonly the feast was made by all the boyes and common peeple about the Market, with the meaner sort of the dwellers in the neighboring quarters, they erected there according to custom a castle of wood, which was to be battered with sticks and fruit, upon this occasion there assembled there abundance of peeple of the meaner sort, and although the houre was com that fruits were us'd to be brought to the Market to pay gabell, and the boyes us'd to be there to gather such fruit that fell upon the streets; but it chanc'd there came no fruit at all, because the shop-keepers had mutined and agreed not to buy any fruit, of purpose not to pay the gabell, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57138:13"/>
they were used to do, telling the Fruiterers, that they shold pay the gabell if they wold, for the Shopkeepers wold pay none: this see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming very strange, they came from words to blowes with the Shopkeepers: And in regard of this difference there was no fruit then in the market which were fresh, but a few of the day before; A tumult did arise among the peeple, which being told the Lord <hi>Zufia Grassi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ro</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the City, he ordered the forenamed <hi>Anaclerio</hi> the Elect of the peeple, that he shold apply himself to remedy that commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which he attempted to do, but all in vain, in regard of the first and obstinate quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell that was 'twixt the Fruiterers and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing Shopkeepers; wherefore the <hi>Elect,</hi> not to displease the peeple and Shopkeepers, gave sentence against the Fruiterers as Forreners, (most part of whom were of the City of Puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuolo) reviling them with words, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to bastinado them, and have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Gallies.</p>
            <p>Among those of Puzzolo there was a cosen of <hi>Massianello's,</hi> who, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions given him, began more then any to incite the peeple, who seeing that he could sell his fruit but at a low price, and after he had payed the Gabell, there was scarce left as much as would pay for the Barque and quit cost, he flew into such a rage, that throwing two great
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57138:14"/>
baskets upon the ground, he cried out, <hi>God gives plenty, and the ill government a dearth</hi>; therefore I care not a straw for this fruit, let every one take of it. The boyes eagerly ran to gather and eat the fruit. <hi>Masaniello,</hi> all this falling out according to his expectation, rush'd in among them, crying out, <hi>Without Gabell, Without Gabell.</hi> But <hi>Anaclerio</hi> threatning him with whipping and the Gallies, not onely the Fruiterers, but all the peeple threw Figs, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and other fruits in great fury into his face. But this seeming but little to <hi>Masaniello,</hi> he hit him upon the brest with a stone, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his militia of boyes to do as he did; which they did: But <hi>Anaclerio</hi> breaking through the crowd in a coach, made hast to the Church of Carmine, where finding a fellu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, he imbark'd himself therein, and so got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pallace, otherwise he had been torn in peeces, or ston'd to death by the boyes.</p>
            <p>Upon this success the people flocking in greater numbers as well in the said Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, as else-where, they began to exclaime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud against those intolerable grievances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they groan'd; so a mighty rumor ran up and down the streets protesting to pay no more gabell, and crying out, Let th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>King of Spain live, but let the ill Government die</hi>: The fury still increasing, <hi>Masaniello</hi> being follow'd by an infinite company of boyes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57138:14"/>
and all sorts of loose people, som with sticks, others with pikes and partizans taken from the Tower of the <hi>Carmine,</hi> he leap'd up upon the highest table which was among the Fruiterers, and with a loud voice cryed, <hi>Be merry dear companions and brothers, give God thanks, and to the glorious Virgin of</hi> Carmine, <hi>that the hour of your redemption drawes neer; this poor bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed fellow as another</hi> Moses, <hi>who freed the Israelites from</hi> Pharoahs <hi>rod, shall in that manner redeem you of all gabells, from the first time that they were ever imposed: A Fisherman, who was</hi> Peter, <hi>reduc'd with his voice from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans slavery to the liberty of Christ Rome her self, and with Rome a world: Now, another Fisherman, who is</hi> Masaniello, <hi>shall release Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and with Naples a whole kingdom, from the tyranny of Gabells.

from one street to the other, they came at last to St. <hi>Iames</hi> his prison, where freeing all the prisoners they admitted them to their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>But being com before the Palace and under the window of the Viceroy, they began to cry out amain, that they wold not be freed of the fruit-gabell only, but of all other, specially that of corn. Hereupon the Viceroy came out into the Balcone, and told them that the said gabell shold be abolish'd, and part of the corn gabell also: but the peeple bawl'd still that they wold not be releev'd <hi>in part,</hi> they wold have the whole taken off, yet they cryed out <hi>may the King of Spain live,</hi> and the ill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment die: And a good nomber of them thinking to go up the stairs of the Palace to notifie unto the Vice-roy the rest of their grievances, his Excellency commanded the German and Spanish gard that they shold not stir, but suffer them to passe and repasse freely, nerethelesse the Viceroy being not altogether obey'd, because he was not heard by them, som resistance was made by the soldiers but the peeple with canes, and clubs only (a thing incredible to beleeve) and with huge cries made their entrance demanding audience of the Viceroy, but he was got away, and they did so revile and affront the Dutch and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish gard who were at the gate, that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57138:16"/>
their ports, and took a fair pair of heels to their quarters: Thereupon the peeple entred the Palace, and being com to the Hall dore though shut they burst it open, entring there without any rub, then they wold have entred into the great Chamber, but a gard of Dutch and Halbardeers were there, as also som Spaniards who did what they could to resist their entrance, but all in vain, because the peeple still thrusting on they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to yeeld their halbards and other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; Then going on at leasure they found easy entrance into all the rest of the rooms, untill they came to the last chamber where the Viceroy was hid in a closet, and though they found the dore doubly bolted, yet by force of halbards and other instruments they forc'd their passage, and the Viceroy hardly scap'd killing, but the Duke di Castel <hi>di Sangro</hi> Don <hi>Ferrant Corraciolo</hi> convey'd him away and so sav'd him from the mortall blow which was intended. The Viceroy with a few gentlemen that were about him finding they were not secure there, thought good to retire into the Castle, where the Dutchesse of <hi>Arcos</hi> had withdrawn her self a little before with her Ladies, children and kinred; but understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at that houre that the Ladies had taken up the draw bridg, the Viceroy took a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to sly into the next Church dedicated to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57138:17"/>
St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> where there was a Friery of Saint <hi>Francisco de Paola,</hi> but he wold first spie out of a window where the grosse of the peeple was, to let them know that he was willing to give them content, dispersing little cedules up and down to that purpose sign'd by himself, and seal'd with the Kings seal, wherein he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely took off the gabel of fruit, and part of that of corn; But the peeple being not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied hereat, they made signes with their hands, and cryed aloud that he wold come down and speak with them face to face; Hereupon the Vice-Roy went unto them to take off all ombrages of distrust.</p>
            <p>In the mean time that part of the peeple which remain'd in the Palace ran up and down with much fury, they sack'd the chambers ev'ry where, putting fire to the Sedans, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cones, Tables, Travesses, Windows, Scrines, and every thing they found, yet they wold not meddle (which was a thing to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at in the middle of such a fury) with the quarter of the most eminent Cardinal <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nultio,</hi> who dwelt in the same Palace.</p>
            <p>The Vice-Roy being com down to the rabble rout procur'd to put himself in a Coach with two horses, and to secure himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the said St. <hi>Lewis</hi> Church, and he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready got into the Coach, but many of the peeple spying him they stayed the Coach, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57138:17"/>
opening it with two naked swords in hand, they threatned him unlesse he wold take off the gabells, he promis'd he wold if they wold be quiet, but this wold not serve the turn unlesse he came out of the Coach and shew himself to the peeple, which he did, and then some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect was shewn him, and som kiss'd his hands, and upon their knees cryed out most excellent Sir, <hi>for the love of God disburden us once of these gabells, let us have no more slavery, let us breath,</hi> His Excellence having confirmed unto them their request, was devising how to get from out of their hands, for although he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor'd by many, yet he held himself not secure in such a confus'd multitude; Therefore to divert the peeple, he threw among them som hundred of Zecchins of gold which he carried about him for that purpose, this took good effect, though many cryed out aloud we have no need to be releev'd with a little money, but to freed from the gabell, but while most of them were greedy to take up the gold, his Excellence got safe and sound into the said Church where he caus'd all the dores to be shut, and of the Monastery also.</p>
            <p>The peeple perceaving this, and being much disdain'd that the Vice-Roy had scap'd from their hands, they went incontinently to the said Monastery, and the first great gate being batterd down they thought to do so to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57138:18"/>
rest, crying out still to be released of the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, therefore they desir'd his Excellence wold consign them a paper in writing under his hand and seal, wherein he shold promise so to do: And because the peeple should not passe further to do violence to the Monastery notwithstanding that they still increas'd, he look'd on them from a window, and desir'd them to be quiet, for he was dispos'd and ready to content them; but because the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous multitude had a conceit still fix'd in them that they shold be deluded, they went still on to batter down the other gate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they immediatly entred the Monastery. While businesse was carried thus, the most eminent Bishop <hi>Filomarine,</hi> who being very zealous in his pastorall charge shew'd often to his Excellence for the service of God and his Church, endeavour'd to appease the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the avoiding of those irrecoverable losses which by his high wisdom and perspica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wit he saw hanging or'e the Citty: Hereupon he made a sign unto them with his hand, that they wold be quiet; but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that they wold have the instrument for release of the gabells from the Vice-Roy, specially those upon corn and fruits, his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence answer'd them, that he wold make it his care to obtain it, and so going out of his Coach he went in person to the second gate of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57138:18"/>
the Monastery, to hinder the pulling of it down by the furious rabble, and he had his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for out of the great reverence they bore to their Archbishop the fury ceas'd, but still they prayed that the gabells might be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd; the Bishop promis'd to bring them the Instrument sign'd and seal'd, but least if he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from among the peeple the fury wold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comence, he sent to that purpose to the Vice-Roy being not able to com himself to mingle speech with him, that he wold send him the said Instrument, which he did, desiring him to deliver it with his own hands to the peeple: The Bishop having receav'd the said written Instrument coach'd himself, and shew'd it to all the peeple which he drew after him all along Toledo street, ev'ry one being greedy to know what it contain'd: but what? The said written Instrument was no sooner read with a loud voice by the Bishop, but the peeple cryed out again that they were cheated, for that Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contain'd only the taking of the fruit-gabell, and seven Carlins upon wheat, but they wold have divers other gabells to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish'd: The Bishop having delivered that written Instrument to the <hi>Capo del popolo</hi> to the chief of the peeple, retir'd to the Palace peaceably.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the peeple ran to the great Market place to give notice of the said Bill to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57138:19"/>
the rest who were met there more in nomber then they; and finding that this was but sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in part, it was necessary for the common defence of the <hi>faithfull peeple of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> to inroll som arm'd men to procure to a totall discharge of gabells: And many returning to the Palace, thousands of men and boyes, they wold have again have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted an entrance into the Church and Monastery of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and being resolv'd to burst ope the dores of that part, where divers Lords and Ladies were, the Spanish soldiers oppos'd them, and in particular one very vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Captain entertain'd the rabble with his sword, and the soldiers with their Musquets till divers of them were killd, but in the mean while the Ladies had time to retire into the Fryers cells, and the Vice-Roy by the help of the Abbot of the Convent scald the walls till he came to <hi>pizzo fulcane</hi> into the Monast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of Jesuits, whence putting himself in an old Sedan carried by Spaniards, he transferr'd himself to the Castle of St. <hi>Elmo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon it being known for certain that the Vice-Roy was gon from the Monastery, the peeple returning to the Palace resolv'd to disarm all the Spaniards who were there in gard, but they deliver'd them drums and half pikes, and all other instruments their swords and Muskets excepted; They went to all the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57138:19"/>
other Courts of gards dispers'd up &amp; down the City; disarming all whom they met withal; Then went they to the Suburbs of <hi>Chiagia</hi> to the Palace of <hi>Don Tiberio de Caraffa</hi> Prince of <hi>Bisignano</hi> who was Field master, and Colonel General of the Battalion of Naples; desiring that great Cavalier, who by his innated benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity had made himself belov'd of all, and to be ador'd also by all Naples; they desir'd that he wold be pleas'd to be their Defender, and an intercessor 'twixt them and the Viceroy for a totall extinguishment of the Gabells, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the favourable priviledges granted them, specially by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth: As they were expecting the Prince of Bisignano, som of them going to the place where they exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gabell of fruit at Chaggia; they put fire to the house, and burnt every thing that was in't, as they had don in other places: And the rabble still augmenting in that most popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous suburb, they divided themselves into two Squadrons, or rather into two Armies: The lesser sort of boyes did put in the middle the foresaid Prince who was a horseback, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring them to be orderly, he sayed, let's go to take off the Gabells, being conducted by the palace, and so along the Castle, and thence through all the popular places till they came to the great market: The Prince seeing there the peeple wonderfully increas'd to above
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57138:20"/>
fifty thousand persons, he endeavoured to quiet them; and to do this the more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, he went to the Church of the most holy Lady of Carmine, which is situate in that place; and being got up in a high place, with a crucifix in his hands, he prayed, exhorted, and conjur'd the peeple for the love of God, and of the most blessed Virgin his Divota, to be quiet a while, promising them by oath to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the Viceroy what they desir'd: But finding that all this wold do no good, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd himself a while in that market, to have the more opportunity to negotiate with the cape leaders of the peeple, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to a good accord, assuring that he wold make it his own task to procure them complete satisfaction. In the mean time many other new recruits of peeple coming from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the City, they went to break o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the prison of <hi>Santa Maria d'Agnone,</hi> and of <hi>S. Archangelo</hi>; whose gards not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to resist, were necessitated to yeeld and flie for't; the gates being thrown into the midst of the streets, they made all prisoners go out, burning and turning to ashes all the Books and Processes of prisoners which were found in the Offices. The same they did in the prisons for the arts of wooll and silk, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that of the Archbishops, the Nuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, and of the great Court of the Vicaria, to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57138:20"/>
which two last they sayed to beare reverence as to royall prisons, and because they had been in times pass'd Kings palaces; the sayed Prince being their protector, and being come neer those prisons, 'twas fear'd they wold do som mischief; but the Warders had time enough to fortifie and strengthen their gates, besides som being earnest for it, were disswaded by the Prince of <hi>Bisignano,</hi> that setting them at liberty being all foreners, murtherers and theeves, they would draw upon themselves great inconveniences.</p>
            <p>They steer'd their course towards the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gana or toll-house for corn, with fagots on their backs, and fire and pitch in their hands, and the gates being wrench'd, the sayed Prince being not able to take them off, though he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured earnestly, they entered there with such a fury, that they put fire on all sides; nor were they satisfied till they saw all not onely burnt, but reduced to ashes; as much corn, with great store of houshold-stuff, and much money, which the Ministers of the Dogana had in bank, being either their own, or <hi>in deposito,</hi> or pawn'd, all was consum'd in the flames.</p>
            <p>This sacrifice being perform'd, they went up to the piazza of <hi>S. Laurence</hi> Church, the Prince not leaving their company all the while, in regard of the violent desire he had by degrees to quiet and o'recome them;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57138:21"/>
but being com thither, and entred through the Church into the Cloysters to go up to the steeple Tower to sound the great bell, that all men shold put themselfes in arms; The entrance was at first denied them by som who had fled thither for sanctuary, who fear'd they had com to find them out, but two of them were presently kill'd. Now, som of the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple began to apprehend divers fears; but there was among them a Sicilian, who (as a person of good credit affirms that was there present) appear'd to be rather a Devill in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane shape, and one of the greatest Furies that hell could have: 'Tis incredible with what boldnesse and with what ardor this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low animated all to battail, he reproach'd them of their fears, he jeer'd their cowardize, he call'd them Cravens, Geese, Hens, and poor spirited men; truly, the body and tongue of that wretch seem'd to be possess'd by a whole Legion of Devills: but the justice of heaven found him out, for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The said Prince finding himself weary after so many hours, and after so much mischief don to the City, and being weak in regard of an infirmity which he had, and growne fainty by reason of the heat of the season, and half choak'd by the swarmes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

rabble about him, and casting about how to disingage himself from the Labyrinth of that popular tumult, by a wise stratagem he distributed the said peeple into divers quarters of the City, with strict prohibition that they shold not sack nor assault any ones house: And his plot took; for being thus divided, he might retire afterwards when he pleas'd to a kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans house of his hard by, whence having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh'd his spirits a while there, he betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self about the evening in a close Sedan into Castel nuovo, blessing God that he found himself free from the tempestuous gulf of of that implacable peeple.</p>
            <p>The report afterward being dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad of the retirement of the Prince <hi>Bisigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and the peeple finding themselfs without a head, cried out for their leader and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Masaniello,</hi> who accepting of that charge began more then ever by sound of Drum to suscitat the peeple through all the City and Suburbs: But for the evident danger of the infinite hurt that was like to ensue, specially the day beginning already to darken, and night to approach, 'twas thought fitting that som religious men shold go out in procession through the City, not onely to appease the unbridled peeple, but to implore divine help: The first were the most reverend Fathers the Teatins, out of two of those six Churches

            <p>The Vice-Roy and the whole Nobility doubting that the rabble of the peeple which elsewhere were increasing in great nombers, shold go to St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Church, and seize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers things which belong to the City, and among the rest of sixteen pieces of Ordnance, and other Arms kept in the Tower of that Church, besides the sounding of the great bell to arms which hangs in the steeple of that Church, and which useth to ring upon such occasion, therefore there were sent thither som Compagnies of Spaniards well arm'd, as also others for the gard of the said Church and Cloyster of S. <hi>Laurence.</hi>

Inhabitants, who were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards numbred, in regard their bodies remain'd many days unburied: This success happen'd at <hi>Porta della Calce del molo picciolo,</hi> and it caus'd such an Earthquake, and so fierce a one, through all the City, that 'twas like that terrible shake which divers weeks before that great <hi>Galeon</hi> made, which was burnt, being not known to this day whether 'twas by chance, or pure malice, in the very Port of <hi>Nables.</hi> But they were not a whit disheartened at this disaster, but going to the Kings powder house out of the City, towards <hi>Cap de Chino,</hi> in greater numbers then before, they went about to seaze upon all that Magazin of powder, had they not been prevented by the Labourers, who had put the said powder in water
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57138:25"/>
for hindrance of the like mischance that happen'd in the Port <hi>della Calce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the peeple made all these preparatifs the Viceroy was not wanting by his wonded pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to acquit himself exactly of his duty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was retir'd into <hi>Castel nuovo</hi> with <hi>Spaniards,</hi> dispers'd up and down for gards all along that Castle, and in St <hi>Francisco Xaverio's</hi> street to the number of 400. He shut up in the Royal Palace for his gard 1000. <hi>Almanes,</hi> and at the gates 800. <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with 1000. <hi>Italians.</hi> He fenc'd all <hi>Pizzofalcone,</hi> which lieth above the Palace, and all the neighbouring streets with good Fortifications, making Ramparts of faggots, and raising other Trenches of earth about the gates of the old and new Palace, and at the end of the street looking towards the said Palaces. He comanded a great Peece of Ordinance to be put at the end of every street towards the <hi>Stanto Spirito,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and the Father <hi>Minimes,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the Cross of the Palace, another upon the assent of <hi>Santa Lucia,</hi> and two before the great gate towards the middle of the new Palace. And because the peeple knew there came a new Regiment of Germanes from <hi>Pozzolo</hi> by Order of the Viceroy, they went to meet them, and kill'd part who made resistance, and the rest who will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly render'd themselfs were made prisoners, all bound and lead into the City: The like was don to two Companies of <hi>Italians,</hi> but by order
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57138:25"/>
of <hi>Masaniello</hi> they were releas'd, and arm'd for the defence of the City, and he sent the Germanes to the Viceroy into the Castle all loaden with bread, fresh and salt meats, cheese and wine, with other comodities; and 'twas a pretty sight to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, that peeple go along the street dancing with meat in their hands, and bottles at their mouths, making mows all along.</p>
            <p>It happen'd upon Munday morning, that the Spanish gard, for som insolences they had receavd imprison'd two mean fellows, and the peeple fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they should be executed, they rise up in such a manner, that by Archibuz and Muschet shots hurting many, and killing som of the said gard, they threatned, with howlings, and unusual schriches, to tear in peeces all the Spaniards which were in <hi>Naples,</hi> if those prisoners were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them; wherefore to avoyd such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience which certainly had happen'd, they were yeelded up safe, sound and free.</p>
            <p>That morning bread of a very hansom fashion, and of unusual weight, was sold, insomuch that wheras before a loaf of bread was but little more then 22. ounces, 'twas now 11. ounces more, in all 33. Therefore one may well conjecture what joy the peeple conceav'd at that: All peeple, both men, women and children, Citizens and strangers, went crying up and down the streets; <hi>Let the King of Spain live, let the most faithful peeple of Naples live; let Grassa, let Grassa live, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57138:26"/>
let the ill Government dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seem'd expedient for the Viceroy, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd as was said before into the Castle <hi>nuovo</hi> to dispatch that Munday morning, by som Lords of the Collateral Councel, and others of the Councel of State, a Note unto <hi>Masaniello,</hi> who was then Cape or Head of the peeple, wherein he granted as much as was demanded the day before, which was the taking away of all kind of Gabells: But the peeple wold not be satisfied with this, but sent to tell him, that they wold have further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, <hi>viz.</hi> a Restitution of the priviledge granted them by King <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> and <hi>Frederic,</hi> and by the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> the fift, all which by a public Act, the Viceroy, the Collateral, and Councel of State, with all the Nobility, shold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige themselves to observe.</p>
            <p>They wold that the Votes of the Gentlemen of the Piazza's shold equal them of the peeple: That the peeple shold nominat the chief Clark of the Market or Grassiero of the City, all which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd; and mean time there was chosen by the peeple the Lord <hi>Cornelio Spinola</hi> for Grassiero. It shold pass for a Law, that never any new Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells for the future shold be impos'd without the intervention of the <hi>Capo popolo,</hi> who shold be a Lord by Title, as it was anciently, when the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> was <hi>Capo popolo</hi>; That he shold be nam'd by the peeple, and the <hi>Elect</hi> likewise made by the <hi>Capistrada</hi> to be all chosen by the peeple,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57138:26"/>
without any dependency, or having any recourse to the Viceroys for the future.</p>
            <p>They stuck not to demand, that the Castle of <hi>Sant Elmo</hi> shold be put into their hands, but they proceeded not very far in that proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>His Excellency perceiving the Treaty of Peace to be still delayed, and the people to be so impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and pleasing themselves with that kind of loose living, wold lend no ear to any accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace, he judged it expedient to do som favors to the Duke of <hi>Mataloni,</hi> and <hi>Don Ioseph Caraffa</hi> his brother, and make them go out, the one out of the Castle of <hi>Sant Elmo,</hi> the other by making him com from <hi>Benevento,</hi> that joyning with other Lords and Knights they might go up and down the City to perswade the peeple to conformity and quietness, which was don, for many Lords did ride up and down the streets in divers quarters, and in particular the Prince of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signano, Caraffa di bel nuovo, Il principe di Monte Sarchio</hi> of the house of <hi>Avalos,</hi> the Prince <hi>di Satriano Ravaschiero,</hi> the Duke <hi>di Castel di Sangro Don Ferrante Carraciolo,</hi> the Prince <hi>del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Rocella,</hi> the Lord <hi>Don Diomede Caraffa,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Conversano,</hi> with other Lords, dwelling in the <hi>Piazza</hi> of the great Market, where there were infinit store of peeple: They signified unto them, that his Excellency the Viceroy was very ready to give them all satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:57138:27"/>But they answered, That they desir'd no more, but that the Priviledges of King <hi>Ferdinando</hi> shold be made good to the City, which was confirm'd by <hi>Charles</hi> the fift of happy memory, who by Oath promis'd the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> at his Invecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Kingdom had from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 7. to impose no new Taxes upon City or Kingdom, as well He, as all his Successors, without the consent of the Apostolical Seat, and being so impos'd, they shold be well impos'd, otherwise the City might rise up with sword in hand, without any mark of rebellion, or irreverence to the Prince, for the maintenance of her Liberties: Now in regard that most of the Gabels ever since, some few of small consequence excepted, have bin layed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his holiness consent, it was just that they shold be all taken oft, and that the peeple shold have the Original of the said Priviledg, which was within the Archives of the City, which is in the Church of S. <hi>Laurence:</hi> Those Lords and Gentlemen understanding all this, they went back to <hi>Castel nuovo</hi> to impart all this to the Viceroy, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently convok'd the peeple Collateral Counsel, with that of State, as also the sacred Councel of <hi>Santa Chiara</hi> to consult what Answer shold be return'd unto the peeple.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Arch-bishop, according to his accustomed vigilance and paternal zeal to spiritual peace, as also to the temporal quietness of the people comitted unto him; as likewise for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57138:27"/>
the Devotion and Vassallage he profess'd unto the Catholic King, to the Service of his Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and State, Ordain'd, That the most holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament shold be openly expos'd in many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to invite all comers to implore at such an exigent divine assistance. This was don <hi>nella Capella del Tesoro,</hi> where the Dome is, where the miraculous bloud, and the holy head of San <hi>Gennaro,</hi> the glorious Protector of <hi>Naples,</hi> was laid out: Moreover all orders went in solemn Processions up and down the City as the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, Franciscans,</hi> those <hi>del Carmine,</hi> the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins,</hi> the <hi>Iesuits, Capucins, Teatins,</hi> and others, who gave som general edification.</p>
            <p>That day mighty diligences were made by the peeple who shold be their Chief, that by their authority they might make their addresse to the Viceroy, and obtain what they desir'd; and in regard that among others which rid up and down the City the Lords <hi>della Rocella</hi> were of the chiefest, &amp; in regard they also had their Palaces in the great Market; Therefore they made motions to the said Lords, That they wold please to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themselfs in behalf of the peeple to find out the foresaid Original Priviledg of <hi>Charls</hi> the fift: The said Lords did promise to do so, and for the execution thereof they went to <hi>Castel nuovo,</hi> accompanied by many peeple, where his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy comanded them to be admitted, and to enter, the concourse of peeple remaining without all the

while, expecting not without much anxiety an answer from the Viceroy.</p>
            <p>At the same time, and to the same purpose, the Lord <hi>Prior</hi> was sent for from S. <hi>Laurence,</hi> with a great train of peeple, and the multitude was so great, as if his horse had bin carried in the air, out of the lively hopes they had to find the said Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: But the Lord <hi>Prior</hi> finding it wold prove a difficult thing for him to find it, as also to be suffer'd to enter into the Stanzas of S. <hi>Laurence,</hi> by a turn which he gave in a straight street, going off his horse, and faigning to withdraw himself upon some business, he got away in the twinkling of an eye, with som of his servants, by an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible way of art and velocity, retiring himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of the holy Apostles among the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Teatins</hi>: This administred cause of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary murmuring and discontent to the peeple, who thought themselves baffled and deluded by him, who they expected shold have bin their kind of Defendor and Advocat, although ther want not som who affirm, that the Lord <hi>Prior</hi> had brought them a kind of Paper in a sheepskin, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out, 'twas the Original out of a mind of the great Charter of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift he had to quiet them: But because when the peeple shew'd it to their Satrapons and Councel, and being told them that it was a counterfeit one, they fell into such a fierce disdain, that if he had not fled, that good Lord had met with death, as they write, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd

            <p>The Duke <hi>de Roccella</hi> in the mean while was return'd from the Castle, attended by much pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to the great Market place, where the gross of the multitude was, carrying with him a Coppy of of the Priviledg desir'd by the peeple: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had heard of the dangerous success the Lord <hi>Prior</hi> was like to have, he durst not say it was the very Original, but he clearly told them it was a true and real Coppy, the Original not being to be had for the present. Hereupon it was receav'd at the beginning with some applause, but being read, and read again, and found imperfect, it rais'd a mighty discontentment in the hearts of the peeple, who cryed out they were mock'd, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen'd and betray'd by the said Duke, as they were by the <hi>Prior,</hi> and so falling into a mortal hatred of all the Nobility, they rag'd against them, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them ruin and revenge, and having the said Duke <hi>della Roccella</hi> in their hands, they clapt him in prison in the <hi>Monastery del Carmine,</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a famous <hi>Bandito</hi> call'd <hi>Perrone</hi> to be his Keeper, who finding himself once chain'd in the same Church, was put at liberty by the peeple; but this man being an ancient friend and a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Dukes, did labour the business so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually with the peeple, that he obtain'd the Dukes freedom, obliging himself to restore him into their hands upon all demands; so the Duke
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57138:29"/>
having remain'd a day or two in his Palace, retir'd afterward to his Country houses.</p>
            <p>Ther was appointed for one of the principal Heads of the peeple to be about the person of <hi>Masaniello</hi> a Priest, by name <hi>Iulio Genoino,</hi> an old and well temper'd man, who had been the peeples <hi>Elect</hi> during the Government of the Duke of <hi>Ossuna,</hi> a person well practis'd in the Affairs of the Court, and who always endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the advance of the peeples good, but he could not bring it then to passe, in regard the said Duke was revok'd to <hi>Spain.</hi> This man found himself at the beginning of these Tumults in the prison of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> which was open'd partly for his sake, therefore to gratifie his good will always towards them, they exalted him to this charge; To him they added for a companion the foresaid famous <hi>Bandito Perrone.</hi> These two being joyn'd with <hi>Masaniello</hi> gave out a list of 60. and odd houses of such Ministers and others, who had meddled with the farming of the Gabells, or had sold, let out, advis'd, or cooperated any way in the Custom Houses of the said Gabells, having enrich'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs, as was given out with the bloud of the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, therefore they deserv'd to be made examples to future ages, therefore their house and goods shall be burnt to the ground; which was don accordingly, as more shall be said, and with so much order, integrity, and neatness of hand, that he hazarded his life who shold touch any the least

thing to carry it away: Thereupon one taking but a little Towel was kil'd, another for the Crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a horse had 50. lashes on the back, &amp; divers others for stealing but small trivial things, after they had made their confessions to their ghostly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wer hang'd by the public Executioner in the Market place by the Comand of <hi>Masaniello.</hi> He was held unworthy of pity, and to be no well-wisher of the peeples good, who commissiated the ruining or burning of any of those mens hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or goods, and who seem'd to rescent it, were esteem'd no better then Complices to those pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Theeves: Whereupon one man having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly, and by natural compassion, only pitied the burning of the rich furniture, house and goods of the Duke of <hi>Caivano,</hi> calling them by chance, <hi>povere robbe,</hi> poor goods, as they were a burning, he had much ado to scape away through a little wicket, while the peeple cryed out, Where is this infamous Rogue? where is he? Let him be found out, and we will bray him in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But to proceed more orderly in the Relation of the burnt Palaces, let it suffice to know, that the first was <hi>Gieronimo Fetitias,</hi> one of the Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Corn Gabel, situat in the quarters of <hi>Porta Nuovo,</hi> near the houses of the Lord <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nili:</hi> There the peeple being flock'd with fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots and pitch, and getting into the house, they threw out of the windows all kind of houshold
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57138:30"/>
stuff, as all sorts of Plates, Dishes, Stools, Tables, Chairs, Carpets, Tapistries, and all sorts of Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siles, with great store of Money, Chains and Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, breaking the windows wider for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; all which were brought to the Market place, and hurld into a great fire, where they were all burnt to cinders, with huge out-cries of the peeple round about, who said, <hi>These goods are our blouds, and as these burn, so the Souls of those dogs who own them deserve to fry in hell fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This first act of the fiery Tragdy being ended, they went next to the house of <hi>Felice Basile</hi>; This fellow at first was a poor Baker, who carried bread up and down the streets of <hi>Naples,</hi> but in a short time, tampering with the Gabells, he became very rich, and having friends at Court; He dwelt nere the <hi>Spirito Santo,</hi> where the peeple being met, and having plunderd his Palace from top to bottom, they hurld out at the windows and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cones all the houshold stuff, Writings and Books, with other rich Curiosities, and ther were 23. great Trunks nomberd to be thrown out into the streets, and som of them being broke open, ther appeer'd wondrous rich things, as cloth of gold, and Tissues, with costly Embroderies, that dazzled the eyes of the beholders; all these they took, with a Cabinet full of Perl, and other precious stones, which were all hurld into the devouring Element, without saving as much as a rag, nor
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57138:30"/>
durst any take up as much as a pin, unless it were to help the throwing of it into the fire.</p>
            <p>These two burnings lasted five hours, then they pass'd to the Palace of <hi>Antonio de Angelis,</hi> a Counsellor, who had bin <hi>Elect</hi> of the peeple in the time of and he concur'd with that Viceroy to impose many new Gabells: This man being admonish'd by many of his friends to secure his goods, and his Palace from firing, he neglected their advice; And because the day before they had ta'ne down his gate only, he thought that their fury had terminated there, as being a sign they had no further malice unto him; besides he made account that they wold bear som reverence to his long robe: But he reckned without his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ost, his infortunat destiny blinded him so, and so stop'd his ears, that he would not listen to whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som cautions. Whereupon the rabble being com before his house, they furiously entred, and finding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>t full of all kind of costly furniture to admiration, they presently destinated all for the fire, leaving not a jot unburnt, and that which was of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary consideration, and the more to be pitied, was, that the Pleas, Writings, Charters, Patents, and Processes of divers poor and rich men were all consum'd; ther was a Library of curious Books, and many thousand Crowns found therin, there was two Coches, four beutiful horses, and two mules, all burnt, and they threw bottles of oile into the fire to make it flame with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57138:31"/>
In his Pantry, Larder house, and Kitchin, ther were d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>licat provisions, and divers Chests of sweet meats, and a boy having ta'ne but a piece of Bacon which fell by chance, he was ready to be torn in pieces by the multitud; ther were 10000. Crowns in good silver burnt, besides vessels of Plate, double gilt. The fire of this house was so great, that though it was in the night time, yet evry corner of the street was as clear as if it had been noon day.</p>
            <p>Thence they ran to the house of <hi>Antonio Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabella,</hi> another Counsellor, and a Napolitan Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, in the suburb of <hi>Mayds,</hi> and they did the like to him, where they left not one stone upon another, but consecrated all to the voracious flame, which lasted above three hours.</p>
            <p>At six a clock they pass'd to the Palace of the forenamed <hi>Andrea Anaclerio,</hi> who had been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted and ston'd by the boys at first, being the Elect of the peeple, but finding no great matter there, because he had wisely remov'd his goods the Sunday before, presaging som violence, they in a furious disdain applied fire to all the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the house, which made a horrible flame, to the terror of all the beholders, which lasted four hours, till Munday night being pass'd, the Sun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to enlighten the following morn of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But while the peeple consum'd with fire the houses, goods and wealth, beforesaid, of those pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57138:31"/>
Theefs, as they term'd them, there burnt in the brest of the Viceroy an ardent desire to put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to these fearful Combustions, and to hasten an accomodation of all things: Hereupon the <hi>Collateral,</hi> and Councel of State and War had a sad serious discours of these calamities, and 'twas resolv'd at last, that his Excellence shold comand four Companies of Foot to re-inforce that squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron which was already in the Castle all along, and 'twas don accordingly. Hereupon there was a legal Instrument printed, wherein there was an abolition of those Gabels, and a general pardon granted: As soon as this Instrument was printed 'twas sent into the great Market, that all peeple beholding and reading it, might return to quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and conformity: But it took no effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the general pardon being found imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, nor specifying as much as the peeple wold have, but containing divers matters subject to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villation<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Therefore all went off the Kings Ages again, and the Treaty was dissolved, to repair which, because the Viceroy perceav'd the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be already hateful to the City, and therefore unfit to quench the fire, but rather make it greater, therefore he purposd to make use of two of the prime Advocats of the peeple, and much esteemd by him, who were <hi>Andrea Martellone,</hi> and <hi>Ono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sico Palma,</hi> therefore the Viceroy having coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to come unto him, he comitted unto their care and prudence, and that with a great

deal of heat and earnestnes the appearing of the peeple with large promises of Remunerations. They executed what was impos'd upon them with much efficacy, but it produc'd no fruit, and being return'd to the Viceroy, they said 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to asswage the fury of the peeple, unless they had deliver'd them the Original of the gran Priviledg that <hi>Charls</hi> the fift granted: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing understood by the Viceroy, as from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning he had ardent desire to content the peeple, specially in this point so much importun'd, he caus'd all diligence to be used, that the said Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Priviledg shold be found out: Therupon he dispatch'd som of the Nobles, <hi>Elect</hi> of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, together with <hi>Don Ioseph Maria Caracciolo</hi> a Teatin, to the Church of San <hi>Lonuzo</hi> to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which <hi>Ioseph</hi> was a Subject of great valour, and learning, besides his high birth, and a most earnest Co-operator at all times, specially at the conjuncture of these Revolutions, and much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the Service of his King and Country.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Masaniello</hi> made it known to all the Marchants in the name of the peeple, and Corporations in the City, That they shold be ready with arms<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> in hand for the service of the peeple; a great part of his Train went a hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and som a foot, to the houses, as well of Gentlemen, as other persons, of what estate or quality soever, to search for arms, which were delivered him, though with an ill will, both by

            <p>The Archbishop seeing, that notwithstanding all proffers of accomodation the Comotions advanc'd evry hour with more fury, it came into his head that he himself wold go abroad in procession, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Teatins, and those of S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms,</hi> of the Congregation of the <hi>Oratorio,</hi> the the same Munday; but doubting it wold not be so pleasing to the peeple, he wold first feel their pulse, doing this with a great deal of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; the grounds of his doubt was this, that when the evening before, and the same morning the said religious Orders went out in a processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57138:33"/>
at way, the peeple did not much like those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, in regard, that notwithstanding they were made with a good intent to appease the tumults, yet this being for no other end then to establish the ancient <hi>Grassa</hi> in the City, they seem'd to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and did tacitly grumble, to what purpose shold so many processions be made now, that they were busy to take off the Gabels, and rid the City of all excessive Impositions, and such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions were not made then, when, generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the consent of the peeple, they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd: Therefore the Archbishop, before he wold put in execution his designs, sent to the Impositers of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and of the Apostles, both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teatin Churches, who coaching themselfs with some conspicuous secular Priests, eminent for their lives and birth, who were particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, <hi>viz Don Carlo de Bologna,</hi> and <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza,</hi> they all went to the Piazza of the great Market to observe the humor of the peeple, how they wold like such a procession, the Bishop having no other aims herein, but the service and satisfaction of the City, yet he wold know their inward inclinations herunto. The said Fathers and Lords being gon to the Market place, they put in strict execution what they had in charge from the Archbishop but they found tru what his Eminence had formerly doubted, as 'twas told them by some of the chief of the peeple, who yet thank'd very much the Archbishop for his pious
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57138:33"/>
Endeavors to favour them, not doubting a whit of his zeal and love to the City: But touching such a solemn extraordinary procession, they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly advis'd his Eminence not to do it, because the Priests and religious men in those broken times might haply receave som incounter or distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, which might prejudice the reputation of the Church, by reason of the great multitudes of arm'd men which were evry where, yet for no other end then the advancement of the public good: Therefore they pray his Eminence that he wold expose in the Church the holy Host, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order public Orisons for 40. hours.</p>
            <p>The Fathers and Gentlemen being return'd to the Cardinal Archbishop, related unto him what they had propos'd, and what answers they had, therefore his Eminence not thinking it expedient to put his former thoughts in action against the will of a tumultuary peeple, he inordred the said Prepositors, and all chief Heads and Rectors of Churches, as well secular as regular, that the bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacrament shold be expos'd, and public and privat Prayers made, to recomend unto his divine Majesty the woful condition of City and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which was punctually perform'd evry day until the death of <hi>Masaniello.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Archbishop had sent out those sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Orders, it being now night, his Eminence went to Castle <hi>Nuovo</hi> to confer with the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, and try whether any accommodation could

            <p>THe Nepolitan peeple were so heated in their desires, and so animated to battail, and to the destroying of the houses of public Ministers and Partizans of the Royal Court, as also of Lawyers and Farmers of the Gabels, that no bounds were sufficient to stop their arrogance and fury: As a strong currented River having burst down the banks and dikes which kept her within her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel can hardly be brought in again to her wonted regular stream, in the mean time, while the fearful Countryman labours with earth, stones, clay, wood and iron to mend her banks, she pursues her raging exorbitant cours, dilates her self o're fields, spoils the corn, undermines the trees, enters boldly into house and cellar without controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so doth a world of mischief. The nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous peeple of <hi>Naples</hi> might be said to be such a River, swelling with disdain and choler against the public Officers of the Gabels, and rushing o're the wonted banks, which were the Laws and Royal Authority of her Prince, the reverence to the holy Church, the fear of Justice: But she was
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57138:35"/>
not only like an unruly mounding River, but like a tempestuous Sea, figur'd peradventure by the Evangelist S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in his book of divine Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wher he saith, That with the waters of the Sea there joyn'd living waters of fire, whence 'tis call'd by him, <hi>Mars mixtum igne</hi>: The Viceroy, the Archb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hence it came to pass, that the glorious Sun scarce appeer'd in the Orient to illuminat the City the third day, but the furious peeple ran with swift pace to the Palace of one <hi>Valenzano,</hi> formerly a very poor Plebean, and afterwards from a Petty Clerk in the <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hence they pass'd to the Palace of the Duke of <hi>Caivano,</hi> towards the little gate of <hi>Santa Chiara,</hi> where all his Writings, and public Books, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Secretary of the Kingdom, with all his Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and infinit store of rich Moveables and Utensils were found, all which were burnt in two great

fires, and the Palace harass'd to the ground: What rich Coches, Sedans and Couches, with rare vessels of Argentry, and Jewels of all kinds, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd in this Palace? Ther were also great store of curious pictures found there, the profane were burnt, but som holy pieces were sent to divers Churches, but reserving for the flame the frames of them, although they were very gallant and rich, which cours they observ'd in all other places: The flame of this fire was so great, that it reach'd to a Monastery of Nunns hard by, of the Order of S. <hi>Francisco,</hi> so that they cryed out they were all destroyed; It took in a Library of Books, the leaves whereof flew up aloft, that some words were legible in the air, among which ther hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd one leaf to fall upon the ground from the said Cloyster, which treated of the Nobility of the ancient Dukes of <hi>Milan.</hi>

            <p>I shold be over tedious if I shold describe all the desolations and ruines which those fires did cause, with the quantity and quality of the goods; I will briefly tell you, that the same cruelties, term'd by the peeple just revenges, were us'd in all those houses whereof <hi>Masaniello</hi> gave a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log to destroy and ruinat: These were <hi>Bartolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me d' Aquino,</hi> the Duke <hi>Iohn de Caivano, Gio: Battista Bozzacarino,</hi> all three of <hi>Chiaia, Iohn Andrea Tuonavoglia,</hi> who dwelt out of the gate of San <hi>Gennaro,</hi> the President <hi>Cinnamo Sopra Gresu Maria,</hi> the sons of <hi>Mastrodatti, Iuseppe

            <p>In the Palace of <hi>Aquino a Chiaia</hi> ther was an inestimable Wardrobe found proportionable to a Kings, which was all destroyed: And <hi>Luprano</hi> having conveyed all his goods which were most precious to the Monastery of the Hospital of the <hi>Padri Zoccolanti,</hi> and <hi>Basile</hi> brought his Jewels and Moneys to the Conservatory of <hi>Santa Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria di Constantinopoli,</hi> and <hi>Zavaglio</hi> brought the flower of his goods to the Monastery of the Nuns of the conception nere his Palace, yet <hi>Masaniello</hi> came to know of all this, and therefore comanded the said Monasteries to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>While the peeple went thus revenging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs of their pretended adversaries, those two Original Priviledges of King <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the V. both which the peeple did so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly thirst after, were found out, and so they were brought to the Viceroy by the chief <hi>Elect</hi> of the Nobles, and by the foresaid <hi>Don Giuseppe Caracciolo</hi> a Teaten, which labour'd extremely in the busines: Hereupon the Viceroy did not let slip one moment of time, or the least advantage to com at last to an accord with the peeple, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them still all posible satisfaction, the Cardinal Archbishop of <hi>Naples</hi> did the like, who, with all his might and main, and by the help of his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by going also often himself in person to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places did not spare pains o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

other places, designing a sufficient nomber of men for the gard of those places; and to secure themselfs from the assault of all enemies, they distributed in evry place a sufficient propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of powder, of bullets, of match, and other instruments, to serve the Artillery, and other sort of fireworks if need required.</p>
            <p>Among those Companies of Combatants which went abroad that day, there were a great many women with Archibuzes upon their sholders, and other sorts of arms, with their she Captains, Alterezes and Sargeants, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peer'd like so many <hi>Amazons,</hi> and 'twas a rare sight to behold, so that the ancient time of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> seem'd to be renew'd when he besieg'd <hi>Rome.</hi> The Companies went on, and in the midst of two Soldiers a woman well clad, and not ill favor'd, went with the Arms of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty upon her head, and with a writing in great letters round about it, <hi>Viva il Re, &amp; il fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissimo popolo di Napoli</hi>; Let the King live, and the most faithful peeple of <hi>Naples</hi>; she went with a naked sword in her right hand, and a Poynard in her left: Ther followed after an incredible nomber of she Archibuziers, and others arm'd with Pikes, Lances and Halbards, others with clubs and staves, with faggots up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their backs, to put fire to the houses of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and public Thieves of their Country<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the little wenches of four or five yeers of

            <p>The Archbishop being return'd to the Castle to confer with the Viceroy, and the rest of the principal Ministers, the last remedy by means of that reverend Bishop was applied to make a final Agreement: So the Viceroy deliver'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands the Original Charter or Priviledg

Such a terror was struck into evry one, that if a boy said to a shop-keeper, For how much sell you the quart of wine? for example sake sell it but for so much, and no more; and so for fruit, and all other things, all obey'd: They went at first to put fire to the goods of <hi>Cornelio Spinola</hi> a Genoways, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided in <hi>Naples</hi> above 20. years, negotiating with the Court, and having farm'd the Gabels, and much peeple being found within for his defence, they went to him by way of strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, saying, They were com to treat with him to make him their Grassier: He excus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at first, saying, that he was not proper for so great a Trust, being a stranger<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and they assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that by long habitation he was becom a free Denizon of the City, he accepted of it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he said, I have a million for the service of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the most faithful peeple of

            <p>The Bishop about the evening dispatcht to the Viceroy Father <hi>Francisco Maria Filoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino,</hi> a Capuchin, who was his brother, with other Gentlemen, praying him that he wold by all means yeeld to all Pretensions, and give entire satisfaction unto the peeple, if he desir'd to prevent the mischiefs that were like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.

which was, that the said Banditi shold go a horsback through the City, and take their quarters a part, which things he held to be very essentiall, and conducing much to the service of the peeple, wherunto <hi>Masaniello</hi> replied, that 'twas bootles to do this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut 'twas sufficient if divided they stood a foot ready at his commands: <hi>Perrone</hi> persisting in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion sayed often that by all means the Banditi shold be a horsback: <hi>Masaniello</hi> suspecting som sinister practises of <hi>Perrone</hi> in giving this same counsell, caus'd that he order'd more peremptorily they shold go a foot, and that they shold not budg from one corner of the Market which he wold assign them for their quarter. The Banditi being much disquieted in mind, because they had not their intent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the execution of their design, as they parted there were seven archibuz shots made at <hi>Masaniello,</hi> yet they miss'd him all, but som bullets burnt part of his shirt and so fell to the earth, all which was esteem'd a miracle of the most holy Lady del Carmine, whose medail he carried about his neck hanging down to his brest. Ev'ry one may imagine how much this act might have mov'd the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to fury, but ther only happen'd confus'd dark rumors and whisperings for the present; but afterwards they fell upon those Banditi and discharg'd 300. musket shots at them,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57138:48"/>
wherein they kill'd about thirty, two whereof fell down before the great Altar, three in the Vestry, one under the very seat where the Archbishop was, and thither he had fled for safe-gard; and the rest in divers parts of the convent, divers also were hurt, but the heads of the slain were set up upon poles in the Market place; and som of them scaping away into divers places from the crowd, fled into Monasteries, but most into Maria della Nuova de <hi>Zocolane. Perrone</hi> was presently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and fetter'd by <hi>Masaniellos</hi> order, and to be proceeded against as shall be told speedily. Then they went in quest of one <hi>Antimo Grasso</hi> a man as notorious as facino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, who was one of the chiefest of the plot, who was found, and murther'd in the same chamber where the Bishop was, which was one of the stands of the Generall. He receiv'd the shot in the window of the sayed cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whilest perceiving himself to be pursu'd by death, he sought to fly into the cloyster, which precipitat flight confirm'd the jealousies the peeple had of him. The Bishop was at that time in most evident danger of his life, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse without being a whit mov'd or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing one crum of courage, he confess'd and gave absolution to the said <hi>Antimo Grasso</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he breath'd his last.</p>
            <p>The noise was so great, and the shots so

many, and the tumult so high in the Monastery, the gates being open'd and pull'd off the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that all the Fryers trembling with fear thought they were all dead men, and many of them confessing one to the other with cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes in their hands, and other images, expected no other then sudden death; yet neverthelesse the Archbishop did not give over, but with a notable magnanimity worthy of a Prelat did encourage them, distributing his pastorall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions among them up and down with many sweet words of comfort.</p>
            <p>The peeple were much mov'd to see the holy Church so polluted with bloud, and profan'd with slaughters, therefore those dead bodies were carried out into the Market; and the peeple went to find out the rest of the Banditi who were hid in divers places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of divers were kill'd, and the rest got o're the walls to save their lifes.

bloody revenge which the peeple might have taken for such a barbarous and unheard of cruelty: when the mines had taken effect, the Banditi were to disperse up and down, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with som of the Gentry whom they had brought in with them, and fall upon the rest of the common peeple, and put all to the sword; this being understood by <hi>Masaniello,</hi> he ordred that with all possible diligence those subterranean places shold be search'd that were reveal'd by the said prisoner, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found tru and reall, he pardoned him his life, but with perpetuall banishment from the City and Kingdom under pain of life; the said powder being taken up from all those places under ground, did serve for provision to the peeple for many days, for they had scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof.</p>
            <p>It was discover'd also by the confession of other Banditi, being put upon the rack, that by the machinations of Duke <hi>Matalone,</hi> and his brother <hi>Perrone</hi> and <hi>Grassa,</hi> having the chief hand therein, that the waters which by aqueducts serv'd the City of Naples were poyson'd, as also the corne, which after much diligen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

At the same time by order of <hi>Masaniello</hi> were dispatch't many companies of armed foot and horse through all the City, and the Suburbs, to take the rest of the Banditi, who were retir'd for sanctuary to divers Churches and Monasteries, specially in Sancta Maria della Nuova, where a great number got shelter, and it was bruited abroad, that Don <hi>Guiseppe de Caraffa</hi> was com also thither for favors which he had receiv'd from the Vice-Roy from Benevento to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: He plac'd also at the same time divers gards at the gates, that the Cavaliers shold not get out to joyn in bands against the peeple, which was much fear'd, out of the confessions which were drawn from the foresayed Bandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti; therefore an exact search was made for these in all the Monasteries throughout the City, where divers were found, and being drag'd out they had their heads chopt off, and put up upon poles up &amp; down the streets. And because there was a report ran that the Duke of <hi>Matalone</hi> himself was hid at St. <hi>Efrem,</hi> one of the Capuchins Churches, a great squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57138:51"/>
of armed men went thither, with rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous resolutions to drag him out and execute him; But a little before having got timely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by a spie, he got out in the disguise of a Capuchin Fryer; and although the peeple went all the waies to overtake him, yet they could not do it, in regard that he was got before up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a swift Coursier towards Benevento; the peeple being much inrag'd at his escape: But whosoever of his servants, pages, laquays, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick boyes, or any other that belong'd unto him came into their hands, they presently mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd them. And because the rage of the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after the sayed Duke of <hi>Mataloni,</hi> was bent next against D. <hi>Guiseppe Caraffa</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there went 4000. persons all arm'd to the foresayed Monastery of <hi>Santa Maria della Nuova</hi> of the Zoccolanti, where he had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd himself, as also his brother Father <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio Caraffa</hi> Prior de la Roccella, who being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by God for his innocence and innated goodnesse, became a Prophet to himself, and to his brother Don <hi>Guiseppe,</hi> of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing danger that did menace their destruction, he exhorted &amp; conjur'd him to get away with him, and to transfer themselfs to a place of greater security: But he, not giving eare to the exhortations of the Prior, but yeelding to his hard destiny, he remain'd alone in the sayed Monastery, the Prior taking leave of him with

teares in his eyes; who being scarce gon, the foresayed rabble surpriz'd the place, and rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in with extreme rage, though a great while they could not find him, he being hid in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretest place of the Monastery; whence he got means to give notice to the Viceroy of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate condition; and therefore to amuse or divert the rabble, he desir'd him to let fly two peeces of ordnance (but without bullets) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; and it might be, that being so terrified, they might return to the town to take new counsells, and so he might have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make his escape. This note be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sowed 'twixt the sole and the shoo of a poor converted Frier, he gave him a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to go with it to the Castle: But what? the bearer had scarce put himself upon his way, but being stop'd by som malicious spies, he was search'd from head to foot, where they found the sayed note, and so they fell upon him most furiously, and chop'd off his head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caraffa</hi> hereupon having lost all hopes of preserving himself, for the certainty the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had got that he was in the sayed Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for the hot eager malice wherewith they pursued him, he resolv'd to attempt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, being told by the Fryers, that the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish peeple wold search all the cells, dormito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with any other places public or private

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57138:52"/>
head; which being done, 'tis incredible what exultations of joy and triumphing there was among them, as if they had taken off the head of the great Turk, and cut to pieces the whole Ottoman <hi>Empire</hi>: so his head being fixed upon the top of a pike, and under it one of his feet and half a leg, with this inscription underneath, which was written in huge chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters that they might be the more legible: <hi>Questo √© Don</hi> Peppo Caraffa <hi>rebelle della pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria, &amp; traditore dell fidelissimo popolo.</hi> This is Don <hi>Peppo Caraffa,</hi> a rebell to his countrey, and traytor to the most faithfull peeple. And because at the same time the heads of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foure who were of his train were chopt off, and put also aloft upon poles, though lower then that where <hi>Caraffa</hi>'s head was, to make it appear the more eminent; and having put his Porter in the midst of four more, and tied about his temples a royall crown of lead, in this posture they made him go up and down the market place, dragging all along the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of those five, till at last they threw them upon a dunghill among stones and filth. This being don, they cried out, <hi>Viva Dio, &amp; il no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro Re mill' anni, &amp; muoiauo gli traditori del fidelissimo popolo.</hi> Let God live, and let our King live a thousand yeers, but let the traitors of the most faithfull peeple die the death.

an ignominious procession was the body and head of <hi>Caraffa</hi> presented to <hi>Masaniello,</hi> who was ther present all the while, &amp; commanding his head to be brought nearer unto him, he pluck'd him often by the hair of his musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos, disgorging many base opprobrious words, and making a kind of speech unto the peeple touching the justice of God, which comes surely, though slowly, to punish the guilty, and useth to make a compensation for the slownesse with the greater security, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king application of the doctrine of that wise man, who without studying could by the meer light of nature say; <hi>lento quidem gradu divina procedit ira, &amp; tarditatem supplicii gravitate compensat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Masaniello</hi> having terminated his speech unto the people, commanded that all the heads of the Banditi, and other facinorous traytors that were taken in the Monastery of the <hi>Zoccolanti,</hi> and in the <hi>Ceriglio,</hi> shold be distinguished from others, and plac'd by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs, and fix'd in the great Market place, but the carcase of <hi>Caraffa</hi> shold be tied to a beam athwart, and his head shold be put in a grate of iron with his foot nail'd underneath, and fix'd without the porta di <hi>Gennaro,</hi> through which the passage was to the Palace of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taloni,</hi> putting above that grate of iron, and under his carcase in the market place the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed

words in large legible Characters. <hi>Don Peppo Caraffa Rebelle della patria, &amp; traditore del fidelessimo popolo,</hi> all which was punctually executed, the peeple still bawl'd aloud let traytors die, let traytors die; and nothing was heard up and down the streets in ev'ry corner, but shrikings, and howlings with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid curses, which made a hideous noise in the air.</p>
            <p>At this spectacle of <hi>Caraffa</hi> the fear of the Cavaliers encreas'd somuch, that they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no other thing then to be torn in peeces, seeing them lay hands so inhumanely upon such that were us'd to make that City tremble at other times, as also the whole Kingdom of Naples: And the foundation of their fears was the greater, because that after the discovery of the plots made by the Banditi, the peeple rise up and multiplied more fast then ever, for that very night there were numbred 114000. arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons, without black caps, and the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that adher'd to the peeple, with divers other, as the Catalog was seen in the hands of <hi>Don Georglo Sersale.</hi> As also of the doubts they had that the Viceroy himself had a hand in that conjuration of the Banditi, and to make him resolve to grant them whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they desir'd, <hi>Masaniello</hi> commanded that no refreshments or provision shold passe into the Castle, where he and his Dutchesse<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

with the Collaterall Counsell, and Counsell of State, with the greatest part of the Kings Ministers, servants and Officers resided, as also into those quarters where the Spaniards were billeted, where they permitted neither bread, or wine, or snow to be carried, but only a few roots, and herbs.</p>
            <p>He commanded also, because he intended to choak them with thirst, as well as to famish them with hunger, that all the Aqueducts shold be cut off: Whereupon the Viceroy see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself in so scurvy a condition, dispatch't a letter to the Archbishop, that he wold make known to the people his sincere intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and that he was not only a meer stranger, but most averse to the practises of the Banditi, and their abominable conjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; For proof whereof he might assure them that he us'd all humane industry that could be imagin'd, to apprehend those Banditi, and deliver them to the hands of the peeple, to do with them what they pleas'd; such were the protestations of the Viceroy to clear himself of those ombrages he found the people began to have of him.

numbers of armed peeple, he could proceed so regular in his orders, and that they were so exactly observed, that there was never seen nor known the like, that he should be so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant to Ladies, so respectfull of the holy Church and her Officers, that all the while he wold not suffer any outrage to be offer'd them, except only in Sancta <hi>Maria</hi> della Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ova in the quest of <hi>Mataloni,</hi> that among such a world of tempting rich goods which there were burnt up and down, he wold not suffer the value of a pin to be converted to private use.</p>
            <p>The first order that was published by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saniello</hi> upon Thursday morning betimes, was, that all men shold go without Cloaks, Gowns, wide Cassocks, or such like, which was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed not only of the common sort, but of all the Nobility, of all the Churchmen, &amp; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders, &amp; 'twas a marvellous thing, if not rather ridiculous, to see the Dominicans, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites, the Regular Canons, Iesuits, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, Priests, and all sorts of Regulars, yea the Canons and Dignitaries of the Cathedral Churches, the Chaplains of the Archbishop <hi>Filomarino,</hi> of Cardinal <hi>Trivultio,</hi> of the Viceroy, the Apostolicall Nuncio, and of all the Bishops residing then in NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLES, and if we give credit to the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many, their Eminences themselves
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57138:58"/>
went without upper garments all the while that <hi>Masaniello</hi> reign'd, every one submitting to so vile a fellow.</p>
            <p>He commanded also that all women, of what degree or quality soever they were, shold go without fardingalls, which was also obey'd; and that when they went abroad they shold tuck their petticoats somwhat high, that it might be discern'd whether they carried any arms underneath; it having bin discover'd, that under such long robes sundry sorts of arms have bin brought to the Banditi and other enemies of the peeple: And besides, the night before there were many papers thrown up and down, wherein ther were ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings given of som notable design against the peeple. That morning also all the streets were intrench'd, and the Cannons from the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of <hi>San Lorenzo</hi> were brought down, and set upon carriages, and plac'd in divers parts of the city which lay most advantagious, and companies both of foot and horse were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd up and down, well arm'd, to be able to withstand any force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Masaniello</hi> commanded also that all Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57138:58"/>
the service of the peeple; which they did, though with a very ill will; for, they plainly perceiv'd the designe of this disarming, which was not only to make them unable to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny opposition, but to expose them to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the furious people their enemies.</p>
            <p>There was also that day an Excize put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all edible commodities, and at what price they shold be sold: There was also by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the said <hi>Masaniello</hi> in sundry of the most eminent places of the City, divers frames of pictures set up of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, and of his Catholike Majesty <hi>Philip the fourth,</hi> now regnant, with the Arms of the City of Naples drawn underneath; and when the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers pass'd by any of those places, they cryed out, <hi>Viva il Re di Spagna, &amp; muoia il mal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verno,</hi> let the King of Spain live, and let the ill government die.</p>
            <p>While that morning the commands of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saniello</hi> were publish'd and executed ev'ry where throughout the City, the Archbishop who from Tuesday morning kept himself within the Monastery of del Carmine, to be able to negotiate with more conveniency with <hi>Masaniello,</hi> and with other heads of the peeple, he was not wanting to publish the true intent of his meaning, and of that of the Vice-Roy, and the fervent desire he had to put in execution the last accord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57138:59"/>
to appease this high popular fury, which ev'ry day, ev'ry hour, yea, ev'ry moment, was the cause still of greater hurt and ruine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having sent into the Castle Father <hi>Filo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marino</hi> his Capuchin brother to that effect, he imployed that morning <hi>Caesare Gherardini</hi> the Master of his Chamber to induce the Viceroy to satisfie the peeple, and to give his assent to what was demanded, assuring him of the inclination that the said peeple had to a peace, so that all depended upon him, otherwise go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus arming daily more and more, and madding up and down the streets, he could not but prognosticate a totall and irreparable ruine to City and Kingdom: The Vice-Roy receiv'd the Embassie of the Archbishop with unspeakable contentment, and to shew his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse and uniformity of thoughts with the said Archbishop, he writ unto him again a most affectionate Letter, wherein demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ardent disposition he had to publike tranquillity, he referr'd himself to ev'ry thing that his Eminence had don, and wold ratifie whatsoever he wold promise, <hi>ex nunc pro nunc,</hi> to the end, that all delayes might be cut off by carrying and returning Propositions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers from one side, and the other, so much in prejudice of the publike good of the City: the Letter was in effect as followeth.</p>

might be publikely seen in an open Balcone with the Archbishop and himself, which was don accordingly, whence <hi>Masaniello</hi> facing the peeple sayed, lo, I am here, I am alive and free, Peace, Peace; at which words the peeple exceedingly rejoycing cryed also Peace, Peace; a little after all the bells rung in the Churches circumjacent, as in the Churches of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> of the holy Spirit, of the Crosse, and <hi>Santa Maria del Angeli,</hi> but he not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that ringing, commanded they shold ring no longer, which was obeyed accordingly; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saniello</hi> told the Viceroy, now my Lord you shal see how obedient the Napolitans are, so he bade them cry out, <hi>Viva Dio, Viva la Madon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na del Carmine, viva il Re di Spagna, viva il Filomarino, Viva il Duca de Arcos, viva il fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissimo popolo di Napoli</hi>: Let God live, let the most holy Virgin of Carmine live, let the King of Spain live, live <hi>Filomarino,</hi> and the Duke of Arcos, with the most faithfull peeple of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and with ev'ry <hi>Viva</hi> that he cryed, the peeple followed him, and at last he cryed <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

commanded with a loud voice out of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cone wherein he was, that ev'ry soul there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent under pain of rebellion and life shold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from that Court, which was punctually and presently obey'd, as if they had all vanish'd away, not one remaining behind, insomuch that the Viceroy was amaz'd at such a ready and marvellous obedience.</p>
            <p>Many discourses being pass'd in the Palace 'twixt the Viceroy, the Bishop and <hi>Masaniello,</hi> they appointed among themselfs that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations shold be printed which were demanded of the peeple, and subscrib'd by the Viceroy, as also by the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall, and the Councell of State and War, and that the Sunday next following the Viceroy accompanied with all the Tribunalls shold go to the Dome in person, where the sayed Capitulations shold be publikely read, and sworn unto by solemn oath, to observe them for ever, as also to procure that they shold be confirm'd by his Catholike Majesty: After this the Bishop went down with <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niello</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> having taken their leave of the Viceroy to take Coach: So afterwards the Viceroy did ratifie all, as desiring nothing more then that by his moderation and prudence the confusion shold cease, and the City freed from Bandit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After this parley <hi>Masaniello</hi> swayed with more dominion then ever he did in quality of absolute Monarque o're the City, as well in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill as warlike affairs <hi>ad modum belli,</hi> with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable independent authority till his head was chopt off. When he parted from the Castle the Viceroy bestowed on him a rich chain of gold of 3000. crowns value, putting it about his neck with his own hands, although he had refus'd it divers times, but afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it by the advice of the Bishop, he was declar'd at the same time by the Viceroy Duke of St. <hi>George,</hi> by a renunciation made him of that title not long before by the Marquis of Torrecuso: and for the last seal of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Masaniello</hi> prostrating himself at the feet of the Viceroy, he kiss'd his knee, after which embracement, he sayed, Son go in peace, &amp; God blesse thee; wherupon having taken his last leave, and going down, the Archbishop brought him into his own Coach, going thence to Toledo street where the Archipiscopall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace stood, in which journey 'twas a pleasant sight to behold ev'ry window hung with rich tapestries, carpets, curtains, and hangings, and the streets full of great wax candles and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it being now one hour in the night, and the bells ringing out in ev'ry Church that

Under pain of life ev'ry one shold cut off his great lock, and weare no Perriwigs, declaring he had commanded this, because many Banditi were found habited like women with Armes underneath; he renewed the Orders of the day before touching Priests and religious men that they shold not weare their upper habits; That all Friers or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men that were found not to be of the City shold be brought before him, to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined whether they were true Friers, or Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti so habited: That upon the sounding of two a clock within night ev'ry one shold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to his lodging, and after that time whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was found upon the streets shold die irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missibly without mercy.

            <p>And because from the beginning of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution many Lords, Cavaliers, and Officers were retir'd with great prudence to divers Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries and Convents, as also sundry Ladies to the Nunneries, one of the first Friday Orders by <hi>Masaniello</hi> was that ev'ry one upon pain of life shold return to their houses, and inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ev'ry one was constrain'd to submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and obey this command as far as Duke, Counts, and Marquises, Regents and Officers, els they had expos'd themselfs to the fury of the mercilesse rabble.</p>

He sent a Spaniard who had murther'd one, to the Viceroy, that he would see him punish'd; the Viceroy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, and desir'd that he might be hang'd in the market place. He caus'd the same day two Banditi to be shot to death at Porta Medina, for being complices with the Duke of <hi>Mataloni,</hi> who though he hated him in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet he wold not put his palace a fire, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring there might be som mine underneath, as also for an intention he had to make it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatory for poor maidens.</p>

Among these a slave of his was lighted upon, who was leading two horses ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair ones, who fearing he shold have been suddenly slain, sayed that he wold say what he knew or could if they spar'd him his life, which being promis'd him he discoverd, that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the person of the Duke he went at first to Benevento, and afterwards to Calabria he knew not whither, but touching his goods and furniture they were hid in certain Churches, as <hi>Santa Maria de Miracoli.

            <p>All this being known by <hi>Masaniello,</hi> he caus'd the said Churches and Monasteries to understand, as also all other religious places and Nunneries, that whosoever had any of the goods of the Duke of <hi>Matalini,</hi> who was such a traytor to the most faithfull peeple

which is a very rare favor to an Italian Cavalier; and now he hath the fourth office of Trust, except the Vicegerencies of Naples and Sicilia, with the government of Milan, that any man hath in Italie, which is the Stradico of Messina, which is a most honourable charge; that town being the cape of the Sicilian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Metropolis thereof, and withall a Fort of much jealousie, being the key of that Island, and the outer wall of all Italie, which Office is executed by the said Prince with much praise and emulation to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for his sincere remarkable fidelity, and rectitude in matters of justice.</p>
            <p>After this, further commands were given by <hi>Masaniello</hi> to burn the goods of divers other Officers, and particularly of the Kings visitor; yet this command was revok'd by the effectuall intercession of the Archbishop <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomarini</hi>; as also it being ordered that Regent <hi>Zuffias</hi> shold run the same fortune, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution was suspended, and no man knew why, unlesse 'twas because certain Troops of Horse were quarter'd at his house, which was intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched round about.</p>

            <p>Being com in this order, and with these ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauses to the Bishops Palace, and being all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, then the Viceroy with all his gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came: upon the entrance into the Church he was met by the Archbishop with all his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Chaplains and Officers, which made a splendid equipage; Then they went to the great Altar, where the Archbishop being set in a kind of Throne, as also the Viceroy, and all the Tribunalls who were there attending Cavalier <hi>Donato Coppola</hi> Secretary to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, did read with an audible voice the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations desir'd by the peeple for a finall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, which being sign'd by the Viceroy, the Collateral, the Counsel of State &amp; War, <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niello</hi> standing all the while afoot upon the steps of the Archbishops throne, who to the wonderment of all added, and took away cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57138:82"/>
and interpreted all things as he pleas'd, no man interrupting or replying unto him: So after the Articles were read, a solemn oath was taken by the Viceroy, and all the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ministers and Officers of State, to observe and accomplish the sayed Capitulations to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity, promising also, and swearing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to have them confirm'd by his Catholic Majesty: all this was don when two quires of music sung all the while with most exquisite voices, <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> which while 'twas a singing, <hi>Masaniello</hi> was observ'd to swell with a kind of glory to have attain'd his ends, with so much felicity and applause, yet he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried still in his hand a naked sword, and sent divers arrogant and ridiculous messages to the Viceroy: The first was, that from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he wold continue to be Captain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the City: The second was, that by vertue therof he intended to go with a gard, and to give Patents to all Officers of War and Arms: The third, that he wold dismisse from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle all Cavaliers. These and such like messages he sent the Viceroy singly and severally, and ther were affirmative answers brought back, for not to disturb things with Negatives; But the gentleman that deliver'd these messages, made an apology for himself privately in the ear of the Viceroy, for indeed most peeple there did blush, or laugh, or jeer the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57138:83"/>
and malapartnesse of <hi>Masaniello.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While these messages were a sending, <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ended, then <hi>Masaniello</hi> began to reason somtimes to good purpose, somtimes senselessely. He said that the most faithfull people of Naples were naturally spiritfull and vivacious, and were so esteem'd by all Netions, but they had almost quite lost their wonted magnanimity and courage, by the heavy weight of so many exactions and Gabells which were impos'd upon them from time to time, not by their Catholic Majesties, but by ill Ministers and their own Compatriots. And although for the loyalty which he alwaies bare, &amp; wil ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse unto his King, he hitherto tolerated ev'ry thing, to avoid all stains of disobedience, yet considering the benefit of those impositions redounded rather to satisfie the ravenous lusts of Officers and Courtiers, and of others as wel Forreners as Natives, whereby they became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively rich, and thrive by sucking the very blood of the peeple, yet finding the City ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally inclin'd therunto, he took a resolution to cure her of this malady, as also the whole Kingdom of such a contagion, which was hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not only to the most faithfull peeple, but to his Majesty also his liege Lord, insomuch that of the bread they gave him he scarce had the crust, they themselfs reserving the pith and substance to fill their insatiable appetites;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57138:83"/>
Hence it came to pass, that the more they gave the King, the more his wants still increas'd, though in sixteen yeers he had given him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one hundred millions, which had been sufficient not onely to have conquer'd Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and France, but to have put under his feet the unlucky Moon of the Ottoman Empire: therefore for the future all the public Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that shold be given the King, care shold be taken that his Majesty shold have the true benefit therof, and not be misapplied to inrich others: and hereof your Excellency (meaning the Viceroy) may be well assur'd; insomuch that all these things considered, and cast into a true ballance, he was well assur'd, that he shold not only not receive any blame from the King his Soveraine Liege Lord, or any mark of diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but he should gaine the reputation and applause of a most faithfull vassall, seeing that whatsoever he had don was for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther service of God, of his Catholic Majesty, of your Excellency his Vicegerent, of the whole City, of the Peeple, and of all the Kingdom. During this discourse he so heated himself, and protested with such a fury and excesse of zeal, that the words procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from him so heartily and empha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

audience of these words up and down the Church, which was as full as it could thwack in thick multitudes, gave a loud generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause.</p>
            <p>Then he said, that now he had brought his honest intents home to his aime, he wold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his former calling to be a Fisherman again, to demonstrate unto the world, that 'twas not his own interest he levell'd at, but that of his King, Countrey, Peeple, City and Kingdome, had induc'd and prick'd him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to undertake so dangerous a tas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT is a thing impossible to expresse the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings of the peeple of Naples for the Capitulations of peace which were sign'd and sworne unto the day before, which ended not that day, but they continued upon Sunday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: The Articles were printed, and fix'd through all places of the City, that all things might be manifested to the world: ev'ry one did contend who shold expresse greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, such a kind of generall jubilee was among them, insomuch that it drew tears from som, which falling upon the ground, made those flowers of joy to spring up which the heavinesse of former times had caus'd to fade.</p>

It being known that that Sunday morning four Banditi were fled for Sanctuary to the Church of Carminello among the Jesuits; he sent a considerable band of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men to encompasse both cloister and

The Viceroy looking upon his servants, said, <hi>Traigan da comer al Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> Masaniello: Bring somthing to eat for the Lord <hi>Masaniello</hi>; no Sir, (he replied) let us go take fresh aire at Posilipo, and leat us eat together there; for I have provision already: and saying this, he caus'd divers Mariners to com in with divers baskets of fruit.

the times, and they went also richly adorn'd: But these were no other then <hi>Masaniello's</hi> mother, and two sisters, and other kinswomen of his, all Fishermens daughters; a little boy his sisters son bare upon his sleeve a kind of arms, which shew'd that his Uncle was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Generall of the City of Naples: When she came to the Viceroys Palace, ther were Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans sent for her and her company, with a gard of Halberdeers, Pages and Laquays to attend them: Then were they brought into the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse, where they found a great deal of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com, and dainties. The Duchesse presented her with a rich Diamond, and the Visitor Generall took the young boy often in his arms and kiss'd him: <hi>Masaniello's</hi> mother meeting upon the stairs with Cavalier <hi>Cosmo Fonseca</hi> the grand Ingeneer, who us'd to make Epitaphs, she told him that he shold tell the Viceroy that her son fear'd no body but God, and his Excellence; therfore he shold do well to send unto him to refrain from so much fire and blood.</p>

            <p>THe thoughts of <hi>Masaniello</hi> began to grow so vast and extravagant, as also so instable and unquiet, that not containing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self within the compasse of his sphere, and those huge honors and authority he had climb'd unto, but he wold be more then the sea, who though a raging element, yet is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to hold himself within his bounds; he wold be more then the Heavens, who passe not their circumference; more then the Sun, who never goes out of the Ecliptic; He had an ambition (had it been possible) to inslave the whole earth, to tame the ocean, to debell the world, to confine the stars, and see the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and setting of the Sun.</p>
            <p>He was so blinded with arrogant desires,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57138:91"/>
that they took from him the solace of his sleep, they kept him from seeing the precipices wherein he was like to fall from the top of his arrogant designes, and the miseries which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his greatnesse. The staires whereby we ascend to honor, are of glasse, the top is an earthquake, the descent a precipice, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doth commonly discompose, and stound the mind of man, specially one of a base carat<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and low extraction, like a Monkey clad with scarlet; Honors serve som men only for their ruine, as long haire serv'd <hi>Absolon</hi> to hang himself: He that is far from <hi>Iupiter</hi> need not feare his thunderbolts.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Masaniello</hi> that Saturday on which a <hi>Te Deum</hi> was sung in the Cathedrall Church, had renounc'd all his usurp'd authority and power into the hands of the Viceroy, and return'd, as he sayed and sware he wold, to his former vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of selling fish, he had deserv'd that the Napolitan peeple should have erected him Colosso's, and statues of gold, to the eternall memory of his magnanimous undertakings, brought to such a marvellous perfection: but a boundlesssse ambition did cast such a mist before his eyes, that breaking the reines of reason, upon the Lords Day it self his brain began to turn, doing so many acts of foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and cruelty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:57138:92"/>Yet many reasons were urg'd for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his command: Som say that he was willing to resigne it, but that by the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his wife, and others of his kinred, he took a resolution to keep it still. Others say, as having heard himself say, that he continued still his power, because if he left it, he was to expect no other but death, he was so generally hated by the Nobles and Gentry for having burnt and destroyed so many pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and wealthy substances, put to death so many of al sorts, &amp;c. Others say, that he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued still his authority, because sense oppos'd reason, being allur'd with the sweetnesse of rule and power.</p>
            <p>Yet if his sayed usurped dominion had bin attended with that humility, discretion and judgment wherewith he began his reign, he might peradventure have continued longer, from that precipice whereinto he tumbled in so short a time. His ruine befell him, because he had broken out into a thousand delirium's and fooleries, which were the causes of his tyrannicall comportments, and consequently of the universall hatred at last of the peeple, which for many dayes depended totally upon him, as upon an Oracle, and obey'd him as a sworn and naturall King.</p>
            <p>But if one be curious to know the reason why he fell into that stolidity, I could tell
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57138:92"/>
him, that it was a fatall drink given him by the Viceroy to this effect, which had an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative vertu to work upon his brain, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper his <hi>pericranium,</hi> that so by becoming odious and ridiculous, the peeple might do him away. This is the opinion of many, which whether it be tru or no, I suspend my opinion. It may be well thought also, that that sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and foolerie which befell him, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from excesse of vigilance, care, watchings, and not eating; for he seldom slept, and he did eat more seldom; his head being so full of thoughts, and new businesses coming like heaps upon him continually, whereof his little narrow understanding (being exercis'd before to sell little fish onely) was not capable: The extreme joy likewise which possess'd him, to becom from a petty Pleb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence it came to passe, that (putting himself upon his bed) he hardly could close his eyes, but he wold suddenly rise up again, telling his wife, Let us be Lords of Naples, and then let us sleep: Up, up, let us put our authority in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: then going to the window he wold face the Gard, and call upon them, imploying them alwayes upon som design or other, that his usurped dominion shold not be idle; what marvell then is it, all these things being well

Such an extravagant passion as this did predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and discompose <hi>Masaniello,</hi> and more easily, being a creature of so low a degree: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Munday morning he appear'd upon the market place a horseback, with a naked sword in his hand, striking many men, and driving them before him, though no cause offer'd.</p>
            <p>Being thus domineering in the Market place, an old and well qualified Captain call'd <hi>Caesar Spano</hi> of <hi>Don Prospero Tuttavilla's</hi> Regiment, told him, that he wold be pleas'd to command that the soldiers of that Regiment might be consign'd unto him, who were Germanes and Walloons, which was don accordingly; but he struck and wounded the old Captain, giving him two cuts in the face, saying, be gon when I bid you. Turning then his horse head he went towards Toledo street, who meeting with one that was told him was a spie, he suddenly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forming of any processe caus'd his head to be chopt off; He met with another, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd that his wife was suborn'd, and carried away by an old bawd, &amp; asking where she was, sayed in such a house, he went thither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and found her there with another man; he commanded her to be hang'd, and him to be broken on wheels, which was presently done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:57138:94"/>Afterwards he met about the Church of St. <hi>Ioseph</hi> with the Prince of Cellamare, chief postmaster of the Kingdom, a discreet and wel temper'd Prince, and complemented very much with him, saying, if he knew any, though he were the greatest potentate in the world, who favor'd <hi>Mataloni,</hi> he wold chop off his head: A little after ther pass'd by the Duke <hi>de Castel di Sangro Don Ferrante Caracciolo,</hi> a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier of high esteem in Naples, and not using any complement towards him, he ran a great hazard of his life; for he made him com sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Coach, telling him, that a new Elect was to be made o're the five Piazzas of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, &amp; he wold publish an order that they who deserv'd that degree shold go decently habited, and that the Cavaliers who were sellers of Votes, shold retire to their dwellings bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed, and so he dismissed him: This being don, he transferr'd himself to the Kings Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and ther being many horses ther, he sayed these are particular mens horses, but the grooms told him, they were his Majesties, and that the Lord <hi>Carlo Caracciolo</hi> the chief Master of the horse in the Kingdom, had the charge of them: he asked what <hi>Carlo</hi>? what master of the Horse? am not I ev'ry thing, not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any body, and saying this, he took for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his friends six of the best horses, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had half brought them to the Market

place, recollecting himself and thinking better on't, he sent them back to the Kings Stables. The same time he dispatch't a band of armed men to the Hospitall, and to the Church of the Zoccolanti, commanding them to deliver up the goods of the Visitor Generall of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Don Iohn Ponze de Leon,</hi> and carried them to the Market place, but return'd them again when he was told of the kisses he had given his Nephew in the Castle the day before: yet he told him ther wold be now no necessity of a Visitor General, because he himself wold look well enough to the abuses of things, and to the public theefs of King and Countrey.</p>
            <p>In regard of these, and sundry other high insolences, which were too tedious to insert here ev'ry one a part, the whole City tremble, yea the Viceroy himself, when he understood of such extravagances and innovatious, because he thought that now all things were termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that message which was sent him by <hi>Masaniello</hi> the day before by the Archbishops Chaplain, that he wold make a full resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto him of all authority, besides the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment solemnly made and sworn unto upon Sunday before, with the stipulation of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in the Dome, so that apprehending more fear then formerly he retir'd into the inner Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, causing it to be fortified, and encreasing the gard: And it was held convenient by all
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57138:95"/>
to com to som galliard resolution, considering how that foolish and phrantic fellow pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his authority and tyranny, to dispose of all things according to his own fancy, both in the Courts of Justice, as also in the Councell of Warr, in the Grassa, and all other Tribunalls, as if he were an absolute Prince, or som impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Monark.</p>
            <p>After dinner he sent a peremptory order to <hi>Don Ferante Caracciolo,</hi> before mention'd, that under pain of life, and the burning of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, in regard he had not in the morning com out of his Coach to do him reverence, that he shold come to speak with him in the Market place; he sent also another message to <hi>Don Carlo Caracciolo</hi> Master of the Kings Horse, to do the like. They answer'd prudently and with sleme, that they wold do what he desir'd; but holding it a diminution to their honor, instead of going to the Market place, they went to the Castle, having setled their houses and goods, to complain to the Viceroy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the abject and sad condition wherin they were plung'd, with all the rest of the Napoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Nobility and Gentry, and so related unto him the arrogant Propositions that were sent them by <hi>Masaniello,</hi> so they concluded to die sooner, and to be torn by wild horses then to live, so vituperiously in such a basenesse &amp; ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, therfore 'twas high time for all the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57138:95"/>
Napolitan Cavaliers to awake, to rid the City of this intolerable ugly Monster; for it was a great blemish to their reputation to suffer him to sway so long.</p>
            <p>The Vice-Roy was extremely vex'd to hear such pungent reasons and grievances, but he durst not apprehend the fool, being so fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and back'd by the besotted peeple all in Arms; and while they were discoursing of the means how things might be remedied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Genovino</hi> and <hi>Arpaia</hi> came into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, who bitterly complained also against <hi>Masaniello.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first spoke very despitefully of him, saying that he could not prevail any thing with him, but he found himself ev'ry moment in no small danger of his life (for he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take off his head) more then he was in the time of the Duke of <hi>Ossuna,</hi> and they say that he had often given him som blowes, yet he was constrained to dissemble and mollifie things. <hi>Arpaia</hi> also had his mortifications and da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

cruelties; therefore 'twas determined by the advice of <hi>Genovino</hi> and <hi>Arpaia,</hi> that all the peeple shold make their addresses to the Vice-Roy, and assure him, that they not only mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik'd, but hated the carriage of <hi>Masaniello,</hi> and not to obey him any longer, but ev'ry where, and in all things to depend upon the commands of his Excellence, provided that they might be well assur'd of the observance of their Priviledges and Infranchisements al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted and sworn unto, whereunto the Viceroy condescending very readily, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd by public Band the confirmation of them; so they were to meet at the Piazza of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> which they did, but a great number, fearing the frownes of <hi>Masaniello</hi> came not thither, but he was gon again in the Dutchesse's Coach to Posilipo: afterwards two resolv'd to chain him, and keep him in safe custody all the residue of his life in som Castle, for they were not inclin'd to put him to death for the good things that he had ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for the public good.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Masaniello</hi> was returned from Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipo, he went to the office of the Gallies, and provided Captains and other Commanders for them, though they were far from the Port; and thence transferring himself to his house in the Market place, he threatned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Captains to take off their heads, as
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57138:96"/>
also to <hi>Genovino</hi> and <hi>Arpaia,</hi> because they had not attended him that day: nay, he threatned fire to the whole City, because he perceiv'd they had lost the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and obedience which they did use to shew him.</p>
            <p>Being extreme hot, he threw himself into the Sea water in all his clothes, and being com out again, he began to shake his sword up and down, and do divers mad pranks, nor could any, no not the Archbishop himself, bridle him, or keep him within any bounds, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Captains of the peeple were constrained to apprehend him, and put him in ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THe foresaid <hi>Marco Vitale</hi> being early got out of the Castle where the Vice-Roy kept his Court, and where he slept that night, and going about nine a clock to Chiaia the next gate to the Castle, and royall Palace, this <hi>Vitale</hi> knowing not any thing of what was intended in the behalf of the Vice-Roy against his Patron <hi>Masaniello,</hi> and meeting with some armed bands in the way confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ligu'd together, he proudly ask'd them, why, and by whose authority and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense they had taken up Arms? one of the Captains answer'd him stoutly, 'twas by order of the Viceroy, <hi>Vitale</hi> impertinently replied, Well, well, I am going now to the Market, and thy head shall pay for it: The Captain drew out his sword, and gave him a shrewd slash, which being seconded by a Musket shot, the infortunate wretch fell down dead, and being put in a sepulchre in the next Church of S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> among the Minims, the peeple
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57138:97"/>
now adhering to the Viceroy, drag'd him forth, chop'd off his head, and putting it upon a pole, they drag'd his body up and down the gutters of Naples.</p>
            <p>That day was the feast of the glorious Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of Carmine, a holy Day of very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion among the Napolitans, specially among the common peeple, that Church being situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nere the great Market place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Masaniello</hi> entred into this Church, having a little before scap'd out of his irons, where he attended the coming of the Archbishop <hi>Filo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marino</hi> to sing Masse, and celebrate the day as he us'd annually to do, and he was scarce come to the Church door when <hi>Masaniello</hi> meeting him full butt, sayed, Most eminent Lord, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive now that the peeple will abandon me, and go about to deprive me of life. I desire that for my consolation, and of all this peeple, a solemn Cavalcata be made, together with the Viceroy, with the Collaterall, and all the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunalls of the City to this most holy Lady, for being thus to die, I shall die contented: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beseech your Eminence to addresse this letter of mine to the Viceroy, the Bishop em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd him, and much commended his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and suddenly dispatch't a gentleman to the Palace with the sayed letter to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, and going afterwards to the great Altar of the Lady of Carmine, he lean'd there, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57138:98"/>
to sing Masse, the Church being full, and replenish'd with peeple as much as it could hold: <hi>Masaniello</hi> going up the degrees of the Altar, and taking a Crucifix in his hands, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended himself with much tendernesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the peeple; that they shold not forsake him, commemorating what he had don for them, he aggravated the difficulty of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, the danger he incountred withall, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of so many thousands by reason of his fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry punishments, and the conclusion at last of the whole businesse in that very Church. Then a little while he fell a doting, and accus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the badnesse of his life past, exhorting ev'ry one to make the like confession before the feet of his ghostly Father, that Gods anger might be appeas'd, and because he fell into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ridiculous expressions, and som savouring of heresie, his gard forsook him; And the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop not induring to hear him, being in the very act of celebrating the Masse, he wrought so much that he got him down, which being don, he did prostrate himself before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops feet, praying his Eminence that he wold please to send his Chaplain to the Castle, to advertise the Viceroy, that he was willing to renounce his command unto his Excellence; which the Bishop promising to do, he caus'd him to be conducted to a Dormitory to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for he was all in a sweat, and to repose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57138:98"/>
thinking him worthy of compassion: so the Bishop return'd to his Palace.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Masaniello</hi> being refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and gon out into a great Hall, he was leaning over a Balcone to take the fresh air sea-ward, som hardy gentlemen rush'd in, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with much peeple, who having first entred into the Church of Carmine, cried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, Let the King of Spain live, and let none hereafter under pain of life obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>Masaniello</hi>: and going thence to the Cloister under pretext to speak with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saniello,</hi> and negotiate with him, they found him almost all alone, and hearing som body crying <hi>Masaniello,</hi> the unfortunate wretch meeting with those who were conspir'd to dispatch him, he told them, Ye go perhaps in search of me; Behold me here my peeple: So they discharg'd four musquet shots at him eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one apart: the first were <hi>Salvador,</hi> and <hi>Carlo Cataneo</hi> brothers, <hi>Angelo Ardizzone,</hi> and <hi>Andrea Rama,</hi> who were four of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall that slew him: so he fell presently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, crying after the first shot, Ah in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull traytors! And so he breath'd his last. Hereupon a butcher came and cut off his head, which being put upon a lance, they went into the Church of Carmine, where there were ten thousand peeple, and thence to the market place, crying out, Let the King of Spain live,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57138:99"/>
and under pain of life let none henceforth name <hi>Masaniello. Masaniello</hi> is dead, <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niello</hi> is dead; and discharging many archibuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, <hi>ad terrorem</hi> without ball, the common peeple were so affrighted that they lost their spirits quite; and seeing themselves headlesse, they skulk'd here and there, not daring to do the least outrage unto them who flew their Captain Generall, that was so much fear'd, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd, and reverenc'd: Insomuch that they went securely up and down the streets, with his head upon a pole, and the boyes dragging his body up and down the channells and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like wayes, where there was money thrown to them that drew him, by many, specially by the Gentry, who all this while durst scarce peep out of their houses, or appeer abroad publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: So they got a horse-back, and went to the Castle to attend the Viceroy, and give him the joy, who entertain'd them with infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of contentment. The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop went also thither, who after he had com from the Carmine, had scarce reach'd his own palace, but the tidings of <hi>Masaniello</hi>'s death was brought him, which made him go directly to the Castle to acquit himself of those duties of congratulation which were due to the Viceroy, who sending very strict Orders abroad that the street Captains shold be in a perfect equipage and readinesse at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57138:99"/>
and that upon pain of life they shold not obey any body else whatsoever. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to apprehend the complices of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saniello,</hi> as was don; as his wife, his sisters, his kinred; and being all made prisoners, they were brought up to the Castle.

            <p>There were armed bands sent also to the market place to bridle the peeple, and gard the goods that were there depositated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to divers owners.</p>
            <p>These good Orders being given, the Viceroy was exhorted by the Bishop, and by all the Nobility, and Ministers Royall, to shew himself publikely up and down the streets; Whereupon the Bishop and he mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on horse-back, attended by all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours, Ministers, Officers, Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with all the Tribunalls, being well garded with Horse and Infantry, they went to the chiefe Church to give God thanks, and the most glorious protector of Naples S. <hi>Gennaro,</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:57138:100"/>
whose holy head and blood was taken out and put upon the high Altar, where extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thanks were given for the tranquillity which was re-obtain'd by the death of so base a fellow, who by the secret judgements of God, had made himselfe so formidable, that he terrified the whole City: a cleer instrument, it cannot be said otherwise, of the just indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God, being offended with the sins of that City, who (as somtimes he punish'd the Egyptians with small contemptible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as flies, and frogs) did correct, humble, and chastise the City of Naples by so vile a Plebean.</p>
            <p>From the Church the Cavalcata pass'd to the Market place, where the Viceroy did again by sound of Trumpet confirm the Priviledges granted by <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> together with the Capitulations; he was receiv'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme exultances of joy by all the peeple, who loudly cryed out, <hi>Viva il Re, viva il Duca d' Arcos</hi>; Let the King live, live the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> whereunto others added, Let <hi>Filoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> live, the restorer of his Countreyes peace: they gave also thanks to the most holy Mother of Carmine, and so they returned into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle very joyfull, and afterwards ev'ry one unto his own home.</p>

This quietnesse was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in a manner, for the many circumstances that attended it, wherof you shall have distinct advise; that which I can say now unto you, is that from the mouth of the Lord <hi>Cardinal</hi> himself the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>San Gennaro</hi> was seen over the great Church of Carmine, with a sword in his hand, and ther were many persons examin'd upon Oaths about this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. His Reverence also saw as he went to the Church of Carmine a most bright star, which gave him undoubted hopes of peace and quietnesse, which God hath pleas'd to restore to this place by his Intercession, for he kept all the while the will of the sayed <hi>Masaniello</hi> in his fist, as it were, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he did few things but what his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence pleas'd and commanded; and he was so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as not to propose any thing, but what was fit to be obtain'd for the universall good. In sum, he hath given unto his Catholic Majesty our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord the Kingdom, and hath so confirm'd it, that for the future there is no fear of any combustions, and this people is so well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the abolishments of the gab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ace aforesayed, many Nobles and Cavaliers were seen to passe ev'ry day along the streets to the Castle in their Coaches, shewing themselfs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the peeple, from whose sight they had kept themselfs hugger mugger before. The Ladies also went up and down with their fardingalls, which formerly they durst not do, by reason of <hi>Masaniello</hi>'s order to the contrary, yet they moderated their expences, and train, specially those who were us'd to gain by the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells.</p>
            <p>The same time that <hi>Masaniello</hi> was slain, ther happen'd two accidents, the first was, that the head and foot of <hi>Don Peppo Caraffa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining still, expos'd to public view in an iron

There was scarce news had of the death of <hi>Masaniello,</hi> but that in that confusion of peeple, four gentlemen adventur'd, being kin to the family of the <hi>Mataloni,</hi> to go boldly to the sayed gate, and in a commanding way, though ther were 1000. soldiers thereabout, they got a ladder, and climing up, they broke the Iron grate with the Inscription, and took out the head, which they carried in a fair sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bason, cover'd with a silk towell, and brought it to the next Parish Church, cal'd <hi>San Iohn de Porta,</hi> delivering it to the Curat of that Church, <hi>Iohn Baptista Iulino,</hi> and caus'd it afterwards to be put in a leaden box, and that an authentic Instrument shold be made, <hi>ad futuram rei memoriam,</hi> by a public Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Notary authoriz'd by the Court of Rome, call'd <hi>Don Maria de Iuliis:</hi> within the sayed Church ther were for eye-witnesses, <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Mastello, Gennaro de Pece, Gio. Baptista Piccirillo.</hi> The four gentlemen who did this hardy act, were <hi>Girolamo Laudata,</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Marzano,</hi> and Cavaliers, <hi>Gastani</hi> sons to a <hi>Carrafesca</hi> mother, <hi>Don Scipion, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57138:102"/>
Antonio Rastaldi; Gio. Baptista d' Afflitto,</hi> whose names are inserted in the sayed Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perpetuity.</p>
            <p>The second accident was, that <hi>Masaniello</hi> a little before his death began to feel the pulses of the richest men up and down the City, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of them many thousands of crowns, because he purpos'd, as he gave out, to make five millions of gold for the King, which he had promis'd to his Excellence already by way of Donative: which millions were effectually to be made up out of the moneys found in the burnt houses, and a contribution of the Cape Merchants &amp; Citizens of Naples, which he had effected within a few daies, had he not died, therfore 'twas question'd whether his death tended more to the service or disservice of Spain.</p>
            <p>Amongst those rich Merchants he had sent to one <hi>Gaspar Roomer,</hi> a most rich Flemin, who to prevent the firing of his house, sent twelve thousand crowns unto <hi>Masaniello,</hi> and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd to a very fair house, four miles out of the City, a place call'd <hi>la Barra,</hi> carrying with him all his best moveables, and goods he had in Naples. To this Marchant he sent <hi>Savino Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verso</hi> of the Carmine, a great confident of his the same Tuesday, the day that he was slain; with an order of his in writing, at sight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he was to consign unto him 5000<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Zecchins,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57138:103"/>
for the service of his Catholic Majesty, since that he had grown so rich out of good bargains he had from the Viceroys from time to time; <hi>Roomer</hi> could not tell how to avoid the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with his desires, and obey them; so he deliver'd so much money in ready gold to the messenger, who leaving a receipt behind him, and returning to Naples, he understood, as he pass'd by a little Church hard by the Carmine, of what happen'd to <hi>Masaniello,</hi> so he imbark'd himself in a Felluca, and went away with the moneys to Rome; therupon the Merchant sent spies up and down to find him out: at last by the help of those of his Order, for he was a Fryer, he had notice where he was, and so recover'd much of his money.</p>
            <p>That Tuesday in the evening, was brought to Naples the brother of the sayed <hi>Masaniello,</hi> and committed prisoner to the Castle, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his mother, and as they pass'd, all cryed out room, room for the Lady Duchesse of <hi>Sarda</hi>; With the brother of <hi>Maesaniello</hi> were brought four heads of his companions, who wold not yeeld themselfs, but make resistance with musquet shot, and nine were taken alive, the rest mortally wounded, or put to flight.</p>
            <p>In this manner ended the life and Empire of <hi>Masaniello,</hi> having foretold it himself the ninth of July, the week before, being the third day of the Revolution, when going up to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket

place, he told the peeple, that what he did, was for the public benefit of the City, and he knew well, that when he had finish'd the work he <hi>shold be slain, and drag'd up and down the streets of Naples</hi>; yet he desir'd the peeple shold remember him, and they answer'd we will all die with thee. And so it happen'd, that having confirm'd the interests of the City upon Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and caus'd their priviledges, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of them, to be subscrib'd and sworn unto by the Viceroy, and all the Councells, he was the third day after assassinated, and hal'd up and down the streets; his head was thrown into a ditch, call'd the corn-ditch hard by the house of <hi>Ardizzone,</hi> and his body cast into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ditch between the gates of <hi>Nolana</hi> and <hi>Capoana.</hi>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57138:105"/>
Catholic Majesty, the greatest part whereof were impos'd by the voices of the Nobility and Gentry, and with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of penall mandates and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: having also within these few yeers of War (which his Catholic Majesty hath had) leavied from them one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred millions, whereby this most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full peeple was, and is reduc'd to such an extreme necessity, that the greater part of them were ready to famish, and the Fathers, Mothers, and Husbands were constrained at very low rates to expose the most dear treasure of honesty, and chastity of living, by reason of those hard and violent exactions of the said Gabells, for which, peeple of all sexes were cast into prisons, executed, and forc'd to pay under pain of excessive punishments, there being promis'd on the contrary to the Nobility, and powerfull persons, an exemption from the said Gabells and Impositions; whereby many of them became extremely rich, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and farming the said Impositions; The said Nobles and royall Ministers
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57138:105"/>
and Officers being permitted further to offend the persons, and possesse the goods of the said peeple, insomuch that a company of poor and little children to whom these pressures were reveal'd, with weak canes and sticks did appeare before the most excellent the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> Viceroy of this Kingdom and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, upon the 7. day of July of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent yeer, 1647. for to have the peeple eas'd of the said onerous exactions, with whom this most faithfull peeple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd with Armes in hand for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Priviledges, and were permitted without incurring any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to resist those that were the Authors of these burthens and dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: And his Excellency the Viceroy having taken notice hereof, together with the Collaterall and Councell of State and War, was pleas'd to abolish the said Gabells and Impositions of this City and Kingdom, and also in remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the perfect and lively fidelity of this peeple, demonstrated so often by their acclamations, <hi>Let the King of Spain

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57138:106"/>
for the defence of this most faithful pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the 21. of August last past, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with these cries, <hi>let the King of Spain live,</hi> with other demonstrations of love and Loyalty towards his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty. Whereupon his sayed Excellency granted new graces and priviledges, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying also those things, which were the causes of grievance to this most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full peeple, and so reduc'd again this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to peace and universall tranquillity, by the mediation of their most reverend Archbishop aforesayed, who went up and down this City on horseback, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this most faithfull peeple of the sayed peace and quietnesse, another so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oath ensuing thereupon from the sayed Viceroy, within the Church of <hi>Santa Barbara,</hi> which is in Castlenuovo, the seventh of September, 1647. Now expecting the confirmation of all the sayed Graces and Priviledges from his Catholic Majesty, on the first of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, the report being going abroad suddenly, though doubtfull at first, that his Highnesse, <hi>Don Iohn of Austria</hi> his
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57138:107"/>
Majesties Son was to arrive at this Port, with a royall Army, this peeple did run with an universall applause, thirsting to see so noble a personage, beeing of the blood of her most beloved King, and when from day to day they hoped to see him, it was represented unto them that he wold not dis-imbarque, if this most faithfull peeple wold not lay downe their Armes, which was suddenly don, although according to their Priviledges they might have refus'd to have don it; insomuch that upon Saturday in the morning the fifth of the same moneth, there appear'd not one armed person throughout the whole City, but there was an universall quietnesse; And as they were greedy to see such a Prince from whom they expected graces and favors, upon a sudden about mid-day this City was occupied by the royall Soldiers by force of Armes, entring into many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries and Conservatories, violating Virgins, and committing other exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant excesses; and at the same time the City was assaulted, and battered with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

8000. Cannon shot from the three Castles on ev'ry side, and by above forty vessells and Gallies for many days and nights continually, and since that time to this, whereby so gentle, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a City, the garden of Europe, was like to be made even to the ground, with all her most noble Edifices, Churches, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries of both Sexes, with other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of piety, and her Inhabitants extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd against all piety and Religion; but the blessed Lord did not permit that such cruell and fierce acts of his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Majesties Ministers shold have the effect of their desires.</p>
            <p>Wherefore this most faithfull peeple hath been constrained to have recourse to the naturall remedy for their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and having no hopes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of quietnesse, or that the royall Ministers wold perform what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd so often; 'twas thought therefore necessary to fly first to the divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, to the most glorious Virgin his Mother, and to the blessed <hi>San Gennaro,</hi> and to all the other Saints, who are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57138:108"/>
