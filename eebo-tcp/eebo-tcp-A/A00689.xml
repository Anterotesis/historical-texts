            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ſande of the riuers is altogether ſtony ſande, of the colour of golde, and it ſheweth as though that it were al gold. There are in this Ilande many Hogges, and much Deare. There is found in the powre of the <hi>Indians,</hi> much gold and coper, and alſo much gilt Coper. The <hi>Indians</hi> do ſay that they gilte the Coper with an hearbe that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that countrey, whiche beyng ſtamped, and the iuyce ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, and the Coper beyng waſhed therewith and put to the fire, it turneth to the colour of moſt fine gold, and it riſeth more or leſſe in colour, accordyng to the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie of the hearbe that is put to it. The people be fearce and warlike, they vſe bowes, and their arrowes be little bigger than quarrels, which they annoynt with an hearbe that is ſo full of poyſon, that it is a great chaunce (when they hit any man) if he eſcape, beyng wounded with that hearbe: one of the things wherewith they make that hearb, are certaine apples which be in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, <note place="margin">Appels of poyſon.</note> &amp; are of the greatneſſe and colour of the wilde Apples of this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie.

And if any man do put himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one of theſe trees in the ſhadowe, immediatly his head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to ake: &amp; if he do continue there long, his face begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ſwell, &amp; to trouble his ſight: and if by chaunce he ſleepe vnder the tree, immediatly he loſeth his ſight: all this I haue ſeene by experience. Before you come to <hi>Sancta Marta</hi> there is <hi>Yaharo,</hi> which is in the ſide of the ſnowie mountaynes. <hi>Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haro</hi> as a good port and ſtandeth in a good countrey: and there <note place="margin">Yaharo.</note> be Orchardes of trees of diuers ſortes of fruytes to be eaten, &amp; among them there is one like to Oringes, &amp; when the fruite is in ſeaſon to be eaten it turneth yellow, and the meate that is within it is like to butter: It hath a good ſauour, and hath the taſt ſo good &amp; ſo ſoft, that it is maruelous. The mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines that lie full of Snow, beginne from <hi>Sancta Marta:</hi> and neare to <hi>Yaharo</hi> is the higheſt parte of them, and they ſhew vpon the toppes as white as if they were Snowe, and from thence they reache to <hi>Veneciuela,</hi> and ſo into the countrey within, it is not <note place="margin">Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayns vvith Snovve.</note> knowen how farre, for that the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie is not yet in ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor the <hi>Indians</hi> do giue any more reaſon of them, but that they reache very farre into the countrie.
