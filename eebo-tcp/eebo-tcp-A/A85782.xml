            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
EXTEMPORARY ANSVVER
To a cluſter of drunkards, met together at <hi>Schiedam:</hi> Made by
<hi>Timothy Gunton,</hi> who was compelled thereto, upon his
refuſall to drink the Kings health.
Whether ſuch impetuous drinking of other mens healths were lawfull,
profitable, commendable, or reaſonable?</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F lawfull, it is either by the Lawes of God, or man: If of God, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in holy writ, which is the old and new Teſtament; but from the
Alpha of Geneſis, to the Omega of the Revelations, there is no ſuch
thing commanded; therefore not by the Lawes of God. If by the Lawes
of man, ſearch the Records, review the Statutes, and ſhew in whoſe reign,
and what yeare it was enacted.</p>
            <p>If profitable, it muſt conduce to the good, either of ſoul or body: If
of the ſoul, it muſt be ſuitable, convenient, and agreeable to the ſoul; But the ſoul is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
creature, not capable either to eat, or drink any materiall ſubſtance: If of the body,
then be ye your own judges, what profit have ye to drinke the money out of the purſe, the
wit out of the brain, the bread from wife and children, the health from the body, and the
peace of God both from ſoul and body?</p>
            <p>If commendable, it is commended either by wiſe men, or fooles: By wiſe men, who know
a thing to be good; By fooles, who ſuppoſe a thing to be good: But wiſe men know that
man is the Image of God, and by his reaſonable ſoul he is diſtinguiſhed from other
creatures, and other creatures cannot (contrary to reaſon) be compelled to drink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
appetite; yet man being become worſe then a beaſt, not only drinks himſelf, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
compels others to drink, untill they vomit it up againe; Wherefore, no wiſe man will
commend it; And if a foole commend it, it is for want of wit.</p>
            <p>If reaſonable, let all the world cenſure, what reaſon hath one man to drink another mans
health, to impair his own?</p>
            <lg>
               <l>By theſe let all men know 'tis worſe then ſordid ſtealth,</l>
               <l>To fawn upon a friend, and ſwallow down his health.</l>
               <l>Yet ſome audacious Rogues dare in their drunken notes</l>
               <l>Pour King, and Kingdomes health down their ungodly throats</l>
               <l>And ſtove it in their ſtinking paunch an hour, or twain,</l>
               <l>And then they'l ſpew, and cag, and piſſe it out again.</l>
               <l>Oh then how ſick art thou poore King, and common-wealth,</l>
               <l>While drunken ſots daily drink, piſſe, and ſpew thy health.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For theſe my lines I'le pardon crave,</l>
               <l>And promiſe eke they ſhall be mended:</l>
               <l>But firſt I muſt ſome reaſon have,</l>
               <l>Wherein, and whom they have offended.</l>
