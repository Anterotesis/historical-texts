            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>DYalling</hi> originally is a <hi>Mathematical Science,</hi> attained by the Philosophical contemplation of the motion of the Sun, the motion of the Shaddow, the Constitution of the Sphere, the Scituation of Planes, and the consideration of Lines.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Explanation.</head>
            <p>THE motion of the Sun is regular, it moving equal Space in equal Time; But the motion of the Shaddow irregular in all parts of the Earth, unless under the two Poles, and that more or less according to the Constitution of the <hi>Sphere</hi> and scituation of the <hi>Plane.</hi> And therefore Scientifick Dyalists by the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrick considerations of Lines, have found out Rules to mark out the irregular motion of the <hi>Shaddow</hi> in all <hi>Latitudes,</hi> and on all <hi>Planes,</hi> to comply with the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion of the Sun. And these Rules of adjusting the motion of the Shaddow to the motion of the Sun may be called <hi>Scientifick Dyalling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60072:3"/>But though we may justly account <hi>Dyalling</hi> original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Science,</hi> yet such hath been the Generosity of many of its studious Contemplators, that they have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated their acquired Rules; whereby it is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to many of the Ingenious no more difficult than an <hi>Art,</hi> and by many late Authors so intituled: Nay more, by this small Treatise it will scarce be accounted more than a <hi>Manual Operation</hi>; for, though (hitherto) all the Authors I have met with seem to presuppose their Reader to understand <hi>Geometry,</hi> and the <hi>projecting of the Sphere</hi> already, or else endeavour in their Works to make him understand them, as if they were absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary to be known by every one that would make a Dyal, when as in truth (the contemplative pains of others aforesaid considered) they are not; but indeed are only useful to those that would know the reason of Dyalling. Thus they do not only discourage young beginners, but also disappoint many Gentlemen and others that would willingly either make them themselves, or set their Workmen about them, if they knew how to make them.</p>
            <p>This little Piece I have therefore composed for the help of those who understand neither the <hi>Projection of the Sphere,</hi> or <hi>Geometrical Operations:</hi> Only, if they know how to draw a straight Line between two Points by the side of a Ruler, describe a Circle with a pair of Compasses, erect a Perpendicular, and draw one Line parallel to another, they may know how to draw a Dyal for any given <hi>Plane,</hi> however scituated in any Latitude.</p>
            <p>But perhaps these two last little Tricks are not known to all new beginners, therefore I shall shew them. First,</p>

            <p>Upon the Line AB you would erect a Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the Point C: Place one Foot of your Compasses upon the point C, and open the other to what distance you please; For <hi>Example,</hi> to the point A, make there a mark; then keeping the first Foot

still in C, turn the other Foot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward B, and make there another mark; then open your Compasses wider, suppose to the length AB, and placing one Foot in the point A, with the other Foot describe a small Arch over the point C, and removing the Foot of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes to the point B, with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foot describe another small Arch, to cut the first Arch, as at D. Then lay your straight Ruler to the point where the two small Arches cut each other, and upon the point C, and by the side of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler draw the Line CD, which shall be a Perpendicular to the Line AB.</p>

            <p>THE Clinatory is made of a square Board, as ABCD, of a good thickness;, and the larger the better; between two of the side is described on the Center Aa <hi>Quadrant</hi> as EF devided into 90 equal parts or degrees, which are figured with 10, 20, 30, to 90; and then back again with the Complements of the same numbers to 90: between the Limb and the two Semi-diameters is made a round Box, into which a Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Needle is fitted; and a Card of the Nautical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, devided into four Nineties, beginning their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at the East, West, North, and South points of the Compass, from which points the opposite sides of the Clinatory receives their Names of East, West, North and South.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Note,</hi> that the North point of the Card must be placed so many degrees towards the East or West sides of the Clinatory as the Needle varies from the true

            <p>Upon the Center A, whereon the <hi>Quadrant</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, is fastened a Plumb-line, having a Plumbet of Lead or Brass fastned to the end of it, which Plumb-line is of such length that the Plumbet may fall just in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Grove GH, below the <hi>Quadrant,</hi> which is for that purpose made of such a depth that the Plumbet may ride freely within it, without stopping at the sides of it.

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60072:6"/>With this Clinatory you may examine the scituation of Planes. As if your Plane be Horizontal, it is direct: and then for the true scituating your Dyal you have only the true North and South Line to find: which is done only by setting the Clinatory flat down upon the Plane, and turning it towards the right or left hand, till you can bring the North point of the Needle to hang just over the Flower-de-luce, for then if you draw a Line by either of the sides parallel to the Needle, that Line shall be a North and South Line.</p>
            <p>If Your Plane either Recline or Incline, Apply one of the sides of your Clinatory parallel to one of the Semi-diameters of the <hi>Quadrant</hi> to the Plane, in such sort that the Plumb-line hanging at liberty, may fall upon the Circumference of the <hi>Quadrant,</hi> for then the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of degrees of the <hi>Quadrant</hi> comprehended between the side of the <hi>Quadrant</hi> parallel to the Plane, and the Plumb-line shall be the number of degrees for Reclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the Center of the <hi>Quadrant</hi> points upwards; or Inclination, if the Center points downwards.</p>
            <p>If your Reclining or Inclining Plane Decline, Draw upon it a Line parallel to the Horizon, which you may do by applying the back-side of the Clinatory, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or depressing the Center of the Quadrant, till the Plumb-line hang just upon one of the Semi-diameters, for then you may by the upper side of the Clinatory draw an Horizontal Line if the Plane Incline, or by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der side if it Recline. If it neither Incline or Recline, you may draw a Horizontal Line both by the upper and under sides of the Clinatory. Having drawn the Horizontal Line, apply the North side of the Clinatory to it, and if the North end of the Needle points direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the Plane, it is then a South Plane. If the North point of the Needle points directly from the Plane,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60072:6"/>
it is a North Plane: but if it points towards the East, it is an East Plane: if towards the West, a West Plane. If it do not point directly either East, West, North, or South, then so many degrees as the Needle declines from any of these four points to any of the other of these four points, so many degrees is the Declination of the Plane.</p>
            <p>You may find a Meridian Line another way; thus, If the Sun shine just at Noon, hold up a Plumb-line so as the shaddow of it may fall upon your Plane, and that shaddow shall be a <hi>Meridian Line.</hi>

            <p>We will suppose you are to draw a <hi>Dyal</hi> that <hi>declines</hi> from the <hi>South</hi> 50 Degrees towards the <hi>East</hi>; here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one Dyal, you need describe but one <hi>Quadrant</hi> of a Circle. Set off in the lower <hi>Quadrant</hi> WAM 50 degrees from the <hi>Meridian Line</hi> M towards W, and from the Center A draw a straight Line through that mark in the <hi>Quadrant</hi> as DA, which may be called the <hi>Line of Declination</hi>; then set off from the <hi>Meridian Line</hi> the <hi>Complement</hi> of the <hi>Poles Elevation,</hi> which in our Latitude is 38 ½ degrees, and there draw another Line from the Center as AP, which we will

            <p>First draw on your <hi>Plane</hi> a straight Line parallel to the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and mark one end W for <hi>West,</hi> and the other E for <hi>East.</hi> On <hi>South Incliners</hi> and <hi>Recliners,</hi> E on the right hand, and W on the left: on <hi>North Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and <hi>Recliners</hi> E on the left hand and W on the right.

Then if the <hi>Plane</hi> respect the <hi>South,</hi> set off in the lower <hi>Quadrant</hi> from the Perpendicular the <hi>Declination,</hi> the <hi>Inclination,</hi> or the <hi>Reclination,</hi> and the <hi>Complement</hi> of the <hi>Altitude</hi> of the <hi>Pole</hi>; and through these several settings off in the <hi>Quadrant,</hi> draw straight Lines from the Center A; then take in the <hi>Horizontal</hi> Line towards the Semi-Circle, a convenient distance from the Center A, as B, and through the point B draw a straight Line parallel to the Perpendicular, and prolong it through the <hi>Polar</hi> Line, as BP: Through the point P, draw a Line parallel to the <hi>Horizontal</hi> Line, as PC; this Line will cut the Line of <hi>Obliquity</hi> in the point O: Then measure the distance of AO, and set
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60072:18"/>
off that distance on the Perpendicular from A to F, and through the point F draw a straight Line parallel to the <hi>Horizontal</hi> Line, as FG, for the <hi>Horizontal</hi> Interse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Then measure the distance of CO, and set off that distance on the Perpendicular from A to I; from the point I, draw the Line ID parallel to the <hi>Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Line, to cut the Line of <hi>Declination</hi> in the point D. Then measure the distance of AB, and set off that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the Line of <hi>Declination</hi> from A to E; and from the point E draw a straight Line parallel to the <hi>Horizontal</hi> Line WE, to cut the Perpendicular in the point K.

            <figure/>
            <p>Then to find the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line, <hi>Substile</hi> and <hi>Stile,</hi> do thus. If your <hi>Plane</hi> be a <hi>Southern Incliner,</hi> or a <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Recliner,</hi> measure the distance of LD, and set off
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60072:18"/>
that distance in the <hi>Horizontal</hi> Intersection from F to M, and through the point M draw the Line AM for the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line. Then add the distance of AL to AK, thus: measure the distance of AL, and place one Foot of your Compasses in the point K in the Perpendicular Line, and extend the other to X, and measuring the distance of AX, set it off in the Line of <hi>Obliquity</hi> from A to Q; and from the point Q draw the Line QR parallel to the Perpendicular, and cutting the <hi>Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Line in the point R. Then measure the distance of AR, and set off that distance from H in the <hi>Horizontal</hi> Intersection to S on the Line HN, and to the point S draw the Line AS for the <hi>Substile.</hi> Then measure the distance of QR, and set off that distance perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly from the point S to T; and lastly, from the point A, draw the straight Line AT for the <hi>Stilar</hi> Line, which <hi>Stilar</hi> Line being perpendicularly erected over the <hi>Substilar</hi> Line AS, will stand parallel to the <hi>Axis of the World,</hi> and cast its shadow on the Hour of the Day.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Plane</hi> be a <hi>Southern Recliner,</hi> or <hi>Northern Incliner,</hi> measure (as before) the distance of LD, and (as before you were directed) to set it off from F in the <hi>Horizontal</hi> Intersection on the right hand the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Line; So now, set that distance from F to <hi>m</hi> in the <hi>Horizontal</hi> Intersection on the left hand in the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Line, and draw the Line A<hi>m</hi> for the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line. Then as before you were directed to add AL to AK: So now, substract the distance of AL from AK, and the remainder will be LK: Set therefore the distance of IK from A to <hi>q</hi> in the same <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Obliquity,</hi> and from the point <hi>q,</hi> draw the Line <hi>qr</hi> parallel to the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular.

The point in the middle of this Glass we will mark A, and for distinction sake call it <hi>Nodus.</hi> Through this <hi>Nodus</hi> you must draw a <hi>Meridian</hi> Line on the Floor, Thus, Hang a Plumb-line in the Window exactly over <hi>Nodus,</hi> and the Shadow that the Plumb-line casts on the Floor just at Noon will be a <hi>Meridian</hi> Line; or you may find a <hi>Meridian</hi> Line other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by the Clinatory.

thus, Hold a Plumb-line to the Ceeling, over that end of the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line next the Window; If the Plumbet hang not exactly on the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line on the Floor, remove your hand on the Ceeling one way or other, as you see cause, till it do hang quietly just over it, and at the point where the Plumb-line touches the Ceeling make a mark, as at B; that mark B shall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line on the Floor: then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move your Plumb-line to the other end of the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line on the Floor, and find a point on the Ceeling di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over it, as you did the former point, as at C, and through these two points B and C on the Ceeling, strain and strike a Line blackt with Smal-Coal or any other Colour (as Carpenters do) and that Line BC on the Ceeling shall be the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line, as well as that on the Floor: Then fasten a string just on the <hi>Nodus,</hi> and remove that string, forwards or backwards, in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian</hi> Line on the Ceeling, till it have the same E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation in the <hi>Quadrant</hi> on the <hi>Clinatory</hi> above the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon</hi> that the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> hath in your Habitation, and through the point where the string touches the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line in the Ceeling shall a line be drawn at right Angles with the <hi>Meridian,</hi> to represent the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> Line.</p>
            <p>Thus in our Latitude the Elevation of the Equator being 38 ½ degrees; I remove the string fastned to the <hi>Nodus</hi> forwards or backwards in the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line of the Ceeling, till the Plumb-line of the <hi>Quadrant</hi> on the <hi>Clinatory,</hi> when one of the sides are applied to the string, falls upon 38 ½ degrees: and then I find it touch the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian</hi> Line at D in the Ceeling: therefore at DI make a mark, and through this mark strike the line DE (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I did in the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line) to cut the <hi>Meridian</hi> Line at right Angles: This Line shall be the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> Line, and serve to denote the Hour Distances, as the

Then remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the string the space of 15 degrees in the <hi>Quadrant,</hi> and extending it to the <hi>Equator</hi> on the Ceeling, where the string touches the <hi>Equator,</hi> there shall be a point through which the I a Clock Hour line shall be drawn: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the string yet 15 degrees further to the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Semi-Circle of Position, and extending it also to the <hi>Equator,</hi> where it touches the <hi>Equator,</hi> there shall be a point through which the II a Clock Hour Line shall be drawn.

            <p>Having thus found out the points in the <hi>Equator</hi> through which the After-noon Hour Lines are to be drawn, I may find the Fore-noon Hour distances also the same way, <hi>viz.</hi> by removing the Arch of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant</hi> to the <hi>West</hi> side the <hi>Meridian,</hi> as before it was placed on the <hi>East,</hi> and bringing the string to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral 15 degrees on the <hi>West</hi> side the <hi>Quadrant</hi>; or else I need only measure the distances of each Hours di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

            <p>Then draw close by the edge of your straight Ruler a Line parallel to the edge, and at about 1/20 part of an Inch a second Line parallel to that, and at about ⅛ of an Inch a third Line parallel to both. Then place one Foot of your Compasses at the beginning of the first degree on the <hi>Quadrant</hi> descibed on the Board, as at B, and open the other Foot to the end of the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and transfer that distance upon your Rule, from B to the first mark or devision, between the two first drawn Lines.

            <p>To this is added on the <hi>Pedestal</hi> a Projection of all the appearing Constellations in this <hi>Horizon,</hi> with their Figures and Shapes. And besides, several new things in it differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the common Astrolabe, (tending to a clearer and quicker way of Operating) the very Principles of all <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographical</hi> Projections are laid down, and <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> demonstrated; as is every thing else of Moment throughout the whole Treatise.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Globes</hi> will be made and exposed to Sale about <hi>August</hi> next, (God willing:) against which time the Book for its use will also be Printed, and sold by <hi>Joseph Moxon,</hi> on <hi>Ludgate-Hill,</hi> at the Sign of <hi>Atlas.</hi>
