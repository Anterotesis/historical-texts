         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE FORM
OF HIS
MAJESTIES
CORONATION-FEAST
To be ſolemnized and kept at
WESTMINSTER-HALL
Up on the 23. of <hi>April</hi> 1661</head>
            <p>HIs Majeſty having declared that he will keep
the Feaſt of his Coronation in <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi>
Hall in ſuch manner as moſt of his Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
have done, the preparations enſuing,
are to be made in order thereunto, according
to ancient preſidents.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Hall is to be hung with hangings ſuitable to ſo
great a Solemnity.</p>
            <p>At the upper end the Marble Chair is to be adorned, and
a rich State over it, and the floor of the place where the King
dines, and the rayles, to be covered with red Worſted.</p>
            <p>The Order of the whole Feaſt is to be appointed by the
Lord Steward, and Officers of his Majeſties houſhold to
whom ſuch perſons as are to do any ſervice by vertue of
their Tenures ought to apply themſelves.</p>
            <p>There is a Room to be appointed for his Majeſty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into, and repoſe after his return from the Church untill
the firſt courſe be on the Table.</p>
            <p>After his Majeſty is retired, the Earle Marſhal by his Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaves
cauſeth room to be made in the Hall.</p>
            <p>When Dinner is ready, the Lord Steward, between the
Conſtable and Marſhal mounted on rich Trapped Horſes,
having the Treaſurer and Comptrouler, and Serjeants at
Armes on foot before them, ride into the Hall before the
Sewer.</p>
            <p>The Sewer ought to be an Earle, and the Servitors that
bring up the firſt Courſe Knights of the Bath, and other
Knights.</p>
            <p>The firſt Courſe being ſet on the Table, the King returns
from his Chamber into the Hall, and ſtanding before the
Table, the Baſon is brought by two Earls, the high Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain
and another, and the Towell by another Earle, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants
at Armes going before them.</p>
            <p>The King having waſhed, ſits down, and two Eſquires of
the Body are to ſit at His feet.</p>
            <p>The Arch-biſhop ſits at the end of the Kings Table, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of Dinner the four Swords are to be held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King.</p>
            <p>Anciently there were four Tables more in the Hall. At
the right hand of the Hall next the Wall ſit the Barons
of the Cinque Ports, and below them on the ſame ſide, the
Maſters and Clerks of the Chancery.</p>
            <p>At the Table on the left hand next the wall, ſit the Major,
Recorder, Aldermen and principal Citizens of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the right ſide of the Table on the right hand in the midſt
of the Hall, ſit the Biſhops, and beneath them the Judges,
and Barons of the Exchequer.</p>
            <p>At a table on the left ſide, the Lords Temporal and other
perſons of quality.</p>
            <p>Upon a Scaffold on the right hand of the Kings board are
the Heraulds to be placed, and there to have a Table.</p>
            <p>In another on the left hand the Muſitians.</p>
            <p>In a Scaffold over the lower door of the Hall, are the
Trumpets to be placed.</p>
            <p>The King being at the firſt Courſe, the Champion comes
in armed in the Kings Armor, and mounted on a Courler of
the Kings, richly trapped with cloth of Gold, he is brought
in by the Conſtable and Marſhal, before him a Trumpet
ſounding, and an Herauld at Armes, and in the preſence of
the King and Audience of all the people, after the Trumpet
hath made three ſeveral Summons, The Herauld is to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
theſe Words with a high voice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That there is no man of high or law eſtate, who will ſay that our
Soveraign Leige Lord <hi>CHARLES</hi> the <hi>II.</hi> Sonne and Heir
apparent of <hi>CHARLES</hi> the <hi>I.</hi> Late King of <hi>England</hi> ought
not to be Crowned King of <hi>England,</hi> againſt whom he the ſaid
Champion is not ready with his body to maintain, and will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that he does falſly lye as a Traytor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon the Champion is to caſt down his Gantler,
which lying on the ground a while, the Herauld is to take up,
and to give to the Champion.</p>
            <p>The like Proclamation is to be made in the middle of the
Hall, and at the lower end, which done, the Champion is to
ride up to the Kings board, and then the King taking a guilt
or gold Cup with a cover, and drinking ſome of the wine,
is to ſend the ſame to the Champion, who drinking off the
wine, is to carry the Cup covered in his hand through the
Hall, and to have the ſame for his Fee.</p>
            <p>At the ſecond courſe Garter King of Armes accompanied
with all other Officers of Armes is to Proclaim the Kings
Style in three ſeveral places of the Hall, and then to return
to his State again.</p>
            <p>After Dinner the Major of <hi>London</hi> is to preſent the King
with a Cup of Gold full of wine, and an Ewer of water, and
after the King hath drank he is to have the Cup and Ewer
for his pains.</p>
