            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And euery exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable fortune of tyrannes / is set as a monici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the same gouernours nat to be of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous behauour / lest at last they may fal i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke miserable ruyne &amp; calamite. And also (as sayth Cicero) a man to knowe nothing of that which was done before his tyme &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: that is as who sayth alway to be a chylde. But it is a thyng very comely: &amp; necessary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other: to knowe these cronycles &amp; noble actes of auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t tyme &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance to kepe in mynde the order &amp; courses of antiquite: and to haue in <abbr>mynd</abbr> the knowledge of exemples for euery mater &amp; purpose. For in likewyse as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to aged men is more credence &amp; auctorite gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen / than to yong men: bycause of experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of many thyngꝭ. So such noble &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t myndꝭ as delyteth in redynge hystories: may haue knowlege nat onely of the dedes of one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes lyfe: but also of the dedes most famous of al tymes syth creation of the <abbr>world</abbr>. <abbr>Wherfor</abbr> (as sayth Dyodorus) it is a comely &amp; fayre thyng / moche necessary &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable: a man to refourme &amp; amende his lyfe / by example of an other mannes fautꝭ &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mages. Wherfore Demetrius Phalerus the great philosopher: often warned &amp; counselled the kyng Ptolomy to excercise hymselfe in often redyng of bokes of hystories. For in so doynge: princes shall fynde writen in bokes before their eyen ryght many thyngꝭ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng their wele / honour / &amp; fame: which their frendꝭ dare nat be bolde to
<pb facs="tcp:12147:6"/>
tell them for drede of dysplesure: fathermore without the knowlege of hystories neuer man coude become good oratour. For (as affer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Quintilian) hystories be of such myght and effect that they may norisshe the speche of an oratour withsoft and swete lycour. These premisses with otherlyke consydered: moost magnificent prince: me thinketh it thing nat inconuenient a preest to write of hystories of warre: and also me thynke both plesant &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to noble men to exercyse themselfe in re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng the same. For brefely to speke by ryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wysie batel: the lawes of god &amp; man be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned: vice &amp; vicious men corrected: vertue / and good men rewarded and exalted. Oure fayth agaynst infideles defended: rebellers &amp; tyrannes subdued: and finally all thyngꝭ dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted &amp; to due order reduced. Fathermore the sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me redyng of hystores semeth to auayle nat a lytel to the knowledge &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sytorie pleasure mundayne &amp; mysery of this vncertayne lyfe.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this present cronycle or hystory of Rome: is written the batayle / whiche the Romayns had with Iugurth / vsurper of the kyngdome of Numydy. The lande of Numydy is parte of the countrey of Affryke. In whiche raygned somtyme a kynge named Massinissa: felowe and frende to the empyre of Rhome. This Massinissa had thre sonnes thus named: Micipsa / Manastabal / and Galussa. But after the deth of Manastabal and Galussa: the first brother named Micipsa / obtayned the kyngdome of Numydy alone / without partyner. For after the custome of Numydy / heritages are wont to be deuided among brethern by equal porcions / after dyscease of theyr parentes / of whome suche heritage issueth. This Micipsa so crowned kynge of hole Numydy had two sonnes / the first called Adherbal / the seconde Hiempsall. But his brother Manastabal whiche was departed before / left behynde hym one bastarde sonne named Iugurth: to whom his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father Massinissa bequethed none heritage / but left hym priuate without lande or lyuelodde / for asmoche as he was vnlaufully borne. The kynge Micipsa was moued with pyte &amp; compassyon agaynst this Iugurth: and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideryng that he was his brothers sonne / &amp; without conforte / receyued hym into his house / and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risshed hym in all thynges / as he dyde his owne sonnes. This Iugurth as he grewe in stature / so grewe he in all gyftes belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge to nature / and became a right strong &amp; hardy knyght / and also more excellent in wysdome / than in courage or myght / and was moche elder than the two sonnes of Micispa: named Adher ball &amp; Hiempsall. What tyme Micipsa co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sydered the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

beyng nat of power to defende the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfe. Micipsa after these thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sydred: determined to obiect this Iugurth vnto paryll of warre / and by such meanes to assay if it might fortune hym to be slayne in batell. Therfore what tyme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> romains hauyng Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio for their capitaine / beseged the cyte of Numance: this Mici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psa sent vnto the romains to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same batayle great socours both of horsmen and of fotemen. And made Iugurthe captayn ouer them. This dyde he trustynge that it was possible and lykely ynough that this Iugurth a knyght yonge / lusty / and desirous of honour / myght by some chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of fortune be slayne in batayle / as I sayd before. But at conclusion it fortuned moche contrary. For the boldnesse and strength of Iugurthe in that warre was well proued and knowen. For many noble and valiant actes of chyualry dyd he: wherby he wanne moche laude and glory / with great loue &amp; fauour / nat onely of Scipio the captaine / but also of all the noblest men of the Romayne army. Insomoche that after this warre was fynisshed: and the cyte of Numance distroyed the captaine Scipio assembled his hole army: and before them all with magnificent and fauorable wordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended Iugurth with merueylous laudes. This done he rewarded hym with ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny &amp; riche gyftes of chyualry. And sent hym agayne to the kynge Micipsa with letters / wherin also he commended this Iugurth with great laude and praysyng. By instigacion of whiche thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it so befell: that where as the kyng Micipsa / nat long before desyred nothyng more than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deth of Iugurth: nowe he coueted nought somoche as conseruacion of his lyfe &amp; helth. So that nat long after he adopted hym as his sonne / and ordayned in his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hym to be one of his heyres &amp; partiner of his kyngdome with his two other naturall sonnes. Whiche ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he neuer chaunged / but at his departyng increased his fauour and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites agaynst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same Iugurth / leauynge hym nat onely partiner of his kyngdome / but also of all his treasours. And besyde this decryed hym to be protectour of his two naturall sonnes / and of theyr porcions of the kyngdome. Sone after this ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the kyng Micipsa departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyfe. But whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thre princes Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herball / Hiempsall / and Iugurth determined amonge them the tyme whan the treasoure shulde be deuided and the boundes of the kyngdome lymited to them eche one his parte. At this assem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble grewe a dissencion betwene Hiempsall &amp; Iugurth / by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syon wherof Iugurth shortely after slewe Hiempsall by treason and gyle. After this Hiempsall was slayne Iugurthe fixed his mynde to possesse the hole kyngdome of Numidy. Wherfore he
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:12147:8"/>
prepared a great &amp; strong army agaynst the other brother Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herball / and at last whan bothe mette in batayle the army of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herball was ouerthrowen / and hymselfe put to flyght. Adherball thus ouercome and spoyled of his kyngdome <abbr>fledd</abbr> vnto Rome / and there before the senatours declared the tyrannous cruelte of Iugurth agaynst hym co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted / and agaynst his brother Hiem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>psall cruelly murdred: desiryng socours of the same senatours / w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pytefull wordes and lamentable complayntes. At conclusion it was decreed of the senatours / that .x. noble men of Rome shulde be sent embassadours to Numydy / to deuyde the kyngdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Adherball and Iugurth indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly.

Wherfore he assem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled a newe army / and with the same i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nuaded his kyngdome: Adherball compelled by necessite assembled also an other army for his part / and proceded forthe and mette with Iugurth. But anone after they ioyned batayle / Iugurth ouerthrewe the hoost of Adherball &amp; put hym to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Iugurth anone beseged the towne on all partes. In the meane tyme Adherball by letters certified y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> senatours of Rome in what state Iugurth had brought hym. How he was bereft of his kyngdome by crueltie &amp; ambicion of Iugurthe: how he was brought to extremite by hunger and force of armes / nat able to abyde the besegynge any lenger: how it appered euidently that Iugurth set lytell by the decrees &amp; ordinaunce of the senatours / And at conclusion of the same letters he humbly besought the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of ayde and socours in this his extremite. Whan these let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were redde before the senatours assembled: many of them were: which iuged it thynge expedient and conuenient: to socour Adherball. And anone to sende an army into Affrike agaynst Iugurthe. But his frendes whome he hadde bought for money at Rome: made suche resistence that no suche ordinaunce coude come to effect / nor passe forthe agaynst hym. Neuerthelesse newe embassadours were sent ones agayne to Iugurth / and that men auncient and of great authorite: to compell and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde hym in name of the senatours to desyst from his entreprise and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:12147:9"/>
in payne of theyr hye displeasure. Iugurth blynded these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours with fayre wordes and rewardes / tyll they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted agayn from Numidy to Rome / w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any thing brought to ende. Whan this was knowen at Cirtha <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Adherball constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by famine and other necessities condiscended to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell. But anone after the towne was yelded / Iugurth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to his fayth &amp; promes which he had made to Adherbal: slewe hym with greuous &amp; horrible tourme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Whan this dede was knowen at Rome: the senatours were sore moued agaynst hym. And toke his demeanoure and dedes inhumayne greuously. Wherfore by commen assent of the senatours and commens of Rome: one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Licius Calphurnius that tyme consull of Rome / was sent with a strong army into Numidy agaynst Iugurth. But with in shorte season this Calphurnius corrupted and accloyed with money by Iugurth made a foule bonde of peace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym to great dishonoure and shame bothe of hymselfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherfore Calphurnius was called home agayne to Rome with great dishonoure and rebuke. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Calphurnius / an other romayn named Albinus was elect consull and dyrect with newe suppleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of warriours into Numidy agaynst Iugurth.

Wherfore Albinus of necessite constrayned: and as decrees of the romayns commaunded: retourned agayne to Rome to be at the sayd election (as he was bounde) without any dede laudably done in Numidy. And at his departinge left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde hym in Numidy his brother named Aulus: to be captayn in his stede / &amp; ruler of his army / and also of the prouince where the same army soiourned tyll the wynter were ouer passed.

After this Metellus: one named Marius last of all was creat consul / and the prouince &amp; warre of Numidy decreed and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to hym.

And finally he made redy euery thynge whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed or was necessary to besegyng of suche a towne.

openly (that euery man myght here) he shewed to them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyder other thynges as his pleasure was that they <abbr>shuld</abbr> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyfie their kynge Iugurth concernynge their embassade. After this within fewe dayes whan he sawe his hoost moost redy and contrary to Iugurth he remoued his tentes and so addressed hym with his army redy in aray and went forward into Numidy: where contrary to any similitude of warre the vyllages and cotages were full of men / the feldes full of beestꝭ and tylmen: and euery where was moche plenty of people yonge and olde namely rude people &amp; tyllers of the grounde / whiche had styll fled before the army in foretyme for feare / but at the last whan they sawe no defence nor socoure / the kynges lewtenantes and all other left their townes / villages / and lodges / and went forthe to mete Metellus withall humilite / honour / and seruice submittyng themselfe to hym / and redy to gyue to hym whete and other corne suche as they had.

And so by suche dyscet to wayt a tyme to execute his treason. Wherfore Metellus thus mysdemynge kept hymselfe in the forwarde of the hoost with an elect and chosen company of archers / slyngers / and other lyke soudyours apoynted in lyght harnes. His vnder captayne Caius Marius had ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le and charge of the rerewarde amonge the horsmen and on bothe the wynges of his hoost he ordayned horsmen &amp; other soudyours for supplement / subsidy / and socouts of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde yf nede shulde requyre / and amonge them to expell their ennemies on what syde so euer they shulde come / were mengled bowmen and other lyght harnysed fotemen with dartes / pykes / and iauelyns to trouble the horsmen of theyr ennemies.

and the princypall market towne of all the kyngdome of Numidy. This towne was named Vacca / Metellus dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we hym and his army thyder / and set garnyson into the same towne.

And also he ledde a garnyson thyder to thintent to haue taken the towne by force of armes / yf the inhabytauntes wolde nat haue admytted the same garnyson. Also he commaunded vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayls / and all other thynges necessary or expedyent to warre for to be brought thyder thinkynge (as the case required) that the concours of marchantes resortyng thyder. And his good prouision of vytayls shulde be great defence and conseruacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for hym and his army bothe in warre and in peace. But whan the citezins sawe such purueyance as he made of vitels considring that he shulde nat hurt nor disprouyde them why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le he had vytell ynough of his owne prouysion: anon they ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned the gates and suffred hym to entre withall his garnyson and retynue. But in the mean tyme Iugurth agayne sende his embassadours to Metellus more diligently and instau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than he had done before / mekely besechyng and requyring hym of peace: And yeldyng vnto hym euery thynge / onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued his owne lyfe: and the lyfe of his chyldren. Metellus sende these embassadours home agayne attysed to the prody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of their maister Iugurth as he had done to the other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours which were sent before. But concernyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace which they desyred in their maisters name: nouther he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nor vtterly denyed it. And in this prolongynge of tyme he loked alway after parfourmynge of the promesse of the other embassadours / whiche before had graunted to the betrayeng of Iugurth.

Whan he aduysed these difficulties with other mo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to hym he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded &amp; fully determined at last to resyst and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stane Metellus in batayle / with strength &amp; force of armes and no farther to meke nor submitte hymselfe by peticion.</p>

Bothe the parties were redyer and more besye one to stryke &amp; wounde other than to defende themselfe. The clamoure &amp; noyse was myxt with exhortacion and confort of some / and the ioye of the quellars &amp; murderers was mingled with the wayling of them which were quelled &amp; murdred. The sounde of the armoure / horrious and strokes mounted to the ayre. The sky was darked with dartes fleyng on eyther syde. And the walles &amp; dychesse were dyed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> blode: and fylled with deed corses pytefull to se. But whan the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiens were somwhat at layser / and whan the romayns a lytell abated &amp; remitted the assaut: than they whiche defended the walles of the towne loked out a farre &amp; intentifely behelde the batayle of the horsmen which styll co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued. There myght one haue sene them somtyme mery &amp; ioyous / somtyme full of dolour &amp; heuynesse after as they sawe the case of the part of Iugurthe went forwarde or bacwarde. And aswell as they coude be sene &amp; herde of their felowes which were with theyr kyng Iugurth: some warned them to audacite / some exhorted them to courage / other they gaue them signes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their handes or with the iesture of their bodyes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenances mouyng and excityng them to boldnesse. If they sawe a romayne stryke a Numidyan: they moued &amp; withdrue their bodyes auoyding the stroke as yf it had ben themselfe whiche had ben striken. And if they sawe a Numidyen cast a dart agaynst a romayn: they moued their bodyes also as they had cast it themselfe. Thus toke they so intentife hede to the batayle that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate themselfe where they were / and it semed them that they had ben with their felowes in batayle. Whan Marius which besyged the towne on that syde: vnderstode this maner &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauour of the inhabitau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp; garyson: he abated his fiersnes for policy &amp; was more slowe in besyegyng of the towne than before fayning that he had no trust nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence to wynne it and suffred the Numidyens within the towne to beholde the batayle of their kynge / for a whyle without any resystence or besynesse. But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sawe them most intentifely beholdyng the batayle / &amp; most amased for the besynesse of their felowes &amp; countrey men: than sodenly withall his power he gaue assaut to the walles so that many of the romayns with ladders and other ingynes / had almost mounted vnto the hyghest part of

Thynhabitantes seynge this expelled their amasednes remembryng themselfe: and ran manly agaynst them with re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>systence throwyng vpon them stones / fyre / &amp; all maner dartes of batayle. The romayns at begynnyng resysted valiantly / defendyng themselfe and auancyng them to the walles. But whan thinhabitantes had first ouerthrowen and broken one ladder / and than ouertourned an other. They whiche abode last were maymed or slayne. Anone the remenant departed &amp; gaue ouer the walles vnder the best maner that they coude a fewe or none hole. For a great part of them withdrewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe transfired with mortall wondes.

Wherfore (as I haue sayd before) he began and went in hande with hym first of all by promisyng of great rewardes. And first of all he dyd somoch: that this Bomilchar came priuely to Metellus &amp; spake with hym. Metellus anone promysed hym on fayth &amp; treuth to do so for hym: that the senatours <abbr>shuld</abbr> pardon hym of all thyngꝭ past / and of his lyfe &amp; goodes. So that he wolde betray or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer vnto hym Iugurth other quycke or deed: lyghtly he persuaded the numidyan. For anon Bomilchar agreed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: what for his treaterous &amp; false mynde which he had of na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture. And what for that he douted if any peace or composicion after that shulde be made bytwene Iugurth &amp; the romayns hymselfe shuld be delyuerd by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dycion to the romayns to be punisshed for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deth of Massiua whom he caused to be slayne at Rome. This Bomilchar whan he sawe his tyme toke leue of Metellus on this apoyntement: and sone after came to Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gurth whome he founde doutefull in care and bewayling his aduers and myserable fortunes with profunde syghes and heuynesse / and doutyng what way was most expedient to be taken. Bomilchar after many wordes beganne to counsell &amp; warne hym / praynge / and obtestyng hym / pyteously wepyng and wayling: and requyring that at last he wolde make some prouision for the sauegarde &amp; socours of hymselfe / of his chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren &amp; frendes: and for the people of Numidy which well had deserued agnenst hym to be prouided for and better sene to.

Anone it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded &amp; decreed among the counsell and declared to the embassadours (acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the olde custome of Rome) that they shuld co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde Iugurth to sende to Metellus &amp; the romayns two hundred thousande pounde weyght of syluer: all his elypha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes which he ocupyed in warre: and a certayne quantite of armour and a no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of his chife horse. All these thyngꝭ were fulfylled and done of Iugurth without any tary or delay.

But at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion whan in vayne &amp; to none effect he had lost suche great ordynaunce and helpe of warre as he had lately delyuered to Metellus: as a volage brayned man / he fully determined agayne to begyn &amp;

A custome damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was among the people at those dayes: whan they slewe any beest in sacrifice: to loke within the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayles and bowelles of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same best so sacrifised. where was shewed vnto them dyuers tokens whyther they shuld haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope to bring that mater to effect: for which they sacrifised or els nat. And often tymes the wycked spyrites to cause them ꝑseuer in their ydolatry: and to gyue crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to that blynd er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour shewed many toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> insuch maner sacrifice: which tokens they often founde true. But now to my purpose. The preest of the ydolles whiche sacrifysed for Marius shewed great and marueylous tokens vnto hym: wherby he myght greatly trust to come to his intent and purpose / byddyng hym prosecute that thyng on whiche he had sette his mynde: and haue sure confydence in his goddes. Sayng that if he wolde proue the extremite of fortune dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly and often: than dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse euery thynge prosperously shulde happen to hym. But Marius afore that tyme: longe season wonderously desyred in his mynde the dignite of the consull. And to say trueth he wanted nothyng which longed to hym / whiche shulde haue such a dignite saue onely antiquite of his progeny and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient noblenesse of byrthe. For thought he were but a gentyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:12147:55"/>
of the first heed: neuerthelesse his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicions were worthy and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. In hym was great experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of wysdome, moche probite / honestie / and sadnesse. He had great polycy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng in chyualry: in batayle his <abbr>mynd</abbr> was excellent &amp; bolde. But in peace it was lowe and moderate. He ouercame coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyse and sensualite of his body. He desyred nor coueyted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng erthly saue glorie / laude / and worshyp. This Marius was borne &amp; brought vp by all his chyldhode in the countrey of Champayne beyonde Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in a towne named Arpyne. But assone as he was encreased / so that he myght bere har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and byde the hardnesse of warfare: he concluded to lyue on the wages of chyualrie. And in that study he exercysed hymselfe: and nat in eloquence of greke langage or in other study or science: nor yet in the superfluous aparayle nor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lustes of citezins vnto which he neuer subdued his body. And thus was he indued with good maners: and excercysed among honest ocupacions and so continued that his hole and vndefyled with shortly encreased &amp; exalted himselfe growyng to honour and vertu. First whan this Marius desyred of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menty of Rome to haue an office: that is to say / to be orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned protectour of the soudyours: many of the citezins knewe nat his persone: bycause he was alway from the cite in warre &amp; batayle: but his actes made his name well knowen. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menty vnderstode that he was Marius of whose nobles all Italy moch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned &amp; talked: anon they graunted his peticion / and proclamed hym protectour of the soudyours ouer all the prouinces &amp; tribes of Italy. In that maistership &amp; office he behaued hymselfe so well &amp; wysely that after that he obtayned an other office of more worshyp and authorite: and after that agayne an other of hyer dignite. And shortly to speke: in euery office and dignite he so behaued hymselfe that euery man thought and counted hym worthyer of more dignite and honour than he had. Howe beit for all these condicions: as honorable as he was: he durst neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desyre thoffice of consull of Rome tyll this tyme whan he had suche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort by his sacrifice. But whan he was thus war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and put in hope and confort / euer after he was hedelyng enclined to ambicion and couetyse of that dignite.</p>
                     <p>¶At this season the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menty of Rome had all other offices among them or at their gyft and dystribucion. But the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and noble men kept among them and in their handes the consulshyp yerely one succedyng other by election. So that of the commenty was none so noble nor excellent of dedes / but that was reputed vnworthy of that dignite / and as who sayth vyle and polluted. But whan Marius sawe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydred
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:12147:55"/>
that the wordes and counsell of the enchauntour and preest which behelde his sacrifice pretended to the same poynt and conclusion as the desyre of his mynde moued hym longe before. Anone he came to his capitayne Metellus / besechyng hym to be dyscharged of the batayle tyll he myght go to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to thintent to desyre the consulshyppe of the senatours. But how beit that in this Metellus was vertu / glorie / wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp / and all other thynges longynge to a good man plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ynoughe. Neuerthelesse of his courage and mynde was he so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>what proude / despisyng &amp; dysdaynyng other: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che were nat come of so hy lynage as he was. But specially he was stately and proude of mynde: whiche is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men vyce and myschefe among estates and gentylmen. Wherfore Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus heryng this interprise of Marius / first of all was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the newelty of his peticion. For at that tyme were none wonte to speke for that dignite / but if they were come of a noble stocke. And so was nat Marius. And thus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus marueyled moche at his enterpryse: and who myght counsell hym therto: warnynge hym as vnder colour of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myte and frendshyppe / nat to presume vpon so contrary and vnlikely a thyng: nor to exalte his mynde so hy aboue fortune co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for his state and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion.

This answere of Metellus styred Marius agaynst hym with greuous yre &amp; wrath / what for the honour whiche he desyred: and what for

the licence to depart / whiche he coude nat optayne of hym by no prayer nor request at his pleasure.

He gouerned the soudyours which passed forthe the wynter vnder his gouernaunce nat as he ought to do: but suffred them to haue their pleasure to thintent therby to optayne their fauour and goodwyll in his enterprise.

For by long contynuance of the same warre: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the sayd marchantes had wasted &amp; spent moche of their substance and richesse. And also to such desyrefull myndes as they had / nothyng coude to fast be hasted or brought to ende.</p>
                     <p>¶Moreouer at this season was in company of the romayne army a certayne Numidyan named Gauda / whiche was sonne of Manastaball: and neuewe vnto Massinissa. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipsa in his testament ordayned that this Gauda shulde be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde heyre of Numidy / after the deth of his two sonnes and of Iugurth. This Gauda was sore enfebled with dyseases and syckenesse: and for that cause his mynde was a lytell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulled and priuate of reason and memorie. Whyle this Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da (as sayed is) was in the romayns army: he requyred of
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:12147:56"/>
Metellus to suffre hym to haue his seat and siege next vnto hym after the vse of kynges of Numidy. Also after that by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of defence and garde of his body: he desyred that a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany of soudyours of the romayns myght be graunted and assigned to hym. But Metellus extremely denyed bothe his peticions saynge for the first: that suche honour longed onely to them whome the romayns toke and named for kynges. And also for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seconde peticion he sayd that it were an vnauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and iniurious ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce if the romayne soudyours were gyuen or assigned to the garde and seruice of a Numidyan / whiche was no kyng but a soudyour lyke many mo hyred for stypende. Whyle Gauda was displeased and angry with Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tellus for denyeng of these his peticions: Marius came to hym and prouoked hym to reuenge the displeasure &amp; iniury which the captayne had done to hym with his helpe &amp; auaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. This Gauda (as I haue sayd before) was of feble and vnstable mynde: and the mennes wytte was of lytell valoure by meanes of diseases which long had holden hym. Wherfore Marius with his elegant / fayre / and flateryng wordes at his owne pleasure induced hym &amp; exalted his mynde sayeng that he was a kyng an excellent and great man: and also neuewe to the worthy &amp; noble kyng Massinissa. Wherfore (sayd he) yf Iugurth were outher slayne or taken prisoner it <abbr>wer</abbr> licke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to that poynt: that the kyngdome of Numidy shulde be assigned &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted to hym of the senatours without any tary or resystence: whiche thyng shulde shortely be brought to passe yf Marius hymselfe were creat consull in place of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus &amp; than assigned to execute and finysshe the warre with Iugurth. Vnder this maner Marius counselled and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced bothe the sayd Gauda / the romayne knyghtes / the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men soudyours / and also the marchauntes and occupyers whiche were in the towne at that season w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many other whome he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled with his wordes so: that some of them for loue whiche they had to Marius: And other some for great hope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre which they had to haue peace and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>corde wrote to Rome to their kynsmen &amp; frendes of the batayle of Numidy &amp; that very sharpely agaynst Metellus desyring &amp; besechyng them to labour at Rome withall their myght that Marius myght be elect consull and assigned to execute the warre of Numidy. And thus at Rome was the consulshyp desyred by many men with great fauour and very honest peticions for Marius. Also at that tyme had the sayd Marius this auauntage. For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentie at that season deposed many of the states: &amp; eralted such as were newe gentylmen after the lawe of one na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med Manlius which before had ben ꝓtectour of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie.
<pb facs="tcp:12147:57"/>
This Manlius ordeyned &amp; inacted a lawe / that if any thyng were vngoodly done and agaynst ryght of the states beynge in any office or dignite: than he whiche so had done shulde be deposed of his office: and in his place some newe gentyll or actyue man of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentie sette and deputed and so exalted. This lawe at those dayes was kept in effect and executed at Rome: wherfore euery thyng proceded prosperously to the purpose &amp; profet of Marius.

But this there was suche as the Scorpyon is wont to make: whiche whyle she maketh glad semblant with her mouthe mortally styngeth with the tayle: so this feest was a cloke to mortall treason.

                     <p>¶These exhortacions with other lyke were contayned in the letters of Bomilchar dyrected vnto Nabdalsa. But whan these letters were delyuerd: as chaunce was: Nabdalsa lay on his bed to recreate and refresshe his body weryed with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and besynesse / which he had taken before. Whan Nab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalsa had red these letters and vnderstode the mynde of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milchar: first many deuyses entred his mynde and moch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he had in musyng what was moost expedient to be done in the cause. But whyle he was in this study: sodenly he fell in a slombre and his wery membres desyring rest moued hym to fall in slepe. This Nabdalsa had a seruant longynge to hym whome he moche loued and trusted: in somoche that no besy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse nor cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell he <abbr>hydd</abbr> nor kept secret from hym: this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of betrayng of Iugurth onely except. Whan this seruant vnderstode that the sayd letters were brought to his lorde he thought that he had nede of his counsell as he was wont and acustomed to haue in other maters: and anone entred in to the tent where his maister lay. And seyng hym fast in slepe he toke the letters whiche Nabdalsa had vnwysely layd aboue his heed vpon the pyllowe: and seyng by the superscripcion that the letter came from Bomilchar he <abbr>redd</abbr> it to thende. But whan he vnderstode the treason: in all hast he addressed hym with the same letter to Iugurth. Nabdalsa nat longe after awakenyd and myssed the letter / wherfore anone he enquy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red who had ben there in his tent. But in short season came dyuers of his louers from Iugurth / which certifyed hym of all the mater as it was done. Nabdalsa first of all entended to pursue his accuser: but whan he perceyued that it was but in vayne so to do / consydring that he was all redy in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Iugurth: he went vnto Iugurth hymselfe to thintent to pacify and mytigate his displeasure &amp; wrath. And sayd vnto hym that whan the sayd letters were first delyuerd vnto hym he had fully purposed nat to kepe them secret: but hymselfe to haue disclosed them to Iugurth. But whyle he was slepyng his false seruant (in hope to be aduansed therby) had preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hym his purpose &amp; done the same thyng which he himselfe had fully purposed to do. Farthermore wepyng he besought &amp; required hym for all amyte and loue whiche had ben bytwene them &amp; for all the faythfull seruice whiche he had done to hym in foretyme nat to haue hym suspected in so cruell a dede. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth

His ennemies and his owne subgettes he dreded and suspected both in lyke &amp; after one maner. He sherched &amp; espyed euery place for drede of treason doutyng &amp; suspectyng euery sound or noyse that he herde. He rested and lay some nyght in one place and some nyght in an other / and that in abiect &amp; secrete places agaynst the honoure of his estate royall. Somtyme he rose from his bed in his slepe in myddes of the nyght and armed hymselfe cryng / enragyng / and violently smyting agaynst the walles of the chambre: as if he had ben in batayle.

to batayle / and also that the towne was strongly defended bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the by crafte of mannes handes and by nature of the place. Anone he compased about the towne on euery syde with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde dychesse / trenches / and herdels: of sharpe stakes the poyntes vpwarde to thentent that none of thinhabytantes shuld breke out nor escape by night / as Iugurth had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: nor that no vitels shulde be conuayed into them / wherby they myght the lengar resyst hym and indure the sege.

But all the pray and riches of the towne was distroyed by them whiche were within the towne in garnyson: of the romayns / whiche had fled from Metellus to Iugurth: which specially had assigned them to defende the towne. These traytours whan they sawe the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les vndermined &amp; brused with diuerse ingens of batayle: and their fortune was brought to extremite: and no socours nor hope remayned.

And also moche of his owne ordynau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce had he left there to a voyde impedyment in his voyage. Thus Iugurth thought most expedient to do.

Or els yf the romayne capitayne Metellus / and his army shulde come to socours of the towne: than thought he that there both hymselfe and Bocchus shuld gyue batayle to Metellus.

And many sayd that Metellus toke so great sorowe and displeasure: bycause the victorie which he had almoost optayned shulde be pulled out of his handes his selfe hauyng the labour and paryll / and an other man the tryumphe and honour.

But in the meane tyme he forgat nat to prepare euery thyng necessary to the warre: wherof the charge rested on hym to execute the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me agaynst Iugurth from thensforth.

And how beit that the senatours were contrary to hym: yet durst they nothyng deny vnto hym belongyng to his besynesse: but gladly and with good wyll they decreed that he shulde rayse and chuse soudyours to fulfyll the nombre of them which <abbr>wer</abbr> lost in batayle in the contrey of Numidy.

But certenly I counte it more better and honorable to be rote and begynner of noblenesse vnto all my progeny and to leue the same vnto my branches: than to corrupt and defele noblenesse receyued of my progeny: as many of these gentylmen do. Forsoth I am nat ignorant but that yf these estates were nowe present &amp; shulde answere to my wordes their speche shuld be abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly paynted / ornate / and elegant ynough.

Marius suffred none of these to pay any thynge at al: but elect many of them for his soudyours. Many of the romayns surmysed that Marius elected vnto warre these abiect parsons: for want of other good soudyours. Some other demed that he so dyd for fauoure / ambicion / and parcialite: bycause this sort of people assisted and honoured hym by auauncement at begynnynge of his promocion.

First he commytted all the bestes which he had taken in pray in foretyme vnto the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men / whiche of their owne wylfolowed hym to war: or were sende to hym for helpe by frendes of thempire. Marius com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them to take charge to driue forth these beastꝭ. Than sent he Aulus Manlius embassadour of the hoost to a towne named Laris / and al the cohortes of his soudyours with hym which were fotemen and lyght harnysed for to kepe the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour of the soudyours wages and vitayls: whiche he had lefte in the same towne. Marius kept his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel of this interprise so secrete that none of all his company hye nor lowe knewe of his purpose nor whan he intended. But whan Manlius and his company shulde depart towarde Laris: Marius dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muled with them sayeng that he wold stray abrode in Numi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy in rouyng and afterwarde within fewe dayes: he and his company wolde come also to the same towne of Laris / laded with prayes of his ennemies. This done he deꝑted towarde a flod named Tana: no creature liuely knowyng of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And euery day he distribued in his iournayes amonge his boost .xlii. heed of oxen for vitayle / which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to be deuided by euyn porcion amonge them by hunders and halfe hunders togyder: deuidyng vitayls to euery company after their nombre. And in the meane season he charged bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels and bowges to be made of the hydes of the same beastes and of other ledder in great no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre. Moreouer he eased their scarcyte wheate and other corne: by wyse prouision. And without knowledge of all his company he made good proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syon of euery thing / which might be necessary vnto his army in tyme of nede. At conclusion the syxt day after whan they were come to the sayd flod of Tana: thyder was brought a myghty multitude of bottels and bowges made of ledder.

There pytched they their tentes with easy labour and small defence. Than refresshed they themselfe with meate and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke: and eased themselfe a certayne space. This done: Marius commaunded them that euery man shulde be redy to procede forwarde euyn with the sonne goyng downe and that euery man shulde onely lade hymselfe and his beastes with water in the sayd bowges and bottels leauynge al other cariage / burthens / and baggage: there behynde them in their tentes / vnder the custody of other soudyours therto assigned. After this whan he sawe his tyme: he departed forthe from his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes with his company: and lauboured al the nyght longe in his iournay. The day after folowyng he rested in a secrete &amp; couert place. In the same wyse behaued he hymselfe the nyght next ensuynge: and in the thyrde nyght moche before the day lyght / he entred into a fayre and large felde ful of smal hylles and downes / no more but two myle space from Capsa. And there he taryed withal his hoost in the moost priueest maner abidynge the day lyght. But assone as the day began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere: many numidyens yssued forth of the towne: some to dysporte themselfe: and some about their besynes / nought fearyng nor suspectyng of their ennemies. Whan Marius sawe that: anone withal haste he sent all his horsemen to the towne / and with them as many fotemen in lyght harnesse as were moost swyft and spedy. Whome he commaunded to ren withal hast and boldely and valiantly to assayle the towne: and to besyege the gates. Than after he hymselfe folowed spedely: but with good hede and aduisement: nat sufferynge his soudyours in the assaut nor in the way thyderwarde to fal to robbyng nor prayes by spoyling of their ennemies. Whan thinhabitantes of the towne knewe herof: their case was vnsure / their feare great and horrible: for the sodayne chaunce of them was nothynge suspected before / nor prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Many of the cetezins whiche were without the towne and were taken and in power &amp; captiuite of the romains their ennemies sent vnto them within the towne desyring them for saue garde of their lyues to yelde themselfe and the cite to Marius.

And that suche thynges as were done by good counsell and prouision / and also suche as hapened by fortune or chance: and by neglygence of their ennemies.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the same. But this his purpose at last came to effect / rather by chaunce of fortune / than by prouision or counsell.

In the meane tyme no soudyour was so good / strong / nor bolde: but that he was outher wounded or beaten done to deth. Than was feare encreased to other that were feble and faynt herted. ¶But after that many dayes &amp; great labours in this maner were ouerpassed and spent in vayne. Marius was sore angred &amp; vexed in his hert reuoluyng many thyngꝭ in mynde: but specially whyther he myght gyue ouer his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (seyng his labour frustrate) or els abyde the chaunce of fortune which at many tymes before he had founde fauorable and frendly to hym. Whyle Marius chafed &amp; brennyng in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre reuolued suche thynges in his mynde both day &amp; nyght: it hapened by chaunce of fortune that a certayne lumbard a symple soudyour / one of the company whiche was last sende from Rome to Numidy to supply the army strayed abrode from his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany a lytel way which lumbarde as he wandred founde among the stones many smal snayles crepyng on the grounde: nat far from that syde of the castel which was ouer agaynst the syde which the romayns besyged and assayled. Bycause this lumbard in his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey was acustomed lyke other of his countrey men to eate such snayles prepared after their maner: therfore he gathered first one and than an other / and after that many: ascendyng vp by lytel and lytel: somty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me crepyng somtyme clymmyng / for no other intent or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose saue to gather such snayles: and so far he ꝓceded by lytel and lytel tyll at last he came almost to the top of the mountay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. But whan he sawe all that syde of the castel desolate and no person steryng: anone he began<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to haue a pleasure &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre in his mynde for to worke some maistry / as the propertie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion is of euery man couetyng to wyn a name / laude and riches: and to be spoken of.

Whan the lumbard had espyed and consydred euery thyng which he thought myght be aua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage to his after pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: than he desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded agayne downewarde by the same way which he ascended: but nat without hede nor with so lytel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisement as he ascended vpwarde: but prouyng euery way / and lokyng about yf it were possible to brynge into the castel any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of men by that syde or nat. This wel consydred: assone he descended: anone he went to Marius and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hym of euery thynge as he had done exhortyng &amp; requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng hym to put in profe whether the castel myght be won on that syde where he had ben.

Neuerthelesse the mynde of Marius was somwat exalted to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort / and good hope: and therfore of al the company of trumpettes / and of other such mynstrels as be wont to be in batayle to gyue courage and signes to the fig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And al them he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to obey to the lumbard and to be ruled &amp; ordred by hym in euery thyng.

But whan they were come thyder: the lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard their gyde caused them to change their armour / and to make bare their heedes and their fete: to thintent that they so bare heded the better might se aboue them and on euery syde of them: and that they beyng bare fote myght labour somoche

the better and take better <abbr>hold</abbr> in clymming vp by the stones. Their swordes were fastned behynde at their backes &amp; their buckelers withal / which were made after the fassion of the nu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>midyens buckelers of lether: bycause of lyghter weyght and burthen. And also to shintent that they shulde gyue lesse soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de or noyse / if it hapned any stone to smyte agaynst them. This done: the lumbard went vp before them / and bounde smal cordes to the stones and to the olde rotes whiche apered aboue the stones where he coude espy any suche wherby the soudyours sustayning themselfe &amp; takyng holde might more lightly &amp; with more ease mount and clym vpwarde. And som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme he went before and helped them vp with his handes spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially such as for that vncustomed way were somwhat fereful. Somtyme whan thascendyng or goyng vp was ouer harde and sharpe: he put eche of them vp before hym without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: and than he hymselfe folowed with their armour and wepyn. Suche places where moost dout was in: he specially proued and assayd them moost of al: and in goyng &amp; comyng often tymes vp &amp; downe by the same moost dangerous passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: he encreased audacite &amp; boldnesse to the remena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Thus after they had ben sore weryed / and with long &amp; great labour endeuored themselfe: at last they came into the castel / whiche on that syde they founde desolate &amp; without defence. For (as sayd is before) al they which were with in the castel were occu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyed in fightyng / or redy to fight agaynst the romayns: as they were on other dayes before. But whan Marius vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode by messa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers how the lumbard had done: how beit that al the day before his men had ben sore besied and occupyed in fightyng: &amp; assayling the castel. Neuertheles specially at this tyme he exhorted &amp; enbolded them: and he hymselfe departing forth from vnder his pauases caused his soudyo<hi rend="sup">r</hi>s to adioyne themselfe nere togyder / &amp; to holde vp their sheldes aboue their heedes / so that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyning of them semed as it <abbr>wer</abbr> the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of a volt. Marius kept hym vnder the same for his defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce / &amp; so approched to the walles. And both he &amp; his company whiche were nere about hym valiantly assayled the castel: and also other of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany which stode a far of &amp; coude nat come nere the walles for prease: assayled the castel fiersly from a far and sore vexed and put in feare their ennemies within the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel throwyng agaynst them plumettes of leed with slynges / arowes / dartes / and al other maner engyns of batayle wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with any thynge coude strongely be throwen into the castel. But the Numidyens within the castel had often before this tyme ouertourned and brent the tentes and pauases of the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns and toke therby so great audacite and boldnesse that
<pb facs="tcp:12147:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they defended nat themselfe within the castel walles: but wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp and downe without the castel walles bothe day and nyght reuilyng and reprouynge the romayns and obiectyng cowardyse agaynst Marius. And thretnyng that his sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyours shulde be made subiectes and bonde men to Iugurth in tyme to come / whome they purposed at that tyme to make bonde to them. Thus whyle they thought themselfe sure and their mater in good case: they were harde and egar ynough reuylinge and thretnynge the romayns. In the meane space whyle the romains and their ennemies were besyest fighting withal their myght: the romayns for laude / glorie / and lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp: and the Numidiens for their helth and sauyng of their lyues. Anone sodenly the lumbard with his company which were within the castel on the backsyde blewe their trumpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. First of al the women and chyldren which went to the walles to se the bykering were al abasshed and fled inwarde to the castel: and after them al the soudyo<hi rend="sup">r</hi>s which were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and nerest to the walles and coude escape in. And finally they all bothe armed and vnarmed fled inwarde. Whan the romayns sawe this they assayled the castel more fiersly: some they slewe and ouerthrue: some they wounded ouerpassynge or standyng vpon the bodyes of them which were slayne. Al their desyre was with their handes to wyn glorie and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp. They stryued to ascende vnto the walles euery man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetyng to be before other. None of them al taryed nor was let with spoylingꝭ nor prayes. Their great courage suffred them nat to loke there after / tyl by manhode and strength they had won the castel. Thus was fortune fauorable to Marius: so that his first negligence and vnwyse boldnesse to assayle a ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stel inexpugnable / was tourned by chance from rebuke to glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie and laude / such was his fortune. But whan Marius had won this castel after estimacion of man nat able to be won: than was he lorde of the moost part of al the treasour of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth: the castel was gyuen al to murdre and hauocke.

For his tong nor pen were nat at ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berte for asmoch as he was so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>what in danger to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayd Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la: wherby he was prohibyted to say or to write / acordyng to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth. For what by fauour &amp; what by fere he durst nat tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che playnly the vices which were in hym. But here I purpose (all fauour and fere layd a part) indifferenly to write of him. ¶This Sylla of progeny: was descended of moost noble stocke of the remai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Howbeit the name of his auncetry was almost lost and decayed by dulnesse / negligence / and slouth of some of his lynage. In greke and in laten he was of lyke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng: and excellently seen in both the langages. His mynde was great / and bolde of courage. Of voluptous pleasours he was desyrous: but moche more desyrous of glory &amp; laude. In vacant leser he was moch enclined to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lustes of his body. But suche pleasure or voluptuousnes dyd neuer let nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde hym from any besynesse or ocupacion necessary: howbe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>it such pleasure so blynded hym that he toke no wyse of byrth / maners / and honestie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for his estate. He was moch eloquent of speche crafty &amp; subtyll ynough. He had the wayes easely to get frendshyp / and it was also no maistry to get fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shyp of hym: in fayning / dissimulyng / and counterfaytinge of besynesses: his wytte was very hye and excellent. He was a marueylous &amp; incredyble gyuer of many thynges / but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of money: and before the warre and victory which the noble men of Rome: had agaynst the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men people: He was so noble &amp; worthy reputed that it is in maner incredyble: nor
<pb facs="tcp:12147:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his good fortune neuer passed the policy of his wyt: in somo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che that many men were in dout whyther he was more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate than strong. But after the victory of this warre: so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goodly was his demeanour &amp; so cruel / that verily I knowe nat whyther I may more be asshamed or greued to write it or to speke therof. For after that this warre of Numidy was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: &amp; both Marius &amp; this Sylla were retourned to Rome: a great discorde fel bytwene the lordes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mens. Marius toke part with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons: but Sylla toke part with the lordes and at last droue Marius forthe of the citie. After that: an other man of great power called Cynna whiche had ben fyue tymes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sull of Rome gathered an hoost of men and toke part with Marius agaynst this Sylla. But at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion Sylla ouercame hym in batayle: and slewe hym. After this: Sylla cruelly murdred an other noble man of Rome named Caius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>arbo: and with hym yonge Marius / sone of this Marius which warred in Numidy. Last of al whan this Sylla had won victory ouer Marius &amp; his fauourers: than became he most cruel of al other: in somoch that he fylled al the citie with blod of the citezins. But here wyl I leaue to speke farther of this Sylla / or of his behauour i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cruelte: and returne to write of his behauour in this warre of Numidy vnder Marius. ¶After that this Sylla (as I haue sayd before) was come to Affrike &amp; to the hoost of Marius with his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: within short season he became most expert in chiualry &amp; crafty aboue al other: howbeit before this tyme he was but ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de &amp; ignorant of dedes of chiualry. And moreouer he treted &amp; gouerned his soudyours with maners &amp; mekenes. And ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue rewardes to many: to some whiche desyred hym: and to some other of his owne pleasure non desyred therto. But he wolde take no rewardes nor gyftes agayne / without it were agaynst his wyl. And if he so dyd at any tyme agaynst his wyl: than was he more redy to gyue agayne that which was gyuen to hym: than to pay that money which he had borowed of other. He demaunded nothyng agayne of any man though it were due and det to hym: but rather he laboured and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored hymselfe that many myght be in his det / and by suche meanes to haue them bounde to hym. And how beit that he was one of the grettest of Rome: yet disdayned he nat the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the most symple soudyours of the hoost: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned and acompanyed with them both in sportes &amp; in sadnes. In labours he was alway redy. In batayle &amp; in watchyngꝭ with other besynes of warre he suffred no man to be before hym. Nor i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meane season he neyther hurt the good name of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sul nor of none other good man: which thing men desyrous

of worshyp &amp; honour be often wont to do for in dispraysing of other they thinke to obtayne great laude to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfe. He onely laboured that none might passe hym neyther in counsel nor in might / or manhod of his handꝭ. But he passed many. By whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che maners &amp; condicions in short tyme he became very dere &amp; wel beloued / nat onely to Marius: but also to al the hoost.</p>

Iugurth agayne corrupted the next of his counsel with gyftes in lykewse as he had done before: and promysed vnto the kyng Bocchus hymselfe / the thirde part of the kyngdome of Numidy: if the romayns were dryuen out of Affrike / or yf the war shulde be brought to ende without losse or diminisshyng of his kyngdome and marches therof. The kyng Bocchus induced with hope of this <abbr>reward</abbr>: with a great multitude of people came to Iugurth / and adioyned both their armies togyder in one. ¶At this tyme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius with his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany was in his iournay towarde the ꝓuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce which was in the coost of Affrike &amp; apartayned to thempi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: where the sayd Marius purposed to rest with his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany / tyl the wynter were past. But whan he was in his iournay &amp; in leest dout: Iugurth and Bocchus bothe togyder inuaded and set vpon hym and his men whan the tenth part of the day scarsly remayned. This dyd they: thynkinge that the nyght which was nere come shulde to them be great socour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence if they were ouercome: and if they dyd ouercome the ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mayns: it shulde be to them no damage nor impediment by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they knewe the contrey &amp; place better than the romains. But on the other syde bothe these chaunces: in darkenesse
<pb facs="tcp:12147:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were harde and contrary to the romayns: for they knewe nat the coostes of that countrey. Marius anone had vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng of his ennemies by many of his espyes: but it was ouerlate. For assone as he had worde: his ennemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were euyn at hande. In somoch that before the army coude be set in order or aray: and or they coude remoue or gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyder their baggage which at that tyme was abrode: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they coude take any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of their captayne by worde or sounde of trumpettes: The horsemen of the Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and of the Getulians ran togyder vpon them nat in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nor aray of batayle: but by companyes and bendes togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der / as it fortuned them to come togyder in heapes and clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. The romayns for the moost part: were al amased and greuously abasshed for that sodayne and vnprouided feare. Neuerthelesse they forgate nat their olde manhode &amp; stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth some drue them to their armour: and other some whiche were armed alredy defended their felowes tyl they armed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfe. Other some mounted on horsebacke and boldly rode agaynst their ennemies: and encountred them valyantly. The fyght on both parties was more lyke a skirmysshe among brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and rouers than to any apoynted or ordred batayle. For the horsmen &amp; fotemen were mengled togyder without stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdes / cognysances / or any ordynaunce / aray / or order. The Maurians &amp; Numidyans were fierse on their syde. Some of the romayns they beat downe and ouerthrue. Some they wounded mortally: And many they bereft vtterly of their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues / and slewe them in that place. The remenant which shar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pely and manly resysted they compased them about on euery syde: and aswel behynde as before assayled them: so that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manhode / strength / nor armour: was able sufficiently to defende them: And no maruel for their ennemies were mo in nombre than they: and compased them about on euery syde of them. But finally the romayne soudyours which were bothe of olde and newe: and therfore bothe strong / bolde / and crafty in batayle: gathered them as nere togyder as they myght. And where it fortuned any nombre of them to mete togyder: they tourned backe to backe / &amp; ioyned them rounde one with an other in maner of a compase or cercle: and so they saued &amp; defended themselfe togyder that on the backehalfe no man coude assayle them: but yf he brake in through the myddes of them whiche was in maner impossible. By this maner they sustayned the myght of their ennemies: and also saued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Nor their captayne Marius in this ieopardous and sharpe besynes was nat affrayed at al / nor of lesse corage and boldnesse than he was before: but styred about euery where
<pb n="lxxvi" facs="tcp:12147:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the batayle. And his men of garde about hym whome he had chosen rather of the strongest and boldest men of the host / than of such as were moost familier with hym. For he set mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re by the audacite of them / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the familiarite of the other: and namely in such a ieopardous case. So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyme he socoured his soudyours in their nede / or such as he sawe in paryl. And somtyme he ran in amonge his ennemies: where they were thyckest. And nat withstandyng their resystence he assayled them valiantly: and wounded / slewe / and ouerthrue them on euery syde he dyed his weapen in the reed blode of the blacke Mauriens and Getuliens. And bycause that in so harde a case: and in so great and troublous noyse &amp; rumour / he coude nat counsel nor confort his soudyours with his tong / therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he thought to counsel / incorage / and confort them with his hande / gyuyng them example surely to bestowe their strokes. Many of his ennemies sende he to hel cryeng in vayne vpon their ydo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>les for helpe. The dartes / iauelyns pykes / plumet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of leed / stones / with other suche instrumentes of batayle <abbr>wer</abbr> cast so thicke on both parties / that the ayre therwith was indymed. The strokes were so coursly charged on the bright helmes and harnesse / that the fyre sprange out on euery syde: so that it semed to be the lyghtnyng: the cry of the men dyeng: the neyeng of the horses: and the dyn of the strokes / with the sounde of the trumpettes: was horryble and tedyous to here. Thus continued they tyl the day lyght was passed / and the nyght come. The numidyans / getulians / and maurians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>systed nor ceassed nothing for that. But as both Iugurth and Bocchus before had warned &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them: they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued more sharpely than before / thynking that the darkenesse of the nyght shulde be for their aua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage. Marius this vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng toke counsel &amp; made best ꝓuision for hymselfe &amp; his men: whiche he myght in suche case: and as the mater requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And to thintent that his people myght haue some place to resort vnto / for refuge &amp; socours: he prouyded before and ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed two hylles nere togyder of whome the one was ouer na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rowe / &amp; of lytel grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to receyue his hole army &amp; tentes: but in the top therof was a fayre fountayne of pure water moch necessary. The other hyl was sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly large to receyue his hole hoost and tentes: and also very defensyue / for it was of a great altitude and done right on euery syde. Insomoche that they whiche shulde take that hyl were sure ynough without great defence of themselfe / for nature had it sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. This wel considred: Marius commaunded Sylla his vndercapten to take with hym al the horsmen / and to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that nyght about the smaller hyl where the fountayne was.
<pb facs="tcp:12147:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This done: he hymselfe gathered togyder by lytel and lytel the remanent of his soudyours dispersed abrode: their enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being nat lesse troubled than were they. Whan Marius had thus assembled agayne his men togyder he led them all with ful cours vp vnto the larger hyl. Thus the two kynges Iugurth &amp; Bocchus seyng it in vayne to fyght with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che were on the hyer grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / and also on so sure a place: were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strayned to leaue the fyght: for difficultie of the place which the romayns had taken. But neuertheles in the meane tyme they suffred nat their men to depart <abbr>far</abbr> thens: but compased bothe the hylles rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about with their hole multitude &amp; there taryed &amp; rested / shed abrode vpon the ground. Whan they had taken their place in this maner: they made great fiers here &amp; there in many places of their hoost: and the barbarians after their custome passed forth the most part of the night in myrth / pleasure / &amp; gladnes / reioysing / daunsyng: and making great noyse and dyn: rennyng and goyng from place to place: and loudly crieng / synging and reuellyng. The kynges themselfe were also nat a lytel proude and fearse: bycause they had nat fled from the batayle: and counted themselfe as ouercomers seyng that they helde the romayns so besieged which as they thought durst nat abyde them. On the other part the romai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyfly gaue aduerte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the demeanour of their ennemies. And for that the romayns were on the hyght of the hyl and without lyght: therfore more easy from darknesse of hyer pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces they parceyued al the dedes and behauour of their enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which were beneth them: and moch more euidently by light of the fyers. This vnwyse behauour of the numidiens put the romayns in great confort and was great courage to them. And specially Marius was greatly confermed in hope seyng their negligence / their folly / and vncraftinesse: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his folke to kepe sylence as styl as might be possible without any noyse. In somoche that he suffred nat the tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petes to sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de the watche: as warryours ar wont aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynst night. Afterwarde whan the day began to apere: the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiens were al weryed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their cryeng / ouerlate watchyng / and reuel: and had gyuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfe to rest a lytel before as men without feare or dout of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> romayns. But certenly it is a true ꝓuerbe which is often sayd: that after fayre wether succedeth te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pestious cloudes: and <abbr>aft</abbr> myrth &amp; ioye often cometh sadnes and sorowe. So it hapened to the numidye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For whyle they ingorged &amp; fylled with wynes lay slepyng on the grounde as beestes without fere &amp; without ꝓuision: Marius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded sodenly all his trumpetes &amp; clarionistes with other mynstrels to sound their instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes as shyrle as they coude altogyder
<pb n="lxxvii" facs="tcp:12147:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that al his soudyours shulde set vp a shout or cry as hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly as they myght: and with that inuade and breke into the tentes of the numidyens. This was shortly done: wherfore the numidyens / mauriens / &amp; getuliens astonyed and abas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with that vnknowen and horryble noyse: were sodenly awakened of sleape: and seyng them thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pased with their ennemies: what for feare of deth and of the noyse they were so amased that they had no power neyther to fle nor to drawe to them their armour / nor vtterly to do or <abbr>prouid</abbr> any maner so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour for themselfe. Thus they stode astonyed for this horrible noyse and cry as yf madnesshe had entred them: none able to socour hymselfe nor other. The romayns alway increased to them their noyse and feare assayling / murdring / and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng them without any resystence. Finally al they were ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouerthrowen / slayne / or wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: or els fled their armo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> / standerdes and weapen left behynde them: and mo were in this batayle slayne: than in al the batels before.

                     <p>¶But to retourne to my purpose: whan Marius with suche dyligence as sayd is: was come nat far from the towne of Cirtha / at the last the fourth day after the forsayd batayle: the espyes of their ennemies appered on euery syde. The romai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb n="lxxvii" facs="tcp:12147:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnderstode anone therby that their ennemies were at hande. The espyes of the romains also which were sende forth: bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught the same tidynges from euery coost of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius perceyued that his ennemies were in diuerse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyes and deuided: wherfore he was vncertayne howe he myght best order his hoost to receyue them: And therfore perceyuing it vnsure: how to order the forfront of his batayle as it ought: he abode his ennemies in the same place no order chaunged with his hoost deuyded in .iiii. partes (as sayd is) as he whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was redy and prouyded for euery chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Thus was Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth disceyued and frustrate of his purpose. For he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyded his hoost into four partes trustynge to inuade some of the romayns on the backehalfe with parte of his army: and with an other part to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter with them / and with the other two partes to enclose them on both the sydes: and so to enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron them rounde about. In the mean tyme Sylla which first encountred with Iugurth exhorted &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted his men aswel as he might for breuite of the tyme. That done: anone he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded with his company by bendes &amp; clustres togyder / their horses conioyned in the moost thyckest maner: and so fiersly assayled the Maurians. The remanent of the fotemen whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che were vnder Sylla: remayned and kept themselfe styl in their first place: and defended their bodyes from the dartes whiche their ennemies thrue agaynst them from farre. But if it chaunsed any of their ennemies to come bytwene their han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des: they hewed them downe to decrease the nombre. ¶Whyle Sylla and his horsmen thus fiersly were fightyng on the right wyng of the batayle: The kyng Bocchus assem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled togyder the fotemen whome his son named Volux / had brought thyder with hym. These fotemen had suche impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their iournay thyderwarde that they came ouerlate to the other batayle whiche was last foughten before this. Wherfore Bocchus: whan he had assembled &amp; inbolded with his wordꝭ these fresshe fotemen: with them he assayled fiersly the rerewarde of the romayns.</p>
                     <p>¶In the meane tyme Marius hymself was occupyed in the forwarde of his hoost and there employed his wysdome and strength / as a valyant and worthy captayne: and so stode it hym in hande. For in the forwarde Iugurth hymselfe with his grettest power &amp; stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of men inbatayled with hym. ¶But after that Iugurth knewe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng of Bocchus to the felde: anone he turned hym with a smal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny about hym priuely vnto the fotemen of the romayns: and there with an hye voyse he cried vnto them / sayng that they fought but in vayne. For a lytel before he had slayne Marius
<pb facs="tcp:12147:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with his owne handes. And in cryeng these wordes he lyfted vp withal / and shewed his swerde al ouersprincled and dyed with blode: whiche he had so couloured in the batayle fiersly ynough in murdring the fotemen of the romayns. These wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des Iugurth cryed in latyn tong. For he had lerned to speke latyn longe before in the batayle of Numaunce. Whan the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns herde these wordes they were affrayed / but more for crueltie of the noyse: than for any confidence or trust whiche they had to the messanger. But on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other syde the myndes of the barbariens <abbr>wer</abbr> bolded &amp; exalted by these wordes: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son wherof more sharpely they inuaded the romayns / seynge them abasshed &amp; astonyed. And nowe were the romains of the forwarde at that poynt that they were redy to gyue themselfe to flyght: as men dyscouraged for the sayd tidynges. ¶Whan they were at this poynt: it fortuned so at the same tyme that Sylla had beaten and ouerthrowen the mauriens which inuaded and assayled hym on the right wyng of the ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayle: wherfore he retourned to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany &amp; fiersly assayled the fresshe fotemen which <abbr>wer</abbr> with Bocchus / and at one syde brake in amonge the thyckest of them. But Bocchus anone tourned his backe: and gaue hymselfe to flyght.</p>
                     <p>¶On the othersyde Iugurth which in his part of the batay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le almost had optayned vyctory dyd his diligence to incoura<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge &amp; support his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany: and to mentayne that aua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he had won. And at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion al in vayne. For whyle he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured there about as a worthy captayne: the spear men of the romayns so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pased hym &amp; his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany about both on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right syde &amp; on the lyft: that al his garde &amp; other which were about hym at conclusion were slayne. But he hymselfe glad to saue his lyfe / brake forth alone from among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myddes of his enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and from wepyns and dartes with great difficuly. ¶But in the meane tyme Marius had ouercome &amp; driuen away the horsmen which assayled hym. Wherfore anone he re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turned fiersly to helpe and socours of his company whome he vnderstode somwhat put backe by viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their ennemies. But he by his policy and valiant dedes anone so reconforted his men that none of his ennemies were able to withstande their violence in any part of that batayle.</p>
                     <p>¶Thus finally the romayns after great labour and many greuous woundes disconfited their ennemies on euery syde. But whan the batayle was ended and the romayns began to pursue the chase: than verily it was a pytefull and horrible syght to beholde in the open feldes and to consyder the cruel spectacle of batayle. Howe some fled: Some pursued / some inraged murdring / some rored dyeng / some slayne / some ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

The ground ouerspred with deed corpses mangled / mutulate / and horribly hewyn: inuolued in blode co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geled.

hym accompanyed with a fewe of his frendes / and also with Sylla: fayninge that he went so forth to mete with Iugurth and to receyue hym / bycause of honour. And thus they proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded forwarde: tyl at last they came to an opyn heyth / where they myght easely se the commyng of Iugurth: whiche place was apoynted before to their treason. For in dyuerse valeys of the same heyth: were armed men lyenge in wayt redy and apoynted before by Bocchus: for to assayle Iugurth and his company / whan signes shuld be gyuen to them: to yssue forth of their lurkyng places. Anone Iugurth with many of his men about hym came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same place al vnarmed: as apoynte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment was made before.

                     <p>¶Anon as Iugurth was come thyder: kyng Bocchus gaue a token to his men / which lay in wayt for Iugurth. Anone as they harde the token: sodaynly they bracke forth and inuaded Iugurth and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany: compasynge them about on euery syde. Without great labour: al the company of Iugurth were murdred: and he hymselfe taken and bounde hande and fote / and so delyuerd vnto Sylla: whiche without tary led hym forth and delyuerd hym vnto Marius: whose hert was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenysshed and inuironed / with ioye inestimable.</p>

                     <p>¶For the same tyme whyle Marius warred in Numidy: and toke Iugurth prisoner. That cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of France (whose people that tyme were named Cymbrians) rebelled agaynst the empyre of Rome. Agaynst whome the romayns sende forth to represse their rebellion: a great army with two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitayns: the one named Quintus Scipio / the other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Manlyus: whiche at last with frowarde fortune had a great and greuous batayle with the same frenchmen Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians. In which both these romayne capitayns were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come· and twyse lost the felde. Of the romayns men of war: were slayne .lxxx. thousande: of tylmen / and pages .xl. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande. Thus was this batayle foughten with so yl fortune vnto the romayns: that the cite of Rome / and al the countrey of Italy trembled for feare therof.

Wherfore (as I haue before recounted) the Senate: and commens of Rome / decreed this prouince of France to Marius for to reuenge the deth of their men: and to recouer the countrey.</p>
                     <p>¶But (to our purpose) whan Marius shulde intre into Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me he was ioyfully receyued with great glorie and triumphe: wherof the order was suche.
