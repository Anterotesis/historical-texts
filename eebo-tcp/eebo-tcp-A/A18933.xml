            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſo ignorant, as to depraue and calumniate the Methode here vſed; by ſaying, that we are not to inuulgar the Myſteryes of ſacred Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuity by way of Poeticall fiction of Dialogues, in forging that to be, which indeed is not. Which aſperſion of any ſuch <hi>Critick</hi> is eaſily wyped away, by the warrantable examples in this kind of <hi>S. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Theodoret, S. Gregory the Great,</hi> and others: who were not afrayd to treate of the higheſt matters of fayth, in forme of Dialogues. Againe, ſuch an inconſiderate aſſertion muſt needs condemne Poetry in generall (ſeeing Dialogues are a kind of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) which how great an errour it were, might eaſily appeare, in that <hi>Poëtry is masked Philoſophy; Philoſophy Natures true Hiſtory; Nature Gods ſeruiceable Agent or Handmayd.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids, I am of iudgment that the Body of any long Diſcourſe (like an vnformed <hi>Chäos)</hi> is beſt brought into an Orbe of forme and Order, by help of interlocutions. And laſtly, admit this kind of Wryting were ſtrange and vnuſuall, and chiefly ſorting to ſubiects of leſſer importance; (as indeed, it is not) yet here we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that a Phantaſtike often begins a faſhion, which graue Men (not to be thought Phantaſticks) are in the end content to follow.</p>
                  <p>Now to approach neerer the ſeuerall ſubiects, handled in all theſe Dialogues. In the firſt is diſputed a Controuerſy, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated and toſſed betweene the Catholiks and the Proteſtants; to wit, touching the change of fayth in the Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>The Interlocutours are <hi>Cardinall Bellarmyne</hi> (that <hi>Hereſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſtix) Michaeas,</hi> a learned Iewiſh Rabin, and <hi>Doctour Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers</hi> of Cambridg. The place of this conference I haue made to be the great citty <hi>Coſmopolis in Vtopia;</hi> ſince an imaginary place beſt ſorteth to an imaginary diſputation, in reſpect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons feigned. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> iuſtifyeth the Catholiks poſition; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicet, that no change in fayth and Religion hath bene made in the Church of Rome ſince the Apoſtles dayes: Which Poſition is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the iuncture, without which the whole frame almoſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Controuerſies hang looſe. <hi>Doctour Whitakers</hi> vndertaks to proue the Contrary; In whom rather, then in any other Proteſtant, I haue peculiarly (and <hi>ex profeſſo)</hi> made choyce to perſonate all
<pb facs="tcp:23452:4"/>
the ſpeeches and arguments, vſed to proue this ſuppoſed change in the Church of Rome; principally, becauſe there is no Proteſtant wryter (that I know) who hath ſo much proſecuted this preſumed change, as <hi>Doctour Whitakers</hi> hath done; as appeareth in his Bookes agaynſt the <hi>Cardinall</hi> himſelfe, agaynſt <hi>Father Campion</hi> (that bleſſed Saint) and cheifly againſt <hi>Duraeus,</hi> where the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour vndertaketh to inſtance diuers examples of this imaginary Reuolt. Yet here you are to conceaue, that I haue not ſo dwelled in the only wrytings of <hi>Doctour Whitakers,</hi> as that I neglect what other Proteſtants haue alſo written in maintenance of this change: for I aſſure you, I haue omitted nothing of Moment, which I could fynd in their Bookes, to be obiected in proofe thereof; though <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour Whitakers</hi> is introduced to deliuer or ſpeake it. And withall I haue made ſpeciall references to their Books, where ſuch their ſentences or authorities are to be found; And yet <hi>(learned Men)</hi> notwithſtanding all that, which can be vrged by any of them in this behalfe; ſooner ſhall they prooue, that the fixed ſtarrs haue changed their poſtures &amp; ſituations in their Orbe, then that Rome hath changed it fayth: So true are thoſe words of an auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <note n="*" place="margin">Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anz. in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ſua.</note>

The <hi>Concluſion</hi> conſiſteth in retorting that vpon our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſartes, where with they here charge the Church of Rome; I meane, in demonſtrating, that it is the Proteſtant, who hath made in fayth this change and innouation, from the auncient fayth of the Apoſtles; And thus by comparing theſe two contrary fayths &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines together, and the antiquity of the one, and innouation of the other, you ſhall find, that errour is beſt knowne by truth, as death is knowne bylife.</p>
                  <p>Now here your ingenuities are to ſuppoſe for the tyme, that <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Doctour Whitakers</hi> are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent liuing; In like ſort, that the <hi>Cardinall</hi> hath read all bookes written either in Latin or Engliſh, which are in this Dialogue alleadged: Which like ſuppoſalls you are alſo to make in the other ſubſequent Dialogues, touching the Perſons in them produced; as that they are now liuing, and that they all liued at one tyme &amp;c. All which imaginations are fully iuſtifiable in the true methode of Dialogues; ſince in this kind of writing, the Perſons (you know) are forged for the matter, and not the matter for the Perſons: And thus much touching the firſt Dialogue.</p>
                  <p>Now to deſcend to the <hi>ſecond Dialogue;</hi> The ſubiect wherof is to demonſtrate, that the viſibility of the Proteſtant Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be iuſtifyed from the Primitiue Church, (much leſſe from the Apoſtles dayes) till <hi>Luthers</hi> reuolt: And which is more, that not any one Man, during all that long Period of tyme (nor <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe) can be truly inſiſted vpon, for a perfect &amp; abſolute Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; and ſuch as the preſent Church of England can, or will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be a member of it. Which point being once euicted, How deadly it woundeth the Proteſtants, may eaſily appeare; in regard of the euer neceſſary and vndeniable viſibility of Chriſts true Church; whoſe expanſion, enlargment, and vneclypſed radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy at all tymes, is much celebrated in Holy writ: <note n="a" place="margin">Eſay. 60.</note>

                  <p>I haue preſumed to incorporate moſt of what can be vrged for the viſibility of the Proteſtant Church, in <hi>Doctour Reynolds;</hi> as a Man, who was beſt able in his dayes to ſupport his owne Church from ruyne; And ſutably herto the ſuppoſed place of this diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Oxford.

                  <p>If any of you ſhall muſe, why in theſe Dialogues all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants (being otherwiſe preſumed to be moſt learned) do reply ſo ſparingly eyther to <hi>Cardinall Bellarmyne</hi> or to <hi>Michaeas</hi> their anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weres and arguments, as here you ſhall find them to do: you are to conceaue, that it is agreed in the begining of the two firſt Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues among all the Interlocutours, to ſtand indiſputably to the freqrent Confeſſions of the learned Proteſtants, vrged in behalfe of any poynt controuerted.

                  </p>
                  <p>But to reflect vpon the ſubiect of this ſecond Dialogue: And here I do auouch, that to maintayne, that Proteſtancy was euer before the breaking out of Luther (though euen then it was not in

                  <p>True it is, that in diuers former ages there haue bene ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret (and indeed blind) Moules, who working vnder the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roman Church, haue labored to caſt vp ſome earth of innouations and noueltyes, comparting perhapps in ſome one or two points with the ſectar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Be it then, that ſome Innouatours in ſeuerall Centuryes haue contumactouſly defended ſome one or other <hi>Theoreme</hi> or principle, without which the entyre frame of Proteſtancy cannot ſubſiſt; Will any of you from hence conclude (and yet many Proteſtants do ſo conclude) that ſuch Mens Religion was perfect Proteſtancy?

In this laſt Dialogue are alſo ſeuerall inſertions of ſome ſmall Treatiſes, in defence of diuers Catholike doctrines.)</p>
                  <p>The Interlocutours in this Dialogue are the right Honorable the Lord <hi>Cheife Iuſtice of England</hi> (to whom all dutifull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment is borne throughout this Diſcourſe) <hi>Michaeas,</hi> the <hi>former Iew,</hi> and <hi>M.

                     <p>Now here I ſe the Catholicke to condeme the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for his deſtroying, and taking away many Articles of Chriſtian Religion, to wit, the Doctrine of Free-will, of Purgatory, of Praying to Saincts, of Merit of workes, and (to omit many other controuerted points) the Reall Preſence in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and Sacrafice of the Alter; and for ſuch proceeding doth anathematize him for an Heretick. The Proteſtant (on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide) for the Catholicke his mantaining, and beleeuing the ſaid points, doth ſtyle him <hi>Superſtitious, Idolatrous,</hi> and, as on wholy exempt from all hope of <hi>Saluation.</hi> And in theſe matters the iudgments of the Proteſtant, and the Catholicke are ſo meerely contrary (the one conſtantly affirming, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peremptorily denying (as that their diſcording beleefes can neuer be wonn vp in any one publick confeſſion or Creede.</p>

                     <p>You both ſpeake learnedly. And firſt touching your directions (my <hi>L. Card.)</hi> I hold them moſt graue &amp; waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Yet ſeing I haue ſpent all my time chiefly in ſtudying the Law, and the Prophets (being heretofore a <hi>Rabnie</hi> in our Iewiſh <hi>Sinagogue)</hi> and ſeing that multiplity of reading, which your method exacts, (to wit of the Auntient Fathers, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels, Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories) is to great a burden to be impoſed now vpon the ſhoulders of my old age (my ſelfe not likely to liue ſo many years, as will be anſwerable to ſo infinit a labour) Therefore I muſt bethinke my ſelfe of ſome other more ſhort, and abreuiated courſe, for the perfect ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of my iudgment in the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>Touching your graue aduice <hi>(M. Doctour)</hi> of relying only
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23452:14"/>
vpon the <hi>Writen word.</hi> Grant, that the Scripture alone were of it ſelfe ſufficient to define, and determine all Controuerſies in Religion; yet I am ſo conſcious of my owne weaknes herein, as that conſidering the ſeuerall ſences vſually giuen vpon one, and the ſame text, I ſhould euer reſt doubtfull (once abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſence, giuen by the ioynt conſent of all Ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours of what conſtruction to make choyce; and the rather ſeing the Scripture witneſſeth of it ſelfe, <hi>That no Propheſy</hi>

                        <hi>of the Scriprure is made, by priuat Intepretation.</hi> And ſure I am, that if we Iewiſh Rabbins ſhould take liberty to interprete the olde Teſtament, according to euery particular conceipte of each of vs, we longe ſince ſhould haue begotten many diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Faith amonge vs.</p>
                     <p>I may add hereto, that I am the more eaſily thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, euen by both your ſpeches at this preſent; ſeing both of you do ſtrengthen, and fortifie your different iudgments (touching the finall determining of Controuerſies) euen from the Scripture it ſelfe. But what? doth the Scripture ſpeake different (or rather contrary things?) Noe. The Scripture is like to the Authour of Scripture; euer the ſame, and vncha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: <hi>Ego</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Malach. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>ſum dominus, et non mutor.</hi> And indeede to ſpeake plainly, when you vrge thoſe words: <hi>ſpiritus vbi vult, ſpirat.</hi> whereby you intimate the guift of the <hi>Priuat ſpirit,</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Scripture, I euer diſliked this Principle (euen before I beleeued in Chriſt) as ready to create in differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly any one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as well as an other: ſo that, that man, who for his Faith, and Religion grounds himſelfe vpon this <hi>Reuealing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly is ready to ſtampe any Religion, which himſelfe beſt pleaſeth, is like (in my iudgment) to on that ſhould be immediatly made rather of the <hi>firſt Matter,</hi> then of the Elements well tempred togeather; ſince he is in poſſibility, Anything. But to proceede: ſeing the directions of neither of you (in regard of ſome difficult circumſtances accompaning them) can at this preſent ſorte vnto my caſe, I muſt make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſome other method, for the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tling of my fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Conſcience in matter of Faith. And (vnder both your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23452:14"/>
it ſhalbe this, wheras by ſeriouſly peruſing the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> (as you Chriſtians call it) I am become with infinite thanks to the Lord of Hoſtes, a Chriſtian, though as yet, but a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian imperfect, and ſcarſly initiated: So out of the ſame deuine Records, I am inſtructed, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe primatiue times receaued the true Chriſtian Faith, incontami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and free from all errour. Now if thoſe ſacred writings be of ſufficient force with me, for my relinquiſhing of my ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Iewiſh faith; then ought they as ſecurely to warrant my Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the true Faith of Chriſt was planted in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This laſt point is confirmed to me by your great Apoſtle Paule, who in his Epiſtle to the Romans, much celebrateth the Faith of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaying: <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>To all, that be at Rome the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of God, called to be Saints, Grace to you.</hi> And againe <hi>I thanke</hi>

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>obdience is publiſhed in euery place.</hi> finally, the Apoſtle is ſo full in aduancing the Faith of the Romans, as that he particularly euen in words, aſcribs one, and the ſame Faith to himſelfe, and them ſaying: <hi>That,</hi> 
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>which is common to vs both, your Faith, and mine.</hi> From all which texts it is euicted, that <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe firſt times enioyed a true and perfect Faith. Now here it comes to be examined, <hi>whether Rome, ſince her firſt embracing of it, hath changed her Faith; or othirwiſe ſhe retaines without any alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame doctrine, which firſt the Apoſtles did plant in her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This point <hi>(moſt excellent Men)</hi> deſerus an exact diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing, and may well ſeeme to be worthy your ſerious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputs: My owne want in your Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories (from whence cheifly this queſtion is to receiue it triall) doth pleade for my ignorance herein, and makes my humble requeſt (for the better eſtableſhing of my yet vnſetled iudgment) to you both, to enter into a graue skirmiſh, and feight of diſputation herein.

                        <hi>Firſt</hi> then, we will take into our conſideration, how longe it is granted by your Proteſtants, that <hi>Rome</hi> did <hi>perſeuer</hi> without any alteration in her prematiue Faith. <hi>Secondly</hi> we will enquire, and ſet downe the acknowledged continuance of that time, during all which ſeaſon the now preſent Faith of <hi>Rome</hi> hath continued; That is, how longe Papiſtry (as you commonly tearme it) hath bene publikly profeſſed, and taught throughout all Chriſtendome. <hi>Thirdly</hi> and laſtly, we will then take a view of the times, betweene theſe two former ſeuerall times: for theſe two times being once acknowliged on all ſides (to wit, the time, during which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly kept her firſt Faith taught by the Apoſtles, and the time, during which the preſent Romane Faith hath continued from this day vpward) it ineuitably followeth, that this ſuppoſed change of Religion did either happen in the <hi>interſtitium,</hi> and meane time betweene the two former Periods of times, or els,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23452:17"/>
that there hapened no ſuch chang in Religion in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at all. Now concerning the firſt of theſe times, how long (in the Proteſtants iudgements) <hi>M. Doctour</hi> did the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> retayne without ſtaine, or alteration in any point of moment, or Article of beliefe (for that only is to be enquired) the Faith firſt deſeminated by the Apoſtles?</p>

                     <p>Now from all theſe former teſtimonies of your ſelfe, <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> &amp; other Proteſtant writers, we may infallibly conclude, that from this day till we arriue, at leaſt to the age of the fore-ſaid <hi>S. Gregory,</hi> the preſent Roman, &amp; Catholicke Religion was taught in diuers Countries; &amp; conſequently (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Countries receiued their inſtruction in Faith from <hi>Rome)</hi> that it was not during all this time introduced into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as an Innouation, and change of the Faith, afore profeſſed by the ſaid Church.</p>
                     <p>Now it being made euident; firſt, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did retaine her purity of Faith, the firſt foure hundred and forty yeares after Chriſt; and alſo, that for this laſt thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares, the preſent Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Catholicke Faith, hath not (at any time thereof) bin firſt brought into the world; but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſaid thouſand yeares it hath bin continually the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall taught doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> It now followeth, that we take into our conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the number of years which paſſed betweene the firſt foure hundred, and forty from Chriſt, and theſe laſt thouſand yeares from vs. Which number (ſeeing it is ſixteene hundred yeares, &amp; ſome more from Chriſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23452:19"/>
to vs) amounteth to about one hundred, and ſixty yeares.</p>
                     <p>Well then if here we can prooue that no change of Fayth in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> within the compaſſe of this 160. <hi>yeares;</hi> then followeth it vnauoidably, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> neuer to this day, hath ſuffered any alteration in Fayth, and Religion, ſince its firſt embracing of the Chriſtian Fayth.</p>
                     <p>That no Change of Faith did happen within the compaſſe of the ſayd 160. <hi>yeares,</hi> I prooue ſeuerall waies, yet all conducing to erect this one maine truth; like as diuers leſſer numbers (though counted after different waies) make vp but one, and the ſame great number. And firſt, this aſſertion of mine is prooued from the doctrine, which was beleeued, and generally taught at ſuch tyme, as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (who was our firſt Chriſtian Emperour) was conuerted to Chriſtianity, which was about the yeare 320. after Chriſt, and therefore before the foreſayd 160. yeares.</p>
                     <p>That the Faith in his time, was the ſame, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> profeſſeth at this preſent, appeareth from the frequent teſtimonies of your former <hi>Centuriſts;</hi> who moſt elaborately, &amp; punctually do record all the particuler Articles of the preſent <hi>Romane Fayth,</hi> to be beleeued moſt conſtantly by the ſaid <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> and that he did cauſe to be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe all the Ceremonies, now vſed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the ſaid <hi>Centuriſts</hi> are ſo exact, and diligent in their enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of all the Catholicke Doctrines beleeued by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> and of the Catholicke Rites, and Ceremo ies obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his time; as that they ſpend ſeuerall Columnes of the fourth <hi>Century</hi> touching this point; to wit, from Column. 452. to Column. 497. or thereabout.</p>
                     <p>Now that not only <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelfe, but alſo the whole fourth Age did generally beleeue, and profeſſe the now profeſſed Doctrine of the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> is in like ſort abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confeſſed, &amp; regiſtred by the ſaid <hi>Centuriſts,</hi> they ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding moſt of the leaues of the ſaid <hi>Century,</hi> in particularizing the now Catholicke Doctrines, and the doctours of that age

                     <p>Therefore in the Authorities of this Nature, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from our Aduerſaries writinges, we are to diſtinguiſh, and ſeuer that, which the Aduerſaries granteth in the behalfe of vs,

                     <p n="3">(3) <hi>Thirdy,</hi> we may call to mind, that wheras the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in the celeberation of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> were ſucceſſiuely and at ſeuerall tymes added, and firſt brought in by ſeuerall Popes; So we finde accordingly, that the Aduerſaries <note n="p" place="margin">The booke entituled: The Relicks of Rome, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Tho.

                     <p>Here now I vrge. If the Enemyes of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> being thus diligent and ſollicitous in noting the beginning of eich Ceremony of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> (all ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies being meerely accidentall to the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and without which the <hi>Maſſe</hi> may as truly and effectually be celebrated, as with them) If they (I ſay) could haue diſcouered any innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the maine Doctrine it ſelfe of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> (as in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Reall Preſence,</hi> the Sacrifice of Chriſts body there offered vp, our Adoration of the Sacrament, the Prieſts enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned chaſtity for ſuch his celebration) would they haue bin ſilent therin? or rather would they not haue loaded their books with the relation of all ſuch innouations; they conſiſting not in ſmale ceremonies, but in moſt ſublime, and high dogmaticall points of Chriſtian Religion? If otherwiſe; then belike our Aduerſaries would haue vs to thinke, that herin they reſemble the Sunne, which reuealeth the Terreſtriall Globe, being but of a litte quantity; but concealeth the Celeſtiall, which is of a far more ſpatious greatnes.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed; and to conclude the force of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, drawne from the impugning, and recording of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations in doctrine: if this preciſe courſe (by our Aduerſaryes

                     <p>But now to vndertake, according to your deſire, <hi>(Micheas)</hi> an other argument. You Proteſtants, <hi>M.

                     <p>What ſtrang <hi>Logicke</hi> is this? and how poore a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation do you make. The mayne queſtion betweene vs, is, whether <hi>the preſent Church of Rome hath changed it Fayth, or no, ſince the Apoſtles dayes?</hi> To prooue, that it hath not, Iverge that the profeſſours therof did neuer go out of any more ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church, and conſequently euer retayned without change it former Fayth: Now you in anſwere hereto (as not being able to inſtance the perſons, by whom, or the tymes when, any ſuch departing, or going out was made by the Profeſſours of our Religion) reply, that it Doctrine is different from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtles; and therfore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath changed it Religion ſince the Apoſtles tymes: and this ſophiſm (you know) is but <hi>Petitio Principij,</hi> or a beginning of the matter in queſtion, and is nothing els but (without anſwering to any of my premiſſes) the denyall of my Concluſion; which kynd of anſwenng, I am ſure, impugneth all <hi>Logicke,</hi> and therfore all Reaſon; ſince <hi>Logicke</hi> is but Reaſon ſublimated and refined.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed further. In euery introduction of a new Religion, or broaching of any innouation in Doctryne,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23452:33"/>
the Profeſſours therof receaue a new denomination, or name, for the moſt part, from the firſt authour of the new doctryne, and ſometymes from the Doctrine its ſelfe; like vnto a running riuer, which commonly taketh the name of that riuer, into which it falleth. Thus the <hi>Arians,</hi> the <hi>Valentinians, Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts Manicheans</hi> from <hi>Arius, Valentinus, Marcian,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheus &amp;c.</hi> or from the doctrine it ſelfe, as the Hereticks <hi>Monothelites, Agnoitae, Theopaſchitae &amp;c.</hi> though this more ſeldome.</p>
                     <p>This Note, or Marke, of impoſing a new name of the Profeſſours of euery arriſing Hereſy, may be exemplified in all Hereſies without exception, ingendred ſince the Apoſtles tymes, euen to this day: a poynt ſo exempt from all doubt, as that your learned Man <hi>M.

                     <p>Wel, <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> touching the venom, you ſpit out againſt <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Religion, I holde it, but as fome, &amp; froth of a diſtempered ſtomack, and therfore I paſſe it ouer: but to returne to my argument. Here now I wilbe ſeruiceable vnto you, and by the mixture of all theſe former <hi>Ingredients,</hi> I will preſent you with a wholſome <hi>Electuary,</hi> compounded of them all: for indeede I holde the demonſtration iſſuing out of the premiſſes, ſo vnauoydable, as that it precludeth, and foreſtalleth the aduerſary of all ſhew of Reply.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then it is graunted, that the <hi>Britons</hi> were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the Fayth of Chriſt by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Aramathia;</hi> who as he had the honour to interre our Sauiour, &amp; lay his ſacred Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in a new monument, cut out of a rock (as the <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt</hi> ſpeaketh) ſo enioyed he the happines to bury al former infidelity in the <hi>Britons,</hi> and to cloath, or infolde their (afore ſtony, and rocky) harts, within the cleane <hi>Syndon</hi> of a pure Fayth in our Sauiour:</p>
                     <p>But to proceed. Secondly, it is confeſſed, that the <hi>Britons</hi> retayned this their firſt Fayth, ſpotles, and without change, till <hi>Auguſtins</hi> comming into <hi>England: Thirdly,</hi> it is prooued, that at the tyme of the conference betweene <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and the <hi>Briton Byſhops,</hi> the greateſt difference in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fayth, and Religion, (wherupon they ſtoode) were but two poynts, cheifly conſiſting in Ceremony; to wit, the <hi>keeping of Eaſter day</hi> in it vſuall tyme, and the <hi>forme of Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,</hi> according to the rites of <hi>Rome. Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly, it is graunted, that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> here planted, and preached to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23452:37"/>
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> all Articles, and points of the preſent Romane Religion, or <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> as you Proteſtants do vſually ſtyle it.</p>
                     <p>Now, <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> what other reſultancy can here be made out of all theſe Premiſſes, but this? To wit, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Auguſtins</hi> time teaching <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> was who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable (the two points, or Ceremonies of <hi>keeping Eaſter day,</hi> and of <hi>baptiſing with the Rites</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> only excepted) with the Fayth, and Religion, which was planted among the <hi>Britons</hi> by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Aramathia</hi> in the Apoſtles daies: and conſequently, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaching <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> did neuer ſuffer any change in her Faith, and Religion ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles departed. This is the Argument, wherin (I graunt) I partly inſult; it is inauoidable; it is a demonſtration: And pryſe it <hi>Micheas</hi> as a ſtrong <hi>Aries,</hi> beating downe, &amp; bearing before it, whatſoeuer may ſeeme to withſtand the Truth in this pointe controuerted.</p>

                     <p>In deed, my <hi>Lord,</hi> it ſeemes to me very forcible, and you did well to reſerue it to the laſt place; that ſo (like ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats) it might pleaſingly cloſe vp the taſt of our iudgments.

                        <hi>My Lord,</hi> This your argument is tyed togeather with many links, and breake but one of them, all the reſt are looſed. And indeed it is but an argument drawne from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>Negatiuely,</hi> and by <hi>Omiſſion</hi> only; which you know is little valued in the ſchooles. For the hinge (as I may ſay) or weight of it only conſiſteth in this. That at the meeting of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and the <hi>Briton</hi> Biſhops, diſſented from <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> But of other greater points we read no mention made among them; and therfore for any thing we know, the <hi>Britons</hi> might aſwell diſagree from <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in all other Articles paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in ſilence, as agree with them.</p>

                     <p>Therfore my abſolute, and laſt reſolution here is, that the Fayth of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> was then one, and the ſame in all Articles with the Fayth of the <hi>Britons,</hi> firſt preached to them in the Apoſtles dayes, (the Ceremonies of <hi>Baptiſing,</hi> and of keeping <hi>Eaſter</hi> day cheifly excepted) which leſſer errours, <hi>S.

Auguſtine,</hi> with the then Doctrine, and Fayth of the <hi>Briton Biſhops,</hi> I will adde the acknowledgement of the <hi>Briton Biſhops</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, of whom <hi>S.

                     <p>
                        <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> before I come to apply particuler an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres to your particuler inſtances following; I muſt tell you, that the force of all ſuch your inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces is already ouerthrowne, by what is deliuered aboue. For if it be already demonſtrated, that no cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of faith hath bin made at any time in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> partly by freeing euery age of the Church, ſince Chriſts time from any change in Religion, euen by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the learned Proteſtants; partly by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting, that neither the Church of Chriſt, neuer made any reſiſtance againſt the firſt ſuppoſed change (as both in duety it was bound to do, and as the holy Scripture propheſieth, that it ſhould euer do, at the innouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any new Doctrine) neither doth any Hiſtoriographer record in his Hiſtory any ſuch cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge; partly by diſcouering the vncertaine iudgments of your owne Brethren touching Antichriſts firſt comming; at what time this ſo much preſſed Innouation of Faith is taught to haue happened; and finally, partly by diuers other reaſons
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23452:39"/>
aboue diſcuſſed, and diſputed: I ſay, if all this hath bin aboue prooued (as I hope it is) then doth it follow, that all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Inſtances, and Examples (vpon which you may hereafter ſeeme in an ignorant eye to inſiſt) are impertinent, friuolous, and wholy by you miſtaken. Neuertheles, for the fuller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this our <hi>Learned IeW,</hi> I will with peculiar anſweres refell euery one of your peculiar Examples. And firſt, to your firſt. Where it ſeemes, that the Doctrine of vowed Chaſtity in Cleargy Men toucheth you neare, in regard of your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters coniugall liues, ſeeing you begin there with. And here by the way, I muſt make bold to ſay, that you Proteſtants (God be thanked) cannot iuſtly be charged with being repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuperſtitious Votaries, and wilfull Eunuchs, (as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prieſts are ſtyled by ſome of your Brethren to be) ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full you are of your owne reputation herein: but the leſſe meruayle, ſince the very <hi>Body</hi> of Proteſtancy is Senſuality (pardon me, <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> for ſpeaking that, which Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and your owne <hi>Theorems</hi> depoſe to be true) as the <hi>ſoule</hi> of it is an aſſumed height of mind, and controule of all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p>But now to your example, wherof you produce no authority of any ancient Father affirming ſo much, but only your owne naked aſſertion. This of <hi>Siricius</hi> is wrongfully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged for ſeuerall reſpects: firſt, in that we finde <hi>S. Hierome</hi> (who liued before <hi>Siricius)</hi> to write of this point in this ſort: <note n="k" place="margin">In Apolo. ad Pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mach. cap. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>If marryed men like not of this</hi> (meaning of the ſingle life of the Cleargy) <hi>let them not be angry with me, but with the holy Scriptures, with all Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons; who know, they cannot offer vp Sacrifice, if they vſe the act of Marryage.</hi> Thus (we ſee) <hi>S.

                        <hi>M. Doctour.</hi> Here I muſt make bold to interpoſe my iudgment. And truely, I can hardly be induced to thinke prayer for the dead (which neceſſarily reſulteth out of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Purgatory) to be an Innouation; much leſſe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therof to be firſt inuented by the Father, whome you ſtyle <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi> who, and at what time he liued, I knowe not. My reaſon is this: I am aſſured, both by my owne practiſe, and peruſing of our Iewiſh bookes, that prayer for the dead was euer vſed in our Synagogues, and is practiſed by vs Iewes euen to this day. And here, ſuppoſing, that the Booke of the <hi>Machabees</hi> be but <hi>Apocriphall,</hi> yet it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all, that the Hiſtories there recorded, are true Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Now there we read, that <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi> (the vndowb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeruant of God) commanded prayers, and ſacrifices to be made for the dead Souldiers, vpon which Act, it is there ſaid: <hi>So</hi>

                     <p>This Doctrine with vs Iewes was ſo generall, as that (to omit all other ancient <hi>Rabbins,</hi> teaching the ſame) <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Simeon</hi> (a learned Iew, and who liued before Chriſt) thus writeth of thoſe, who are temporally puniſhed after this life: <note n="u" place="margin">In. l.

                     <p>You muſt call to minde here, <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> the reaſon, why <hi>Victor</hi> did excommunicate the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which was, becauſe the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> were vnwilling to conforme themſelues to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in keeping of <hi>Eaſter day,</hi> to wit, to keepe it onely vpon Sunday; whereas they would needs continue the keeping of it vpon the 14. of the Moone, according to the cuſtome of the Iewes: Now for this their reluctation herein againſt the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Victor</hi> did excommunicate them.</p>
                     <p>But when this ſeemed (as being but a Ceremony, and for a time tollerated, through the weaknes of the Iewes) in the iudgment of diuers, too ſmal an occaſion to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and cut off ſo many famous Churches, therfore <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> was cenſured by diuers, to be ouer ſeuere in proſecuting with ſo great a puniſhment, ſo ſmal a ſeeming fault. From which, their thus cenſuring of <hi>Victor,</hi> we may rather gather his Primacy aboue other Churches, then otherwiſe: and the reaſon hereof is, becauſe we do not finde any of the ſayd Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to charge <hi>Victor</hi> with any Innouation, in vnduely aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to himſelfe this Authority ouer other Churches (which doubtleſly they would haue done, if <hi>Victor</hi> had firſt taken this priuiledge to himſelfe, they being ſo iuſtly prouoked thereto) but they did onely rebuke, (as is ſayd) his ouermuch rigid ſeuerity, in puniſhing (as they thought) ſo rigorouſly, ſo ſmal a diſobedience in the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea which is more, that <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who was moſt forward in taxinge <hi>Victor</hi> with his ſharp proceeding, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth to <hi>Victor</hi> a ſoueraignety ouer all Churches.

                        <hi>M.

                     <p>But becauſe theſe ſimilitudes, and reſemblances are moſt vrged, not only by your ſelfe, but alſo by many other Proteſtants of Note, and haue much ſwayd with vulgar iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not in reſpect of any force in them, but in regard of the eminency of their firſt Inuentors (ſo the water heateth, not becauſe it is water but by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it borrowed heate elſwhere: Therefore I will examine them narrowly, and will ſhew the great diſparity betweene them, and the change, which is at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time made in Religion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Firſt</hi> then, the firſt ſmale decay in any building, and the (firſt ſhew of whitenes in haires is imperceptible, and not to be diſcerned; wheras euery change in faith (though but in one point, or article) is moſt markeable, and ſubiect to obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>

(3) <hi>Thirdly,</hi> not any haue the charge, or care impoſed vpon them, to obſerue the changes in theſe petty matters; but in the Church of Chriſt there are euer appointed Paſtours, &amp; Doctors, whoſe office is to marke the firſt beginning of any innouation in doctrine, and accordingly to labour to ſuppreſſe the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4) <hi>Fourthly,</hi> theſe ſimilitudes, and deceitfull reſemblances (being truly vrged) do recoyle backe with diſaduantage to the Proteſtants. For although we cannot ſhew, when the firſt haire began to be white, or the firſt ſlifter in a houſe begunne to be a ſlifter; yet any notable degrees of the ſaid whitenes in the haires, or of the ſlifters in a houſe are eaſily diſcerned: and therefore the Proteſtants are obliged (euen from the nature of theſe their owne ſimilitudes) to tell vs, at what times ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible degrees, and increaſe of this ſuppoſed change did happen; and the manifeſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe degrees is to be made, by naming the time, and perſon, when, &amp; by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch, and ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular poynt, or article of our preſent Roman Religion, was firſt ſenſibly introduced into the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The which not any Proteſtant (notwithſtanding all his exquiſite and preciſe ſearch of Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories) hath bin able yet to perform. And thus farre, <hi>M.

                        <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> this is a meare groundles Phantaſie. If you haue any graue teſtimonies warranting a generall ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all ſuch records; then all of them were not extinguiſhed ſince the teſtimonies, which affirme ſo much, are yet extant. If you produce no authority witneſſing ſo much, then why ſhould we beleiue your bare, and naked affirmation herein? But to examine more punctually this poore refuge. And firſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you teach, that this change of Faith in the Roman Church came in by degrees, now by innouating one point of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient true Fayth, now another: ſuppoſing for the time this to be true, how can it be conceiued, that all the Coppies of ſuch particular changes in Faith, already diſperſed throughout all Chriſtendome in the handes of infinite Proteſtants (as you ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, though vntruly that in thoſe times they were) could be gathered, &amp; ſuppreſſed without any remembrance thereof to all poſterity? It is moſt abſurd, but to furmiſe ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore do we not ſee, that the liues of ſuch Popes, which can be leſſe warranted, were recorded in hiſtories, yet extant to this very houre (as elſe where is intimated:) Neither the narrations of them either were, or could euer be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? How then can we be perſuaded, that the memory of this ſuppoſed great chang could by any ſuch meanes be cancelled in a perpetuall forgetfulnes? Since certaine it is, that the Popes (if poſſible they could) would haue cauſed all narrations, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the perſonall faults of their Predeceſſours to haue beene vtterly extinguiſhed; conſidering, that ſuch their leſſe iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able liues might be reputed by many to be no ſmale blemiſne to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Such an improbability this your euaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>M.

                     <p>
                        <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> before I come to ballance this your laſt argument, you muſt pardon me, if I ſmile to my ſelle to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:23452:57"/>
obſerue, how affectedly, and ambitiouſly you haue rioted in your Greeke throughout this whole diſcourſe; and eſpecially in this your laſt cloſe, beſprinkling diuers paſſages thereof (as it were) with ſome Greeke word or other. Which in my iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (beare with me if I miſconſter your meaning) is but to beare your ignorant followers in hand, what jolly men, and great Clarkes you Proteſtants are. And according hereto we commonly find, the bookes writen either by Engliſh, French, or German Proteſtants, euen to ſwell with Greeke phraſes, or ſentences. But who ſeeth not, how forced this is? it being a point of oſtentation, and vanity, thus to braue it forth in a froath of ſtrange wordes.</p>
                     <p>We all know, the tongues are but the porters of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (in which the Catholicks, though with more ceſſion, &amp; modeſty, are moſt skilfull) and that he, who is a learned man indeede, is euer preſumed afore hand to be expert in them, as being meanes conducing to the perfection of learning: Thus the want of Greeke is a great defect; the enioying of it but a neceſſary furniture of a ſcholar. Therefore who vanteth hereof or is become fond of a few greeke words (being commonly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the riches contayned in that tongue, as many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are) is like to that man, who taketh delight in a litle Mother of Pearle, he reioiceth; he hauing no intereſt to the Pearle within contayned. I ſpeake not this, but that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſometime to make vſe of Greeke phraſes, and ſentences; but this chiefly, when the Queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is touching tranſlations out of that tongue, and that we are to recurre to the Greeke (being the originall) for the cleering of that point: Or when the Greeke word, or phraſe carieth with it a greater grace, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and force, then the ſame in Latin, or Engliſh will beare. But this I euer auerre, that to be ready vpon euery lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle occaſion to proſtitute, or ſtaule forth ones Greeke (a diſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature peculiar to Proteſtants) as if he tooke a pride, in that he is skilfull in coniugating of <hi>typtò:</hi> This man (I ſay) deſerues to be verberated throughout all the moodes, and tences of the word, for ſuch his folly: This courſe being among all graue, &amp;

learned men, iuſtly cenſured for an exploded vanity.</p>
                     <p>But now, <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> to deſcend to your reaſon touched aboue, and drawne from the authority of the holy Scripture. Here I ſay, you haue taken your laſt Sanctuary; not in that the Scripture maketh for you, and againſt vs; but that by this meanes you may the better reiect all other authorities, though neuer ſo forcible, &amp; reduce the triall of all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies to your owne priuat Iudgments? ſince you will acknowledge no other ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſcripture, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what the <hi>Genius</hi> of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy doth vouchſafe to impoſe vpon the <hi>Letter.</hi> &amp; thus by your faire pretended Gloſſe of the Scripture in this your laſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, you Proteſtants well reſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble that Man, who being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall, thinketh not how to preuent the fall, but how to fall in the fayreſt, and eaſieſt place. The like (I ſay) you do vnder the priuiledge of the <hi>reuealing ſpirit,</hi> interpreting the Scripture; the vaine, &amp; fluctuating vncertainty of which <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> to diſcouer (though this place be not capable therof) were indeed to cut in ſunder the cheife Artery, which giueth life to the huge Body of Hereſie? ſince once take away this <hi>Priuate Spirit,</hi> Hereſie is but like a dying la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe, which hath no oyle to feede it: Only I will here pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that as ſome haue thus left written. That <hi>muſt be good, which Nero perſecuteth;</hi> ſo here I do iuſtify by the contrary, that it muſt be euill, and falſe, which the <hi>Priuate Spirit</hi> affecteth, and manteineth.

Since not to vſe reaſon at all, is the property of a beaſt; to vſe it well, of a celeſtiall Angell.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the <hi>Parallell,</hi> which you make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Proteſtant, and Catholicke Countries, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe plainely, I do not conſpire with you in iudgment therein, your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Doctours, I purpoſely paſſe ouer in ſilence, and do repute them learned.</p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>Germans.</hi> It is true, that they haue beene, and ſtill are diuers graue ſchollers of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſome Proteſtants, and other Catholicks; and infinitly farre more Catholicks, then Proteſtants, by how much longer time <hi>Germany</hi> hath bin Catholicke, then Proteſtant; againſt whoſe honour, and due reputation, farre be it from me to ſpeake. Neuertheleſſe if we do with a ſteddy hand, ballance that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the cuſtome of it, with <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spayne,</hi> (to ſpeake nothing of <hi>France,</hi> which being almoſt wholy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, ſome few places excepted, hath, and doth daily bring forth men of great worth for learning.) We ſhall then eaſily diſcouer the diſproportion, and inequality.</p>
                     <p>And to giue a little touch of the nature of them all: who knoweth not, that in diuers parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are but certaine liueleſſe, and great <hi>Coloſſes,</hi> or <hi>Statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aes</hi> of fleſh, and bones; who make their bodies, but conduits, or ſtrayners for beare, and wine to paſſe through; belching out their diſcourſes of Religion in ful carouſes? a maine cloude, which darkneth the light of the vnderſtanding. Againe, who can be perſuaded, that <hi>Fleame,</hi> and <hi>Haire</hi> (the predominant complexion of that country) and a loathſome <hi>beſpitled ſtoue,</hi> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conteſt in matters of eruditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the <hi>ingenuous mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choly</hi> of the <hi>Italians,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and their moſt famous ſchools, and Academies? By the help of which actiue humour in them (for I ſpeake not of that groſſe, and dull <hi>Melancholly,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Man thinketh, and walketh away his dayes) the pure, and vnfettred Soule, diſorganized, (as it were) and vnbodyed for the tyme, doth by an inward reflex glaſle it ſelfe in it owne eſſence; and ſo tranſcending it accuſtomed limits, through an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:23452:62"/>
internall working of it owne Powers, doth penetrate the moſt difficult, and abſtruſe miſteries in learning, and religion; fanning away points, which in their owne properties are to be ſeuered, and caſting, or fagoting together things of one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>But to returne backe to <hi>Germany,</hi> (which I will euer acknowledg hath brought forth many moſt famous, and worthy Men for Learning, Vertue, and Piety,) your former aſſertion in aſcribing the Proteſt ant faith to all that Country, cannot be iuſtifyed. For though I grant, it is on moſt ſides obſeſt (as I may ſay) with Proteſtancy; yet it is certaine, that diuers principall parts thereof are not Proteſtant, but Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke in Religion: As halfe of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> a part of the <hi>Griſons, Voltolyne,</hi> the whole Country of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories</hi> of all the Biſhops <hi>Electours,</hi> the kingdome of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> beſides many Imperiall Citties, and ſtates.

                     <p>I Commend much your great feruour herein: But yet, I hold it more ſecure to pauſe for a time, to ſee, whether this your reſolution touching Prieſt hood (being, but the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiae</hi> of your ſpirit) be ſteddy, and permanent, or whether hereafter it may alter, and wauer.

                     <p>And you muſt knowe, that the wings of a new conuerted ſoule to Chriſt, do commonly at the firſt performe their ſpeedieſt flight: <note n="c" place="margin">Pſalm. 54</note>

                        <hi>My Lord,</hi> I make ſmale doubt, that this my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (through the ayde of him, who firſt did inſpire it into my ſoule) will remayne ſtable, and vnchangeable. Therefore your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> may further hereby take notice, that my intention is to ſpend his ſhort remnant of my yeares, in diligently ſtudying the Controuerſies betweene the Catholicks, &amp; the Proteſtants, to attempt (as afore I intimated) to plant that relilgion in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which you haue already planted in me.</p>
                     <p>I further am reſolued, to take a view (if my aged &amp; feeble body will ſuffer me) of the moſt famous Catholicke, &amp; Proteſtant Vniuerſities in Chriſtendome; and particularly I haue (I confeſſe) a thirſting deſire to ſee the two (ſo much ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated)

Vniuerſities of <hi>England</hi> (of the one of which, I here <hi>D. Whitakers</hi> is a member) places, of which <hi>Fame</hi> her ſelfe hath ſounded her trumpet, in the higheſt Note. Now (my <hi>good Lord)</hi> in regard of theſe my determinations, and of my late embracing of the preſent Roman Roligion, (the noyſe, and bruite whereof will, no doubt, ſpread it ſelfe at large.) I do probably preſage, that I ſhall meete with diuers Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who hearing of my election of Religion, will perhaps earneſtly ſolicite me, for my change to them; and making many violent incurſions, vpon my yet weake, and vnfortified iudgment, will endeauour to demolliſh, and lay leuell with the ground, whatſoeuer your <hi>Lordſpip</hi> (by your former lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diſcourſe) hath already built in my ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, that I may ſit cloſe, and immooueable in this my choyce of faith now made, I would intreate your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> to inſtruct me, how I may beſt guide occaſion in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with ſuch Men; that ſo they may not be able to winne ground vpon my weakeneſſe.

in which may be included the proofe of the truth, or falſhood of the Proteſtant Religion) then touching any <hi>dogmaticall point</hi> of faith, and doctrine, as receiuing it proofe from the ſcripture. This I ſpeake not, but that the ſcripture makes moſt clearly for the Catholicks, and againſt, the Proteſtants: But becauſe your aduerſary in diſpute will euer cauill at your expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Scripture; reducing it in the end (againſt all antiquity of Fathers, and tradition of the Church) to the interpretation of his owne priuate, and <hi>reuealing ſpirit;</hi> and ſo your labour would prooue, commonly, to be loſt thereby. Now in <hi>matter of fact,</hi> your Aduerſary is forced to ſtand to the authorities, deduced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, and other ſuch humane proofes; and therfore he muſt either ſhape a pro bable (if not a ſufficient) anſwere to them, which he neuer can do; they wholy making againſt him, euen by his owne learned bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns Confeſſions; or els he muſt reſt ſilent. And this is the reaſon, why the Proteſtants are ſo loath to diſpute of the Church; ſince this Queſtion comprehendeth in it ſelfe, diuers points of <hi>fact;</hi> as of it continuall Viſibility, Antiquity, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, Ordination, and Miſſion of Paſtours &amp;c. All which Queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s receiue their proofes from particuler Inſtances, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by ſhewing the particular times, perſons, and other circumſtances, concerning <hi>matter of fact.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An other reaſon of this your choyſe of your ſubiect of diſpute may be; in that few Men (and thoſe only ſchollers) can truly cenſure of the expoſition of ſcripture; whereas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt euery illiterate man (enioying but a reaſonable capacity) is able ſufficiently to iudge of the teſtimonies, produced to prooue, or diſprooue <hi>matter of fact.</hi> And here I would wiſh you, that in your diſpute you labour, to haue ſome Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks preſent; for where all the Auditory are Proteſtants, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that they will voice it againſt you, howſoeuer the diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may otherwiſe go. But becauſe theſe obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are ouer generall; I will giue you here ſome more particuler; ſince moſt of them may be reſtrained to certain particular paſſages, which may occurre betweene you, and your diſputant Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>

1. Firſt then, let the true ſtate of the Queſtion (diſcuſſed of) be ſet downe, and acknowledged on both ſides; in regard of the often willfully miſtaken doctrine of the Catholicks.

If your Aduerſary ſhould produce ſome ſuppoſed diſagreements in doctrine among Catholicks; you may reply, that their differences reſt only in ſome Circumſtances of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, Concluſion, and not in the Concluſion it ſelfe.

If your Aduerſary conteſt, that all the writinges, and memory of Proteſtants in former ages were extinguiſhed by the Popes of the ſaid, and after ſucceeding ages; you may ſhow, how abſurd this aſſertion is.

For ſeeing the ſaid bookes do indifferently make mention both of the Proteſtant Opinions, and of the other Hereſies defended by the ſame men; either the ſaid Bookes are to be beleeued in both, or to be reiected in both: If the firſt, then it is certaine, that thoſe men beleeued thoſe acknowledged Hereſies, and then they can not be inſtanced for perfect Proteſtants: If the later; then the ſaid Bookes are not of any ſufficient authority to prooue, that there were any Proteſtants in thoſe ages.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. There is great diſparity betweene Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing ſome points, which do aduantage the Catholicke faith (as for examples, that the Primitiue Fathers were Papiſts in all cheife Articles of Papiſtry, as the Aduerſary vſe to tearme it) and other Proteſtants, impugning the ſaid Confeſſions. Seeing the firſt men ſpeake againſt themſelues, and their Cauſe; which (they being learned) would neuer do, but as conuinced with the euidency of the truth therein; whereas theſe other do deny the Confeſſions of their owne Brethren, in behalfe of their owne Religion; and ſo ſuch their denialls are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted more partiall. In like ſort, there is great difference to be made, betweene Proteſtants ſpeaking againſt themſelues, and yet beleeuing the Proteſtant doctrine, and concluſion, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſome Circumſtances, whereof their ſaid Confeſſions are; and betweene ſome others, who afore were Catholickes, and after do defend ſome one point, or other of Proteſtancy. Since theſe later men do not ſpeake againſt themſelues, but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ſuch their Proteſtant doctrine, then newly entertained by them, and conſequently, in defence of their owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and therefore ſuch their authorities are not to ballance

If your Aduerſary doth produce any authorities; either from the Popes Decrees, or from Generall Councels; (by the which the Antiquity of ſome Catholicke Article may be impugned). Be carefull, 1.

                     <p>2. That the point vrged out of the Councell doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Doctrine of faith, and not matter of fact; touching which later point, it is granted a Councell may alter it Decrees, vpon better, and later informations. 3. That the Canon, or Decree poduced out of the Councell, do immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the doctrine it ſelfe of ſome Article of faith, (then ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be brought in) and not the name only to be impoſed vpon the ſaid doctrine afore beleeued; as it happened in the Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> touching the word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>

                     <p n="14">14. If your Aduerſary produce the ancient Fathers in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Proteſtancy, firſt aske him, if he will inappealea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtand to their iudgments? If he will; then vrge the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants (whoſe bookes are moſt plentifull in ſuch like accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) charging them, as Patrons of Papiſtry. If he will not ſtand to their authority; then demand; to what end he doth alleadg them? And further let him know, that it is the ioynt conſent of Fathers (without contradiction of other Orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Fathers) which the Catholicks do admit. Where ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants obiect, that diuers points of the Cathoclike Religion were condemned in ſome Hereticks, by the Orthodoxall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Primitiue Church; you may truely reply hereto,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:23452:71"/>
that the Article, or concluſion it ſelfe, of any Catholick point, was not condemned by them; but only ſome abſurd, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Circumſtance (annexed by the ſaid Hereticks to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) was condemned by the Fathers. Thus the Catholicks are charged by <hi>D. Fulke.</hi> and others, to borrow the praying to Saints, and Angels from certaine old Heretickes, condemned by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> for this doctrine. Whereas thoſe Heretickes praied both, to good, &amp; bad Angels, &amp; to thoſe, who were falſly tearmed Angels; accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pting them as Patrons of their wickednes. And for theſe Circumſtances only <hi>Epiphanius</hi> regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Hereticks. This ſleight is much practiſed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in certaine points of the Catholicke Religion. Therefore be ſure to ſee the words of the Fathers ſo condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, in the Fathers owne bookes; which if you do, you ſhall diſcouer wonderfull forgery, and deprauation of the ſaid Fathers writings, vſed by the Proteſtants.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. If it be vrged, that the deniall of <hi>Free-will</hi> (for example, and ſo of other Articles of Proteſtancy) was taught by <hi>Manichaeus;</hi> and conſequently, that the Proteſtant faith is as ancient, as thoſe primitiue times. Reply, that this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer Hereticke, or that particuler Sectary did teach, but one, or other Proteſtant Article, and were inſtantly written againſt for ſuch their Innouation, the ſaid Men being Catholicke in other points. And therefore you may truly auerre, that the vrging of ſuch Examples are wholy impertinent, either for the proofe of the antiquity of Proteſtancy, or for the viſibility of the Proteſtant Church in thoſe daies.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. When you produce the ancient Fathers againſt the Proteſtants, their common ſhift is to make an oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Scripture, and the Fathers; mantaining that to follow the Fathers iudgment in faith, is to reiect, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Scripture; and that themſelues are to be pardoned for preferring the Scripture before the Fathers. But to this you may anſwere, that ſeeing the Fathers do admit, and reuerence the ſcripture in as high a degree, as the Proteſtants do; The maine queſtion, and doubt here is onely, <hi>whether the Fathers,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:23452:71"/>
or the Proteſtants do more truly expound the Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">18. When a Catholicke doth alleadge the Fathers, the Proteſtants do ſeeke to leſſen their authorities ſeuerall waies, as by obiecting either another Father, or the ſaid Father in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place againſt himſelfe, ſo falſly traducing him, as a mantainer of contrary Doctrines. In like ſort, by obiecting ſome confeſſed errour of the Father produced by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke; which cheifly houldeth in <hi>Origen, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</hi> But to this laſt point, you may anſwere; that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Fathers in ſuch Catholicke Points, touching the which, they were not written againſt by any other Father; and therefore their authority therein is of force; ſince it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed hereby, that all the other Fathers (and conſequently all the Church of God) agreed with them therein; whereas their confeſſed errours were impugned by <hi>Auguſtine, Hierom, Epiphanius,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Do not admit this, as good: ſome Fathers do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this, or that text of ſcripture figuratiuely; therefore the ſaid Fathers teach, that it is not to be expounded literally. This is a meere <hi>ſophiſme;</hi> for ſeeing diuers texts of ſcripture are capable (beſides the literall) of allegoricall ſences (as all the learned Catholicks, and Proteſtants do acknowledg) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the figuratiue ſence doth not exclude, but rather often preſuppoſeth, and admitteth the literall.

You are here alſo to conceiue, that diuers Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants do call our Catholicke Doctrines, as they are defended by vs, <hi>Superſtition, Idolatry, Blaſphemies;</hi> but as they are taught by the ancient Fathers, they mildly ſtile the very ſame Doctrines, <hi>Errours, Scarrs, Blemiſhes.</hi> The reaſon of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent appellation of them in the Fathers is, in that they would not ſeeme to breake with the Fathers, or to be of a ſeuerall Church from them; whereas they call the ſame Doctrines in vs,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:23452:72"/>
by the former aggrauating tearmes; to imply to their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, that we Catholicks (as ſuppoſed by them to profeſſe <hi>Superſtition, Idolatry, Blaſphemies, &amp;c.)</hi> are not of the true Church of Chriſt. By this you may diſcerne the Proteſtants, both Malice, and Subtilty.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. You muſt be wary to obſerue, and diſtinguiſh, when a Father writeth <hi>doctrinally,</hi> and <hi>ſententially (ex profeſſo)</hi> of any ſubiect, from that, which he writeth <hi>Antagoniſticè,</hi> and in heate of diſpute with his Aduerſary, touching the ſaid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: ſince in the firſt kind his poſitiue, and true iudgment is clearely ſet downe, and for ſuch his authority (thence dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) is to be embraced: Whereas in this later kind, he often diſputeth, <hi>ad perſonam;</hi> and ſo ſome-times (either through vehemency, or for his greater preſent aduantage) writeth more looſely, and not ſo reſeruedly, as the Catholicke doctrine in that point requireth. According hereto, ſome of the ancient Fathers, writing againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and his ſect (who aſcribed ouer much to <hi>Free-will)</hi> did not (perhaps) ſo fully diſpute in defence of the Catholicke Doctrine of <hi>Free-will,</hi> as they might haue donne. This courſe they tooke (of which the Proteſtants make aduantage) that thereby they might the more eaſily conuince their Aduerſaries Hereſy, reſting ſo much on the contrary ſide.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. In like ſort, the Fathers ſome-times perhaps in a Rhetoricall, and amplifying manner, do vſe certaine tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſpeaches (as alſo ſome more moderne Catholicks haue donne) in praiſe of our Bleſſed Lady, or in honour of the Croſſe, or the like; then being taken literally, can well be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But they were the more bold to do, becauſe they (as then hauing no Aduerſaries to their Catholicke Doctrines in thoſe points) might reſt aſſured, that their wordes would be taken in that pious ſence (and no other) wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered them. But if they had foreknowne, that there would haue come in after times ſuch ſectaries, who would ſo rigidly, and literally inſiſt in all ſuch their ſentences, peruſing euery word, and ſillable of them, and racking them to the worſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:23452:72"/>
conſtruction (as now the Proteſtants do) they would) no doubt) haue writen more reſeruedly, and cautelouſly of thoſe points. But little did they thinke, that any ſucceeding Men, (profeſſing themſelues to be Chriſtians) would euer ſo vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably) haue detorted their words, from their intended ſence.</p>

                  <p>Now concerning the <hi>times,</hi> when all theſe former points of Proteſtancy did firſt take their being; this Circumſtance (for the moſt part) may be taken from the times, wherein the Fathers (who did impugne, and write againſt the ſaid doctrines) did liue; ſeeing no ſooner any of the ſaid doctrines began to riſe, and get on wing; but preſently one Father, or other was ready (by his penne) to ſuppreſſe, and beat downe the ſame.

                  </p>
                  <p>That all theſe former prime Hereticks did depart, and go out of a more ancient ſociety of Chriſtians, then themſelues (to wit, out of the then viſible, and knowne ſociety of vs Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,

                     </gap>ooued ſeuerall waies. Firſt, becauſe it appeareth from the aboue alleadged Confeſſions of the learned Proteſtants, that our Catholicke Faith was the only faith in thoſe ages, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beleeued, and that the Proteſtant Church (ſuppoſing that afore it had beene in Being) was as then by their like Confeſſions, wholy extinct, and inuiſible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the foreſaid points of the former Hereticks departing from a more ancient community of Chriſtians; is further euicted, from the Fathers particuler charging this, or that Hereticke, with this, or that particuler Hereſy only, for if either any, or all of them had ioyntly taught all the Articles of proteſtancy (at this preſent beleeued) then no doubt all the ſaid Articles of proteſtancy, as then mantained by one man, had beene impugned, and writen againſt by the ſaid Fathers, as well, as the particuler Hereſies of this, or that particuler Hereticke are by them contradicted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in that the Fathers, who condemned the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d Hereticks, were euer reputed moſt Orthodoxall, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctours, neither were they reprehended by any other Father, of Gods Church, for ſuch their proceeding againſt thoſe Hereticks, which conſideration demonſtrateth, that the whole Church of God did in thoſe times agree in faith, and Religion with thoſe Fathers, and againſt the aboue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and nouelizing Hereticks: from whence we may further conclude, that the whole Church of Chriſt (which hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to diſcerne, both true, and falſe doctrine; as a ſtraight line me ſureth both a right, and crooked line) did by the former Fathers (as by her inſtruments) condemne thoſe Men for broaching ſuch their Hereſies. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly, (for acceſſion of more reaſons) the former point appeareth, from
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:23452:77"/>
the conſideration of the Nature of the former Hereſies; which ſeeing they, for the moſt part co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt in <hi>Negations,</hi> (as the <hi>deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> of <hi>Free-Will, deniall</hi> of <hi>Purgatory, deniall</hi> of the <hi>Reall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> &amp;c.) do therefore preſuppoſe a preexiſtency of the <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue</hi> doctrines, whereof they are meerely <hi>Negations:</hi> I meane they preadmit a former beleefe of the ſaid doctrines of <hi>Free-will,</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> of the <hi>Reall Preſence</hi> &amp;c. For why ſhould any Sectarie in thoſe daies, riſe vp to deny any of the ſaid doctrines, if thoſe doctrines had not beene afore beleeued? From which it euidently followeth, that the Profeſſours of the <hi>affirmatiue</hi> doctrines were that ſociety of Chriſtians, out of which (as more ancient) the former Hereticks originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and went out. And with this <hi>(moſt remarkeable Men)</hi> I end, remitting to your owne cleare eyed iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the peruſing of this ſmale Treatiſe) whether it was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Proteſtant Church, which hath made this ſo much inculcated change, and alteration from that Faith, which firſt was preached, and taught in the ſayd Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Apoſtles.</p>

At the length he arriueth in <hi>England;</hi> where from viſiting of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> he cometh to <hi>Oxford.</hi> Then he findeth <hi>D. Reynolds, Ochinus,</hi> and <hi>Neuſerus.</hi> They mooue him to become Proteſtant. He anſwereth, that the want of performace of the Prophecies, touching the Viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſts Church, in the Proteſtant Church, induceth him beſides other reaſons to continue Catholicke. Hereupon they all begin a Diſputation touching the <hi>Viſibility of the Proteſtant Church,</hi> for former ages; prefixing therto (by mutuall conſent) a ſhort Diſcourſe of the Neceſſity of a continuall Viſibility of the true Church. <hi>Michaeas</hi> ſo fully diſplayeth the inſufficiency of the pretended Inſtances of Proteſtants, and of all other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments vrged for proofe thereof, That inſteed, of <hi>Michaeas</hi> being to be made a Proteſtant by this Diſputation; <hi>Ochinus,</hi> and <hi>Neuſerus,</hi> as not acknowledging the preſent Roman Church to be the true Church, and ſeing the Prophecies, not to be fulfilled in the Proteſtant Church, do finally come to this point, to wit, abſolutely, and openly to affirme, that the Church of Chriſt (as not hauing the Prophecies accompliſhed in it, which were foretould to be performed in the true Church of God touching it Viſibilitie) is a falſe Church, and that our Sauiour Chriſt was a Seducer. Hereupon they both proteſt, that, from that tyme forward they do renounce the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fayth, and do embrace the Iewiſh Religion; and ſo teaching Circumciſion, and reuiuing the Old law, they do turne blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous

Iewes or Turks. <hi>Michaeas</hi> and <hi>D.

What courſes <hi>Ochinus</hi> and <hi>Neuſerus</hi> do after take for their ſpreading of Iudaiſme, is hereafter ſet downe: And all the paſſages of their Reuolt are manifeſted, partly out of their owne wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and partly from the acknowledgment of diuers learned Proteſtants: ſo as their Apoſtacy is not feigned, but true and reall.</p>

For where are thete ſuch healthfull, and pleaſant ſeates for Vniuerſityes both being placed in a Triangle from the chiefe Citty of the realme? Such magnificent, and ſtately buildings, and Colledges fitting to be pallaces to ſo many Princes? Such opulency of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, and rich endowments, appropriated vnto them for the education of poore ſchollers? Finally ſuch pious ſtatutes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23452:82"/>
and Decrees, left by their Founders for the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vertue, and learning? All this is not to be matched (I aſſure my ſelfe) throughout the whole Circumference of the earth.

                     <p>I like well your method here intended; and indeed it is that, which the Philoſophers call: <hi>Ordo Naturae.</hi> For by this meanes, we firſt handle the <hi>Theſis</hi> to wit, <hi>whether the Church of God is to be viſible, or no.</hi> That done, we next deſcend to the <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> Which is, <hi>if the Proteſtants Church hath euer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed this Viſibility, or not.</hi> Neyther can any iudicious man hould this firſt part, as but certayne <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> tending on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the better vnfoulding of the ſecond Part; for it is indeed a primary eſſentiall, and radicall point, and firſt in all neceſſity to be diſcuſſed. For what auayleth it to prooue, that there haue bene Profeſſours of Proteſtancy in all ages ſince Chriſt, if it reſt doubtfull, whether the Church of Chriſt exacteth ſuch a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it Profeſſours in all ages, or no?

                     <p>Well then, ſeing the proofes drawne from the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are worthily euer to haue the firſt place; and ſeing I haue voluntarily impoſed this labour vpon my ſelfe, I will firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Now for the confirmation of this ſupreme <hi>Verity</hi> of the Churches <hi>Viſibility,</hi> we will produce our firſt proofes from thoſe Prophecyes, which foretell, that the Church after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhalbe miraculouſly multiplyed. Which extraordinary multiplicity of Profeſſours muſt needs imply a <hi>Viſibility</hi> of them. As where it is ſayd of the Church: <hi>The Iles</hi> 
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Eſay. 60.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall wayte for thee. Their Kings ſhall miuiſter vnto thee; and thy gates ſhalbe continually open; Neyther day nor night ſhall they be ſhut; that men may bring to thee the riches of the gentills.</hi> And agayne: <hi>Kings</hi> 
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Eſay. 49.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhalbe thy nurſing Fathers, and Queenes thy mothers.</hi> And yet more: <hi>I will</hi>

                        <hi>giue thee the Heathens for thy inheritance, and the end of the earth for thy Poſſeſſion.</hi> And laſtly (to omit diuers others ſuch predictions of the Churches encreaſe, and amplitude, it is ſayd: <hi>enlarge</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now how can theſe Prophecyes, touching the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, be truly applyed to that Church, which ſhall conſiſt of ſo few, as that it ſhalbe ſometimes abſolutely <hi>Inuiſible?</hi> Or how ſhall it gates <hi>be continually open,</hi> and <hi>ſhut neyther day nor night</hi> (as aboue is prophecyed of it) if it ſhall remayne at any time, in a night of Latency?</p>
                     <p>In this next place, I will alledge ſuch texts of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherin we fynd the word: <hi>Eccleſia</hi> or <hi>Church;</hi> In all which (without exception) by the word: <hi>Church,</hi> is ſignifyed <hi>a viſible congregation of Men.</hi> The places (among others, for breuity omitted) may be theſe: <hi>Numbers 20. Why haue you brought the Church of the Lord into ſolitude?</hi> But this Church was the knowne, and viſible people of Iſraëll, which came
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23452:87"/>
out of Aegypt. In like ſort, it is ſayd. 3. <hi>Kings 8. The King tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his face, and bleſſed all the Church of Iſraell; for all the Church of Iſraell did ſtand &amp;c. Math 18. Tell the Church, &amp; if he will not heare the Church, let him be as an Heathen or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blican</hi> But how can we be commanded to tell the Church, if we do not know which is the Church? And if in all our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall neceſſities, we are commanded to repaire, to the Church, then followeth it, that the Church at all tymes muſt be <hi>viſible. Act. 20. Take heede to your ſelues, and to the whole flock, wherein the Holy Ghoſt hath placed you Biſhops, regere Eccleſiam Det, to gouerne the Church of God.</hi> But how could they gouerne the Church of God, if they knew it not? <hi>Act. 15. They being brought on the way by the Church, paſſed through Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Paule went vp, and ſaluted the Church.</hi> Now how can theſe texts be poſſibly applyed to any <hi>Inuiſible</hi> congregation or company of men. Furthermore, <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelfe, that he perſecuted the Church of God, as in 1. <hi>Cor. 15. Galat. 1. Philipp.</hi> 3. In all which places the word: <hi>Church,</hi> is vſed: But it is well knowne, whom <hi>S. Paul</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute. And <hi>in 1. Timoth.</hi> 3. It is ſayd how to conuerſe <hi>indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Dei, quae eſt Eccleſia Dei, in the houſe of the liuing God, which is the Church of God.</hi> But how could <hi>Timothee</hi> know, how to conuerſe in the houſe of God, except he did know, which was this houſe? To all which former texts of Scripture, I annex this one note (a point much to be conſidered) that not any one place of Scripture can be produced, wherein the word: <hi>Church,</hi> is named, but that a <hi>Viſible,</hi> and <hi>externall</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men is neceſſarily vnderſtood thereby.</p>
                     <p>To the former Scriptures may be added certayne deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church in other paſſages thereof; as in <hi>Eſay. 2. Daniel. 3. Michaeas</hi> 4. the Church is compared to a conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mountayne, which cannot be vnſeene, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of <hi>Ierom,</hi>

                     <p>Another moſt illuſtrious &amp; conuincing paſſag of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the Churches <hi>Viſibility,</hi> is that in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians c.</hi> 4. where it is ſayd of Chriſt: <hi>He gaue Paſtours, &amp; Doctours to the conſummation of Saints, vnto the worke of the Miniſtery, till we all meete in the Vnity of Fayth; that is (as D.</hi>

Which expoſition being granted, implyeth neceſſarily an euer <hi>Viſibility</hi> of the Church. For how can thoſe Doctours, and Paſtours preach at all tymes, and vpon all occaſions the word of God, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacraments, if they be concealed, and lye in ſecret? Or how can the perſons, to whom the Word is preached, &amp; the Sacraments diſpenſed, become vnknowne or Inuiſible?</p>
                     <p>That this is the true interpretation of the former text of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> is generally taught by our owne learned men: For according hereto, <hi>D.

                     <p n="1">1. In this next place, I will deſcend to arguments drawne from analogy of reaſon. And firſt, from the compariſon, made betwene the old Teſtament, and the New Teſtament. Certaine it is, that the Iewes euer ſince Ghriſts dayes retained, and kept a knowne profeſſion of their Religion, (though vnder ſome reſtraint) and their Synagogues haue euer ſince bene extarnally <hi>viſible</hi> (though diſperced) as in <hi>Greece, Spayne, Italy, Germany, France, England &amp;c.</hi> And this point <hi>Peter</hi>

Now then if the Church of the new Teſtament ſhould want a continuall <hi>Viſibility,</hi> then ſhould it be inferiour in honour, and dignity to the Iewiſh Synagogue; euen then, when the Goſpell is propheſied to be moſt floriſhing, and the Synagogue to be in it greateſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23452:91"/>
decay, and ruyne: a reaſonable to ouerbalance all reaſons, brought to the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The foreſaid Concluſion of the Churches <hi>Viſibility</hi> is alſo proued, from the beginning, and progreſſe of the Church. For firſt durnig the old Teſtament the Church was then ſo <hi>Viſible,</hi> as that the Profeſſours thereof did beare euen in their fleſh, the <hi>Viſible,</hi> and markable ſigne of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> as a badg of the Church. Againe, in the new Teſtament, the whole Church of Chriſt was in it infancy, and beginning in Chriſts Apoſtles, and Diſciples; Who were ſo <hi>Viſible,</hi> as that the Holy Ghoſt did <hi>Viſibly</hi> deſcend vpon them, vpon the feaſt of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoſt. Furthermore, We reade in the <hi>Acts. c</hi> 2. 3. 4. that on one day three thouſands; on an other, fyue thouſands were adioyned to the former, by their confeſſion of fayth, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. And ſo after they (and only they) were reputed, as membrs of Chriſts Church, who did adioyne themſelue to the former Chriſtians, by their externall confeſſion of fayth, and by Baptiſme.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An other argument may be taken from the greate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity impoſed vpon Chriſtians; who are obliged vnder paine of eternall damnation, to range themſelues vnto the true Church of Chriſt, and to perſeuer in the ſame; as appareth not only from the teſtimonies of <note n="p" place="margin">lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But how can this be performed, if the Church of Chriſt be <hi>Inuiſible?</hi> Or how can God be excuſed from cruelty, by threatning to vs eternal perdition for our not performing ſuch conditions, the which (ſuppoſing the Church not to be <hi>Viſible)</hi> is not in our power to accompliſh?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Furthermore the <hi>Inuiſibility</hi> of the Church impugneth the marks of the Church, giuen by vs Proteſtants; which are the true <hi>preaching of the Word, and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments;</hi> ſeeing there matters cannot be put in practice, but among a <hi>Viſible Society</hi> of men; and ſuch a <hi>Society,</hi> as

that one of it is knowne to an other.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Againe, the <hi>Inuiſibillity</hi> of the Church mainly croſſeth the ende, for which the Church of God was inſtituted.

                     <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Obſeruation. Seing the Church of God is at al times, and ſeaſons (without the leaſt diſcontinuance thereof) to be <hi>Viſibile,</hi> and to enioy a publike adminiſtration of the Word, and Sacraments (as aboue we al haue proued) That therefore ſuch Inſtances of Proteſtancy, which may be giuen by you hereafter (ſuppoſing them to be true) do but iuſtify <hi>Viſibility</hi> of your Church, only for ſo long (&amp; no longer) as the ſaid Proteſtants did liue. And therefore except you be able to produce examples of Proteſtancy, for al ages ſince Chriſt (&amp; if you do fayle herein, but for any one only age) it neceſſarily followeth; that Church of the Proteſtants (as wanting this vninterrupted <hi>Viſibility)</hi> is not the Church of Chriſt, deſcribed in the old Teſtament, and their prophecyed of, in ſo many different places</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third,</hi> and laſt Obſeruation. That one may truly, and iuſtly be called a Proteſtant, two things (among others) muſt neceſſatily concurre: The one, that he do mantayne al the chiefeſt points of Proteſtancy; Thus he is not to hould only ſome few points of Proteſtancy; and in the reſt (being more in number, and of greater importance) to pertake with the Catholicks: ſeeing ſuch a Man is rather (as beleiuing more Articles of Catholicke Religion, then of Proteſtancy) to be reputed a Catholicke, then a Proteſtant; for his denomination is to be giuen him rather according to the greater, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier number of Articles beleeued by him, ther otherwiſe; though to ſpeake the truth, ſuch a Man ſo beleeuing, is formally nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23452:94"/>
Catholicke not Proteſtant.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing neceſſary to the being of a Proteſtant, is, that he doth not hould pertinaciouſly any mayne Hereſies, or Paradoxes wholy impugned, gainſaid, and contradicted, both by Proteſtant, and Catholicke. For this Man in this reſpecte, is to be ſtyled rather an open Hereticke, then a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, euen in the cenſure of the Proteſtants themſelues. Therefore to conclude this laſt obſeruation; Euen as when beaſts of ſeueral Kyndes (or ſpecies) do coople together, that which is ingendred, is of a third Kinde, diuers from them both: So here, that Religion or fayth, which is (as it were) propagated from the mixture of contrary Religions, muſt be a beliefe, different from them al. Theſe things being premiſed, now <hi>M.

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond (though but incidentall at this preſent) whether it ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the ſweete proceeding of God, to vſe as his Inſtrument, for the reedifying of his Church (admitting it afore ruined) a man, who practized his penne (and this after his ſuppoſed cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) to the wronging of Chriſtian Faith, and Charity; to the fortifying of the ſtate, and Empyre of Chriſts greateſt Enemy; to the expunging of Gods ſacred Writ, and conuitiating of his greateſt Seruants: to the diſauthorizing of all Chriſtian Princes, and Ciuill Magiſtrates: to the diſhonoring, and debaſing of

the Sacraments: to the diſualewing of the infinit worth, and price of Chriſt his Paſſion: to the vphoulding, and maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a ſtoicall, and fatall Neceſſity in all things: And laſtly to the abſolute deniall of the moſt Bleſſed, and holy <hi>Trinity.</hi> Now <hi>(Gentlemen all)</hi> if you want a Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to be the ſquare, and rule of Proteſtancy, I am content (in this your penury) that you take <hi>Luther</hi> for a Proteſtant.</p>

I grant, the Doctour anſwereth ſo; but why doth not he (being much prouoked by his Aduerſary thereto) alleadg as much as one Man, who was a Proteſtant before <hi>Luthers</hi> chang? Againe I demande, why did thoſe ſuppoſed Proteſtants imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly before Luthers dayes, lye ſo hid and vnknowne, at Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reſing? If you ſay for feare of Perſecution (for no other pretext you can alledge) I reply, that feare of Perſecution could not be pretended to be a let after Luthers open reuolt; but that the Proteſtants (if any ſuch were) might ſecurely then haue ſtept out, and publikely haue ioyned themſelfs with Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Conſidering that then diuers magiſtrats and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths had openly vndertaken the patronage of Luthers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion; And who obſerueth not, that the floud of any doctrine in faith is more or leſſe, as it is gouerned with the <hi>ful</hi> or <hi>wayne</hi> of ſecular Authority?</p>
                     <p>But to vrge a more irrefragable proofe, for this matter. This point (to wit, that not any one Proteſtant was to be found, through the whole World, immediatly before the dayes of Luther) is ſo cleare and vndeniable, as that we find the ſame granted, by a whole volley of Confeſſions, proceeding from the Proteſtants owne penns.

                     <p>Iohn Hus did liue in the yeare. 1400. Who firſt was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Prieſt.

                     <p>But to make a more particular diſſection of this Inſtance; The Articles, wherein his followers (the Bohemians) diſſented from the Church of Rome, were theſe following, which M. Fox thus relateth: <hi>The Bohemians</hi>

                     <p>In the precedent ages to theſe former (if credit may be giuen to authenticall Hiſtoryes) there were not only many Proteſtants, but euen ſeuerall Bookes then written, in defence of the Proteſtant Religion: As the Authour of the Booke, written againſt Images, in the name of <hi>Carolus Magnus: Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram, Vlrick, Berengarius &amp;c.</hi> All or any of which to denye, to haue bene Proteſtants, were to infringe all authority of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Hiſtory.</p>

                     <p>There are not any of theſe, you haue named, as much (I may ſay) as of the halfeblood to a Proteſtant: ſo little affinity there is, betweene the Proteſtants Religion, and theſe Mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23452:106"/>
I grant, that ſome Proteſtants (and theſe but very few, and of meane eſteeme) do inſtance (through their ſecurity of better examples) in theſe your mentioned men; but how coldy and weakly, we will now diſcouer. And firſt, touching the Booke written againſt Images, in the name of <hi>Carolus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> I ſay, firſt, that booke concerneth only but one point of Religion; and conſequently it can giue no proofe of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in thoſe dayes. Secondly, I auer, that it was forged by ſome Heretike, that denyed the doctrine of Images (perhapps) in thoſe dayes; but neuer made or allowed by <hi>Carolus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> This I prooue firſt, becauſe <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> was wholy addicted and deuoted to the Church of Rome, and it fayth in generall; And therefore the leſſe probable it is, that he ſhould wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I will relate the words of Hoſpinian (the Proteſtant) touching his affection to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke fayth; Thus be ſayth: <note n="y" place="margin">In ep. dedic. hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                        <hi>Carolus Magnus nonſolum publicis edictis &amp;c. Charles the Great did not only command by publike Edicts, that the Ceremonyes, rites, the Latin Maſſe of the Church of Rome, and other decreſſe and Inſtituts of the Pope of Rome, ſhould be obſerued, through out the whole Empyre; but alſo himſelfe did force the Churches, to theſe obſeruations vnder payne of impreſonments, and other kinds of puniſhments;</hi> with whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo conſpireth in iudgment herein Criſpinus <note n="z" place="margin">In his booke of the ſtate of the Church. p. 221.</note> M.

For Paulus <note n="c" place="margin">Lib. 2. hiſt. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae.</note> Aemilius witneſſeth, that Carolus did ſend twelue Biſhops vnto a Councel houlden at Rome, vnder Pope Steuen in confutation of the errour of the Grecians, againſt Images. The ſame doctrine of Images, as defended by <hi>Carolus,</hi> is further confeſſed by the Centuriſts, <note n="d" place="margin">Cen. 8. c. 9. col. 570.</note> D.

(which booke was purpoſely written, againſt that booke diuulged in Carolus his name) that the ſaid booke was then written by ſome ſecret enemy of Images: a point ſo euident, that Caluin <note n="g" place="margin">Inſtit. l. 1. c. 11.

We reply, that by force of all Reaſon, this Epiſtle is but forged by ſome enemy of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church in his name; and was written diuers yeares after Pope Nicolas was dead, or before that Vlrick was borne. For as Onuphrius <note n="k" place="margin">L. de Rom. Pontif.</note> writeth; Pope Nicolas the firſt (to whom

But <hi>(M.

In like ſort the former prophecyes touching the encreaſe, ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, &amp; continuall ſplendour of the Church do euict the ſame. Now to apply this to our preſent purpoſe.

This is my opinion.

                     <p>Laſtly and principally, this your ſurmiſe impugneth all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, touching the cheife Occurrents of the ſame ages and times. For firſt we find, that the perſonall defects and blemiſhes of certaine Popes are regiſtred in thoſe tymes, and the relation of them are at this preſent extant; Neyther could the Popes preuent the ſame; And from ſuch relations do the Proteſtants (and particularly you, <hi>M.

Now then theſe things ſtanding thus, how could the Popes hinder the regiſtring of any Profeſſours of fayth, aduerſe &amp; contrary to themſelfs in thoſe dayes? It is abſurd therefore to thinke, that the Popes were well contented, that their owne ſcarts ſhould remayne to be ſeene by all poſterity (ſuppoſing, it were their powers, to preuent the ſame) and yet ſhould affectedly labour, that all teſtimonyes of different profeſſours in fayth from them (but eſpecially of Proteſtant Profeſſours) ſhould be buryed in eternall ſilence and obliuion: Themſelfs not being able to forſee, that proteſtancy ſhould ſweigh more in theſe dayes, then any other erroneous fayth and Religion. Againe, the Examples of the Wrytings of <hi>Hus, Wicklefe,</hi> the pretended booke of <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> the ſuppoſed booke of <hi>Bertram,</hi> the connterfeyted Epiſtle of <hi>Vlrick,</hi> and all other writings of the foreſaid Hereticks, or any others at this day yet extant,) &amp; not ſuppreſſed) fight mainly with this your Opinion: For were it not, that the ſaid Wrytings and bookes were yet remayning to the world, the Proteſtants of theſe tymes could not haue knowne, what articles of proteſtancy the ſaid Heretickes did mantayne in thoſe dayes.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, the very ſubiect of the Decrees and Canons of Catholicke Councels, celebrated in all former ages, is chiefly the condemning and anathematizing of particular Hereſyes,

Ad hereto, that your owne Brethren confeſſe, what we here endeauour to proue. Among whom D. Whitakers ſhall ſerue for all at this tyme; who being glad to make clayme for Proteſtants of all ſuch, as in any ſort reſiſted the Pope, thus writeth to his Catholicke Aduerſary: <note n="o" place="margin">Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Duraeu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> l. 7. p. 469.</note>

The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our Church floriſheth euen in your Hiſtoryes; And thoſe, who labored to relate the proceedings of the Popes Kingdome, are become Witneſſes of our Church.</hi> Thus D.

Laſtly, we will adioyne, to all the former experiences, the hiſtoryes and Cronicles euen of the Proteſtants, whoſe ſubiect, taske, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned labour is to relate and make mention of ſuch ſtrange &amp; new doctrines, as did riſe in euery age; ſhewing, how the ſaid doctrines were not proued ouer in ſilence by the Church of Rome; but how, and when, and in what Popes reigne, they were openly gainſaid, croſſed, and condemned by the ſaid Church. And all this the Proteſtant Hiſtoriographers do bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the Catholicks auncient Records (for but for thoſe Catholicke Records, they could not tell, how in theſe dayes to write of thoſe matters.) This (we ſee) is performed very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently by the Century writers, in their ſeuerall Centuryes: by Pantaleon in his <hi>Chronographia;</hi> by Oſiander in his <hi>Epitome Eccleſ.</hi> And by Illyricus in his booke ſtiled: <hi>Catalogus teſtium Veritatis, qui ante noſtram aetatem reclamarunt Papae.</hi> And which is here to be noted (as making more in our behalfe herein) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of theſe opinions and doctrines, thus related by theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, to haue bene condemned in former ages, are ſuch, as are at this preſent mantayned for true doctryne by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. Now from all theſe premiſſes we may fully gather, how far thoſe former ages or the Popes then liuing, were from labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and affecting to keepe in ſilence or ſuppreſſe any doctrine
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:23452:115"/>

But <hi>[Michaeas]</hi> I ſee no reaſon, but that we may auer, that the Proteſtant Church, and the adminiſtration of the Word &amp; Sacraments were in all ages; though the particular profeſſours of it were latent, and indeed inuiſible, through the raging ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and perſecution, wherewith the Popes of former times did afflict all thoſe, who in externall profeſſion of fayth did in any ſort diſſent from them. And you know, how aduerſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity is to Mans inclination: And therfore the leſſe wounder, if the rayes of proteſtancy were in former tymes ouerclowded with the myſts of perſecution.</p>

                     <p>Indeed, I haue read, that <hi>Antonius ſadellius</hi> (a proteſtant of no vulgar note) giueth this reaſon of the latency of his Church, and of the want of adminiſtration of the word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in former ages; with whom it ſeemes you <hi>[Newſerus]</hi> in iudgment do ioyne. But to poyze the weight of this reaſon. Where firſt I muſt put you in mind, that it being approoued, maketh the proteſtant Church to be wholy inuiſible in former tymes; and ſo deſtroyeth the mayne <hi>Theſis</hi> or <hi>Tenet,</hi> mantay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by you all in the begining of this diſputation; who ioyntly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:23452:115"/>
did auer, that the Proteſtant Church was in all ages viſible, &amp; the profeſſours of it were, knowne and diſcernable; But to let that paſſe. Thus I argue, in further diſproouall of this your poore refuge. The Church of God vnder perſecution, eyther communicateth openly with the falſe viſible Church, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of Sacraments and externall profeſſion of Fayth; Or els ſhe doth refraine, from all ſuch externall communion. If ſhe doth not communicate with it; then by ſuch her refray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſhe is made knowne, and conſequently is become there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible: If ſhe doth communicate with a falſe and idolatrous Church (as you repute the Church of Rome to be) then is ſhe not the true Church; ſince the true Church cannot brooke any ſuch diſſimulation: I will enlarge my ſelfe vpon the ſeuerall parts of this Argument. And firſt, that the true Church by not communicating with a falſe Church, is (in regard of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution comming thereby) made viſible, is cleere euen in reaſon it ſelfe. For who are perſecuted, but Men, that are knowne? And how can one lying ſecretly and vnknowne, be ſayd to be perſecuted? A point ſo euident, that M. Curtwright confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that the Church vnder perſecution is viſible and ſenſible, for els <hi>(ſayth he) how</hi> 
                        <note n="q" place="margin">In Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guifts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, p. 174.</note> 
                        <hi>could it be perſecuted?</hi> Yea he further thus conteſteth with his Aduerſary, ſaying: <hi>To let paſſe, both Scriptures and ſtoryes Eccleſiaſticall, haue you forgotten, what is ſayd in the firſt of Exodus? that the more the children of Iſrael were perſecuted, the more they encreaſed.</hi> With whom agreeth M. Iewell, ſaying: <note n="r" place="margin">In his Reply, p. 506.</note> 
                        <hi>The Church is placed vpon a mount, her perſecutions cannot be hid.</hi> I may truly ad herto, that the greater and more violent the perſecution is, the more viſible knowne, and conſpicuous, is the Church made thereby; like to a ſhip, which the more it is toſſed with waues and ſtorms, the higher to the eye it appeareth; or like vnto an Arch in building, which the greater weight and burden it beares, the more ſtrong and firme it remaynes.</p>
                     <p>The truth of which point is further warrantable, from the example of the perſecution in the Primitiue Church; which of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23452:116"/>
all preſſures of the Church, was incomparably the greateſt. And yet we find, that the particular Biſhops, Confeſſours, &amp; Martyrs are euen to this day made knowne, who they were, and what Hereſyes or falſe Religion they impugned; And this from the penns not only of Catholicke Hiſtoriographers, but euen of Proteſtants; of which ſubiect, you may peruſe the <note n="s" place="margin">In Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. 1. 2. 3.</note> Centuriſts, <note n="t" place="margin">In Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphia.</note> Pantaleon, <note n="u" place="margin">In Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia.</note> Functius, <note n="x" place="margin">Cent. 1. 2. 3.</note> Oſiander, and M. <note n="y" place="margin">Act.

Now for the better diſcouery &amp; diſplaying of this your ſleight, you are here to conceaue, that the ſenſe of theſe words is not, that the Proteſtant Church had in thoſe tymes a latent and hidden being in Catholicke Countreyes, without hauing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe or Communion with the then knowne and viſible Church, in the Sacraments.

to prooue that the Church of Rome had altered it Religion, becauſe (ſaid he) it fayth and Religion is contrary to the holy Scripture; Therefore as loath to obtund your eares with a faſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious iteration of the ſame points, I referre you to the full anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were of the Cardinall, <note n="*" place="margin">In the firſt part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted Iew.</note> giuen therto.

                     <p>By the Lord of Heauen, I cannot ſee how this difficulty can otherwyſe be ſalued, then either by denyinge the Goſpell of the New Teſtament; or by granting the Church of Rome to be the true Church, which my Soule abhorrs to do. For as concerning the perpetuall Viſibility of the Proteſtant Church, It cannot be made good, notwiſtanding our great ventitation thereof afore in our Words: And therefore it were honeſty in vs now in the end to pull of our Viſards (through which wee ſpooke to <hi>Michaeas)</hi> and plainly confeſe the truth herein.</p>
                     <p>And here <hi>[M. D.]</hi> to take a ſhort view of all the diſcours paſſed, and to examine it impartially a monge our ſelfs; We cannot but obſerue, that the Exemples produced by you, were moſt inſufficient; firſt, becauſe they were no Proteſtants at all: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in that admitting them for Proteſtants, they but only ſerue (as <hi>Michaeas</hi> well noted) to iuſtify the Viſibility of Proteſtants only for thoſe tymes; neither you nor wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to produce but only for for me ſake, any one confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Example of Proteſtancy, for the ſpace of ſix hundred yeers at the leaſt.

As firſt, to pretend (though God knowes, a ſilly pretence) that all Relations and teſtimonyes of Proteſtants in former ages were by the Popes induſtry and tyranny, vtterly extinct. That fayling, then we made ſhow (for in our priuat iudgments, we could not really thinke it) That the Proteſtants in former tymes were forced to lye ſecret and latent, in regard of the ſuppoſed then raging Perſecution. That playne anſwere not ſeruinge, then we thought good to inuolue and roule our ſaid euaſion touchinge Perſecution, in a certaine obſcure and darke ſentence: <hi>to wit, That the Church was in the Papacy; the Papacy in the Church, and yet the Church was not the Papacy:</hi> a forme of words (as <hi>Mich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

1. This then I proue ſeuerall wayes. And firſt, from the Inuiſibility of the Proteſtant Church, during all former ages till Luthers inſurrection (if ſo we take Luther for a Proteſtant) For ſeeing euer ſince the Apoſtles dayes, there hath bene a viſible Church of Chriſt in the World (as all Eccleſiaſticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoryes, Chronicles, and Antiquityes do irrefragably conuince) And ſeing that by the Confeſſions of all ſydes, there hath beene no other Church of Chriſtians viſibly in being all theſe tymes, but either the Catholycke Church or the Proteſtant Church (For as for the Arians, and other Heretycks, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued only for certaine ages) And laſtly, ſeeing it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged aboue by ſo many learned Proteſtants, and otherwyſe alſo proued by many vnanſwerable arguments, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church hath not beene viſible for ſo many ages till Luthers appearing: Therefore it inauoydably followeth, that the Catholycke Church is that Church, which hath euer bene viſible and knowne to the World during all that long ſpace of tyme: And the rather, ſeeing the learned Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſe (as aboue is ſhewed) that all the former Inuiſibility of the Proteſtant Church was wrought by the labour, power, &amp; diligence of the Catholicke Roman Chuch now how could the Roman Church effect ſo much for ſo long a tyme, except it ſelfe during al that tyme, were moſt viſible?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I proue the ſame poynt from the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſucceſſion of Paſtours in our Catholycke Church, euer ſince the Apoſtles. Which euer viſible ſucceſſion of Paſtours neceſſarily includeth in it ſelfe the euer viſibility of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycke Church: thoſe viſible Paſtours being the viſible and moſt eminent members of the ſaid Church; and preaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing others: who euen in this reſpect muſt become alſo viſible and knowne.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Catholicke Roman Church hath ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed this viſible ſuceſſion of Paſtours, is confirmed from the wrytings of the Centuriſts in their ſeuerall Centuryes: their relating of which poynt being a Principall part and ſubiect of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:23452:136"/>
that their ſo much commended Work; A matter ſo euident and confeſſed by our aduerſaryes, as that D.

                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, We prooue the former aſſertion of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church its Viſibility, during the firſt ſix hundred years after Chriſt (and conſequently during the whole period of the Primatiue Church) by taking a view in generall, how the cheife auncient Fathers of thoſe tymes are pryzed and entertayned by the Proteſtants; who indeed (diſpenſing with all Ceremonyes herein) do abſolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For as for theſe laſt thouſand yeares; It is acknowledged by all Proteſtant whoſoeuer; that our Church hath bene moſt viſible, tyrannyzing (they ſay) ouer the true Church, for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages. And according hereto M Powell <note n="c" place="margin">In his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Papiſts reaſons p. 105.</note> ſayth: <hi>From the yeare of Chriſt ſix hundred and fyue, the profeſſed company of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath been very viſible and conſpicuous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to proceede. If the moſt auncient &amp; moſt reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Primatiue Church, (I meane, <hi>Ignatius, Dionyſius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reopagita, Iuſtinus, Ireneus, Tertul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That theſe primatiue Fathers were Papiſts (as our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryes tearme vs) appeareth euidently out of theſe few confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here following; which for breuity I haue diſcerped out of the great ſtore of like acknowledgments of this point occurring in our aduerſaryes bookes.</p>

Thou mayſt be aduertized hereby, that not long ſince, to wit in the yeare. 1624. there came out a certaine Booke entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: <hi>A Treatiſe of the perpetuall Viſibility and ſucceſſion of the true Church, in all Ages:</hi> not ſubſcribed with any Name. The reaſon thereof (belike) was, in that the Authour (as guilty to himſelfe of his impure proceeding therein (durſt not iuſtify neyther himſelfe, nor this his labour:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:23452:141"/>
Though the entituling him in the Epiſtle to the Reader (which ſeemes to be written by ſome other perſon, then the Authour) <hi>The moſt Reuerend, Religious, and painfull Authour thereof &amp;c.</hi> doth in the iudgment of many, intimate him to be no meane Man, but a great mayſter in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> to wit eyther <hi>D. White,</hi> or <hi>D. Featly,</hi> or ſome other as great as eyther. To this concealing of them, of the Authours name (who, as being a Proteſtant, might boldly and without danger ſubſcribe his owne name to his owne Booke; farre differently from vs Prieſts) I may ad the Authours affected ſilence through out his whole Treatiſe, in not touching, neither glancing at the then late and freſh <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> had at London, euen of this very <hi>Subiect</hi> of the Viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Proteſtant Church in all Ages, betweene the afore mentioned <hi>D White,</hi> and <hi>D.

Sweete</hi> on the other: This Authour not ſo much as naming eyther the ſaid Prieſts or Conference; though all the Realme did then ring thereof. But his intended policy therein may well be preſumed to be, that if he had made any particular Reference to the ſayd Conference or Prieſts; he might well aſſure himſelfe, that then preſently an anſwere would be ſhaped againſt his Booke; which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But whoſoeuer the Authour is; moſt certaine it is, that the Treatiſe is moſt ſhalow and frothy; though otherwiſe it be fraught with diuers deceats and impoſtures: But we muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, ſeing we are to remember, that there are ſome fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoods (and among theſe, this of the ſuppoſed Viſibility of the Proteſtant Church in all Ages, may iuſtly be placed) of ſo deep a tincture of lying, as that no art can make them receaue any other dye.</p>
                  <p>The ambitious title (as preſuming the Proteſtant Church to be the true Church) promiſeth (you ſee) to prooue; that the Viſibility and Succeſſion of the Proteſtant Church hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually

and without interruption bene in all ages, ſince Chriſt his dayes.

                  <p>And as touching this precedent Catholicke Treatiſe of the ſecond part of the <hi>Conuerted Iew.</hi> Though it be indeed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely and principally written againſt all eminent Proteſtants in generall (as appeareth by the alledging of their names and teſtimonyes therein) who heretofore haue mantained by their penns, the continuall viſibility of the Proteſtant Church; yet may it with all be iuſtly reputed, as a full anſwere to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe here examined; ſeeing the whole ſcope, drift, and cheïfe examples of Proteſtancy (I meane of <hi>Hus, Wicklefe, Waldo,</hi> &amp; diuers others) inſiſted vpon by this <hi>Anonymous</hi> and nameleſſe Authour, are diſcouered in the former Dialogue, for falſe, idle, and impertinent; as being alledged long ſince by other more famous Proteſtants: Thus we ſee, that this Authour is glad to licke vp the arguments of his former Brethren, &amp; to feed vpon their reuertions.

                  <p>And firſt, this Pamphleter much inſiſteth in the tymes of the Iewes; prouing from the paucity of true beleiuers among them, that the Church of Chriſt is in lyke ſort at diuers tymes to be ſtraytned.

                  <p>This Councell conſiſted of three hundred Biſhopps and more; the greateſt part whereof by their voyces did abſolutly condemne the Arian Hereſy.

Therefore (ſeing we beleiue the Holy Church, as an article of our fayth) it followeth, that it needs not to be euer eminently viſible, or apparently ſenſible vnto vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Learnedly concluded. Therefore for the better inſtruction of this Pamphleter, he is to vnderſtand; that in the Church of God, there is ſomething to be ſeene, and ſomething to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiued. We do ſee that company of men, which is the Church, and therein the Church is euer viſible; But that, that Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or Society is the true viſible Church of God, that we ſee not, but only beleiue: Euen as the Apoſtles did ſee that very Man, which is Chriſt, the Sonne of God; but that he was the Sonne of God, this the Apoſtles did not ſee, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue.</p>
                  <p>In pag. 28. and 29. as alſo in ſome other pages afore, he much inſiſteth in the words ſpoken of the <hi>Woman</hi> in the <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. cap.</hi> 12. of whom it was prophecyed, <hi>that ſhe ſhould flye into the Wildernes;</hi> affirming that by the <hi>Woman,</hi> is vnderſtood the Church, which is not to be ſeene in tyme of perſecution.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:23452:145"/>
To this I anſwere; firſt, this paſſage being taken from out of the Reuelations, cannot (as euidently to vs men) proue any thing; ſeing the Reuelations being deliuered in viſions &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyes (many of them being yet vnaccompliſhed) and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue ſpeeches, we cannot ſo eaſily apprehend the true ſenſe &amp; meaning of them. Secondly, What diuers learned Catholicks and ſome Proteſtants, do vnderſtand by the Woman in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations (differently from the vrging of this Authour) is ſet downe aboue, in the firſt part or beginning of the former Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. Thirdly, admitting, that by the Woman, is vnderſtood the Church in Perſecution; yet followeth it not, that therefore ſhe ſhalbe inuiſible (which is the point, for which it is vrged here (ſeing a Church, in that it is perſecuted, euen in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect is become viſible (as is proued in the Treatiſe aboue) though otherwiſe it be granted, it is not ſo gloriouſly eminent, as it is in tyme of proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Authour pag. 29. from the <hi>Woman</hi> (mentioned in the Reuelations) <hi>flying into Wildernes,</hi> thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth: <hi>The true Church is for the tyme out of ſight in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes: But ſo ſay they</hi> (meaning vs Catholicks) <hi>was their Church neuer: Therefore Will they, Will they, their Church is not the true Church.</hi> Here Ignorance mixt with extreme bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, diſputeth. For whereas Learned Men (both Catholicks &amp; Proteſtants (as appeareth in the former Treatiſe) make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Viſibility, to be a <hi>Marke</hi> of the true Church; Here the Authour (diametrically croſſing all former Authorityes, aboue alleadged) teacheth, that that Church, which euer hath beene viſible, and <hi>neuer out of ſight</hi> (to vſe his owne words) cannot be the true Church; and conſequently that the Catholicke Roman Church is not the true Church: Thus he (contrary to all other authours) maketh an Inuiſibility to be a neceſſary <hi>Marke</hi> of the true Church. Ad hereto (as afore is intimated) that if in this Pamphleters iudgment, the true Church muſt ſometymes euen of neceſſity be out of ſight, and in Wildernes (or otherwiſe not the true Church) how then doth not this

                  <p>And thus farre of the firſt part of this Pamphlet in which we ſee, how painfully the Authour hath labored, ſometymes to prooue, that the Church of God muſt at certaine ſeaſons be more glorious and reſplendent, then at others (though no Catholicke denyeth this, and therefore the prouffe of it is but impertinently vndertaken) At other tymes, as in his laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſentence and argument, as alſo in ſome paſſages aboue cyted, to prooue that the true Church muſt be often wholy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, plainly thwarting the Inſcription of his booke. But his affected calumny here (whereby he bewrayes his owne guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in theſe his vnworthy Scripts.) is only, to prefix this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Churches obſcurity, or rather Inuiſibility; that it may ſerue, as an excuſe (and for a plaſtering ouer) of thoſe few, weake, and falſe examples of Proteſtancy in former ages, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged after in this Pamphlet by him: For he hopeth, that by this his former inſinuation of the Churches obſcurity, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will leſſe expect any full demonſtrations and certaine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Proteſtants Churches Viſibility in former tymes; and the rather ſeing ſuch an vnterrupted viſibility is not (in this Mans weening) neceſſary to the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Now here we will further tract this Authour in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, who, (whether he be D. White or D. Fearly, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) next beginneth with extraordinary calumnye &amp; deceate, to exemplify his Proteſtants for certaine ages. For whereas he ought to prooue (euen from the Title of his Booke, and the Controuerſy of the Proteſtants Churches viſibility, now ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated betweene vs and his Partye) that the Proteſtant Church (ſeeing he preſumeth it to be the true Church) hath bene vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the ſpace of ſixteene hundred yeares (for ſo long ſince and more, it is ſince our Sauiours Incarnation) he produceth examples (admitting them for true) only for foure hundred

yeres at the moſt; and immediatly before Luther; ſo leauing one thouſand, and one hundred yeres, and more (a ſmall tyme, you ſee) wholy deſtituted of any one produced example of Proteſtancy: he ſaluing this his omiſſion, or leauing ouer theſe eleuen hundred yeres, in this manner following: <hi>What</hi>

                     <hi>the old Fathers taught</hi> (meaning the Fathers of the Primatiue Church, as being Proteſtants) <hi>we haue tyme hereafter to ſhow,</hi> (which time of his ſhowing, what they taught, is not yet come) And of the ſuppoſed Proteſtants, betweene the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church and the tymes of <hi>Waldo</hi> (he aſcending no higher then <hi>Waldo)</hi> being about ſix hundred yeares, he vſeth this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terition: <hi>We ſhall</hi>

                     <hi>not need to aſcend any higher</hi> (meaning any higher from Luther, then to Waldo) <hi>Which otherwiſe to make playne, is as eaſy, as to deliuer that, which hitherto I haue ſpoken: And it is not to be conceaued, that Petrus Waldo (of whome the Waldenſes did take their name at Lyons) had his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine from no body &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not this a very learned ſatisfaction (thinke you) or rather a ſatisfaction vnworthy to proceede from any Man, profeſſing learning for inſtancing of the being of Proteſtants, from Chriſt his tyme to the dayes of Waldo (contayning about twelue hundred yeres, or but little leſſe) for all which tyme he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not in any one Proteſtant, but wholy ſlips it ouer notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Catholicks euer earneſt prouoking of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants herein? Or can any impartiall iudgment, demanding for inſtances of Proteſtancy, during all or any of thoſe former ages, reſt thus contented? Heere then <hi>(good Reader)</hi> thou ſeeſt, how this Authour abuſeth thee, who dealeth with thee herein no otherwiſe, then if he iuſtly and truly owing thee <hi>Sixteene hundred pounds,</hi> ſhould in ſpeeches vauntingly pretend, that he had payed thee euery penny thereof; And yet he comming to particular accounts and reckonings with thee, ſhould be able to prooue, that he had payed thee (and this alſo, but in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeyt ſiluer) only <hi>foure hundred pounds;</hi> affirming in lieu of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther payment, that he would be as able to pay thee all the reſt,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:23452:147"/>
as he hath already done this leſſer Somme. Wouldſt thou not take ſuch an one, for a moſt diſhoneſt and perfidious man? The caſe of this Treatiſer is here iuſt the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to the Fathers of the Primatiue Church, Of whom he ſaith, what they taught, <hi>he would hereafter ſhow;</hi> meaning (belyke) in ſome other Booke hereafter to come forth Of that labour he is now allready preuented; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reader may find in the Concluſion to the former dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, that by the confeſſions of moſt learned Proteſtants, the Fathers were abſolute Papiſts (as we are called) and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the ſaid Proteſtants vtterly reiected. In which former paſſage, is alſo proued, from the Proteſtants lyke Confeſſions; that all the Profeſſours of Chriſtianity, betweene the tymes of the auncient Fathers, and the dayes of <hi>Waldo</hi> (contayning ſix hundred yeres at leſt) were wholy of our preſent Roman Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and not any of them a Proteſtant.</p>
                  <p>But let vs now in this next place, come to his particular Inſtances of Proteſtancy, for the ſpace of foure hundred yeres only aboue mencioned: in ſetting downe of which the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter vſeth this enſuing policy (for indeed he is a man wholy made of ſophiſtications, deceats, and colluſions) he doth not beginne with <hi>Waldo,</hi> ſo deſcending to <hi>Luthers</hi> dayes; ſeing by this playne method the Reader might at the firſt ſight and ſenſibly obſerue, that he hath omitted (contrary to the title of his Booke) eleuen hundred yeres, without giuing any one inſtance of Proteſtancy for all thoſe ſeuerall ages. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he craftily beginneth to inſtance in the tymes before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and ſo ryſeth vpward ſome foure hundred yeres from this day, in his pretended Examples: Thus hoping, that the vulgar Reader would either, through not peruſing the booke to the End, or through want of Iudgment, not ſo eaſely and inſtantly eſpye, how far (and no further) he had proceeded in theſe Examples.</p>
                  <p>Now touching his Examples; he firſt inſtanceth in <hi>Hus</hi> and <note n="u" place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>Ierome of Prage,</hi> who liued anno Domini 1400. that is,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:23452:147"/>
ſome hundred and twenty yeres (or thereabouts) before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Apoſtaſy. To this Example of <hi>Hus,</hi> in which the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter cheifly inſiſteth (for as for <hi>Ierome of Prage,</hi> he but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced ſome of <hi>Hus</hi> his errours, as learning them from him) I <hi>Firſt</hi> anſwere, that ſuppoſing <hi>Hus</hi> had broached all poynts of Proteſtancy; yet followeth it not, that <hi>Luther</hi> had receaued the ſaid Doctryne from <hi>Hus,</hi> by an vninterrupted deſcent of Beleife (as this Authour pretendeth) for it may well be, that <hi>Hus</hi> his Errours were extinct in reſpect of any beleiuers before <hi>Luthers</hi> dayes: Euen as <hi>Aerius denyed prayer for the deade,</hi> and the Hereticke <hi>Manichaeus freewill</hi> (as <note n="x" place="margin">Lib. de Haereſ. c. 23. &amp; 46.</note> 
                     <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> witneſſeth) yet were thoſe Hereſyes vtterly extinguiſhed for many ages, till <hi>Luther</hi> reuiued them. Secondly, the articles, which <hi>Hus</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned (different from the Roman Church) were but foure, as they are recorded by <hi>Fox</hi> himſelfe: Of which, the doctrine of Communion vnder both kinds, was the cheifeſt: though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the iudgement of <note n="z" place="margin">Luther epiſt. ad Bohem. &amp; lib de cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuit.

                     <hi>Luther,</hi> it is a point but of In differency. In all other points <hi>Hus</hi> was Catholicke, which this Authour calumniouſly concealeth. Thirdly, <hi>Hus</hi> mantayned that acknowledged Hereſy on all ſydes, <hi>that Biſhopps &amp; Princes (being in mortall ſinne) were not to be obayed, but thereby did looſe all their authority.</hi> Which Hereſy is in like ſort wholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed by this Pamphleter. Concerning the particular prouffes of all which points, euen from the Proteſtants Confeſſions, I referre the Reader to the former Dialogue, where <hi>Michaeas</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth them at large: as the like he doth of <hi>Wicklefe, Waldo,</hi> and others hereafter alledged by this Treatiſer. Fourthly, if the Viſibility of the Proteſtant Church may be iuſtifyed in <hi>Hus,</hi> or in <hi>Waldo, Wicklefe,</hi> or in any other hereafter obtruded for a Proteſtant by this Pamphleter, becauſe eich of them taught two or three (at the moſt) of Proteſtant points, then by the ſame reaſon may the Proteſtant Church de ſayd to haue beene viſible, in the <hi>Arians,</hi>

Now this Inference I would entreate the Reader to obſerue, with peculiar applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the pretended examples of Proteſtancy, alledged in this Pamphlet. Fiftly, if we ſhould grant heere all that, which is ſpoken of <hi>Hus,</hi> yet it but warranteth the viſibility of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church, only for the age, in which <hi>Hus</hi> did liue: His do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine not being taught in ages before.</p>
                  <p>Now here in this diſcourſe touching <hi>Hus,</hi> I am to put the Reader in mind, how this Authour ſpendeth many idle leaues, in ſhowing how the Nobles of Bohemia, mantayned the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of <hi>Hus;</hi> And that they came into the field in great forces, agaynſt the Emperour in defence of the ſame: ſo much (ſayth he) was the doctrine of <hi>Hus</hi> dilated. He alſo introduceth ſome one or other, inueighing againſt the Popes manners and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of thoſe tymes: and for ſuch their proceedings, he tearmeth them Proteſtants. (And this method, he mightely obſerueth throughout his whole Pamphlet.) Idly inferring: as if fayth, which reſids in the vnderſtanding, were not different from manners and conuerſation, which reſt in the Will: Or that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes in manners, will not euer be in ſome members of the Church: Or finally that a Proteſtant, for charging of ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his part with diſorders of life, or Puritans for their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inuerghing againſt the Biſhops here in England, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be reputed Roman Catholicks: ſo looſly and weakly he diſputeth herein.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe his Digreſſions, in reſpect of the vndertaken ſubiect of his diſcourſe, are meerly extrauagant. And in my iudgment his intention in theſe, and other ſuch dilations, and declamatory inuectiues (wherewith his Treatiſe is in many places hereafter fraught) is cheifly, but to fill vp leaues of paper: that ſo his booke might grow to ſome reaſonable quantity. For
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:23452:148"/>
ſeeing all his ſuppoſed examples of Proteſtancy in his Treatiſe, might well be contayned (omitting all froathy ambages and circumſtances) in two ſheets of paper, and ſeeing ſuch a poore thing could not come forth alone, with any credit to the cauſe, or reputation to the writer: He therefore thought it more fit, to interweaue in his Pamphlet diuers long and tedious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, how improfitable ſoeuer. This to thinke, I am the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther induced: in that we may further obſerue: in how great and large a letter his Booke is printed: and how ſpacious the margent of his leaues are, being almoſt as much paper in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, as that, which is printed: And all this (as probably may be coniectured (to the end, that this his learned <hi>Tome</hi> (forſooth) might contayne ſome indifferent number of leaues: See how ſuttle Hereſy is, in triffles and things of no moment.</p>

All that this Authour can produce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for, is, becauſe they did wryte Satyrically and bitterly againſt the abuſes of the Church, in thoſe dayes.

To this I anſwere: firſt, he alledgeth no authenticall writer affirming ſo much, but only an obſcure <hi>Regiſter</hi> of the Biſhop of Hereford: and therefore it may iuſtly be ſuſpected to be meerely ſuppoſitions and forged (or rather, that it is but feigned, that ſuch a writing is) ſeeing ſuch a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting may with more facility be coyned without any diſcouery of deceat therein: as being to he found only among the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quityes, belonging to the ſayd Biſhop, who is a proteſtant. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſuppoſe all for true: yet ſeeing that Scedule prooueth the ſayd <hi>Bruite</hi> to be a proteſtant, but only in ſome points: it followeth, that he was Catholicke in the reſt: and therefore can no more be challenged, for a proteſtant, then for a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke: being the fayth of a profeſſour in any Religion ought to

Thirdly, ſuppoſe him to be a Proteſtant in all points, yet ſeing he is but one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man; &amp; that it cannot be prooued, that others did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with him in doctrine, his example cannot prooue the viſibility of the Proteſtant Church: ſince one man alone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accounted for a Church.

Secondly, if we do admit the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Fox</hi> herein; yet it proueth, that thoſe men loſt their liues, but for one, two, or three particular points (at the moſt) of proteſtancy, mantayned ſeuerally by eich of them; they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing all other poynts of Catholicke Religion: being both more in number and of greater importance; And if it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then let this Authour prooue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:23452:157"/>
or in generall falſe: <hi>If falſe,</hi> then haue we no ſufficient Records, that there were any in thoſe dayes, who beleiued any points of proteſtancy: <hi>If true,</hi> then certayne it is, that as <hi>Waldo, Wicklefe, Hus, &amp;c.</hi> mantayned ſome points of proteſtancy, ſo with all, that they mantayned diuers explorate Hereſies: and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for ſuch both by Catholicks and Proteſtants.</p>

                     <hi>of all thoſe, which hitherto haue beene named, or can be named</hi> (meaning for Proteſtants) <hi>but in ſome knowne, confeſſed, and vndowbted Opinions did varye from you: And therefore they and you Proteſtants may not be ſaid to be all of one Church.</hi> This difficulty he ſalueth with a moſt impudent and bare denyall, ſaying: <hi>All thoſe, whom before I haue named, did generally for all mayne Matters teach the ſame, Which we now teach.</hi> What forhead or ſhame hath this Man? For <hi>Firſt,</hi> as touching <hi>Waldo, Wiclef, Hus,</hi> and their followers (in whom through out this Pamphlet, the Authour princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally inſiſteth) It is confeſſed by <hi>Oſiander, Luther, Fox,</hi> and other Proteſtants, as alſo it appeareth by ſome of their owne Wrytings, that they agreed with the Catholicks in moſt points of Catholicke Religion, which were of greateſt moment (as in the Reall Preſence, ſeuen Sacrements, praying to Saincts, Purgatory, frewill, Merit of Works, and in all other moſt principall Articles of the preſent Roman Religion) Concerning the proufe of all which poynts, I remit the Reader to the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Dialogue. Secondly,</hi> touching other obſcure Men, alledged by the Pamphleter for Proteſtants he commonly and for the moſt part (ſome two or three excepted) exemplifieth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Article of Proteſtancy defended by them, then their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and inueighing againſt the Biſhop of Rome. But if he could haue iuſtly auerred them for Proteſtants in all chiefe Articles, why would he not as well particulary ſet the ſaid Articles of Proteſtancy downe, as he did the other, touching their diſclayming from the authority of the Biſhop of Rome? Ad hereto, that many are produced for Proteſtants by this
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23452:157"/>
Authour, only for their ſharply ſpeaking and writing againſt the manners and conuerſation of the Cleargy in thoſe dayes; they not diſſenting from the doctrine of the then Church of Rome in any one article whatſoeuer; &amp; euer euen ackuowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Primacy of that Sea.</p>
                  <p>To all the former poynts I may adioyne this following Conſideration. That ſuppoſing the forſaid alledged Men were proteſtants in all poynts: yet do they not proue the Viſibility of the true Church of Chriſt, for theſe Reaſons enſuing: <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe they were but few in number, and in regard of ſuch their paucity, the Predictions of the amplitude largnes, and continuall ſplendour of Chriſt Church could not be performed in that ſmall number. Touching which predictions, peruſe the beginning of the Dialogue: <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe neither this Authour, nor any other Proteſtant liuing (how learned ſoeuer) can proue, that, there were in thoſe tymes (ſpecified by this Pamphleter) any <hi>Adminiſtration of the Word and Sacraments</hi> practized by any of theſe ſuppoſed Proteſtants: which euer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily concurs to the exiſtence and being of the true Church; as is demonſtrated in the former Tract. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> becauſe the former Men could but ſerue for inſtances during their owne lyues, and no longer; The Pamphleter not being able to name any one Man for a Proteſtant, for the ſpace of many Ages and Centuryes together: which poynt being ſo, impugneth not only the Nature of Chriſts true Church, which muſt at all tymes and ages be moſt viſible; but alſo it croſſeth the Title of this Pamphlet: wherein the Authour vndertaketh to proue the <hi>Viſibility of his Church in all Ages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far now <hi>(Good Reader)</hi> I haue labored in ſurueighing this Idle Pamphlet. Now for they better memory, I will brei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly recapitulate and repeate certaine chiefe impoſtures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceatefull deportements, practized by this Authour throughout his Booke. And then I will remit both him and his Treatiſe, to they owne impartiall Iudgment.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I may remember his putting no name to his

Booke, nor taking any Notize of the then late Conference in London, touching the Viſibility of the Proteſtant Church: nor once naming <hi>M. Fiſher</hi> and <hi>M. Sweete,</hi> the two then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants. Which concealed Cours our Pamphleter purpoſly affected in all probability: ſeing otherwiſe he might well thinke, that the ſetting of his owne Name downe (eſpecially if the Authour were either <hi>D. Whyte or D. Featly)</hi> or hauing in this diſcours particular reference to the foreſaid Diſputation, might ſooner draw on an anſwere to his Pamphlet, from one of the ſaid two Fathers, or from ſome other Prieſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You may call to mynd, that in the firſt part of his Treatiſe, he laboreth to proue rather the Inuiſibility of the true Church, then the Viſibilitie thereof (contrary to the Inſcription of his Pamphlet) cheifly to intimate thereby, that a continuall Viſibility of the true Church is not ſo neceſſarily to be exacted, as we Catholicks do teach it is: and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly, that what few, weake, may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The pamphleter callengeth any one for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant who did but hould one or two Articles of proteſtancy (and eſpecially if he did but impugne the Popes authority) or did wryte againſt the Manners &amp; conuerſation of the Cleargy of thoſe dayes; though otherwyſe he did agree with the Church of Rome, in all Articles of fayth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He callengeth thoſe for proteſtants, who were condemned by the Church of Rome, for other Errours, then are mantayned by the proteſtants; ſo making the ignorant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beleiue, that the Pope in thoſe dayes condemned only the doctrines of Proteſtants for Hereſies. this the pamphleter doth to the end, that the number of the profeſſours of his Church in thoſe dayes might ſeeme the greater, in his Readers eye.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Fyftly,</hi> he moſt cauteouſly concealeth the Catholicke doctrynes, euer beleiued by <hi>Hus, Wiclefe, Waldo &amp;c.</hi> as alſo

                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Eightly,</hi> his Monſtrous Impudency is to be obſerued, in making <hi>S.

                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Nynthly,</hi> The title of his Booke, being to proue <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Viſibility of his owne Church in all ages,</hi> he produceth his Examples of proteſtancy (ſuppoſing them for the tyme, to be true Examples) only for the firſt three or foure hundred yeres before <hi>Luthers</hi> dayes; and ſo (mearly croſe to the title of his booke) he omitteth eleuen hundred yeres, without geuing inſtance of any one proteſtant, during all thoſe Ages.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Touching the Compas of thoſe few ages, for which he produceth ſome ſuppoſed Examples, his fraud and calumny is, to begine from <hi>Luther</hi> vpward (and not down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards <hi>Luther)</hi> thereby the better (as is aboue ſaid) to conceale from a vulgar Eye, the ſmall number of thoſe ages or

ſince otherwiſe, no reaſon there is, why they ſhould be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of them; And indeed the leſſe reaſon, becauſe in tyme of Neceſſity, when the Prince is to command aydes, forces, or Tributs from his ſubiects, no ſuch releife and helps can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at the hands of any ſtrangers, reſyding in his Country. Laſtly, it were repugnant to the nature of Iuſtice (which in it ſelfe is euer ſacred and inuiolable) that a ſtranger, (ſuch an one, as you <hi>Michaeas,</hi> are) by comming into a forrayne Country, and as it were, by indeuizing hymſelfe for the tyme, ſhould become a ſubiect in the fruition of the benefits of the ſaid Country; And yet, when he would performe any vnlawfull act, he ſhould of new create himſelfe a ſtranger.

I will now haſten to the ſecond branch, contayning (as you ſay) the doctrine of Diſloyalty, taught euen by all the Doctours of the Roman Church. Firſt I anſwere, It is a moſt iniuſt ſlander obtruded vpon them by you; ſince not any one Catholicke Doctour teacheth, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one good lay Catholicke beleiueth, that the Pope can at his ny pleaſure depoſe Princes, and transferre Kingdomes and ſtates, as to him beſt liketh. Secondly, I reply, that ſeeing you neuer ceaſe to vpbraid our Catholicke Religion, with the foule ſtayne of diſloyalty (this being your, &amp; other Proteſtants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Theame, wherein you ſo much ryout in malignant exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerations) Therefore as awakened by your ſo often ingemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted accuſation herein, I do auouch (pardon me moſt <hi>Reuerend Iudge,</hi> if being thus prouoked, I enter into a Subiect, perhapps vngratefull to you) that the Proteſtants do by infinit degrees, ſtand more reprehenſible in this poynt of diſloyalty and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towards their Prince, then we Catholicks do. And this I will prooue, if I may be ſuffered, at this preſent againſt you <hi>[M.

nor ought to be any true ſouerainty or Princes at all, now in the dayes of Chriſt. To which Princes partly their Eminency graced with Pompe and ſtate; but chiefly an innate &amp; imbred Obedience to Power and Maieſty (God and Nature making that now good, which law of man did firſt ordayne) induce men to exhibit all due reuerence and veneration: In compare of whom, euen the greateſt ſubiects are to ſeeme but priuate &amp; obſcure; like the brighteſt ſtarrs, which are darkened in the preſence of a fayrer light.</p>

For firſt, when <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Swinglins</hi> were produced out of their owne wrytings to that end; You anſweare, that indeede they were iuſtly charged thearewith; but neuertheles the tymes after them, being more refined and purged from all errours, were moſt free from all ſuch imputations. When to impugne this reply, I did vrge, that <hi>Caluin, Beza, Knox, Bucanan</hi> and diuers others of theſe dayes, did in their book &amp; wrytings moſt confidently defend the ſame doctrine of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and diſloyalty for defence of Religion: Your next ſleight

was (croſſing your former anſweared) to ſay, that though theeſe later Men did teach the ſayd doctryne; Yet ſeing this was but only the ſpeculation of ſome Proteſtant Schollars; but neuer put in practize by any of them, or their followers; that therefore their errour was herein the leſſe dangerous and more pardonable. When to confront this your ſilly euaſion, ſome of the ſaid particuler Proteſtant wryters, and many thouſands of other Proteſtants are vrged (by their open rebellions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections) actually to haue practized the ſaid ſpeculatiue doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne of diſloyalty: You then laſtly replyed, that all this was vndertaken by them, for the defence of the Ghoſpell, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of ſuperſtition and Idolatry: Which you ſay, may perhaps deſearue hearein a myld cenſure. And further, you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that you hould the Proteſtants leſſe chargeable with any iuſt fault hearein, becauſe they are euer loyall to their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes, for any attempts touching religion; though not euer loyall to their Princes of a different religion from them.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23452:177"/>
the ineffable greife and diſlyke of all other good and ſober Catholicks) Diſloyall to their Prince: Yet ſince the difference both of their doctrines, and circumſtances of their attempts, are incomparably ſhort and inferiour, to the doctrynes and reall inſurrections of the Proteſtants, againſt their Soueraignes; You haue no reaſon <hi>(M.

                     <p>And firſt touching the doctrine. The Proteſtants (I meane, thoſe former alledged Proteſtants) do extend this power of depoſing Princes to euery pore parochial ſuperintendent; who is <hi>Pope,</hi> (or ſo would be) within his owne circuit; yea for want of ſuch a turbulent fellow (if at any tyme, theare can be a want of theſe) they giue this liberty (as aboue I haue ſhowed) to the baſe Common people, and promiſcuous multitude; the many headed tyrants of all humane ſocietyes: The Catholicke deuynes, who moſt defend ſuch tranſcendency of proceedings, do neuertheles aſcrybe the doing of it to the Pope only; who is a ſtranger, and therefore further of from any ſuch ſudden &amp; preſent attempting; and who himſelfe in caſe of Hereſy (as a priuate perſon) lyeth open to the ſame perill. This alſo they teach muſt be done, by many former ſweete admonitions and proceedings. To proceede to the attempts on both ſides. The Proteſtants haue actually depoſed ſeuerall <hi>Kings, Queenes,</hi> and <hi>abſolute ſoueraigns:</hi> Thus is the <hi>King of Spayne</hi> depoſed, of a greater part of the Lowcontryes; the <hi>King of France,</hi> of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Cittyes in France; The ſupreme <hi>Lord of Geneua,</hi> of his Territory belonging to that Cittie; The <hi>Emperour,</hi> of many Imperiall Cittyes in Germany; <hi>King Sigiſmond,</hi> of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Sweueland and Finally his <hi>Maieſties Grandmother</hi> and <hi>Greatgrandmother,</hi> of the Kingdome of Scotland: The Pope and the Catholicks haue neuer yet to this day, actually detroned any one abſolute Proteſtant Prince or King, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:23452:178"/>
all Chriſtendome, of their Sates and Territoryes. The greateſt matter of this nature, that can be alledged, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications of <hi>King Henry the eight of England, Queene Elizabeth his daughter, and King Henry of France the fourth.</hi> The Proteſtants haue come into the fyeld againſt their Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Princes, in many huge Armyes and hundred thouſans of men; as appeareth by the warrs made by them in the Low Countryes, France, &amp; Germany: which warrs haue continued for many yeres: The Catholicks neuer yet leuyed any ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes againſt their proteſtant Prince. Laſtly the Proteſtants haue not only depoſed their Princes of ſeuerall ſtates and Countryes; but they haue really impatronized themſelues of the ſayd ſtates, and keept them in their owne poſſeſſion; as is ouer manifeſtly euident by the examples of <hi>Rochel</hi> in France, <hi>Geneua, Holland, Zeland,</hi> ſeuerall parts of <hi>Germany, Sweueland, Tranſiluania &amp;c.</hi> The Catholicks to this very day haue not made themſelues Lords of any one towne or Citty (much leſſe of any ſtate or Kingdome) which haue belonged to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes. And thus farre touching the libration and wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghing in an euen hand, the doctrine and attempts taught and made by Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; Catholicks in point of diſloyalty, againſt their lawfull dread ſoueraigns of a different Religion.</p>

the Church) is internal; ſince truth in doctryne is internal and inuiſible. We may ad hearto, that in the note of true preaching the word, the beliuing &amp; receauing it ſo preached &amp; this with perſeuerance) is included by our Aduerſaries doctrine, as a part of the ſame Note. But how can it be known, whether the Word (though truly preached) be truly heard and beleiued with a final perſeuerance? So far diſtant is this pretended Note, from being (for our direction) a true Note of the Church.</p>
                     <p>An other Argument for the impugning of the Proteſtants former Notes may be this. The Scripture it ſelfe cannot be made knowne to vs to be Scripture, but by the atteſtation of the Church: for as for that ſentence, which teacheth, that the Maieſty and voyce of God, which appeareth in the Scripture, or the Priuate Spirit iudging of it, aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eth vs, which is true Scripture, it is an exploded Errour; Seing one Man is perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he fyndeth in thoſe books, which himſelfe admitteth for ſcripture, that Maieſty and voyce of God: the which very books, for want of the ſaid ſuppoſed voyce or Maieſty, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man vtterly reiecteth, as Apocryphil. And in lyke ſort, the priuat Spirit of this Man embraceth ſuch books, as Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical: the which bookes the Priuat Spirit of an other abſolutely diſcanoneth.</p>
                     <p>Now this being granted, it from hence ineuitably reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that firſt we muſt know, which is the true Church, to giue this approbation of the Scripture, before we can know, which is the Scripture; and much more then, before we can be aſſured, which is the true preaching of the word and ſincere conſtruction or Senſe of the Scripture. Now that our knowing which is Scripture, proceedeth from the authoritie of the Church, I firſt proue, not only from S.

                     <p>Now out of the Premiſſes I demonſtratiuely conclude, that ſeing by the authority of the Church (and not otherwiſe) we are tought which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of knowledg to vs, then either the Scripture, or the true preaching of the word of Scripture; the true preaching of the word is not, nor can be apprehended to be a Note to vs, to find thearby which is the true Church. Since then it would follow (an abſurdity incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with all true diſcours of Reaſon) that a thing, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23452:184"/>
to vs is later knowne, ſhould be a Note to vs of that, which by vs is firſt knowne.</p>
                     <p>An other argument may be drawne from the Nature of euery true Note; which ought to be ſo peculiar to that, of which it is a Note, as that it cannot be applyed in the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others to it meare Contrary: But we ſee different ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taryes teaching contrary doctrynes, and profeſſing themſelfs to be members of different Churches, do all neuertheles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly challenge the true preaching of the Words, and the vſe of the Sacrements to be the Notes of their ſo much diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Churches or Conuenticles. And therefore the afore named Lubbertus thus truly pronounceth of this poynt: <note n="*" place="margin">Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus, l. de Eccleſ. printed. 1607. l. 4. c 2. p. 202.</note>

                           </gap>s communia: The preaching of the word, the diſtribution of the Sacraments, and ſuch like, do not belong to the eſſence of the Church ſince theſe things are common both to the Conuenticles of Hereticks, and to the true Churches of Chriſtians.</hi> And according hearto we find by experience, that Lutherans, Proteſtants, and Purita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s theaching moſt repugnante doctrines, do wartant theſe their doctrines, by the former Notes of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Word. And therefore it from hence followeth, that it is no leſſe a madnes in our aduerſaries, to preſcrybe the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word and the vſe of the Sacraments, for the notes of the Church (which are common to all Hereticall Conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles at leaſt in their owne Opinion) then for one, who would diſcouer and note out one particular Man from all others, to diſtinguiſh him from them, by ſaying: <hi>It is he, who hath two eyes, one noſe, one mouth, two armes &amp;c.</hi> Since theſe Notes or deſcription are common to all men in generall.</p>
                     <p>Againe, I thus diſpute. A true Note of any thing ought to be at all tymes (without diſcontinuance) a Note theareof, and not ſometymes only: ſince otherwiſe it is but a temporary Note. But theare hath bene a Church of God euen then, when there was no Scripture at all: much leſſe any preaching or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23452:184"/>
of the Word Therefore the preaching of the word cannot be erected, as a true Note of the Church. The Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this argument is manifeſt: For it is acknowledged, that the Church of God continued two thouſand yeres before Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſes his tyme, without any Scripture: and therefore D.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes of Chriſtians, which beleiued only by preaching and by force of Tradition, without enioying any Scripture at all. And it is certaine, that after our Sauiours paſſion, theare was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of tyme, before any part of the New Teſtament was written. And after when it was penned, what partly by violence of perſecution, and partly through ſcarſity of Manuſcripts, the New Teſtament could but come to the hands of few, in reſpect of the whole number of Chriſtians then in being: which being true: how then could the Scripture or the preaching of the Word be a knowne Marke, to all other Chriſtians of thoſe dayes? Neyther auayleth it heere to reply, that whatſoeuer was then deliuered by Tradition, was agreeing and anſwerable to what was afore or after written by the Apoſtles &amp; Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts. This ſatisfyeth not the point; ſeing admitting ſo much for true; yet what was then deliuered, was receaued by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers through the authority only of the Church, and not by Note or direction of the Scripture; which is the point here concrouerted.

Poſition of erecting the preaching the word for a Note, for the ignorant to fynd out the true Church, implyeth in it ſelfe an abſolute contradiction. The reaſon is this Firſt euery true Note of anything, muſt firſt be knowne it ſelfe to the party ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and doubting: But it is impoſſible, that the true preaching of the Word ſhould be knowne to one, as long as he con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>My laſt argument here vſed ſhalbe taken from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the obſcurity and difficulty in generall of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Note here giuen. For if the Scripture be in it ſelfe moſt ſublime, abſtruſe, and the ſenſe thereof impenetrable without Gods directing grace therein; how then can it be obtruded for a Note of the Church, not only to the learned, but to the illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate and vnlearned? Now that the Scripture is moſt difficult, is a point acknowledged by all learned men, and prooued by ſenerall Media.

Since as by ſuch their pretence, they on the one ſide, labour to reduce the knowing which is the true Church, to their owne priuat Iudgments (which euery learned and iudicious man at the firſt ſight expoldeth, for an impoſtute) ſo on the other ſide, they are forced euen by moſt neceſſary Inferences (reſulting out of their owne doctrine herein) firſt to grant, that the Proteſtant Church, as for many ages, by their owne acknowledgments, wanting the ſaid Notes (being eſſentiall to the true Church) hath for the ſayd ages (contrary to the Nature of Chriſts true Church) beene vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly extinct, and not in being.

For the better vnfoulding and vnderſtanding of this one propoſition, we are firſt to conceaue, that both the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and Proteſtants do teach: That the precepts of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> do not oblige Chriſtians, as they are properly <hi>Leniticall;</hi> that is, as they are <hi>Poſitiue and Iudic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>all;</hi> but only as they are <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall;</hi> that is, as they are prohibited by the law of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Now the Catholicks do further teach, that as ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps in Leuiticus are <hi>Naturall;</hi> ſo ſome other preceps are not <hi>naturall,</hi> but meerely <hi>iudiciall;</hi> and therefore may be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, by Chriſt his Church, as the Councell of Trent <note n="a" place="margin">Seſſ. 24. Can. 3.</note> affirmeth; Whereas our Aduerſaryes mantayne, that all the precepts of Leuiticus are <hi>Naturall;</hi> and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ich of them indiſpenſable by the Church.</p>
                     <p>Now here we are to remember, that thoſe are <hi>Naturall</hi> precepts, which are knowne for ſuch only by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without any diſcourſe: or at leaſt, which are knowne for ſuch, by a moſt ſmall diſcourſe of Reaſon: And theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are the ſame among all Men, in all nations and tymes, both for the knowledge of them, and for the rectitude and iuſtnes of them. Now ſuch precepts, as for the knowing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do neede ſupernaturall light, are called: <hi>Diuina poſitiua, diuine Poſitions:</hi> And thoſe other Precepts, which receaue their eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment by humane diſcourſe, from the Prince or Magiſtrate, are ſtyled: <hi>Humana, humana Conſtitutions:</hi> and theſe are not the ſame among all men and in all nations.</p>
                     <p>Now then this iuſtly preſuppoſed: The firſt propoſition, to wit. <hi>That all the Precepts deliuered in Leuiticus (touching the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees prohibited in Mariadge) do not bynd Chriſtians by diuine Law, to obſerue them.</hi> Is proued.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from the conſideration of the different puniſhments, appointed in the twentith of Leuiticus againſt thoſe, who tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iadge the different degrees, prohibited in the eighteenth of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> Thus for example, we there fynd, that Mariadge contracted in the firſt degree of Affinity in the right line, God puniſheth with death, and compareth it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23452:189"/>
with adultery and ſodomy: Which are manifeſtly againſt the Law of Nature. The ſame puniſhment of death is there apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſuch, as marye in the firſt degree of Conſanguinity in a collaterall line; as when the Brother maryeth the Siſter. But now in the ſecond degree of conſanguinity in the collaterall line (as when the nephew maryeth his Fathers ſiſter, or the Mothers ſiſter) this Mariadge is puniſhed with a leſſe and more gentill puniſhment. In like ſort, mariadge in the firſt degree of Affinity in the collaterall line (as when one maryeth the wife of his brother being dead; and in the ſecond degree; to wit, when the nephew maryeth the wife of his vncle) is not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with death of the parties, ſo contracted; but only with priuation of children: That is, that the children begotten in ſuch a mariadge, ſhould not be aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rybed or reputed the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſaid patents. Now this puniſhment euidently ſhoweth, that theſe mariadges are not prohibited by the Law of Nature; ſince the light of Naturall Reaſon doth not dictate to all Men, that the former chaſtiſement is a iuſt puniſhment of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd kind of mariadge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the former propoſition or ſentence is thus proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. If all the precepts of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> (touching the degrees of mariadge) were ordayned by the law of nature; then followeth it, that they ſhould be vniuerſall; ſo as all mariadges contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted within the degrees there prohibited, ſhould be vnlawfull. For what is prohibited by the Law of Nature, is in all tymes and places prohibited; as euen the Proteſtants do mantayne. But Moyſes hath prohibited <hi>Leuiticus</hi> certaine mariadges, and hath permitted other mariadges in the ſame degree. Therefore this prohibition in <hi>Leuiticus</hi> proceedeth not from the law of nature; but is meerely <hi>iudiciall and poſitiue:</hi> and conſequently diſpenſable. The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of this argument is euident: for the Law of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> doth forbid mariadge of the nephew with his Aunt, either by his Fathers or his Mothers ſide; and yet it forbiddeth not mariadge of the Vncle either of the Fathers ſide or Mothers ſide, with the Neeſe eyther of the Brother or the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23452:190"/>
ſiſter: And yet the nephew &amp; the aunt are in the ſame degree, in which the vncle and the neeſe are. In like ſort <hi>Leuiticus</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth mariadge with the wife of the brother, though dead; and yet it doth not forbid mariadge with the ſiſter of the wife, except the wife be aliue; and conſequently, it forbiddeth not with the ſiſter of the wife being dead: And yet there is one &amp; the ſame degree of affinity with the ſiſter of the wife, and the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e of the brother.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the foreſaid verity is thus prooued: If all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps (touching the prohibition of degrees in Leuiticus) were <hi>Naturall,</hi> &amp; binding by the law of nature; then they ſhould at all tymes be bynding, even before the Law was Queene of them. As we ſee, that the Law of not killing, of committing adultery, of not ſtealing &amp;c. were obliging, before the law of theſe Precepts were giuen to the Iewes by Moyſes. Now if the foreſaid Lawes touching the degrees prohibited in mariadge, were euer and at all tymes binding; Then Men of ſanctity and in high grace and fauour with God, would neuer haue contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted mariadges within thoſe prohibited degrees: But there are federall examples of holy Men, who in the law of nature, did contract mariadge within the degrees prohibited in Leuiticus.</p>
                     <p>According hereto we fynd, that the Patriarch Iacob did take to wifes, two ſiſters, both liuing togeather: to wit, Lia and Rachael, as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Neyther can it be replyed agaynſt theſe examples, &amp; ſome others of this nature here omitted: That theſe Patriarchs did ſinne in contracting the foreſayd mariadges: for although Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men (ſuch as they were) may, as men, ſinne: yet ſtill to liue
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23452:190"/>
and dye in this ſtate without repentance, ſuppoſing it to be ſinne (as Iacob and Iudas did) is not incident to vertuous men, and ſuch as be the friends of God. Ad hereto, that if we grant, that the precepts of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> do euer bind in conſcience: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> followeth it, that not only Iacob and Iudas did ſinne: but alſo that the Sonnes of them both were baſtards and illegitimate.</p>
                     <p>Neither will that ſecond Euaſion (geuen by ſome) ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the former Examples. Which is, that God did diſpence in the ſaid Mariages, through ſome intended Miſtery. This cannot be iuſtified, ſeing we reade in the twentith eight of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that two Siſter were ioyned in Mariadge to one Man. Thus did Laban who (when he had de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The lyke is euident in the fact of Iudas, who, when he ioyned the wyfe of one brother to an other Brother, inſiſted not in any diſpenſation from God for warranting this his Act: but vrged only the reaſon of the Cuſtome: to wit to the end <hi>that the ſeede and oſpring of the dead Brother might be ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp.</hi>

Now for the ſlauing of theſe two contrary lawes in <hi>Leuiticus</hi> and <hi>Deutronomy</hi> (that ſo the ſcripture be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scripture) we are to obſerue (according to the iudgment of the Learned) that matrimony with the wife of the deceaſed Brother, is not prohibited in Leuiticus: but only as ſuch a mariadge is conſidered in it ſelfe nakedly, ſimply, and abſtracted from all Circumſtances: euen as manſlaughter is taken in the Decalogue, when it is ſayd: <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> Which law of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> doth not hinder, why there may not after be ordayned ſome particular poſitiue Lawes, which may prohibit mariadge with the wife of the Brother, according to ſome circumſtance: and yet according to other circumſtances, may warrant and iuſtify the ſaid mariadge. Euen as the foreſaid law in the decalogue: <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> doth not let, but that particular lawes and decrees may be ordayned, which may command a theefe or a murtherer to be killed: and may alſo command, that he ſhall not be killed, who killeth another ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by chance, or in his owne defence.</p>

For the truth is, thoſe words (heere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited) do but make one and the ſame Commandement with thoſe firſt words: Thou ſhalt not haue any other Gods before me; theſe later being but a more full explication of the firſt words; and conſequently may be omitted ſometimes in a ſhort numbering or ſetting downe of the Commandements.

which point moſt at large Saint Auſtin <note n="a" place="margin">Quaeſt. 77.</note> diſcourſeth.</p>
                     <p>Now that Images are not abſolutely forbidden by the law of God, appeareth; in that the Scripture telleth vs, that God himſelfe commanded Images to be made: According heere to we reade in the booke of Kings, <note n="b" place="margin">3. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum. c. 6. and 7.</note> that God commanded the Images of the <hi>Cherubins, Lyons and Oxen to be made:</hi> In the Booke of Numbers, <note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 21.</note> the <hi>brazen ſerpent;</hi> And in Exodus <note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 25.</note> the Images of the <hi>Cherubin</hi> to be made. From whence we may infallibly conclude, that the making of Images is not abſolutely forbidden by God, as a diſtinct precept from the firſt; but only ſo farre forth, as the Images be taken for God; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that (as is aboue ſaid) theſe words (forbidding the making of Images) do but make one &amp; the ſame Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the firſt words: <hi>Thou ſhalt not haue any other Gods before me.</hi> And therefore the Catholicks do not fraudulently conceale one of the ten Commandements; as our Aduerſaryes do in their Pulpits tragically complaine.</p>
                     <p>Againe.

Now if ſuppoſing further, that that: <hi>thou shalt not couet &amp;c.</hi> be only one Precept (as ſome other fathers do hould) then (to make vp the tenth Commandement) all thoſe words: <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen image &amp;c. thou shalt not adorethem, nor worship them &amp;c. do concurre to make vp one Precept or Commandement.</hi> But abſolutly and ſimply to make Images, and to adore or worſhip them being made, are two different things in themſelues; becauſe one man may adore an Image, which he did not make; and an other Man may make an Image, and yet not adore it. Therefore only one of theſe two things is prohibited in the foreſayd words. (Since other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there ſhould be eleuen Commandements:) But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, that the worſhipping of Images in place of God, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; Therefore the abſolute making of them is not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now the Schoolemen, and all Latin Catechiſmes, &amp; Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars do follow herein the firſt opinion of S.

And therefore Primars and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes, intending but breifly and in few words, to ſet downe the ten Commandements, do omit to ſet downe that: <hi>thou shalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen Image &amp;c. thou shalt not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23452:193"/>
adore them &amp;c.</hi> becauſe (as is ſaid) theſe words are implicitly included in the firſt Commandement. In like ſort, and for the ſame cauſe of briefly ſetting downe the ten Commandements; we find, that Latin Cathechiſmes and Primars do omit to ſet downe diuers words immediatly following in Exodus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Commandement of keeping the Saboath day, holy. The words omitted are theſe: <hi>Six dayes thou shalt labour, and doe all thy worke; but the ſeauenth day is the Saboath of thy Lord, thy God &amp;c.</hi> Beſides many other words there following. The ſame courſe the Catechiſms and Primars take in ſetting downe the Commandement of honoring thy Father and thy Mother: where theſe words following are alſo for b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>euity omitted: <hi>that thy dayes may be prolonged vpon the land, which the Lord, thy God giueth thee.</hi> Now is it not a looſe and diſſolute kind of reaſoning, thus to argue: The Papiſts do purpoſely conceale and labour, to put out of holy Scripture, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers paſſages immediatly following &amp; belonging to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of keeping the Saboath day, holy; and of hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy Father and Mother: becauſe (for greater breuity) they do not ſet downe the ſaid paſſages (being but meere explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſayd Commandements) in their Cathechiſmes and Primars, when they make recitall of the ten Commandements. And yet we ſee, the Proteſtants do euen in the ſame manner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue moſt wildly againſt the Catholicks, for not ſetting downe thoſe words: <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Image &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yf the Proteſtants could prooue, that any one Catholicke did ſay or mantaine, that the ſaid words of not making Images, were not Scripture, and were not ſpoken by God, in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of the ten Commandements to Moyſes: then they had iuſt reaſon, to charge the Catholicks with great Impiety here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: But this is impoſſible for the Proteſtants to do.

Now this is to be vnderſtood that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we pray, we neither pray to the Pictures, nor honour them with the honour due to God (for this is the Proteſtants will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully miſtaken aſſertion, moſt wrongfully laid to our charge) but only in preſence of them, we do in tyme of prayer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute God with that ſupreme reuerence and honour, which is peculiar to himſelfe alone.

                        </gap>riſion and ſcorne; as the Iewes worſhipped our Sauiour vpon the Croſſe. Heare further we are to remember, that that worſhip, which is geuen to God alone, is a cheife and ſupreme proſtration and inclination of the Will, with the apprehenſion of God, as the firſt beginning and laſt ending of all things: and therefore as our cheife Good: and is called by the Deuynes, <hi>Latria:</hi> and cannot be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated without Idolatry to any Creature.</p>

And did worſhip Men, Geneſ. 23. In lyke ſort, all men do vſe to kneele to God in their prayers: to their Prince or King: and to their owne parents: yet with diſparity of honour to eich of theeſe. And heare is the ſource and fountayne of the Proteſtats miſtaking, who hearing that Catholicks do ſometymes exhibit part of that externall worſhip to Creatures, which is geuen to God: do inſtantly exclayme forth in this, or the lyke maner; Se how the Papiſts commit Idolatry to Creatures: ſee how they pray to ſtocks and ſtones: Poore Men, I commiſerate their Ignorance who ſo much miſtake the true meaning of the Catholickes practiſe.</p>

                        <hi>Images of Chriſt and his Saincts are to be worſhipped and honored with a peculiar reſpect; ſo as neither any Confidence be placed in the Images: neither any petityon be made to them, nor that it be bele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This is proued by the example of the Images of the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins,</hi>

But to both theeſe the Iewes gaue a peculiar worſhip, as to

                     <p>But now I here inferre, that if it were lawfull to worſhip the Images of Angells (I euer meane, with that reſpect, due to conſeciated things) then by the ſame reaſon, it is lawfull to worſhip the Images of Saincts departed.

                     <p>Againe leauing diuine authorityes, and comming to force of reaſon. Yf a picture be capable of diſgrace and iniurye, in regard of the perſon thearein repreſented; then by the ſame reaſon a Picture may be capable of honour, reſpect, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. This inference is moſt demonſtratiue. Now that a Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of diſgrace or Contumely, is euident: For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if a Subiect (diſloyalty affected to his Prince) ſhould

Then by the ſame reaſon, may the Pictures of Chriſt and his Saincts be affected with due religious reſpect aboue other things: in regard of Chriſt and his Saincts repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in them, of whom they are the Pictures.</p>
                     <p>Only heere we are to remember (as aboue is often intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that the reſpect we giue to the picture of Chriſt, is not that <note place="margin">If any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour ſeeme to ſay that the ſame worſhip is giuen to the Image which to the hrofit vpon ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he meaneth that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is giuen to the Image but all to that which it repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth or that it is the ſame only in name not in nature or only Analogicè non vniuocè.</note> ſupreme honour and veneration due to Chriſt: but only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour religious reſpect, due to things, as they are directed to ſpirituall ends: and not otherwiſe.

                     <p>But now I will conclude this diſcourſe touching Images with a moſt authenticall and ſtrange miracle, wrought by the Image of Chriſt, and recorded by <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. 7. hiſtor. cap. 14.</note> Euſebius, <note n="e" place="margin">In cap. 9.

                     <p>TOuchinge Prayer to Saincts. I will deliuer the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke doctryne thereof in certaine Propoſitions; which Propoſitions may ſearue as certaine graduall ſtips or degrees of this Controuerſye.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Propoſition may be this. <hi>It is not lawfull to pray to Saincts, as authours or principall diſpenſours of diuine benefitts, to obtaine from them either grace or glorye, or the meanes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our Eternall felicitie; much leſſe, the Crawne of glory or heauen it ſelfe.</hi> Since in this ſenſe to pray to them, were (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the iudgment of S. Auſtin <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. de ciuitate Dei c. vlt.</note> and all Catholicks) to make Saincts, Gods. And therefore if at any time, the words directed to Saincts ſhould ſound otherwyſe: as when we ſay: <hi>Our Lady healpe me &amp;c.</hi> We are heare to inſiſt in the ſenſe, not in the naked words: That is, <hi>Our Lady healpe me by her inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and prayers to her ſonne;</hi> and no otherwyſe: Euen as we fynd, that S.

                        <hi>If I may ſaue ſome of them:</hi> meaning, of the Gentills. And againe the ſayd Apoſtle ſaith of hymſelfe: <hi>To</hi>

Which words of the Apoſtle (being truly vnderſtoode) may ſear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e well to ſtop the Mouths of the Proteſtant Miniſters, for their often miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and miſinterpreting of the Catholicke Doctrine touching prayer to Saincts.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Propoſition. <hi>Saincts are not our immediate Mediatours, by way of interceſſion with God; But whatſoeuer they demande or obtayne of God for vs, they demaund and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne it, through Chriſt and his Merits.</hi> And according hearto we find, that all the Prayers of the Church (which are made to Saincts) end with this clauſe: <hi>Per Chriſtum Dominum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum:</hi>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:23452:197"/>
For we willingly acknowledge, <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 14.</note> that no Man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the Father, by the Sonne; And that their is but one <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi> of <hi>Redemption:</hi> though all the Saincts may be tearmed our <hi>Mediatours, by way of Interceſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Propoſition. <hi>The Saincts, which reigue with Chriſt, do pray for vs, and this not only in generall, but in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:</hi> That is, for particular Men, and for the particular Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſityes of the ſame Men. This is proued firſt, from thoſe words in Ieremy: <note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>If Moyſes and Samuel ſhall ſtand before me, my Soule is not towards this People.</hi> From whence it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that Moyſes and Samuel (then being dead) might and were accuſtomed to pray for the People of Iſrael.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the ſame is proued from the Example of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, who do pray for vs, and haue a care of vs in particular, as appeareth out of ſeuerall paſſages of <note n="f" place="margin">Toby. 12. Zach. 1. Math. 18. Apoc. 8.</note> Scripture. But if the Angells do pray for vs, then much more Saincts; ſeing ſo far forth, as appertayneth to this function, nothing is wanting to the Saincts in Heauen, which Angells haue: for they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Intelligence or Vnderſtanding, and with Will; they are euer in the preſence of God; they loue vs vehemently; and finally they <note n="g" place="margin">Luc. 20.</note> are equall euen with Angells: Beſids, ſome priuiledges they haue in this point, which are wanting in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells: to wit, that Saincts are more conioyned and vnited members of the body of the Church; and that they haue tryed our dangers and Miſeries, which Angells haue not.</p>

Which is, that God out of his ſpeciall fauour and loue to his Saincts, doth open and reueale to them, the particular ſtates and prayer of their friends, yet liuing in the World.</p>
                     <p>Now how agreable it is to all force of Reaſon, that Saincts in Heauen ſhould know the affayres of their liuing friends, is ſeuerall wayes proued. Firſt, becauſe the <note n="f" place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> Angells in Heauen reioyce at the conuertion of a ſinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>: Therefore the Angells know the particular ſtates of liuing Men. But if the Angells do, then by the ſame Reaſon the Saincts doe: ſeeing ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne this poynt, theare is no difference betweene the Angells and the Saincts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Nature of their beatitude requireth ſuch knowledge of the affayres of their liuing friends. For ſeeing their Happynes is a mayne Ocean of all ioyes (no kind of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines being to them wanting, which is requiſite for them to haue) therefore it followeth, that for their greature meaſure of their felicity, they are to haue notice of the miſeryes, wants, &amp; prayers of their liuing friends. And this the rather, ſeing Nature is not aboliſhed, but betered and perfected by grace; from whence we may gather, that the Saincts in heauen do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon &amp; reiect the cares &amp; ſtates of their liuing friends; but do ſtill retayne (though with greater perfection) their former naturall deſire, to know &amp; releiue the ſtate of their ſaid friends.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This priuiledge of Saincts, knowing the ſtate, and hearning the prayers of the liuing, beſt ſorteth to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and worth of their beatificall and happy Viſion of God. For if God hath honored diuers of his friends (whyles they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this world) with the guyft of Prophecy; as he did Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell, Ezechiel, Eſay, Dauid, and many others, wheareby diuers of them reuealed many things to come, meerely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Mans freewill (and therefore not forſeene, in their cauſes) as alſo did tell (at the very tyme they were donne)

things donne in places far diſtant and remote from them. How can it then otherwyſe be, but that his diuine Maieſty is moſt willing to communicate vnto his Saincts the ſtate and prayers of the liuing?

Thus our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries may ſee, that we do not aſcribe our <hi>firſt Iuſtification</hi>

                     <p>Concerning the merit of Works more particularly, the Catholicks teach, as followeth; whoſe doctrine herein (for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſpicuity) I will ſet downe in certaine propoſitions; Which propoſitions do contayne certaine condicions, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily requyred, that Works may merit.</p>
                     <p>The firſt propoſition is this. <hi>That works may merit, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred, that the partye (who worketh) be in ſtate of grace, and an adopted Child of God.</hi> Thus we exclude all works from meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which are performed by one, who is not in ſtate of grace; that is, who wanteth true fayth, true hope, true charity: for ſuch Works are performed by force of Nature only, &amp; not by force of Gods grace.</p>

To the former doctrine of merit of Works, I will adioyne the doctryne <hi>touching works of Supererogation;</hi> Which doctrine is greatly exagirated and depraued by many Proteſtants; who are not aſhamed to traduce the Catholicks, and to diuulge both by penne and in Pulpit, that the Catholicks do hould, that their works can do more, then merit Heauen. But this is the Proteſtant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lumny; ſince the Catholicks do not hould or beleiue any ſuch thing. Therefore I will ſette downe the true definition of an Euangelical Counſell diſtinguiſhed from a Precept; ſeing vpon Euangelicall Counſells works of Supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation are grounded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An Euangelicall Counſell of Perfection, is called any good Worke, Which is not commanded by Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only commended by him, and poynted on to vs by hym; As the Vowe of Chaſtity of Pouerty, of Obedience; and diuers other good Works, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It differeth from a Precept. Firſt, becauſe the ſubiect of a Precept is more facill and eaſy, then that of a Councell; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly in that a Counſel doth include in it the Performance of a Precept, and ſomething more then a Precept; Thirdly, in that Precepts are common to all Men to performe, Counſells are not ſo; Fourthly, Precepts of their owne nature do oblige Men to their performance; Counſells are in the choyce of one, to performe or not performe; Laſtly Precepts, being obſerued are rewarded; being not obſerued, the tranſgreſſion is puniſhed: Whereas Counſells, being obſerued and kept haue a greater reward; being not kept, no puniſhment followeth.</p>
                     <p>Thus far touching the definition of an Euangelicall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: Which in other words may be alſo thus defined: <hi>An Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Counſell is any ſuch good Worke of high Perfection, to the performance whereof we are not bownd, as that we ſinne in not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</hi>

                     <p>Now whereas it is commonly obiected againſt the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Euangelicall Councells, That we are ſo obbliged to God, as that we cannot euer do more, then we ought to do:

It is therefore heare to be conceaued, that if we conſider Gods benefitts beſtowed vpon vs, we willingly acknowledge, that Man can not do more good, then he ought: no not the thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and part of that, he ought to do, in that Man cannot render or retaliate any thing of equall valew and worth to Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitts.</p>
                     <p>Neuertheleſſe Yf we conſider the Law and Commande impoſed by God vpon vs; then man may be ſayd to do more, then indeede he is obliged by Gods Law to do.

                     <p>Now the guilt of eternall damnation for ſinne being remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there remaineth a temporall puniſhment. And this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall puniſhment (thus reſerued) is the ſole ſubiect of Indulgences. Therefore an Indulgence (as heare the word is taken) <hi>is a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full relaxation or remiſſion of temporall puniſhment, due for ſinne, by applying the ſuper abundant ſatisfaction of Chriſt, after the ſinne it ſelfe and guilt of eternall damnation due to mortall ſinne is remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                     </p>
                     <p>The ground and foundation of Indulgencs is cheifly the treaſury and ſatisfaction of Chriſts death, which is of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity greate valew an pryce (ſeeing euery drop of his bloud was able to redeeme a thouſands Worlds, in regard of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity being vnited to his Humanity) as that it can ueuer be exhauſted.

                        <hi>Chriſt is apropitiation for our ſinns; and not for our ſinns only, but for the Sinns of the whole World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is certaine, that the pryce of Chriſts death was not actually applyed to all Men hitherto liuing; ſince then it would follow, that all Men (which hitherto haue liued) ſhould haue bene ſaued.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it followeth, that theare yet remayneth a greate abundance of the pryce of Chriſt paſſion (if it were not in finite, as indeede it is) to be applyed and ſtill will remaine.</p>
                     <p>The diſpenſer of this treaſury of the Church is the Heade of Chriſts Church, who hath power to apply this treaſury for the abſoluing of Men from their temporall puniſhment, due to their Sinns, allready remitted by Sacramentall Confeſſion, according to the authority geuen him in thoſe words: <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou loſeſt vpon earth, ſhalbe loſed in Heauen;</hi> with which <note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> place accord other places <note n="f" place="margin">Math. 18.

Now theſe words being generall, they do extend aſ well to the puniſhment due for ſinne, as to the ſinne itſelfe; ſeing the puniſhment is as remiſſible, as the Sinne; And as to the one are applyed Chriſts Meritts, ſo to the other Chriſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Cauſe, why any <hi>Indulgence</hi> is granted to any Man, ought to be iuſt and reaſonable (or otherwyſe the <hi>Indulgence</hi> granted is of no valew) for ſeing the Pope is not Lord of this ſpirituall treaſure of the Church, but only the diſtributer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of therefore this diſtribution he cannot make without a iuſt, reaſonable, and lawfull Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The Partie receauing the benefit of an <hi>Indulgence</hi> ought

Since wee ſee, that the obiect of an <hi>Indulgence</hi> is the temporall puniſhment only (and not the puniſhment of damnation) and this for a ſinne allready committed (and not hereafter to be committed) of which a Man being in ſtate of grace (and conſequently not one, who beareth a preſent reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to commit any ſinne hereafter) is remitted by his <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;</hi> applyed to hym, vpon iuſt and reaſonable Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>We are further heare to admoniſh, that the Partie recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an <hi>Indulgence,</hi> ought to performe entyrely and preciſly all things enioyned hym by his <hi>Indulgence;</hi> Whether it be prayer, Alms, faſting &amp;c.

Where it is vulgarly objected, that <hi>Iuduigences</hi> are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes granted for more thouſands of years, then the World or Purgatory are like to endure and continue; And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ridiculouſly and fooliſhly granted. I anſwere, this argument proceedeth from meere Ignorance. For heere the yeres are not to be vnderſtood of the yeres or dayes of penall ſatisfaction, which are to be impoſed in Purgatory; but of the number of yeres, which were more or leſſe in number propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (according to the diuerſity of the crime) by the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Decrees of the Church. And here we are further to know, that God in the ſpace and compaſſe of an houre or ſome ſuch ſhort time, may by the bitter paynes of Purgatory expiate that, which (in this life) a remiſſe and ſlow penance or ſatisfaction would ſcarce redeeme in the compaſſe of many yeres.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the antiquity of <hi>Indulgences;</hi> we fynd them practized by S. Paul, who thus ſayth of the inceſtuous perſon: <hi>Whom</hi>

                        <hi>you haue pardoned, I alſo pardon: for that which I haue pardoned, in the Perſon of Chriſt, for you I haue done it, that we be not circumuented of Satan.</hi> Here now we are to remember, that the inceſtuous perſon (to whom the <hi>Indulgence</hi> was heere giuen) being in great contrition and ſorrow for his ſinne, was excommunicated by S. Paul, who at the requeſt of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians did releaſe him of his excommunication, for feare he might faule into diſpayre. Now in this example, we find all things neceſſary to an <hi>Indulgence</hi> or Pardon. As firſt, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the granter of the pardon; to wit, S. Paul, who affirmes to do it, in the perſon of Chriſt. Secondly, ſtate of grace in the Receauer of the <hi>Indulgence;</hi> as appeareth by his Contrition and ſorrow for his ſinne committed. Thirdly, the temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remitted; to wit, his Excommunication. Laſtly, a iuſt &amp; ſufficient cauſe for giuing this <hi>Indulgence</hi> or Pardon: Which was, leſt the offendour ſhould faule into diſpayre, or be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plunged in ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>After the Apoſtles tymes, we fynd that the Biſhops of the Primatiue Church gaue pardons and Indulgences to many: and

                     <p>Beſides the former authorityes, the doctrine and vſe of Indulgencs is warranted by Councells, both Generall and Prouinciall.

The ſecond Abſurdity, is that in regard of the ſaid Fathers and Generall Councells, defending the doctrine of Indulgences, the whole Church of Chriſt (ſuppoſing the doctrine to be fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Proteſtants affirme it to be an abſolute tranſgreſſion of onr Sauiours precept; The Catholicks denye it; mantayning, that our Sauiour in the firſt inſtitution of the Sacrament, did leaue no precept, touching the maner, how it is to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrated to the Laity.</p>

by the confeſſion of the Proteſtants. Moreouer <hi>Drinke yee all of this</hi> was ſpoken onely to thoſe to whom was ſaid <hi>do yee this in remembrance of me.</hi> But this was ſpoken onely to the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and in them to Preiſts their ſucceſſours.</p>
                     <p>Now ſeeing (as aboue it is proued) Communion (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one, or both kynds) is a thing of Indifferencie; The Church of God out of her authoritie, hath debarred the Laity from the <hi>Cup;</hi> moued thearto (beſides ſome other reaſons) out of a due reuerrence to this highe and venerable Sacrament. For if the Laity ſhould drinke of the <hi>Cup,</hi> it would not (morally ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) be otherwyſe, but that through the negligence of diuers of the Laity, theare would be frequent ſpilling of the <hi>Cup</hi> vpon the ground; a thing moſt indecent and irreuerent; and which the auncient <note n="r" place="margin">Auſtin. l. 5. homil. 26. Cyrill Catech. myſtag. 5. Origen homil. 13. in Exodu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Fathers had a ſpeciall care to preuent.</p>
                     <p>Neither can it be heare replyed, that to the Laity (as being retayned from the <hi>Cup)</hi> but a halfe and imperfect Sacra ment is geuen; and that thereupon the Laity is depryued of much grace and fruyte, imparted by receauing it vnder both kinds: To this I anſwere. Firſt, the Proteſtants haue ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to vrge the want of Grace or fruit, by giuing it vnder one kind; ſeing by their doctrine, this Sacrament actually giueth no grace or fruit at all, but only by repreſentation or ſignification; But this repreſentation of our Sauiours death is perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed vnder one kind only; As we ſee, it was fully figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the old Law, in the Manna alone, and in the Paſchall Lambe alone.</p>
                     <p>Secondly and more particularly, I ſay, that neither is this Sacrament giuen by halfs only (as our Aduerſaries ſuggeſt) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is leſſe fruit imparted by one kind, then by both; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof is, becauſe the Catholicks do ioyntly teach, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eyther kind, is truly contayned whole Chriſt; to wit, his Body, Bloud, Soule, and Diuinity.</p>
                     <p>That this doctrine is true (euer preſuppoſing the Reall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, which all Catholicks doe) is prooued from two other Principles of faith. The firſt is, that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:23452:210"/>
Chriſt after his Reſurrection, ſhall neuer dye agayne, according to that of S. Paul: <note n="s" place="margin">Rom 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt ryſing from the dead, now dyeth no more.</hi> From whence it immediately followeth, that vnder the forme of Bread, the Body of Chriſt is not without bloud and Soule; ſeing otherwiſe, it would be without life, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently dead. The ſecond Article is, That Chriſt is one <hi>Diuine Perſon,</hi> ſubſiſting in two <hi>Natures:</hi> from whence it followeth, that ſeing the Body of Chriſt hath no other ſubſiſtence, then that of his Godhead; That therefore where his body is, there alſo is his Diuinity. Both which Articles being true, &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Proteſtants, it vnauoydably followeth, that (once ſuppoſing and granting the Reall Preſence for true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) neyther the Sacrament is maymed or imperfect vnder one kind; nor that leſſer grace or fruyte is giuen vnder one kynd, then vnder both. And thus farre of this poynt.</p>

Now both theſe attempts are deſeruedly puniſhed by our Lawes, for their acrocityes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in committed; And to the daunger (decreed againſt them) your ſelfe <hi>[Michaeas]</hi> reſts obnoxious; ſeing you (being a Prieſt) haue no doubt often practized them both, ſince your arriuall into England.</p>
