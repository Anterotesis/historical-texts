            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118405:5"/>
but to ſingle out one onely, and to qit one paſſage of Scripture from their abuſe thereof therein. This point in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as by them maintained, having propounded in theſe tearms, <note n="n" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 2.</note> that <hi>God doth not, wil not, cannot, in theſe times, ſee any ſin, in any of his juſtified children:</hi> to cut of all by-debates, and keep cloſe to the point intended to be dealt in at preſent, after <note n="o" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note> ſome diſcovery of their wonted tergiverſations, I ſubjoyn theſe words, to which thoſe cited relate;</p>
            <p>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 5.</note> 
               <hi>The queſtion then is, what it is that theſe men maintain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods ſight of ſin in the faithful. which (to ſtate aright the controveſie, as it ſtands between them and us) is not eyther concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the efficacy of Juſtification in generall; or concerning Gods ſight of ſin generally in ſuch as believe and are juſtified, (that which would be obſerved, to diſcover the meer impertinency of a multitude of allegations, which out of Orthodox Autors concerning thoſe points theſe men heap up to no purpoſe) but whether God do or will, or can ſee ſin in the ſame manner in perſons ſo qualified and eſtated now, as in former times he did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words having reference to that ſingle <hi>point</hi> or <hi>queſtion</hi> in preſent controverſie ſo ſtated, do in no wiſe imply any <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> between us and them in thoſe ſeverall branches there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, (wherein I doubt not but <hi>differences,</hi> and thoſe vaſt ones may be found) but to cut off the ſcanning of them, or ought that might be caſt in concerning them, as not appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the preſent debate. And to diſcover the weaknes and unſoundnes of this inference: ſuppoſe we that a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being to debate the <hi>controverſie</hi> between us and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> concerning their <hi>Maſse,</hi> ſhould in ſtating of it, ſay, <hi>The Queſtion betwen us and them, is not concerning the nature and efficacy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in generall, nor concerning the difference between Sacraments and Sacrifices in generall, nor concerning Chriſts preſence gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in every Sacrament; but whether Chriſt in the Maſſe be really offered as a Sacrifice propitiatory for the ſins of qick and dead.</hi> could any man with color of reaſon hence inferre, that the party ſo ſpeaking ſhould acknowledge a <hi>conſent</hi> in all thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars between <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant?</hi> Yet the inferences are alike.</p>
            <p>Yea ſuppoſe we that the <hi>Antinomians</hi> and we were acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118405:5"/>
to agree in thoſe <hi>two heds</hi> at firſt propounded: or in thoſe <hi>three,</hi> which they are afterward ſliced out into, (which this Autor the rather pitched upon, that he might ſay <hi>all theſe,</hi> which of two onely ſo congruouſly he could not) or in many more points then thoſe <hi>three,</hi> to make out his <hi>&amp; caetera,</hi> which he was pleaſed to annex, as if there had been more behind, wherein <hi>conſent</hi> and concurrence ſhould be acknowledged, whereas indeed no more then thoſe <hi>three</hi> are mentioned, &amp; thoſe not, as he would have it, to be <hi>granted,</hi> as <hi>on both ſides</hi> agreed in, but to be laid aſide, as impertinent to the queſtion in hand. But grant, <hi>I ſay all theſe,</hi> to be agreed in, and more then all that is there mentioned: yet would not all this be of force ſufficient to infer, that therefore <hi>there is little difference between the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians and us.</hi> no more then if one of ours ſhould in preciſe tearms ſay, <hi>there is no controverſie between the Papiſts and us about the unity of the Deity, the Trinity of Perſons, the Deity of Chriſt, his ſuffering to ſave ſinners, his riſing from the ded, his aſcention into Heaven, his return to judgement;</hi> it could thence be inferred, <hi>that therefore there is little difference between the Papiſts and us.</hi> The one inference ſure would be as good as the other; neither ſound nor of validity to bring ſo neer together either the one couple or the other.</p>
            <p>And this ſhall ſuffice to ſhew that in thoſe words of mine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing les was intended, then this Autor would eyther perſwade them, or enforce them, to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Thus having diſpatched briefly, what concerned mine own particular, I ſhal take the boldnes to pierce a little into the main <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>book,</hi> and to conſider of the work it ſelf; the rather, that my judgement in this buſines may further appeer, and how far I am from deeming, much more from aſſerting ſuch a <hi>petite difference between the Antinomians and us,</hi> as if we ſtrove but about ſticks and ſtraws.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Title</hi> holds out <hi>Free Grace;</hi> and the <hi>Preface</hi> pretends <hi>Peace.

            <p>For firſt, as concerning the former, <hi>Free-grace;</hi> it is that, I hope, that all tru and faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt highly eſteem, frequently preach, eagerly contend for, and by all means labour to advance; ſuch <hi>Free grace,</hi> I mean, as the word holdeth out as wel in the writings of the <hi>Old</hi> as of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament:</hi> and ſuch as the <hi>Prophets</hi> of <hi>God</hi> propounded and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the one, and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> after <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in the other. But that <hi>Free Grace,</hi> that we find here deſcribed, and is by our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> uſually <hi>aſſerted,</hi> is ſuch (which I doubt not by Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance but to make plainly appeer) as differeth much from that, which either the <hi>Prophets</hi> of <hi>God</hi> held forth in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preached in the <hi>New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt as concerning the Prophets and their preaching, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this <note n="r" place="margin">Pag. 24 &amp; 3c.</note> Autor alledge, as other of the <hi>Antinomians</hi> alſo do, that paſſage of <note n="l" place="margin">Eſay 55. 1.</note>

               <hi>Balaam,</hi> to proov ſuch a <hi>free grace</hi> as they now fancy; as if it had been an exhortation made not to thoſe that then lived, but to ſuch onely as then were not yet in being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) Yet when he ſpeaks out his mind, concerning the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God by his Prophets in thoſe times, he telleth us in plain terms, that, <note n="v" place="margin">Pag. 167.</note> 
               <hi>The whole frame of the Old Teſtament was a draught of Gods anger at ſin.—and God in this time of the Law appeared onely as it were upon terms and conditions of reconciliation: and all the worſhip then, and acts of worſhip then, as of prayer, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, repentance, &amp;c. went all this way, according to God under that appearance.</hi> 
               <note n="w" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>and in this ſtrain</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>runs all the miniſtery of the Prophets too, in their exhortations to duty and worſhip, as if God were to be appeaſed and entreated and reconciled, and his love to be had in way of purchaſe by duty and doing, and worſhipping. ſo as under the Law, the efficacy and power was put as it were wholy upon the duty and obedience performed, as if God upon the doing of ſuch things, was to be brought into terms of peace, mercy and forgivenes; ſo as their cours and the ſervice then, was as it were a working for life and reconciliation.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:118405:6"/>
Now whether theſe words do not evidently and cleerly hold out an utter deniall of <hi>Free grace</hi> then taught, eſpecially as they now decipher it, let any indifferent reader judge. But in few words, (to pick out one <hi>medium</hi> onely, made up of two clauſes alone, that wil eaſily evince it,) I thus argue; <hi>Where Gods love is to be had in the way of purchaſe, and the whole efficacy and power is put as it were on the duty and obedience performed; there is no free grace, much les ſuch as theſe men deſcribe it: But ſo it was</hi> (ſaith this Autor) <hi>in all the miniſtery of the Prophets. No free grace therefore was preached by them.</hi> yea conſequently, <hi>none ſaved by free grace</hi> in thoſe times. for <note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 1, 2</note> how could they be <hi>ſaved</hi> by that, that was never <hi>preached</hi> to them? Yet the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, that <hi>all</hi> that were ever juſtified, either in thoſe times or theſe, were <note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 3. 23, 24 <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>juſtified by free grace.</hi> and <hi>by it</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> aſſures us, that thoſe were <note n="z" place="margin">Acts 15. 11. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>ſaved</hi> that lived in thoſe times, <hi>as wel as we</hi> that now live.</p>
            <p>Beſides that herein he makes the Prophets of God (as he doth the like alſo by the Miniſters of the Goſpel, for treading, as he ſaith, in their ſteps) no better then meer mountebanks and deluders of Gods people; yea God himſelf ſpeaking by them, <note n="a" place="margin">Occaſionall word, p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>not unlike the Gentleman, who becauſe he would ſeem free to his neighbours,</hi> (he wil not refuſe, I hope, to own his own ſimilitude) <hi>bid fil out wine freely; but bad commanded his ſervants before hand ſo to burn it, that it ſhould be too hot for any of them to drinke.</hi> For ſo he intimates in his application of it, that <hi>by ſome Miniſters the Wine in the Goſpell is ſo over-heated with conditions and qalifications, that tho they ſeem to fil it out freely, yet poor ſouls cannot taſte of it; and tho free grace may be in the notion of it, yet not in the truth of it.</hi> Now what may be the ground of this ſore and grievous charge? do our Miniſters clog their offers of grace with any other <hi>conditions</hi> and <hi>qalifications,</hi> then the <hi>Prophets,</hi> Gods Miniſters and meſſengers; in thoſe times did? No. it is not that, that this Autor chargeth them with: but this rather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <note n="b" place="margin">Treatiſe, p. 169.</note> 
               <hi>they run in a legall ſtrain, and would work God down into his old and former way of reveiling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as under the Law, when he ſeemed to be onely in the way to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilation and peace, rather then pacified;</hi> ſuch as he formerly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. If then the Miniſters under the Goſpel, whom he thus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth, <hi>fill out this Wine heated</hi> with no other <hi>conditions and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118405:7"/>
qalifications,</hi> but the very ſame that the <hi>Prophets</hi> did in the time of the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> and they <hi>filled it out</hi> then no otherwiſe then they had good warrant from God; then I ſee not, how it can be avoyded, but that <hi>God</hi> is hereby made like that <hi>Maſter,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> his Miniſters and Meſſengers, in thoſe times at leaſt, guilty of ſuch deluding snd jugling with men, as this compariſon of his imports. So that when <hi>Eſay</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eſay 55. 1.</note> inviteth <hi>all to come and drink freely without money or price;</hi> he makes a ſhew indeed of <hi>filling out the Wine freely,</hi> and there is in his words as it were a <hi>notion of free grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but when he comes in afterward with ſo many <hi>conditions</hi> and <hi>qalifications,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ibid. verſ. 3, 4, 6, 7.</note> of <hi>audience,</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>ſupplication,</hi> and <hi>reformation,</hi> and <hi>reverſion, &amp;c.</hi> he doth ſo <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heat</hi> it, that poor ſouls for fear of <hi>ſearing</hi> their lips, dare not put the cup to their mouths.</p>
            <p>I conclude for this former branch: If the <hi>grace</hi> of God tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with ſuch <hi>conditions and qalifications,</hi> as the <hi>Prophets</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſed, tho it may <hi>in notion</hi> ſeem <hi>tru,</hi> yet <hi>in truth it is not free;</hi> (nor is any notion indeed tru, that hath not truth in it) then the <hi>Grace of God</hi> preached and propounded to the faithful in the time of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> was <hi>no free grace;</hi> and conſequently <hi>no grace:</hi> (for <note n="e" place="margin">Nifi gratuita, non est gratia.

            <p>Yea but whatſoever <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Prophets</hi> (for whatſoever they did, was by his direction and appointment done) did in the time of the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> yet I hope <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and preached <hi>free grace</hi> in the <hi>New.</hi> Let us pas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on from the <hi>Old</hi> to the <hi>New;</hi> and conſider whether by this mans grounds and principles our Saviour himſelf preached ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Goſpel</hi> or <hi>free grace.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If any ſhal object, as this Autor doth, that <note n="l" place="margin">Pag. 103.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt tels you in few words; and his Apoſtle in as few. As Moſes lift up the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the wildernes, ſo the Son of man muſt be lift up, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believes on him, ſhould have life.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The anſwet is eaſie.

            <p>As for the <hi>Apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> what the ſubject <hi>matter</hi> of their <hi>Sermons</hi> was, and what <hi>method</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of preaching they uſed; how exactly treading in their Maſters ſteps, as himſelf did in the ſteps of <hi>John</hi> his forerunner; how diſſonant from that that this Autor propounds and commends; how conſonant to that he thus girds at, and traduceth as a <hi>legall</hi> and <hi>no Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> way; wil plainly appear, if we ſhall but briefly conſider, what <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> began with, our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf ſeconded him in, gave in charge to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and they conſtantly obſerved, from the <hi>firſt</hi> to the <hi>laſt:</hi> wherein we ſhal have a ſhort <hi>breviari</hi> of the whole <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as in Scripture it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>

               <hi>the Lambe of God,</hi> who by his ſufferings did <hi>take away their ſins.</hi> for <note n="s" place="margin">Acts 19. 4.</note> ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tels us he preached; and this Autor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpake not ſo exactly or warily in another <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of his, where he ſaith, that <note n="*" place="margin">Smoke in the Temple, p. 66.</note>

            <p>And did not the Apoſtles, think we, keep to their commiſſion? or preached they any other Goſpel then what <hi>Chriſt</hi> their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had enjoyned them?

               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 25.</note> 
               <hi>to be faithful.</hi> but had not ſo been, had they ſwarved from their charge.</p>
            <p>Yea but, ſaith this Autor, <note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 41.</note> 
               <hi>What did Peter preacht, Cornelius, or Philip to the Eunuch, or Ananias to Paul, or Paul to the Jaylor, but Jeſus Chriſt onely?</hi>

that they offered and tendered ſalvation by Chriſt without any <hi>condition</hi> at all; or otherwiſe then as Chriſt had himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it, and enjoyned them to preach it.</p>
            <p>2. We have <note n="e" place="margin">Acts 2. 40. &amp; 16. 32.</note> not their whole <hi>Sermons,</hi> but ſome brief <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maries,</hi> or ſome principall heds of them.</p>

               <hi>Peter</hi> doth <hi>Simon</hi> the ſorcerer, becauſe he was <note n="l" place="margin">Acts 9. 11.</note> by God informed beforehand, that he <hi>prayed.</hi> nor <hi>Peter</hi> to pres <hi>holineſſe of life</hi> upon <hi>Cornelius,</hi> whom he found <note n="m" place="margin">Acts 10. 2.</note> moulded and wrought in that regard to his hand; but to <note n="n" place="margin">Acts 10. 38.</note> acqaint him with the particularity of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> his perſon, whom yet he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved on, and expected before: and yet he <hi>preached</hi> more then <hi>Jeſus Chriſt onely</hi> to him; when in that <hi>Sermon</hi> he aſſured him that <note n="o" place="margin">Acts 10. 35.</note> 
               <hi>in every Nation, whoſoever he were that feared God, and lived righteouſly, he was accepted with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. It is as abſurd to imagine that <note n="'" place="margin">Acts 16. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> preached not as wel <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> as <hi>faith</hi> to the <hi>Jayler;</hi> becauſe there is no expres men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>repentance</hi> in the Text; as to ſuppoſe that <hi>Peter</hi> preached not as wel <hi>faith</hi> as <hi>repentance</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe in his Sermon there is no expreſſe mention of it: or that our Saviour prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched not <hi>faith,</hi> but <hi>repentance</hi> onely in his firſt Sermons, becauſe <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 4. 17.</note>

But I am a ſinner. Therefore God will ſave me.</hi> To paſſe by, what I farther ſpake, either in confirmation of the way ſhe was in, or the confutation of this new one; I told her, (not to trouble her with <hi>rules</hi> of <hi>Logike,</hi> or <hi>Schole maximes,</hi> to diſcover this <hi>fallacy)</hi> ſhe might with as good ground thus reaſon; <hi>God wil damn ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

            <p>No. God forbid, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yea or Gods <hi>Prophets,</hi> ſhould by any of us be ſo termed or eſteemed, tho they ſpeak <hi>free grace,</hi> as far as any, and as fully, conſiſtent with <hi>truth.</hi> But if we ſpeak <hi>free grace</hi> as far and as fully as they do, we may juſtly give ſome ſuch <hi>title</hi> for <hi>diſtinction</hi> to thoſe that <hi>go further;</hi> not becauſe they <hi>go further then our ſelvs go,</hi> but becauſe further then they went; yea if further, I ſay, not then the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but then the <hi>Prophets</hi> went, (for <hi>Gods grace</hi> was ever alike <hi>free)</hi> whoſe

            <p>But to let them pas, whom we have at preſent nothing to do with; why doth he in this very work of his ſo oft uſe this very term of <hi>Legal Teachers,</hi> in the entry whereunto the very firſt motion he makes is to have it wholy laid down? Or what is this but meer colluding and gloſing, to commend one thing, and practiſe an other, to proſecute the direct contrary to that which at firſt himſelf propounded? I remember to have read ſometime a <hi>Catechiſticall Treatiſe</hi> of one, who in his <hi>Preface</hi> complained much of the <hi>variety of Catechiſnts,</hi> aſcribing the <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proficiency</hi> at leaſt of people hereunto, that <hi>Teachers</hi> made uſe of many <hi>ſeveral Catechiſms,</hi> and kept not to that <hi>Common</hi> one pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely allowed, to which for <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>method</hi> he gave the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence; and yet himſelf at the ſame time together with that <hi>Preface</hi> ſet out ſuch a form, as differed more from that <hi>common</hi> one ſo highly by him commended, then the moſt of them ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily then in uſe did.

            <p>Thus he deſcribes the dealing of our Miniſters with men, for the bringing of them to repentance, as if he were painting out ſome Popiſh Prieſt, preſſing men to <hi>ſhrift,</hi> and putting them upon hard <hi>penance:</hi> as ye ſhal anon heare him reſembling their preaching remiſſion of ſins unto the penitent, to the <hi>Popes giving out his pardons.</hi> But that which follows is far wors.</p>

               <hi>Who, like ſome Chirurgians, that keep their Patients from healing too ſoon, that they may make the cure the more admired, do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly keep ſuch ſouls with their wounds open; and if they pour in any thing, it is rather Wine then Oyl, rather ſomething of the Law then of the Goſpel: ſo as they are not onely long in healing and getting peace through Jeſus Chriſt; but they carry a ſcar with them ſtill; and are as it were lame in their conſciences a long time after; like ſome poor Patients, that have had as much of the ſound fleſh cut away as the rotten, and ſo have been healed, tho but to a bodily infirmity all their life time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what is all this indeed, but meer <hi>Mountebank</hi> practiſe, to tell men, that the <hi>Phyſitians</hi> and <hi>Chirurgeons,</hi> they have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of, do but vex them by plying them with purges and pils, and ſearching their ſores, and ſearing them and cutting them to the quick, and with their cauſticks and corroſives put them, poor ſouls, to a world of needles pain; and all this they do but to lengthen the cure, and hold them long in their hands; whereas they wil give them that, that ſhal put them to no pain, and yet ſhall perfectly heal them without all that ado?
