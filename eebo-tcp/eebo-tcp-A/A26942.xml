            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>Our Deare and Reverend</hi> BROTHER.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the receipt of your Papers and Conſideration of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as our hearts were moved with thankfulneſs to God, that hath given you ſo great a deſire after the peace of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſo much patience in the Labours and Travels of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years, for the obtaining of it; ſo we muſt needs reſent it; as a thing that ſhould Melt our Hearts within us, that ever there ſhould need ſo much adoe, and that among Chriſtians, yea the Leaders of Chriſts Flock, to bring them to ſo clear and great a Duty; Much more that after all ſuch Labours, there is no more done.</p>
            <p>For our ſelves, as far as we can underſtand your deſires, we conceive that it is in three Particulars, that our return muſt anſwer theirs. Firſt, In giving you our thoughts of the deſigne in generall. Secondly, In telling you our thoughts of the diſeaſe and cure more particularly. And Laſtly, In offering you our correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the time to come, for the contributing our utmoſt aſſiſtance to the work.</p>
            <p n="10">X. And for the Firſt, There's little needfull to be ſaid. The deſigne doth ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently bear the name of the Prince of Peace, and anſwer the Precepts of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the Workings of his Spirit in all his Saints, and is ſo happily ſuited to his intereſt and to the wellfare of his Church, that it pleads ſufficiently for it ſelf, and needeth not the Teſtimony of ſuch as we. So bleſſed a thing is <hi>Peace,</hi> and a <hi>Holy Peace</hi> among the Members of the Body of Chriſt, that the Enemies and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators of it do pretend to it, and none are found that oppoſe it profeſſedly for it ſelf; they all flatter it while they fight againſt it, and betray it with a kiſſe, and ſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le upon it while they are wounding of it, and extoll it with the higheſt praiſes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59433:2"/>
while they deſtroy it; condemning themſelves by all that they ſay in its juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion: we ſcarce think that there is a man of all thoſe, where your great unwearied Labours have leaſt ſucceeded, and that are obſtinately unpeaceable after all, but will joyn with you in extolling the Concord of the Churches, and profeſſe their great deſires after it, ſo that they are all ſain from their ſeveral pretenſions to truth to fetch their weapons for the wounding of our Peace. For Chriſt hath left it an undeniable principle, that all his Members are one Body, into which by one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we are all Baptized, in which even the more feeble and leſs comely and leſs honourable parts have their place, receiving a comelineſs and honour from the whole, that there may be no Schiſme in the Body, but the Members ſhould have the ſame care one for another, ſuffering with that which ſuffereth, and rejoycing with that which is honoured, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12, 13, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. And the Holy Ghoſt hath left it as a certain truth, that of all theſe Members the moſt Charitable is the beſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.13. And that all men muſt know us to be Chriſts Diſciples by our loving one another, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.17. That we muſt thus be followers of God as Deare Children, and walk in love as Chriſt hath loved us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1, 2. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ainly he that loveth God, doth love his Brother alſo, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.21. and he is a lyar if he ſay he loveth God, when he hateth his Brother, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. Peace muſt be <hi>followed</hi> (and not only accepted of when offered) as well as holineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. And that with all men if it be poſſible, and as much as lieth in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.13. The weak in Faith muſt be received, but not to doubtfull Diſputations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. And the ſtrong muſt tolerate their infirmities, not pleaſing themſelves, but their neighbours for their Edification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1, 2. The light of a multitude of ſuch paſſages of Scripture doth ſhine ſo bright in the faces of the unpeaceable, that they were not able to ſtand before them, if they drew not the veyle of a zeal for ſome pretended truth over the face of their moſt unchartiable Practices. But the ſelf-appropiated Title of <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and the ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Heterodox</hi> odious conſequents, from their Brethrens words, will prove but inſufficient Fig-leaves to cover the nakedneſs of uncharitable dividers when the Lord of Peace ſhall ſearch and judge them. Go on deare Brother, and if Satan ſhould have leave to hinder your ſucceſs, yet live and dye in this Bleſſed Work, and if you have not more comfort at laſt, in the revenue of theſe your pacificato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry labours, then ſelf-conceited dividers ſhall have in their uncharitable waies, then muſt we confeſs that we were ſtrangers to the will and waies of Chriſt. The wiſdome that is from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and the fruite of Righteouſneſs is by Peace-makers ſown in Peace: but the wiſdome that cheriſheth envying and ſtrife deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſuall, (or naturall) and devilliſh: For where envying and ſtrife is, (though piety and Othodox Doctrine may be pretended) yet there is confuſion (or tumultuouſneſs) and every evill work; and therefore in pretending to befriend the truth, they do but glory in vain and lye againſt the truth, and indeed know not what Spirit they are of, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.15, 14.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. And for the ſecond Point, The <hi>healing</hi> of our wounds! Oh that we could as ſurely accompliſh it, as we can all tell what <hi>means</hi> are neceſſary thereunto. Our work is not to procure a Communion between the viſible Members of Chriſt and of Satan, nor a Syncretiſme with any that hold not all that is eſſentiall to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, or that deny any point of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation; nor yet to draw any to participate with the trueſt Church or Saint in any of their Sins: Nor yet is it our preſent buſineſs to change mens minds from Infidelity or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59433:3"/>
to the Faith, that ſo they may be capable of our Communion; nor to change the differing Opinions of the Churches, which is a thing that we cannot expect at preſent: But our work is in theſe three particulars. Firſt, To bring the true Churches of Chriſt to underſtand each other to be true Churches. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To procure that internall Charity which true Chriſtians ſhould have to one another. Thirdly, To procure that externall manifeſtation of this Charity, which is their duty, or ſo much at leaſt as is neceſſary to our common ſafety, and the Propagation of that truth which all profeſs. And for the firſt of theſe (which the reſt depend upon) What can we require more of one another, then a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Chriſtian Faith; That which we require to prove a ſingle perſon fit to be a Member of the Church, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it that we muſt require of whole Churches, and with which we muſt be ſatisfied; which can be nothing but a profeſſion of Chriſtianity, not nullified by contradictory profeſſions or practices. And I hope we are before this agreed what Chriſtianity is, and what are the Eſſentials of the Faith. All theſe Eſſentials we do all profeſs. We all profeſs to believe the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith contained in the Creeds and Confeſſions of the Churches, by what Teſt ſoever a Chriſtian or a Church was known for man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>undred Years after Chriſt, (till Papiſts and Hereticks enlarged or depraved the Creeds,) by the ſame do we all offer our ſelves to be tryed, and may eaſily be known to be profeſſed Chriſtians, and (being united with our Paſtors for holy Communion,) to be true Churches of Chriſt. We all take the holy Scriptures for the Rule of our Faith and Lives, and believe it to be the infallible Word of God. In this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, (and the Integrals too,) are plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. This rule is Divine, and ſo our Faith is Divine. Had we but a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Rule, we could have but a humane Faith; If any would know our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is hither that we ſend them. Our Confeſſions are but to ſatisfie men, of our underſtanding the ſenſe of paſſages of Scripture: And they are written according to the Occaſions of their writing, and therefore with Diverſity (though not contrariety in any necceſſary point, at leaſt) ſpeaking moſt to the Points that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions call us to ſpeak moſt to, we make none of our Confeſſions the Rule of our Faith. Nor do we take any thing in them to be infallible and unalterable, further then it agreeth with the Scripture, which is our Rule. It hath been the running deſign of the Papiſts <hi>(<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t in conventu Thorumi &amp; ſaepiſſime)</hi> to draw us to own ſome other Teſt of our Religion: and then they think they may freely diſpute againſt it, and charge it with falſity, novelty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they dare not charge on the Word of God: And they think by this to ſet us altogether by the Ears, while one is for one Confeſſion and others for another; Whereas in the Scripture we are United.</p>
            <p>The great cauſe of our uncharitable cenſures and diviſions, hath been our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Antient ſimplicity of Faith, and alſo from the ſufficiency of the holy Scriptures to be the Rule and Teſt of our Faith: And till we return to this <hi>Scripture ſufficiency,</hi> and <hi>antient ſimplicity,</hi> there is no hope of the antient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Unity and Charity, while proud men muſt thruſt their own Opinions into the Churches Creed, or un-Church all that hold not ſuch Opinions; our peace with them muſt be by calming them, and bringing them to themſelves, and bearing as far as may be with their Infirmity, but not by doing as they do, in lacerating the Churches.</p>
            <p>We know it is here objected by the Papiſts and too many more, that many Hereticks will ſubſcribe to all that is in the Scriptures, while they miſinterpret them, and what's the conſequent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59433:3"/>[<hi>Therefore a plainer Confeſſion is neceſſary for men to own that will be accounted Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox.</hi>] We deny the conſequence. The Scripture is a Rule both plain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. A Heretick may miſinterpret the words of any other Confeſſion as well as the words of Scripture. The ſenſe of the counſell of <hi>Trent</hi> is not yet agreed on among the Papiſts. The remedy for Hereſie is not to impoſe another Rule of Faith then Scripture, (as if this were inſufficient and we could mend it) but to exerciſe Church Government carefully, and if any be proved to teach any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contrary to the Scripture, that Magiſtrates and that Paſtors do their parts to correct ſuch and reſtrain them. We might not make new Confeſſions or Laws when ever wicked men will miſinterpret or violate the old Ones; the perfecteſt Law may be broken, and the perfecteſt confeſſions miſinterpreted. We conclude therefore, that all that ſubſcribe to the holy Scriptures, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to all contained in the Antient Creeds of the Church, and in the Lords Prayer and Decalogue, do make ſo full a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, that none may reject them, till they prove by ſome inconſiſtent contradiction that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they hold not what they do profeſs.</p>
            <p>And yet we deny not, but to teach the People, to direct young Miniſters, to ſtop the mouths of ſlanderous adverſaries, the Confeſſions of the Churches are uſefull and to be approved. And <hi>ex abundanti</hi> to cure the jealouſies of diſſeaſed mindes, we are all ready in every Proteſtant Church to give men a full account of our Faith, in plain Confeſſions: but with this Proteſtation, that only the holy Scripture is the Rule of our Faith, and the Teſt of our Religion, and that all that is contained in our ſeverall Confeſſions is not Eſſentiall to a Chriſtian or a Church; nor will we juſtifie every Term or Method of theſe Confeſſions, as perfect and inculpable; but as we are certain in the Eſſentials and other points that are plain in Scripture, ſo for the leſſer dark points, we are ready to alter any thing of them that can be proved contrary to the Scripture which is our Rule.</p>
            <p>The 39 Articles were lately the Confeſſion of our Churches here in <hi>England,</hi> but now becauſe of too or three Articles for Ceremonies and Prelacy, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is laid by; and not impoſed upon any. And what! have we therefore changed our Religion, or are the Churches in <hi>England,</hi> other things and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith. No ſuch matter. Who will affirm it, that knows what Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is? We have the ſame Chriſt, and the ſame Rule of Faith and Teſt of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſtill, and hold the ſame Doctrine which thoſe Articles expreſs, though we be not all of a mind in Ceremonies. A Papiſt, <hi>Polydore Virgill,</hi> truly ſaith of the Proteſtants, that they are therefore called, <hi>Evangelici quod haud ullam aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent recipiendam eſſe Legem, quae ad animarum ſalutem pertineat, niſi quam Chriſtus aut Apoſtoli dediſſent. De Invent. Rer.</hi> l. 8. c. 4. p. 410. By the great mercy of God we are all agreed in the authority and verity of the Scriptures, and that's enough in point of Profeſſion, to prove us to be of a ſound belief: but if we think to centre in any Confeſſions that are not plainly thence extracted, we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a difficult and needleſs work. Nothing thefore can be pretended againſt our Faith, (the rule being ſo perfect and unqueſtioned) unleſs it be that we nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſie this Profeſſion by contradictions, and believe not the Scripture while we think we do believe it; but they that will condemn any Church on ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, muſt firſt produce their prooſe, which muſt not be from the words of a ſingle perſon, which none are reſponſable for but himſelf, but it muſt be the words of the Church it ſelfe, which they condemn, and it muſt not be from forced, feigned, or undiſcernd conſequences, while the Church doth expreſly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59433:4"/>
aſſert thoſe truths, which the Accuſers pretend they do by conſequence ſubvert. Such a connexion is there between· Theologicall Verities, that if no man were a true believer that holdeth any thing conſequentially inconſiſtent with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, it would be hard to find a believer in the world. Secondly, They muſt in reaſon admoniſh the accuſed Church, and hear them ſpeak for themſelves, and not reject them till after the firſt and ſecond Admonition, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily; But if all the enemies of the Proteſtant Churches at <hi>Rome,</hi> or Hell, ſhould bring forth their evidence to prove them void of the Chriſtian Belief: (for we are loath to ſuppoſe that there are any ſuch accuſers among themſelves,) they would all ſhame themſelves, and leave the Churches in poſſeſſion of their Faith; we can as eaſily prove that we are Chriſtians, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> can that they are Papiſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And for our ſecond work (to procure mutuall Charity among the Churches,) This is the work of grace which we may and muſt perſwade men to, and leave the bleſſing to the Lord. But we muſt needs ſay, that one of the greateſt cauſes of our diviſions, is the admitting of graceleſs unſanctified men into the Sacred Miniſtry; who being meer Opinioniſts in Religion, and void of that tender love to the Brethren, which is the Character of true Chriſtians, are eaſily carried for the ſake of their Opinions, to condemn and vilifie their Brethren, and tear and tread down the Churches of Chriſt: Whereas if they had ever known themſelves, they would have been more compaſſionate to others; and would be ſo jealous of their frail underſtandings as to be afraid leaſt they condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by the terms on which they condemn their Brethren: And if ever they had been poſſeſſed of the Spirit of Chriſt, they would have been taught of God to love the Brethren: and withall they would have underſtood, that denying them to be Brethren, will prove a poor excuſe for their uncharitableneſs.</p>
            <p>And for the third point (of Externall manifeſtation of this charity) we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that in theſe ſeverall waies, its to be done.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If perſons of different Judgments in leſſer Controverſies, do live neare together in the ſame Towns or Countries; that they ſhould lovingly joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame holy Aſſemblies for the worſhiping of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That if any profeſſing the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity; dare not joyn for fear of ſin, in the uſe of any Ceremony or Doctrine which they are againſt, they ſhould not thereupon be uſed uncharitably, but have ſuch liberty as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Peace and Welfare of the Churches and Commonwealth where they live.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Churches of ſeverall Nations (that have not oportunity of locall Communion) do cheerfully acknowledg one another for the true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt, and profeſs Chriſtian love to one another, and a readineſs to aſſiſt each other to their power, in the common cauſe.</p>
            <p>In ſome, Deare Brother, We conceive that the means moſt uſefull for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious atteynment of theſe ends are theſe two. Firſt, That the Churches in every Nation do in their Synods recognize their own Confeſſions, and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Confeſſions of other Churches; and having conſidered of both, do ſend to thoſe Churches, whoſe Communion and friendſhip they deſire, a double meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: that is, both an acknowledgment of the truth of thoſe Churches, with a profeſſion of our Brotherly love to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo our deſire of the like Brotherly Charity from them to us. To which end we ſend them the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Faith. In order to this it were to be deſired, that our common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59433:4"/>
be in generall the holy Scriptures, and more particularly the Ancient Creeds of the Church; (if this ſatisfie not) a fuller collection of all, and only the Eſſentials, and neer adjoyning points of Chriſtianity, and that as much as may be, in the very words of Scripture: if this cannot be done for want of time, or concord, then let the preſent Confeſſion of ſuch Churches be ſent as it is; but with this profeſſion, that only the Word of God is our Rule, and if any thing in our Confeſſion be found diſagreeable to that rule, we are ready when we underſtand ſo much, to diſown it and correct it. If you get but the Churches thus to own each other, and profeſs their Brotherly love and concord, your work is done: ſome ſuch acknowledgment we ſhould all Subſcribe. <hi>E.G. [We the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, repreſenting the Churches of Chriſt in</hi> England, <hi>in our Aſſembly at W. having conſidered of the Confeſſion of the Churches of Chriſt in</hi> (E.G.) <hi>Saxonie, and heard of their ſtability in the Chriſtian Faith, do heartily own them as the true Churches of Chriſt, and love them as our dear Brethren in the Lord, and take it for our duty to pray for them, and praiſe God on their behalf, and aſſiſt them in the common cauſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our ſeverall capacities and opportunities; and we earneſtly deſire the like Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love and Communion from them, having ſent them our Confeſſion of Faith, and this profeſſion of Brotherly love to that end.</hi>]</p>
            <p>This much of the work is with one ſide Actually, or Virtually done already. For we perceive by the Papers you ſent us, and by the frequent Profeſſions of many Reformed Churches, that they are generally reſolved to own the Churches called <hi>Lutherans</hi>; and for our parts we take it as a thing that Charity alloweth us not to queſtion (though in every point we be not of their mindes) So that on one part the work is done already, and nothing is wanting but a ſolemn manifeſtation of it, and an invitation of them to the like Charity and Communion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond part of the work to be done is, that thoſe Churches which upon theſe Brotherly Invitations, ſhall reject any neighbour Churches, and refuſe to own them as Brethren, in Communion, may be deſired (as we muſt do with particular Members) to ſet down in terms, out of their Confeſſions the Hereſie or other ſin that they charge them with, as the cauſe of their rejection, and hear them ſpeak for themſelves, before they judge them; which if they refuſe, we can proceed no further, but commit our cauſe to God, as we would do againſt the accuſations of any unreaſonable men. But if they performe it, we ſhall, it is like, correct ſome phraſes that offend them, and explaine others, and give them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; which one would think none ſhould need: when the queſtion is not [<hi>Whether we have any errors</hi>] (for ſo have the accuſers, and all men on earth) but, [<hi>Whether we are true Chriſtians, and Churches of Chriſt,</hi>] which nothing but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable darkneſs, or frowardneſs can cauſe Brethren to deny. The two chiefeſt expedients to ſatisfie, or ſilence all accuſations would be</p>
            <p>Firſt, To reduce our Confeſſions as aforeſaid, to Scripture and the Antient Creeds, and to Scripture phraſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And to cauſe ſome judicious moderate men to draw up a diſcourſe containing our mutuall agreements, and contracting our differences, and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the miſtaken points, and ſhewing how much of the difference is but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how much but verball, and that the reall are but in leſſer points, where a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is tollerable and conſiſtent with Chriſtianity and holy Communion. Some of us think it no hard matter to manifeſt the diſagreements that are moſt odiouſly exagitated, to be farre ſmaller then many on both ſides apprehend them. And much is done towards this already, by ſeverall learned Pacificators whom, you have excited.</p>

            <p>THough our particular Aſſociations meet once a moneth, yet our general meeting being but once a quarter, I could no ſooner diſpatch an Anſwer to your Letters. Our Brethren are thankfull for your great Reſpect in Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of your Papers concerning ſo ſweet and deſirable a thing as the Concord of the Churches. I conceive the way that we have here expreſſed will be by farre the moſt expeditious, namely for the moſt peaceable Churches to begin and ſend to the reſt. Firſt, A Confeſſion of their Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as much as may be in Scripture phraſe, that it may make no quarrels,) And Secondly, With it ſuch a Profeſſion of Brotherhood and Communion, as in the <hi>Formula</hi> we have expreſſed; and if this be accepted, that we deſire a return of the like from them. When this is done, the work is done, (ſave only that the Recording this by their Synods, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it by their Princes and Divines muſt help forth the fruits of it) If they deny this, they muſt be deſired to ſet down in their Accuſation the Reaſons on which they deny us their Communion: which when we have received, its two to one but we ſhall, partly by correcting our Expreſſions which offend, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by explaining them, and partly by manifeſting their Miſtakes, give ſome ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. If this way will not do, I think no way will, but Princes correction of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate Divines. We may calmlier thus ſatisfie them by Writings then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed debates in great Aſſemblies, and You, or I may not hope to live to ſee an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of all or moſt of the Churches for this Work.
