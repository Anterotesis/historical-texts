         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THat the Bishop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> was the Author of the Letter to the Vicar of <hi>Grantham,</hi> and Divines of that Lecture (though his Secretaries pen might set downe the words) is manifest by the premisses in the first Section; and that hee was likewise the Author of the <hi>Holy Table</hi> in defence of the Letter against the <hi>Coal from the Altar,</hi> is not onely probable, but plainly manifest and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable; for although in the Title page, and in the license he call him a <hi>Lincolneshire Minister,</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 5. a neighbouring <hi>Minister, employed in some of the maine passages,</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 11. one of the Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Grantham,</hi> saying <hi>(Wee met accordingly, and perused these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp;c.)</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 21 and 114. one of the Lecturers that approved of the Letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet all this proves him not a Lecturer, both because he might purposely personate another man whom he was not, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95783:4"/>
also because that by the same reason, wee may as well thinke him to be a Countrey Joyner; for hee saith, <hi>Holy Table</hi> pag. 45. <hi>I that am but a poore Countrey Ioyner, can set you up a Table, &amp;c.</hi> and yet hee could not be a Lecturer and Joyner both; besides, the Lordly stile, the Bishoply phrase, the Prelaticall disdaine of the Doctor the Chaplin, although the <hi>Kings,</hi> his mocking him with a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke, his slight of a Vicaridge, his disdaine of the Vicar of that Lecture, doe speake him no Lecturer at <hi>Grantham,</hi> his leasure to reade Histories; besides <hi>English, French, Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely in a Lecturer; his dexteritie in the civill, Common and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non lawes, the Lord Keepers office, Acts of Parliament, Acts of Councell, Prerogative Royall. Episcopall policy, and experience, and many such reasons bewray him to be no Lecturer, his skill in the tongues not usuall in a Lecturer, his Promptitude and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse in the Popish Canons, Decrees and Decretals, his skill in so many severall Masse-bookes, and frequent quotation of Masse-mongers, his notorious ignorance in understanding and applying the Scriptures, as appeares, <hi>pag.</hi> 78. upon <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2. and his rare quotation of Scriptures, the whole Booke (I thinke) scarce affording five severall Texts among many hundreds of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits Masse-bookes, and other Authors frequently quoted: in all which regards I appeale to any rationall man, whether this can be a Lecturer; but above all this, wee have himselfe confessing, (and one confession of the party accused or suspected, the Law takes hold of, not regarding a hundred denialls) for, saith hee, <hi>Holy Table, pag.</hi> 206. <hi>I dare not determine, being as you say, none of the ablest Canonists in the Church of England,</hi> here he takes the words as spoken of himselfe, which in the <hi>Coal from the Altar, pag.</hi> 50. and quoted, <hi>Holy Table, pag.</hi> 54. It is manifest that <hi>Heylin</hi> speakes it, and <hi>Lincolne</hi> takes it as spoken of the writer of the <hi>Letter,</hi> so that it cannot be denyed, but that one man was writer of both; and that hee was the Bishop appeares plainly, <hi>Holy Table, pag.</hi> 58. saying, <hi>This Pamphleter, whose whole Booke is but a Libell against a Bishop, &amp;c.</hi> Now it is evident that <hi>Heylin</hi> writ the Coal in answer to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Writer thereof; therefore the Writer of both Letter and Booke was the Bishop: And if this plaine confessing can be shifted off with jugling <hi>barbara celarent, pag.</hi> 64. adieu <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Logicke, Mood</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi>; and <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Tense</hi> too, and <hi>vous avez</hi> Doctor <hi>Holdsworth,</hi> who (they say) corrected it at the Presse, and Master <hi>Bourn who had the Manuscript,</hi> and also <hi>vous avez</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> himselfe, who licensed and approved it for Orthodoxal and consonant, and subscribed his Name.</p>

Lyturgie, as if it were all Gospell, although it be as unlike S. <hi>Iames,</hi> as Bishop <hi>Williams</hi> an honest Minister; for he may remember that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they pray <hi>pro iis qui in monastertis degunt,</hi> for those who live in Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, which prayer sure he will not say S. <hi>Iames</hi> composed; againe, it saith, <hi>commemorationem agamus benedictae Dominae nostrae matris Dei &amp; semper virginis Mariae,</hi> let us make comemoration of our blessed Lady the mother of God, and a perpetuall virgin: againe, it calls the sacrament <hi>incruentum sacrificium,</hi> a bloodlesse sacrifice, and saith, <hi>dimitte spiritum sanctissimum, ut efficiat hunc panem corpus sanctum Christi tui,</hi> send down thy most holy spirit, that it may make this bread the holy body of thy Christ: and againe, <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento Domine sanctorum patrum, fratrum &amp; episcoporum,</hi> be mindfull O Lord of our holy fathers, Friers &amp; Bishops, <hi>Martyru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, confessoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> Martyrs, Confessors &amp; Doctors, <hi>Ave Maria gratia plena,</hi> hail <hi>Mary</hi> ful of grace, &amp;c.
