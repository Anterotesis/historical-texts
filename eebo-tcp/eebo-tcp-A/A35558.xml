            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall make no other diviſion of the words, then ſuch as I finde made to my hand, and any body that hears, may anticipate: In the firſt Verſe, a Sad <hi>Deſolation</hi> (or <hi>Subverſion</hi> both of Church and State) threatned: in the ſecond, a bleſſed <hi>Restitution</hi> or <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of both promiſed. <hi>For the Children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. a ſad <hi>Deſolation. Afterwards ſhall the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael returne,</hi> &amp;c. a bleſſed and glorious <hi>Reſtitution.</hi> The Words, immediately were ſpoken of, and to the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> that is the Ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſeparated from the two Tribes, <hi>the Tribe of Judah and Benjamin:</hi> which adhered unto the poſterity of <hi>David. The Children of Iſrael?</hi> a glorious title for ſuch Rebels, and Idolators, who at one time had ſhaken off the yoake, both of their God and of their King. But <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> do not alwayes agree: we know that by the experience of all ages. So we may call
<pb facs="tcp:98739:3"/>
them <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who damn all men that are not of their Communion; not for any want of Charity either in their judgments, or to their perſons, that they can juſtly charge them with; but becauſe they think themſelves bound to profeſſe againſt; and their Conſcience will not give them leave to joyn with them in their errours. So may we call them <hi>Saints:</hi> but <hi>I</hi> will forbear further cenſure: it is but upon the by; a touch is enough.</p>
            <p>Well, but how doth it appear, that by that goodly title, or denomination; thoſe Rebellious Idolatrous Tribes are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſpoken of, or to? Firſt, becauſe moſt part of this Propheſie doth belong unto them: <hi>Ephraim,</hi> often here in moſt Chapters repeated: and that is as much as <hi>The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael:</hi> or ten Tribes. But more eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe words of the Text <hi>(David their King)</hi> manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allude, or relate, to that breach or diviſion of <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom under the reign of <hi>Roboam Salomons</hi> Son: when the ten Tribes fell off, and conſtituted another Kingdome, under the Government of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> an Ephrathite of <hi>Zereda, Salomons</hi> ſervant. (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 26.) Theſe be the chiefeſt reaſons that are given by Interpreters. Though ſomewhat might be objected, yet I am content it ſhould be ſo; <hi>I</hi> will not contend about the Word, <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately:</hi> ſo it be granted, that the ſubſtance of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, doth extend to all <hi>Jewes,</hi> in Generall. Some talk of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> too; but we need not ſtretch it ſo farr. But in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth, it being very uncertain what became of thoſe ten Tribes after their Captivity: and whether any part of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in Chriſts time; or even at this day: we ſhould be very much put to it, when we come to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Propheſie, here promiſed, <hi>in the latter dayes:</hi> if we do not extend thoſe words <hi>the houſe of Iſrael</hi> (as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the Scripture) to the Jewes in generall. To this purpoſe you may obſerve, that in the firſt Chapter of this
<pb facs="tcp:98739:3"/>
Propheſie, though the tenth verſe mention only the <hi>houſe of Iſrael;</hi> yet in the eleventh verſe, wheer the ſame matter is proſecuted, both <hi>the Houſe of Judah,</hi> and <hi>the Houſe</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are diſtinctly named. <hi>Then ſhall the Children of Judah, and the Children of Iſrael be gathered together, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point themſelves one head, and they ſhall come out of the land, for great ſhall be the day of Jezreel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing we will take into conſideration, which will give more light to the whole Propheſie, and main drift of it, is the <hi>Time,</hi> either of the <hi>deſolation</hi> threatned; or <hi>reſtitution</hi> promiſed. <hi>In the latter dayes;</hi> ſaith my Text, in the laſt words. It is the opinion of many, that this <hi>Deſolation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun from the captivity of each people, by the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> of the ten Tribes, under <hi>Hoſea</hi> (or <hi>Hoſhea</hi> as ſome write it) the ſon of <hi>Ela,</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> of the two Tribes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Zedekia:</hi> the laſt of <hi>Juda:</hi> and that their <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> the beginning of it, is to be accounted from their returne of the ſaid Captivity, by the ordinance and appointment of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as is more particularly related in <hi>Eſrah</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> It cannot be denyed indeed, that at the return of the Jewes from the Babyloniſh Captivity, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to a government of their own, under ſome <hi>Princes,</hi> firſt; and then Prieſts; enjoyed their firſt Fundamentall Lawes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that at the ſame time, the worſhip of God alſo was reſtored. But here is a great difficulty, a main cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the Text, or Propheſie wanting: a <hi>King,</hi> and that King, <hi>David</hi> by name. Somewhat is ſaid of <hi>Zeroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel:</hi> he was of the Royal Seed; that is ſomewhat, but not enough to verifie, the accompliſhment of this glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a King: of the beſt, and beſt beloved of Kings, <hi>King David.</hi> Yet <hi>I</hi> do not deny, but that the words of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, might have ſome reference to that returne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration alſo. It is the nature of propheſies ſometimes, to comprehend different times and events, ſome more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately;
<pb facs="tcp:98739:4"/>
ſome more remotely: if they agree in ſome one, or two main circumſtances, though they do not in all, it may become a propheſie well enough.</p>
            <p>All things well weighed and conſiderd, (not to trouble you with many doubts, and variety of opinions) we muſt conclude, that both in regard of the <hi>Deſolation</hi> threatned, and the <hi>reſtitution</hi> promiſed; being taken together, as they are here joyned together: the moſt genuine, full and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory ſence will be, to begin the threatned <hi>Deſolation:</hi> (or ſubverſion of State, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical) from the laſt great Calamities of the Jews by <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperor, when the City was taken and deſtroyed, the Temple burnt, Millions of Jews periſhed: now full 1500. Years ago. So that the moſt warrantable expoſition (and which we ſhall pitch upon) of the words will be this: <hi>The Children of Iſrael:</hi> that is, the Jews in generall; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinarie Scripture phraſe, not of the <hi>Old,</hi> but New Teſtament alſo, as <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 21. and elſewhere. <hi>Shall abide many dayes:</hi> many dayes, God knowes, they have now continued a diſtinct people, from all other Nations, though diſperſed among, almoſt, all Nations of the World. <hi>Without a King, and without a Prince:</hi> a thing not little to be wondred at, that being ſo many and ſo potent, in ſome places, as they are reported to be; they ſhould in ſo many Ages of the World, get no <hi>King,</hi> no <hi>Prince,</hi> of their own, in any place. As they have no <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Prince;</hi> ſo no <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> nor any of thoſe other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, mentioned here in the Text, which I forbear here to mention, untill we have better enquired into the true meaning of the words. <hi>Aftewards ſhall the Children of Iſrael returne and ſeek after the Lord their God, and David there King:</hi> that is, they ſhall turn unto God, repent of their incredulity, and ſeek after Chriſt the Meſſias, ſtiled in the Scripture, not <hi>the Son of David,</hi> only; but alſo <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98739:4"/>
abſolutely: as by <hi>Jeremie,</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> in divers places. Him, whom when he came firſt, and ſought unto them, they would not receive: <hi>in the Latter dayes,</hi> that is, at the end of the World: They ſhall ſeek and become Chriſtians: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth aſſure us: <hi>For I would not Brethren, that you ſhould be ignorant of this myſtery—that blindneſs in part is hapned unto Iſrael, untill the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in. And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 11. 2, 5, 6. <hi>And ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs:</hi> that is, they ſhall worſhip God for his goodneſs, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>There is mercy with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared, Pſ.</hi> 130. 4. that is, worſhipped, becauſe fear is a principall part, and firſt Original, as it were, of Gods worſhip. That is the right ſenſe; but I may not at this time inſiſt upon it.</p>
            <p>So you have the moſt genuine and warrantable ſenſe of the words. Before we proceed to that uſe, in ſeveral <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> upon the words <hi>I</hi> aim at; we will conſider of ſome expoſitors, or rather opinions of expoſitors, upon the ſame words: as alſo of ſome particular words of the Text, which have bred ſome difficulty.</p>
            <p>I told you it is the opinion of ſome Interpreters, that the promiſed <hi>restitution</hi> of <hi>the Children of Iſrael:</hi> is to be reckned from their return out of the Captivity of Babylon, and this to be the moſt literall interpretation of the words. What might be objected, I tould you likewiſe. This <hi>King David,</hi> ſo eminently, ſo emphatically here promiſed, muſt certainly be ſome body elſe, beſides <hi>Zerobabel.</hi> Yet I will not deny, but that even in <hi>Zerobabel,</hi> this prophecy might have ſome accompliſhment: I find moſt interpreters of that opinion, and that is enough to perſwade me. Wherein (by the way (the infinite wiſdom of Almighty God, is much obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo to forecaſt events from all eternity, that the ſame words of his Prophets, might both fit the times and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Goſpel, ſo long after: and yet fit the preſent
<pb facs="tcp:98739:5"/>
occaſions and occurrences of thoſe times, and events un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law.</p>
            <p>Here I cannot but take notice of an objection, made, by <hi>Ribera</hi> the Jeſuite (a very learned Jeſuite, as moſt of that order) againſt this literal interpretation. For, ſaith he, <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> K. of <hi>Juda,</hi> lived a long time during the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: Of whom we reade: (2 <hi>Kings,</hi> laſt Chapter, laſt Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:) that <hi>Evilmerodach, King of Babylon, in the firſt Year of his reign, did lift up his head out of priſon, and ſpake kindly to him, and ſet his throne above the thrones of all other</hi> (Captive, or Tributary) <hi>Kings that were with him in Babylon. And changed his priſon Garments: and that he did eat bread continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before him all the dayes of his life.</hi> What an objection is this? What ſhall we make of it? I expected <hi>Ribera</hi> would have told us, that <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> had reſtored unto <hi>Jehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi> King of <hi>Juda,</hi> his Royall power and Soveraignty: that he had reſtored him to his ſubjects, and his ſubjects unto him: Then indeed he had ſaid ſomewhat. But becauſe <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jakim</hi> had a bare title, and an empty throne; yea and an <hi>allowance</hi> for his daily expences (for that alſo is expreſſed in the Scripture) vouchſafed unto him, by him that had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away all his power, and authority: hence to inferr, that therefore <hi>the Children of Iſrael,</hi> were not without a King, during the Captivity; whether more ſtrange, from ſuch a one as <hi>Ribera;</hi> or more ridiculous in it ſelf, I know not. Yet let me ſay? Such an objection might become well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough a Jeſuite; that is, a perfect enemy to the power and authority of Kings. <hi>I</hi> do not deny, but <hi>Evilmerodach,</hi> was great enough, to make a true King. That honourable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator of <hi>Rome, Pompeius Magnus</hi> [when <hi>Rome</hi> was Miſtreſſe of the then known world, but little excepted:] made many that were true Kings, and had the power and authority of Kings, where they did reign, and where conſtituted by him. But a meer titular King, that hath the pompe and

garbe only, or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, the <hi>allowance,</hi> but not the ſubſtance, that is the <hi>power</hi> and Soveraignty; is a ſad ſight. Not a King according to the Scripture, I am ſure, whom we may <hi>call, the breath of our Noſtrils:</hi> of whom we may ſay; <hi>under the ſhadow of his wings ſhall we live among our enemies,</hi> Lament. 4. 20. Such a King is none of thoſe <hi>comely</hi> things that wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> did admire. A <hi>Lyon which is ſtrongeſt among beaſts:</hi> that is the firſt: <hi>a King against whom there is no riſing up:</hi> is his concluding inſtance; the laſt in order, but the firſt, and chiefeſt in his intention, as may be gathered by other examples of the ſame nature. But we have done with this <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> King; as we may call him: Not ſo much becauſe <hi>Ribera</hi> a Jeſuite doth make this objection; and not any but he, that I know of: but becauſe it is the proper Character of a Jeſuite, to be an enemy to the power and authority of Kings.</p>
            <p>As to the ſenſe of the words in generall, I have ſaid as much as needs: but there is yet in the words, if more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly examined, that wants cleering. <hi>For the Children of Iſrael</hi> (ſaith my Text.) <hi>Shall abide many dayes without a Prince: and without a Sacrifice, and without an Image; and without an Ephod, and without Teraphims.</hi> We made the meaning of the words in generall to be, that the Iſraelites during the time of their deſolation, ſhall be without any publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; ſuch worſhip as was eſtabliſhed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the law of God; the Leviticall and Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all law: as particularly, <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and an <hi>Ephod:</hi> which was a ſacred garment: ſufficiently known, both, to them that are not unacquainted with the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But how come <hi>Images,</hi> here; and <hi>Teraphims;</hi> that is, Idols: as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of Gods worſhip? Here Interpreters are put to it. They ſay (the beſt ſhift they can make) the intention of the words is this: That the Iſraelites ſhall be without any publick exerciſe of religion, or divine worſhip; whether
<pb facs="tcp:98739:6"/>
true, ſet out by <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and the <hi>Ephod,</hi> ordained by the law: or falſe and idolatrous, ſet out by <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims:</hi> that is: Idolls. Though this be ſaid by many, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not what elſe to ſay:) yet it is ſtrange, and ſomewhat unlikely to me, that the Prophet ſhould mix true, and falſe worſhip, in this manner: <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Mammon:</hi> light and darkneſs: in one verſe without any need. And <hi>I</hi> doubt, whether it can be made good by Hiſtory, that the Iſraelites in generall, who many times were notorious Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, in the Holy Land; continued alwaies true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the Land of Idolaters. <hi>I</hi> could ſay more, but <hi>I</hi> will contract my ſelf, becauſe <hi>I</hi> reſerve my ſelf for ſomewhat elſe.</p>
            <p>But what if this Idolatrie be but a conceit of Interpreters, ſome Interpreters: and upon better examination, prove no ſuch matter? Firſt, for the word <hi>image,</hi> it is granted that the Original word <hi>matſeba,</hi> may as well be tranſlated, an <hi>Altar,</hi> [and ſo indeed it is by the old Latin and Greek interp.] or <hi>Pillar,</hi> intended for a ſacred memorial: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 19. 19. where <hi>Altar</hi> and Pillar, ſeem to ſtand for one thing: both dedicated to the true God: And is it not much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and an <hi>altar,</hi> ſhould be joyned; then <hi>ſacrifices</hi> and <hi>images?</hi> So here is no <hi>idolatry</hi> in theſe words. There is more difficulty about the <hi>Teraphims:</hi> becauſe we have not [as is objected] a preſident in Scripture, where <hi>Teraphim</hi> is taken in good ſenſe, for any part of Gods ſervice or any thing that was then lawful, and in uſe. If it were granted: yet we doe not want exemples in Scripture, of other words; which are taken in ſome one place or other, in a different ſence, from their uſual ſignification. <hi>I</hi> could inſtance in many ſuch words, if <hi>I</hi> thought either time or place ſeaſonable. In ſome places, it is tranſlated <hi>idol;</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. in ſome <hi>idolatry:</hi> as 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 15. 23, In ſome <hi>images:</hi> as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. more then once. Where beſt Interpreters
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98739:6"/>
by images underſtand an <hi>Ordinary Statue</hi> or mans <hi>picture:</hi> not any thing that was unlawfull, or idolatrous. And why not here alſo, <hi>Teraphim</hi> being joyned with other good words, in a good ſence? But what uſe of <hi>pictures</hi> or <hi>images</hi> in Gods ſervice? Or to religious uſe? St. <hi>Jerome</hi> will tell us: both for his antiquity and exquifite knowledg of the originall Hebrew one that deſerves credit, as much as any. His words are, <hi>Teraphim, proprie</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>id est figurae &amp; ſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra, quae nos poſſumus in praeſenti duntaxat loco, Cherubim, &amp; Seraphim, ſive alia quae in templi ornamenta fieri juſſaſunt, dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> That is, <hi>Theraphim, properly certain images, ſhapes, or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, by which in this place, we may understand Cherubins and Seraphims, and other ſuch things, that were commanded to be made, for an ornament to the Temple.</hi> But to put all out of doubt (and I wonder ſo many expoſitors ſhould take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it:) Let us interpret Scripture by Scipture, which is generally acknowledged the beſt and ſafeſt way. What is here more largely and fully ſet out, that is by more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 3. is thus compriſed: but here, by the <hi>praeterit,</hi> hiſtorically: in my Text, by the future, as a propheſie: of the ſame people, but not of the ſame men. <hi>For the Children of Iſrael ſhall abide many dayes,</hi> ſaith my Text. there; <hi>Now for a long time Iſrael hath been:</hi> what? <hi>without the true God, and without a teaching Priest, and without a Law;</hi> their <hi>Deſolation.</hi> The <hi>Restitution</hi> follows, in the next verſe. <hi>But when they in their troubles did turne unto the Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, &amp;c.</hi> The difference is great, as to the matter of the words in the ſecond verſe; no <hi>Meſſias,</hi> no <hi>King David</hi> here; but only a <hi>reſtitution</hi> in general. But in the firſt verſe, there is no queſtion but the ſame thing in effect was intended in both places; here more conciſely, (as I ſaid before:) in my Text, more fully ſet out, to wit, that the Iſraelites had <hi>been,</hi> in <hi>Chronicles: ſhould be</hi> in the Prophet, without any publick worſhip of the true God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98739:7"/>
So now the Text is clear, and the words acquitted of all ſuperſtition and Idolatry. An eaſie miſtake. Though in the true nature, or <hi>formalis ratio,</hi> of true Religion and Idolatry; there is a vaſt difference: yet in outward appearance, they may come ſo neer ſometimes, that a man had need much cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, to give a right judgment. And indeed this is the method that Gods word hath preſcribed unto us, in the tryall of Idolatry, before we paſs any judgment. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 12, 13, 14. Then <hi>ſhalt thou enquire,</hi> and <hi>make ſearch:</hi> and <hi>ask diligently:</hi> and behold if it <hi>be truth:</hi> and <hi>the thing certain: then ſhalt thou, &amp;c. Then,</hi> and not till <hi>then.</hi> And why ſo much caution <hi>I</hi> pray? I told you before; it is an eaſie matter to miſtake; there is ſo much affinity ſometimes (externally) between true and falſe worſhip. The Jewes once miſtook their brethren the <hi>Reubenites;</hi> and they had like to have made a foul work: much innocent blood was like to have been ſhed, and a whole Tribe of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> deſtroyed. Fierce Zelots would have had it ſo, you may be ſure. But the ſober part carried it. They went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods rule: they firſt <hi>inquired diligently:</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diligent inquiſition, they pronounced them innocent, and acknowledged them Brethren, whom but a little before, they were in a readineſs to deſtroy, as unworthy to live, as abominable idolaters. You have the ſtory, <hi>Joſua,</hi> 22. The Jewes themſelves (in general) for doing no more then what they were commanded by God, obſerving <hi>New Moons;</hi> and the like: (as by ſome very learned is obſerved) were accounted Idolaters, worſhippers of Sun and Moon, by ſome other Nations that were really guilty of it.</p>
            <p>I ſaid before, that it is any eaſy miſtake: but alas! That is not the worſt. A bare miſtake where there is no other engagement; upon better information may eaſily be redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But where intereſt and worldly ends oblige, if not to <hi>believe</hi> (for belief is not ſo eaſily wrought) yet to <hi>criminate:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98739:7"/>
information will not avail. Say what you will, bring rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, bring authority: in deſpight of truth, though never ſo manifeſt; in deſpight of all Conſcience, an <hi>Altar</hi> or <hi>ſacred Pillar</hi> ſhall be a prophane <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Teraphims</hi> muſt be, ſhall be found <hi>Idols.</hi> It is expedient it ſhould be ſo, reaſon muſt yield to profit, and conſcience to gain. O this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary idolatry! How really profitable and advantagious hath it proved in all ages to wordly Wiſe men? Yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> had warned us long before; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>Thou that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrest Idols, doest thou commit Sacriledge?</hi> A man might think, that he had propheſied this of <hi>the latter dayes.</hi> Noe: long before his time, there were ſome known Atheiſts; deſpiſers, by their life, of all Deity and Religion; who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs under colour of piety, robbed Churches, (Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples rather) and committed ſacriledg, with all licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is hard to be judged, whether Idolatry (the moſt provoking ſin, out of all queſtion, and moſt inconſiſtent with true Religion) have done more hurt in the World; or a pretended zeal againſt idolatry. I am confident, that the idolatrous worſhip of images (for there it begun, and continued a good while, before it came to theſe Weſtern parts) hath been a main thing that brought the curſe, and judgments of God upon thoſe famous Eaſtern Churches, where once Chriſtian Religion was in ſo great ſplendour and purity. And as certain it is, that <hi>Arabs</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> both prevailed at the firſt, not a little; and to this day up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold themſelves very much, in their abominable Apoſtacy from Chriſt, by their pretended zeal againſt Images, and idolatry. Thoſe miſcreants, that think it great idolatry, to ſee the image of a King ſtamped upon a peece of money, which Chriſt ſaw and allowed of: think it no idolatry, to prefer <hi>Mahomet,</hi> before Chriſt; a meer man, before the eternall Son of God; an Impoſtor, a cheater of men; before the Saviour, and Redeemer of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98739:8"/>
And what think you of the Idolatry of <hi>Cathedralls,</hi> and other goodly Churches; erected to the honour of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, and endowed, for the maintenance of piety and learning; Of the Idolatry of a <hi>publick Liturgy,</hi> whithout which was never any Chriſtian Church in any part of the World heard of, that ever I could hear, till of late years: but to be ſhort; what of the Idolatry of a <hi>Surplice; Church-Muſick, Biſhops,</hi> and the like? Have not Men got, ſome brave Eſtates of Lands, by this pretended Idolatry; ſome good benefices: nay ſome built themſelves ſtately houſes with the very ſtones which they have bereaved God of? Some write of one of the Popes of Rome, that he ſhould applaud himſelf with his Mates, and Cardinalls, how much they had gained by this <hi>fabula Chriſti.</hi> They indeed (if it be true) very blaſphemouſly, calling that a <hi>fable,</hi> which we believe, and know a <hi>truth,</hi> atteſted by God, with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible evidences, and demonſtrations of ſound reaſon. But much more reaſon have theſe men (as it is likely, where they may freely) hug themſelves, and make their brags, that they have thrived ſo well, by this ſubtle device of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Idolatry. Be ſure of this, there ſhall never be want of Idolatry, whilſt there is any thing to be got, let but time and opportunity ſerve them: <hi>Tythes, Colledges, Libraries, Hoſpitalls, Corporations:</hi> nay rather than fail, <hi>the very prayer of the Lord,</hi> that holy prayer, (the uſe of it, <hi>I</hi> mean, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſts inſtitution) ſhall be made Idolatry: their goods, if not their lives, ſhall be in danger that have uſed it: It will be found ſuch horrible Idolatry.</p>
            <p>We have done with our firſt <hi>Obſervation,</hi> upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Idolatry of the words: and all that we have more to do, is but to make ſome further uſe, by way of <hi>Obſervation,</hi> upon the reſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond then, ſhall be this: that the name and title of a <hi>King,</hi> according to the Scripture, is both honourable
<pb facs="tcp:98739:8"/>
with God (there is no incongruity in the words: God ſaith <hi>He will honour them, that Honour him:)</hi> and is propoſed, by the Scriptures, as an object of joy and happineſs among Men, in times of greateſt diſtreſs. <hi>No King: no Prince:</hi> in the threatned <hi>deſolation: They ſhall return to the Lord their God, and David their King;</hi> in the promiſed <hi>restitution.</hi> It may be ſome body will ſay, this <hi>King:</hi> this <hi>David</hi> here promiſed, is no other then the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> or Chriſt himſelf: the Son of God, no Earthly mortall King. Let it be granted. Is it not a great honour to Kings, and to their office, that Chriſt the Meſſias, the expectation of all People, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the World, is here promiſed under the tipe, and perſon of a King? That he was really and literally, of the Royall ſeed, and linage, and did not deſpiſe the very name of a King, <hi>King David?</hi> This obſervation might have been ſpared, had not the impiety and impertinency of other Men, made it ſeaſonable, and neceſſary. Do not we know how much ſome Men have endeavoured, to diſcredit that ſacred Name and function: to perſwade Men, that a curſe lay upon it, rather then a bleſſing? O how have the Pulpits rung with, <hi>Tophet is prepared for the King:</hi> and, <hi>He ſhall bind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Kings in chains,</hi> and the like? Bleſſed Scripture, how haſt thou been wreſted and racked, by corrupt, illiterate teachers; to ſerve their ungodly private ends? We will not argue the caſe, from broken looſe pieces of Scripture; as the manner of theſe Men is: there be cleer proofs and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies enough, both from matter of fact; and from poſitive doctrine; as of the <hi>Old;</hi> ſo of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> to aſſert this ſacred authority: but <hi>I</hi> will content my ſelf here with what <hi>I</hi> have ſaid, by way of obſervation upon the Text.</p>
            <p>The third, (or next) ſhall be: That a King may be at variance with his ſubjects, and his ſubjects with him ſo, that it may proceed to a direct ſeparation: (nay, which is
<pb facs="tcp:98739:9"/>
more <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> this may happen between a good King, and good ſubjects for the generality: as in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when part of his ſubjects were drawen from him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of evill government by his Son <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and he forced to fly:) but proceed I ſay, to a direct ſeparation, and yet afterwards reconciled, to the great joy and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, both of King and people.</p>
            <p>There is no Nation ſo wiſe, or ſo well governed, but is lyable to diſcord and diviſion. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, ſaith our Savious. <hi>It must needs, that offences come.</hi> Why? Nothing is impoſſible to God. No: but conſider the Nature of Man, in generall; and the nature of the world; this ſublunary World, which we cannot expect with reaſon that God will alter, till the time of its generall alteration come: ſo it is impoſſible, that there ſhould not be offences: and where Men are, ſtri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e and contention at times ſhould not ariſe. It is a high ſpeculation, but which hath much of truth in it, that this World (this ſublunary world, I mean ſtill,) doth ſubſiſt by contraries, that is, by continual ſtrivings: and thoſe Philoſophers had ſome reaſon too, if rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that made <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is ſtrife and contention, one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Originall principles of the world. Yea ſuch is the nature of man, though he be moſt happy by peace, and in peace: yet he becomes inſenſible of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, he loatheth it, if he do not want it ſometimes, and recover himſelf to a right ſenſe and judgment, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects, of ſtrife and contention. This made a wiſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſay, with ſome admiration; <hi>Quae magna gaudia, niſi ex malis?</hi> That all great joyes were the products of great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or ſorrows.</p>
            <p>Well, a King and his Subjects may fall out, and be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. <hi>David</hi> and his Subjects, were our inſtance. So for this alſo, that they may be reconciled. The hiſtory is known, in <hi>Abſaloms</hi> caſe. <hi>David</hi> was happy, and his ſubjects happy,
<pb facs="tcp:98739:9"/>
that their diviſion did hold no longer. Yet it is very poſſible that where the breach hath been longer, and the want of a King longer; if it once come to a perfect and cordial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, if not the joy greater, yet the ſenſe of it may be longer. The Prophet intended a very great joy; as great as he could make it, the greateſt of the World: the long expected <hi>Meſſias:</hi> and this joy he ſets out by the joy of a King and People, who after <hi>many dayes</hi> (ſo he ſaith) <hi>many dayes</hi> divorce, are again re-united. <hi>Behold how good and how pleaſant it is</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>for Brethren to dwell together in Unity.</hi> Unity indeed, ſhould alwaies be our wiſh, and our aim: and they that are the cauſes of diviſion, deſerve the curſe both of God and man. It is not allwaies true, that <hi>Amantium irae amoris redintegratio eſt.</hi> Sometimes a little ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle doth kindle a great fire, not to be quenched untill it hath made an end of all. But where God is ſo mercifull, as after a long breach and gaſping condition, to grant a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Re-union and reconciliation: a man had need of the tongue of Angels, to expreſs the greatneſs of that joy, not here in earth and among men only; but, <hi>I</hi> am confident, even in Heaven, <hi>in the preſence of the Angels of God;</hi> and all the hoaſt of Heaven. Hear <hi>I</hi> pray how pathetically the words of my Text doe run: <hi>Afterwards</hi> (after that ſad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, or ſeparation <hi>of many dayes,) ſhall the Children of Iſrael returne, and ſeek the Lord their God, and David their King: and ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs in the latter dayes.</hi> And here offers it ſelf our laſt obſervation upon the words: <hi>viz.</hi> the method of this Returne, or Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Firſt, they ſeek the Lord their God: and after, their King. There may be a <hi>returne,</hi> or reconciliation for meer politick ends, on both ſides: It may be they finde, they cannot ſubſiſt aſunder; and that the continuance of their diviſion, will be the ruine of both. Such an occaſion will cauſe a <hi>returne,</hi> if they be not infatuated to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
<pb facs="tcp:98739:10"/>
And God doth uſe ſometimes ſuch outward means and inducement to bring us to Himſelf, and to work us by degrees to a perfect converſion, or reconciliation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the trueſt and ſureſt foundation is to begin with God, acording to the method of my Text. <hi>It is God that maketh men to be of one mind in a Houſe, Pſ.</hi> 68. 16. according to ſome tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations: <hi>in a houſe,</hi> much more in a Kingdom. <hi>I form the light, and create darkneſs, I make peace, and create evil,</hi> So God of himſelf, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. 7. God then is firſt to be ſought ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the right method, upon a ſure foundation. But what if Men will pretend to ſeek God, and to <hi>return</hi> unto God: but reſolve to go no further. It is very ordinary for worldly politick Men, to put that cheat upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or rather, upon others; credulous, ignorant People. They will affoord us <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> enough, in their kind: and God ſhall be in their mouths, and <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> nothing more. By theſe fair pretences, they drive on their deſignes, and thrive by the miſeries and ſufferings of the publick. To theſe men, or to them rather that are gulled by them, <hi>I</hi> ſhall commend the advice of an interpreter of great fame: <hi>John Calvin</hi> is the Man. <hi>Non fruſtra</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Hoſeas in reſipiſcentia populi,</hi> &amp;c. in Engliſh, thus: <hi>It is not without great cauſe, that the Prophet in ſetting out the repentance of the People, doth alſo particularly remember</hi> (or, <hi>relate) their return to David their King. For otherwiſe the People could not truely and really ſeek God, except at the ſame time it did ſubmit to the lawfull government; to which it was obliged,</hi> (or, <hi>ſubjected) not by Man, or by chance, but by the appointment of God himſelf.</hi> The laſt words require a candide interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſt he ſhould be thought to ſay, that ordinary Kings, that have not ſuch immediate calling as <hi>David</hi> had, are by <hi>chance,</hi> or by <hi>Men</hi> only: which is ſo contrary to Scripture, and to ſound doctrine, that the very Jeſuits would exclaim as much wronged, if laid to their charge: though many of
<pb facs="tcp:98739:10"/>
them ſay little leſs in effect, and act accordingly, as it is well known. But the Counſel well underſtood, is very good: I need not to add any thing to it.</p>
            <p>So we have done with the Text; the <hi>expoſition</hi> of it, and ſuch <hi>Obſervations,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> apprehended not impertinent to it. Theſe times, and the common talk of all People, might ſeem to prompt ſome application. But this is <hi>lubricus locus,</hi> ſuch a ſubject wherein a man that will be meddling, may ſoon go beyond his bounds, and ſooner do hurt then good. Though Kings are <hi>by God,</hi> and we warranted, nay obliged by Scripture, to preach ſubjection <hi>for conſcience ſake:</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt <hi>rebellion,</hi> in generall: much more againſt all killing, or murthering of Kings (O horrible!:) under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of law; yet ſince the power and praerogative of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Kings, is limited and conſtituted, by the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall laws of every Kingdome, approved and confirmed by the aſſent and conſent of ſucceſſive Kings: in this caſe, what a King may do lawfully, what he may not, according to law: what oppoſition in caſe he attempt, or do any thing againſt the fundamentall law, may be made according to the ſame law: by whom, and how farr: theſe things, as they are out of our ſpheare, and ſcanning, as we are preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel; ſo muſt it be high preſumption, in any of our profeſſion, to paſs judgments, or indeed, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle. So, if the buſineſs of <hi>union,</hi> or <hi>reconciliation</hi> be in hand, after <hi>many dayes</hi> ſeparation and diviſion: <hi>I</hi> know <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> what a loyall Iſraelite is bound to wiſh, what to pray, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; but many cautions, and conſiderations of State, may belong to ſuch a buſineſs, to bring it to a good and well grounded iſſue. They that can judge what is moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the proper conſtitution, and fundamentalls of a Realm (Lawyers and Sages of the land, as <hi>I</hi> take it.) They that know what the preſent condition, inclination, ability, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the people of the land is: what may be done;
<pb facs="tcp:98739:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what muſt be borne to prevent further evils, and effuſion of blood, (a Parliament as I take it:) I think it belongs unto them, and is their proper work: Let them look to it, as they are accountable to God, and their Country. If they (to whom it belongs) ſhall enact any thing, to which I cannot yield obedience with a good conſcience, that is without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying God: I may reſolve, with Gods aſſiſtance, to ſuffer, I may not to oppoſe. Yea though it were in my power to do ſome what, and to diſturbe; yet my conſcience tells me, it is not lawfull.</p>
            <p>This is all the <hi>application</hi> I ſhall make: God give us all grace, to apply our ſelves unto him, in ſimplicity and ſynce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to depend of him in all things: to ſeek his glory, and his favour above all things: to whom all honour, glory, power, and majeſty:</p>
