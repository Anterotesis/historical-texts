            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:46418:4"/>
wonderfully to ſupport, ſtrengthen and incourage us under loſſes &amp; long confinements, that through Divine aſſiſtance we were enab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to hold on in the Lord's way to the laſt; thoſe that gave us trouble being in the iſſue, either weary of their own Work, or convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the honeſty of our's, and the integrity of our Hearts therein: that theſe my Fellow-ſufferers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the reſt that did ſympathize with us, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us in our bonds, as bound with us, ſhould be under ſome viſible Character of my cordial Love, and ſeeing the Providence of God had for the preſent ſet me at ſo great a diſtance from them, that I was utterly diſabled from doing or receiving good among them, I ſhould put ſomething into their hands, which might ſtir up their pure minds by way of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.
<pb facs="tcp:46418:4"/>
I knew no more Uſeful Leſſon to recommend to them, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1.</note> than this of Right Numbring their Dayes, which may put them upon a ſerious conſideration of their dayes paſt, a due improvement of the preſent, and an Holy prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for thoſe few and evil ones that are remaining.</p>
            <p>I am alſo made in this ſmall undertaking, to have a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere reſpect to the Members of that Antient and Honourable ſociety (whereof you are now a member) formerly walking with Mr. <hi>Henry Jeſſy</hi> where for ſome time;<note place="margin">Now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care of Mr. <hi>Jam.

            <p>And now I know that you will not be troubled, that you have been the occaſion, and made way for me, that I might diſcover ſome of that true Love I have for my old Friend (and
<pb facs="tcp:46418:5"/>
Native Countrey) whoſe Souls I hope I could ſerve with laying down my own Life. But that I may not grow tedious to you, I ſhal only further tel you what I lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard of you, from the mouth of a Judicious Chriſtian, who hath many years been intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with you, both before and ſince your (ſignal) Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man with all his faults.</note> more need not be ſaid of the, beſt Saint in the World, and leſs cannot be ſaid of the weakeſt; I confeſs I was much taken with the expreſſion, and therefore mention it not only, becauſe it is inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive (having neither flattery nor reflexion in it, both which I loath) but becauſe it may be of uſe to ſome; if he had ſaid you had been an honeſt Manwithout faults, or but with a few; or if he had ſaid, that he is a Man bleſſed with rare accompliſhments, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable

            <p>IF the ſhortneſs, ſwiftneſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of time were well weighed, what a change ſhould we ſee in the World! That Men may make truer and better meaſures of it, than they have done is the honeſt deſign of this ſmall Treatiſe. I have ſometimes thought that if perſons would conſider their words before they ſpeak them, and view their Actions before they do them, and value their time before they lay it out, what examplary Chriſtians would they be found! Thou wilt find herein ſome account of that expreſſion of <hi>Job, Man that is born of a Woman is of

What good fruit ſhould we bring forth if we laid this ground, that the pleaſures of ſin, and worldly grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are but for a ſeaſon! what good ſeed would be ſown for our Eternal welfare and being in the World to come! I could tell thee of ſtrange effects, which the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the tranſitorineſs of this Life, the certainty of Death, together with the duration of Eternity, hath had upon Men, to put them upon laying up a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for time to come. I would take the liberty to recommend unto thee, one or two paſſages of a ſtory made uſe of by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Miniſter long ſince with God, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Gar.</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Leea's</hi> Author of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt.

               </note> which together with ſome other remarkable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and hints of his, which I have quoted in the following work were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to me by a good old puritan one of
<pb facs="tcp:46418:11"/>
his hearers. One ſtory relates the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of King <hi>Edwink</hi> about the year 600 together with his Kingdom, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſpecially <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> Thus a wiſe Courtier of his, when he heard of a Chriſt, that promiſeth Eternal happineſs was preached unto him, reaſoned with him: This preſent life of our's, O King, ſayes he, in regard of the uncertain time that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us and ſhall be after us, is but like the flying of a Bird here, through your entry in at one door and preſently out at another, whilſt you and your Nobles in a ſtormy bluſtering day ſit warm here about your Hall-fire; the poor bird for ſmall moment of time whilſt ſhe was in your entry felt not the cold and ſtormy weather, but that was for a very ſhort moment and preſently ſhe did but as it were dart through from ſtorm to ſtorm: ſo this preſent life of our's, is but a very ſhort thing, but a Bird's flight through your entry, what went before and what follows after we utterly know not, and therefore if this new Doctrine bring us any more certainty, and after a ſhort flight through this entry, can tell us how and where we ſhall live happy for ever: by all means let us imbrace it, this was a great motive to his converſion as alſo of his People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46418:12"/>The other paſſage is of the Son of an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperour,</hi> whom his Father, for fear he ſhould turn Christian, laboured by all means to keep from entertaining a thought of future happineſs, or of Death, or of the ſhortneſs of this Worldl's pleaſures, leſt hereby he ſhould be driven to embrace the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> that promiſeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Life, an Happineſs Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance incorruptible and undefiled and that, fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for us. The <hi>Emperour</hi> that his Son ſhould never think of any ſuch future happineſs, canſed him to be brought up in a moſt Glorious Palace, and attended there with gallant attendants, freſh and comely and youthful, and that he ſhould never ſee nor 'bear of the miſeries of this Life, as Death, old Age, Sickneſs, Poverty &amp;c. to the end that he ſhould think of nothing but the preſent happineſs; afterwards the young Man deſiring to recreate himſelf with going abroad, his Father appointed that the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhould take order that all things irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and unpleaſant ſhould be removed out of the way, and that there ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Song, and Muſick, and Dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and delightful ſights in his way; but upon a time through the negligence of his Officers, he eſpyed an old decayed writhen
<pb facs="tcp:46418:12"/>
Man ready to drop into his Grave; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being ſomewhat moved, he demanded what would become of that Miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Anſwer was returned that he ſhould ſhortly Die, and be Buried in the Earth, and what ſhall all Men Die likewiſe ſaies he, or ſome only? nay all ſay they, all muſt Die; and within how many Years? Eighty or an hundred at moſt, and when he had heard this, it would never out of his thoughts but ſtill he was mourning out theſe Words, and what ſhall Death alſo ſeize within ſuch a time upon me, ſhall I within ſuch a time bid ſarewel to all my pleaſures? why then Laughter than art mad, and Mirth what doſt thou? and why ſhould Madneſs be in my Heart whilſt I live,<note place="margin">Et me more me a-liquando corripiet.</note> and after that go to the Dead, and then to have a Living Dog to be better than I a Dead Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? and thus his troubled Heart courſed him with theſe thoughts, and would never let him reſ till Chriſtianity brought him to a lively hope of that other Happineſs: Now it were good, as this made him of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a Chriſtian, ſo our Hearts would courſe us thus to make ſame of us that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians only in ſhew to be Chriſtians in Power,<note place="margin">And the Earthy houſe of this Tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved.</note> and to be Sanctified by the Spirit of Regeneration that when we fail we may be received into Everlaſting Habitations:

The former
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46418:16"/>
is that which at preſent falls more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, under my Conſideration; having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready treated of the latter in divers Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. That I may make way to my Text, be pleaſed to take notice of our. Saviour's general Dehortation, Ver. 25. <hi>Take no thought,</hi> &amp;c. Obſerve how par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular he is, as if he deſigned to anſwer all the ſecret Objections and Surmiſings of an unbelieving heart; if I have Meat, what ſhall I do for Drink, and if I have both, how muſt I get Clothes? why ſaies he, be not careful about any of theſe, and he gives us ſeveral weighty Reaſons for what he ſayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the latter end of Ver. 25. <hi>Is not the life more than meat,</hi> &amp;c. It is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the greater to the leſs; he that has given life, will he not maintain it? It's leſs trouble and charge for him to make a Coat for thy Body, than to frame thy Body which was curiouſly wrought, rare Embroidery, curious Needlework; <note place="margin">Pſ. 139.19 acupictus ſum.</note> a skin will ſerve for the Back, and the ſleſh will ſerve for the Belly, but the placing of the Bones was not ſo eaſily done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Argument lies in Ver. 26. From God's care of the inferiour Creatures, the Animals, the Fowls of the Air, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46418:16"/>
this is an Argument from the leſſer to the greater, <hi>It's your heavenly Father that feeds them:</hi> The Maſter of the houſe will not feed his Cattel without, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Children to periſh for want of bread within; If God cares for Oxen, then much more for Saints. <hi>Are ye not much better than they?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="5">5. Inducement is, <hi>ab abſurdo,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Ver.</hi> 32. It's not ingenious, not at all becoming you to be ſo carking and caring, it is a <hi>Gentiliſh</hi> property, poor Heathens that know of no better things, may be allowed to ſeek after theſe earthly matters; but it is not ſuitable for thoſe that have been acquainted with things of an higher nature, and of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duration; it is not worthy, not Chriſtian; your Education and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation ſhould teach you better things, and ſpirit you to a more Noble and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſearch and endeavour.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Incitement is, a <hi>non-neceſſario,</hi> in the latter end of Ver. 32. <hi>For your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father knows,</hi> &amp;c.

means to ſecure a competency, and that is by <hi>ſeeking firſt of all the kingdom of God,</hi> Ver. 33. He that would make Earth ſure, muſt firſt of all make Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſure; ſhall I be taking thought what to eat and drink here, and never fear begging a drop of water hereafter? ſhall I be ſolicitous for Clothes, and do not know but my Soul and Body may lie naked in the ſcorching flames of the wrath of God to all Eternity? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I have a Promiſe of God for outward things, if I make it my buſineſs to ſeek after Heavenly; it is a very needleſs care; God provides meat for me that I may not be taken off my work to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</p>
            <p n="8">8.

Ah, my Brethren, how little is this conſidered, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more ordinary than to ſay, I little thought ſuch an one would have been gone ſo ſoon, what an healthful luſty Man was he, it was but ſuch a day I ſaw him, and I thought he never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better ſince I knew him, I thought I ſhould have died long before him; was not he at ſuch a place, at ſuch a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a few dayes ago? &amp;c. Oh Friend!. Know his Breath was in his Noſtrils; and ſo it is with thee; there may not be a ſtep between thee and Death for any thing thou knows; a lurking Diſtemper in thy Body may riſe up and pull thee by the Throat, and all thy friends ſtand about thee, and none be able to reſcue thee, and ſave thee from that deadly Hand: A ſlip, a fall, a croſs

active and diligent Enemy, who goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout night and day ſeeking whom he may devour? he ſleeps not in the night time, much leſs on the day time; he is upon thee continually either as a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or a Troubler: what a quiet World ſhould we have if it were not for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Inſtruments! what brave living will there be when they ſhall be chained up. There is no place but the Devil is there; he is conſtantly at Meetings, and is one of the firſt there, who-ever come late, he is there betimes; how ſhould this ſhame you for your late coming? what comes he for, but to diſturb and diſtract: with vain; unruly, worldly, wandring thoughts? if thou go into thy cloſet, thou canſt not ſhut him out thence for he is there before thee, and aſſoon as ever thou haſt ſhut thy Door, down he ſits with thee, and preſents thee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with one ſort of thoughts, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with another ſort; ſometimes he bids make haſte, get thee down, get thy Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters read, and thy Prayers ſaid, ſuch a buſineſs ſtayed for thee, ſuch an one is to be ſpoken with, and you muſt not fail, your Family wants you, a Cuſtomer waits, &amp;c. be but ſhout now, you may

be longer another time: God is a God of mercy, if thou be indiſpoſed now, God is a God of pity, he will paſs it by, he knows the fleſh is weak, &amp;c. Sometimes again with other thoughts, if he ſees thee ſit down to conſider in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt about thy Soul; why, Soul, what doſt thou mean to make thy; life ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable? Godlineſs is a chearful thing, thou comes into thy Cloſet, and thou thinks many a ſad thought, and weeps a great many tears, and puts up ſo many Petitions, and ſpends ſo much time, and thou art never the better; this is but to turn as a Door upon the Hinges, this life is not to be led, this is not to be endured, here comes no fruit at all; it might even be as well not to make ſo much ado, and make Religion a burden, you may do your duty to God, and pleaſe him as much with a great deal leſs trouble to your ſelf; how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably does many a good Chriſtian live that do not ſpend ſo much time alone, nor ſo many ſorrowful thoughts, and yet are careful not to neglect their Duty; put away theſe troubled thoughts, and try how it will be <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is <hi>Satan's</hi> Language, and by the way let me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve four Deceits, Fallacies and lies in

theſe few Words he has ſpoken. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a moſt falſe inſinuation as if too much time and care could be ſpent in good ſervice. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian he means, is the careleſs formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, that is much a ſtranger to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſs. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here is a means to make thy thoughts more ſad and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed than they ſhould be, that ſo he may provoke thee to throw all away, all ſeriouſneſs, all Godly Sorrow, as a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He would put this quite out of thy Mind, that the Soul that diligently waits at the foot of Chriſt Weeping and Mourning, though for a while Sorrow may rather ſeem to increaſe than abate, yet ſhall certainly at laſt meet with full aſſurance, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of comfort, peace and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; they that ſow in Tears ſhall reap in Joy. But yet a little further, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> is in the ſhop, in the Ware houſe, counting houſe; medling with buying and ſelling, egging on to lying Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, bad Wares, falſe Weights, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching, Defrauding, and preſently after to anger and diſcontent with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and it may be at laſt to murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this Trade will not do, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make both ends meet, ſo many bad

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46418:28"/>2. Daily wants cauſe daily Griefs, to want is an Evil, a Miſery, now the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind are alwaies wanting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: conſider the reſtleſneſs of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in a kind of tedious weariſomneſs ſtealing upon us in the very Reflections, the interchangeable Reflections of the Body, we muſt Sleep a while till we be Weary of that, and then we muſt Wake another while till we come to the former again; we muſt Eat a while till we be weary of that, and Faſt another while till we come to the former again; we we muſt ſtand <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whatſoever we turn to for our Eaſe, there again we find our wearying; theſe Bodies of ours are like wayward crying Children, that are no ſooner quieted with one thing but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently complaining again; ſo I muſt walk, I muſt ſit, I muſt cool, I muſt warm my ſelf again; like the Nurſes toil, dreſs and undreſs, how long the very ſame things? Again, conſider the trouble of Laborious toiling and moil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſeveral Callings and Vocations to get a little ſupply for the wants of the Body: ſince the time it was ſaid, <hi>in the ſweat of thy Brows thou ſhal Eat thy Bread,</hi> the World is become a great Correction of Work-houſe, a General Bridewel to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46418:29"/>
task us all to our Labours; the very Bread we put into our Mouths, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cloaths we put upon our Backs, the very Houſes we put our Heads into, what are they but evident Arguments of Mans great labour and pains? As for the Houſe, conſider what a deal of labour muſt needs come between the Timber ſtanding uncut in the Mountains, and the Stones unhewn in the Quarry, and the making of them now in the form of a fit Houſe to dwell in; as for thy Cloaths thou putteſt on, conſider but all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that comes between the Sheeps wearing them on their Backs, and thy wearing them on thine; As for the Bread alſo which thou putteſt into thy Mouth, conſider (beſides the Plowing up the Ground) the great labour that comes between the Seed-Mans hand caſting it into the Ground, and thy Hand putting it into thy Mouth; conſider well but theſe, and then thou wilt acknowledge many great labours every Day. I might add likewiſe the great Trouble that comes in regard of Sores, and Sickneſſes and Infirmities; they know well what this trouble means, that tell the Clock whilſt others ſleep, that have weariſome Dayes and Nights appointed for them,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46418:29"/>
that are ſeldom free from Pains and Weakneſs and griefs as much as they can well bear. Conſider alſo the manifold troubles of the Mind by reaſon of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments and diſcontents from Friends, from Enemies, from Children, from Servants <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will you now ſay that our daily wants and troubles that flow from thence are not ſufficient to fill eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day with as much Affliction as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it can hold?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Daily fears bring daily perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; have you a Day without its fears, fears about the ſtate of your Souls, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Faith be right, your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unfeigned, your Duties accepted, your Works wrought in God? whether you have ſavingly cloſed with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> upon Goſpel-terms? whether you have brought all to him, and take all from him? whether you are truly Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, and can groundedly ſay, <hi>my Beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> I hare every falſe way, I have reſpect to all God's Commandments, ſo far as I am acquainted with his will? Again, fears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout holding out, my Corruptions are ſtrong, my temptations are preſſing, I ſhal one Day fall by the Hands of my ſtrong Luſts and unruly Affections; if Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46418:30"/>
ſhould come I ſhould do as <hi>Peter</hi> did, I ſhould want Courage, I ſhould diſhonour God, I know not how to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Impriſonment or be a <hi>Martyr</hi> for the Goſpel and Waies of Chriſt: Again Fears of Death, which keep ſome in Bondage all their dayes, every day they do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe; what ſhall I do when I come to Dye? I cannot think of it but with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, I cannot look that King of Terrours in the Face, I neither know how to part with my Comforts, nor yet how to endure the Pains and Pangs of Death, and leaſt of all to meet with God, who I have caufe to Fear is not at peace with me; and then what will become of me to fall into the Hands of a Living God who is a Conſuming Fire? Again, fear of outward Want; how the World will hold out? how I ſhall maintain my Family and bring up my Children; ſuch Fears as theſe are daily companions to ſome: though by the way let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that fear Want, that they want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as Faith; a little more Truſting God, and a little leſs ſinful; foreſight and needleſs care would do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well: Now tell me whether all theſe Fears and a great many ſuch like, be not enough to ſpoil the comfort of our Day.</p>

                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:46418:30"/>4. Daily defects and diſappointments procure daily Miſery and Vexation. The ſhortneſs that is in every Creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and which the Soul cannot but be every day ſenſible of, muſt needs cauſe Trouble; I thought to have had ſuch an eaſy ſeat, and the ſtool breaks under me, I promiſed my ſelf ſo much comfort in this Child, How are my hopes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation fruſtrated! I reckon'd that this deſign would have proſpered and have done my Work, and I ſee it has failed me; I ſee theſe Worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are but dreamiſh things, they are but ſhadows, they can feed the hunger of the Soul, but they cannot feed the hungry Soul; I have been Labouring for the Wind, I never plcaſed my ſelf in any thing, but to be ſure I met with a Croſs in it: theſe outward enjoyments promiſe more than they can perform; I never leaned upon them, but they deceived me, I never truſted them but they fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, Riches, and Friends, and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations make themſelves Wings and they flee away; I was at the merry meeting but ſome things were wanting, and ſome paſſages did not pleaſe me: and thus you have the proof of the Doctrine, I now come to give you the Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

The Lord does it for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Sin; daily Sins muſt have dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chaſtiſements, there is a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between Sin and Puniſhment, as between ſowing and reaping, we are fowing and reaping every day. It is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your obſervation, that ſome kind of grain comes up ſooner a great deal than others; but the Husband-man does ſo order his ſowing, that commonly he reaps all together: ſome ſins that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, are not puniſhed till a great while after, again ſome ſins are reckoned for immediately upon the Commiſſion; ſome ſad ſinful ſeed comes up quickly, ſown in the morning &amp; reaped the ſame day, ſome not till a Week or a Month, or a Year, or many years after: but it is ſo ordered that there is reaping work for every day; I may be reaping this week what I ſowed the laſt, and ſowing this week for the next; I may this year be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46418:31"/>
teaping what I ſowed laſt, Or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ago, as <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Brethren did their cruelty to their Brother; I may in old Age be reaping the Sins of my Youth; <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me and makes me poſſeſs the Sins of my Youth</hi> ſaith <hi>Job.</hi> The Fathers ſow for the Children,<note place="margin">

When I meet with any remarkable Affliction more bitter than ordinary, then ſhould I be thinking with my ſelf, what ſeed was this of, what is the name of the ſeed that this Fruit came from, what is the name of the Apple, it is a very ſowre one, it wrings me by the Bowels and cauſes me to make Faces, and groan and cry out; What is the Sins name? what do you call that Iniquity of mine that has laid me under this great diſtreſs? is not the name of it Self-Love, Back-ſliding, falling from the Fear of God, decay of love to God, unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablneſs under the means; I have heard that ſuch kind of ſeed does uſe to bring forth Friut with ſuch a taſte or may not

the Name of it be Love of the World Covetouſnes, or may it not be Idolatry have not I ſet up ſomething or other in my Affections and eſteem above God have not I made an Idol of ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? for I hava read that God is very jealous of his Glory, and cannot endure that any thing ſhould be in the throne of the Heart equal to him, much leſs above him; and upon this account I have know a him ſometime Kill a Child in the Mothers boſom a Wife in the Husbands boſom, an Husband in the Wifes boſom to the amazement and aſtoniſhment and even overwhelming of the ſurvivor; and all this becauſe he was robbed of that love he ought to have had, and he will not give his Glory to another: if the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have been the Idol, the Dead ſhall he thy puniſhment. Thoſe that have truſted in their Wealth and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their Riches, that have pleaſed and prided themſelves in them, he has all on a ſudden ſent his Serjeants and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treined and recovered all from them, by Fire or Water, or Thieves, or that little moth his ſecret curſe and blaſting; thoſe that have lived careleſly and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly he has brought them to Pinching &amp; Peverty; ſome the Lord paies with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

The Lord fills our dayes with trouble for Diſcipline and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Grace; if the Sea was not rough, Grace would be becalmed, there would be no motion; Faith, Hope, Self-denial Mortification, &amp;c. cannot live but in hard and rough, and ſtormy Weather; the more tempeltuous the Sea is, the better Faith works; Faith has but little em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, where there is much enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: No Grace honours God ſo much as Faith doth, and the exerciſe of it; and nothing gives Faith that exerciſe as trouble doth. The Ships are ſafeſt in the Harbour, and the Seamen quiet and out of danger in their Beds at home; But there is nothing to be gotten, and they may ſtarve at, home, unleſs they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forth to Sea: How canſt thou truſt God when thy Cupboard is full, thy Barns and Garners full? it's true, thou mayeſt and ought to exerciſe Faith then in acknowledging God, and depending upon the goodneſs and bleſſing of God in the enjoyment of them, and uſing them in his fear; but the exerciſe of Faith is much more difficult, and much leſs viſible in ſuch a condition: Faith that is ſeen, is not Faith; till the Stream be dryed up, thou canſt not ſo well take

it's worth ſitting by ſuch a Man to hear him diſcourſe of his travels, how he paſſed from one Region to another, from one condition to another, how loth he was to enter into it, with, what amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was received into it, with what difficulty, diſtreſs and anxiety of Spirit he paſſed on under it, how many times he had almoſt fainted, how wonderfully good and kind the Lord was to him, how ſeaſonably ſupports and ſupplies came in once and again, what ebbings and flowings he paſſed through; how when he vehemently cried out, <hi>ſave me Maſter I periſh,</hi> preſently the Lord Jeſus appeared and ſaid, <hi>be not afraid, it is I;</hi> this diſpenſation has Love in it, it is for thy good, it wil not hurt thee, be not ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, not an hair of thy Head ſhall periſh by thy affliction, thou ſhall loſe nothing but what would, have done thee harm to have kept; how afterwards the Lord quieted, compoſed and ſatisfied his Soul, made him ſee how much need there was of ſuch a ſevere Providence, ſuch a ſharp Paſſage, ſuch a bitter Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; as alſo how much Love and Goodneſs there was in it, which at firſt ſight carried ſo much of the Face of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, diſturbance and deſtruction; ſo

               <p>Are there not many that will ſay, that had they but ſo much, they would be content, ay that would they with all their heart, and never deſire more; does not this contradict your Doctrine, and that which you are deſigning to prove all this while; that he that lives upon Earth in any part of it, or in any condition in it, muſt expect trouble every day, all their life time and enough of it?</p>

So theſe unexpected Winds riſe as often by Land as by Sea, the wind of Affection, of too much Love and deſire towards the World and joy in it; and carries Men a way into the wide World God knows whither.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This that they ſay, that if they had ſo much they would be content, fully content and not deſire a whit more; this is only out of a ground of unlikely-hood that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they ſhould come to more, or ſcarce to that, and not as though that ſame would abſolutely ſatisfy and content them; as ſickly Men, or old Men, that in likely-hood cannot live long, will ſay

perhaps, that were they certain to live but ſo many years, they would never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live longer, not as though ſimply that would ſatisfy them (for every man naturally hath an infinite deſire to live for ever) but becauſe conſidering their preſent ſtate in all likely-hood they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go beyond, or ſcarce attain unto that period of time; and therefore they ſay that were they but certain to live ſo long they would even deſire no more; but reſtore to the ſickly Man his perfect health again, and to the old man his former youth; and try my parties then if ſo few years will content them, if they will be ſo moderate in their deſires: juſt thus many men, becauſe in al likely-hood they can never attain to greater matters, and ſcarcely to thoſe they inſtance in, therefore they ſeem to have moderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and ſuch, and ſuch things will content them; but give them all the opportunities and means that others have, and then ſee if their deſires be not the like: there are many would climb higher, if they had but a ladder, and he that laid 38 years at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> if he had had any to help him in, he would not have laid there any longer than the others.</p>

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:46418:44"/>I ſhall endeavour to open the point and then apply it: for the opening of it, I ſhall enquire into the import of the phraſe of numbring Dayes, or what is implied in this expreſſion of numbring our Dayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This, that our Dayes are numbred does denote the ſhortneſs of them; <note place="margin">pauperis eſt numer are pecus.</note> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot be numbred, what ever is in God is incomprehenſible and innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the Dayes of God are not to be numbred. We ſay he is a Poor man that can number his Flock, that can tell how many ſheep and cattel he has, the Dayes of a Man are ſoon told they are quickly reckoned up, he that hath but a little skill in <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> may caſt up the number, he that is but newly entered into the Table of Numeration may count them, if he know Units and Tens he may do it, he need not go as far as hundreds. <hi>David</hi> tells us how the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count went in his Dayes, and ſince his time, the number is not increaſed, Sin has rather ſhortened them, and cut them off. <hi>The Dayes of our Years are threeſcore years and ten,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſa.</hi> 9.10</note> 
                  <hi>and if by reaſon of ſtrength they be fourſcore years, yet is their ſtrength labour and ſorrow, for it is ſoon cut off, and we ſtee away.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:46418:45"/>2. It holds forth the fixedneſs of the bounds of them: the time of their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſet and fixed, and there is no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing beyond thoſe bounds which the Lord hath made; there is no altering, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of them, God is exact to his numbers, he will not upon any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration revoke his decree and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this kind; <hi>Seeing his daies are determined,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 13.5.</note> 
                  <hi>the number of his Moneths are with thee,</hi> (purely in thy power) <hi>thou haſt appointed his bounds that he cannot paſs.</hi> The time of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity was out in the Night, and though in 430 years, as we uſe to ſay, a Day would break no ſquare, much leſs a piece of a Night; yet, that the Lord might be exact to his own prefixed time, he will be at the charge to light them out rather than ſtay till the morning. So <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was ſlain in the night, becauſe, as ſome think, then the Captivity was out. If a man could give all the World, he could not purchaſe one hour beyond his appointed time; Death's not to be delayed, it will not be bribed, it wil fetch a Man out of his bed at Midnight, and not ſtay till Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will ſeize upon a Man, when he is abroad, and not ſuffer him to go home,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46418:45"/>
and take his leave of his Family, and ſet his Houſe in order; it will not give a Man time to make his Will, nor to ſpeak a few words which might prevent abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of trouble, and Law-ſuits that fall out about the diviſion of his Eſtate; where-ever thou art, what ever thou art doing, when the minutes of thy Life are expired, Death ſtrikes thee, and there is no avoiding it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſets forth the tranſitorineſs, the ſlipperineſs, the ſwiftneſs of our Daies. How does the Scripture labour for ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to ſet this forth! certainly to know and believe this is of very great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to our Faith, or elſe the Spirit of God, would never gather ſo many illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations from ſenſe; it would be worth while to gather them up, and open them, but they are frequently done by others, and ly ſo obvious to your ſearch, that I need not ſpend ſo much time about it; only give me leave, ſeeing it is a buſineſs of ſo great conſequence, and ſo very little minded, to deal a little plainly and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically with you. Alas, alas, where is that Profeſſor, that ſits down and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly thinks with himſelf, how ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his time paſſes away? who knows not that time is ſhort, and paſſes ſwiftly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46418:46"/>
away it is a theme for School-Boyes; ay but let me tell you, few conſider it, or live under the power of it; it is a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation fit for the beſt Saint upon Earth, and without diſpute to live in the right belief of it, would be an eſpecial and principal means to recover the power of Godlineſs which is ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in this laſt age.</p>
               <p>Do you think that Profeſſors could be ſo Formal, and Secure, and Worldly, if they lived every day as their laſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed every Duty as their laſt? would there not be more Zeal, and Life, and Love, and Heavenly-mindedneſs? Do you believe that we ſpend <hi>our years as a Tale that is told,</hi> as a Word, as a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>ſwifter than a Weavers Shuttle; That our life is as wind, and vaniſheth away as the Cloud: That our dayes are ſwifter than a Poſte,</hi> You know how ſwift a Poſte is, he paſſes by ſo faſt, you can take no notice of him, you get but a glimpſe of him, you could not know him again if you ſaw him; <hi>ſo do our dayes poſt away,</hi> how are we hurried in haſte, haſte, poſt-haſte from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! poſte to Bed at night, put off your Clothes, poſt-haſt, poſte up in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and put them on again; pſt to your
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46418:46"/>
Meals, and poſt from them again; poſt to your buſineſs, and poſt from it; how do Sabbaths; and Sermons, and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities poſt by, and that in ſuch haſt, that you cannot remember them when they are gone! it may be in twenty four hours you have forgot all. How many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that you have heard have lived a moneth with you? What was the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of God to you this day moneth? the Matter as it was paſſing by did much affect you, you were much taken with it, and thought you ſhould have known, and remembred that matter as long as you had lived; but it ſeems it went by in ſuch haſte, the time of the Meeting paſſed away ſo ſwiftly, that it has happened to you, <hi>as to a man that looks his natural Face in a Glaſs, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.24</note> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth himſelf, and goes away, and ſtraight way forgets what manner of man he was;</hi> ſo you have forgotten what manner of matter it was that you heard, that you were ſo affected with, and melted under, that your Soul did ſo fully cloſe with, &amp; you could ſo evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſs to the truth of it; how lively, it was repreſented to you, how experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally you did receive it, what good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you taſted in it and thought that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46418:47"/>
taſte would have never gone out of your mouth; now no impreſſion remaining, the Text and every word of the Sermon ſo poſted away, ſo far gone that they cannot be recalled or recovered. If a Painter would take the Picture of a Man, the Man muſt ſit in a ſteady poſture, but our Comforts periſh in the uſing, they are not ſitting Comforts; we are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, crowded, that we get little of the company and enjoyment of them <hi>Solomon</hi> had a mind to have the comfort of Wine, and he got it alone, for he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>his heart with Wiſdom,</hi> and was freed from thoſe exceſſes, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, and diſturbances which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly keep company with the drinkers of Wine, but he concludes that <hi>all was vanity and vexation of Spirit, and there was no profit under the Sun.</hi> A man can have no time to ſit with his comfort and enjoy them, but he is either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or the comfort is gone. But to leave this Similitude, he ſayes, <hi>his dayes are ſwifter than a Poſt:</hi> It is well obſerved by Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> that a Poſte ſtaies to change Horſes, but the Chariot of the Sun, which is the natural meaſure of time, never ſtaies, but is in continual motion: I might add this alſo, that the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46418:47"/>
Artificial Meaſures of Time, which are continued by men, are in continual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Sands in the Hour-glaſs are always running, or elſe it is of no uſe; the Wheels in the Clock and Watch are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes moving, or elſe they are of no uſe at all; if the Watch be down, it is good for nothing, for it's only uſe lies in motion. You may ſee this Similitude of a Poſt excellently laid open by Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryl</hi> upon the place, as alſo thoſe two more which they find in <hi>Job</hi> 9.26. <hi>My dayes are paſſed away as the ſwift ships, &amp; as the Eagle that haſteth to the prey.</hi> Ships upon the Sea under ſail before the Wind paſs away very ſwiftly, and leave no impreſſion: The Eagle is a Bird of the ſtrongeſt Wing, the ſwifteſt Fowl, and a greedy Fowl; ſhe ſoares aloſt, and is quick-ſighted, and ſoares down upon her Prey, as a Thunderbolt, as a Bullet, as an Arrow, and ſhe leaves no impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion in the Air. Now, ſaies <hi>Job, My dayes are paſſed away as the Eagle that haſteth to the Prey.</hi> I ſhall forbear the Proſecution of other Similitudes; our <hi>dayes are compared to Smoke, to a Dream, to a Shepherds Tent, to a Vapour, to a Shadow, to a Flower, &amp;c.</hi> the aptneſs of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46418:48"/>
which Similitude I leave to your own conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This, that our dayes are numbered does likewiſe imply thus much, <hi>that our work is numbred to our day, our work is cut out for the day;</hi> God makes no emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes, as every day has its trouble, ſo every day has its work. <hi>To every thing there it a Seaſon,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and a time for every purpoſe under the Sun;</hi> and it is as true, that there is a purpoſe for every Seaſon, as well as a Seaſon for every purpoſe; and happy is that man that knows his Seaſon for his purpoſe, and his purpoſe for his ſeaſon, that knows his day for his work, and his work for his day, and does his dayes work upon his day; when our work is finiſhed, then our dayes ſhall be ended: But alas for wicked men, their dayes <hi>end before they begin their work;</hi> they do work that God never allotted, or allowed any time for: <hi>There is a time to build, and a time to plant, and a time to morn, &amp;c.</hi> but there is no time to ſin. Some know their work yet do not do it, and <hi>theſe will be beater with many ſtripes:</hi> The great Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-houſe of Hell is prepared for thoſe that would not work whil'ſt they had
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46418:48"/>
day, and time, and light, and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and aſſiſtance, and whatever might have an influence upon the promoting of their work; Be ſure thou examine the work thou art about, and ask thy ſelf ſtrictly theſe two Queſtions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is this work for any time, is it to be done at all?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is this work proper for this time; does the work and the time correſpond and ſuit one another? it may be ſinful thoughts ariſe when thou art at Duty, let them know there is no time allotted for them, much leſs at ſuch a time; it may be worldly thoughts come in about thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and calling, let them know there is a time for them, but they muſt keep their place and due diſtance at ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; perhaps ſome good thoughts may come in, which yet are not ſuitable to the work which thou art engaged in, tell them, they ſhall be encouraged in their proper time; God is a God of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and not of confuſion and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>there is a time to Read, a time to Hear, a time to Meditate, a time to Pray, a time to confer about good things,</hi> and theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties help one another in their place and order. But it is not unuſual for him that ſometimes transforms himſelf into an
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46418:49"/>
                  <hi>Angel</hi> of light to inject even good things in an unſeaſonable manner which tend only to diſtraction, and not to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and promoting Communion with Gods and he is a Wiſe Chriſtian that knows how to manage himſelf, that there may be no interfering of duties. I cannot but break out and tell you, how hard a thing it is to be a right Chriſtian, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itian indeed, even-ſquared according to Goſpel-rule and proportion. The miſery of Man is great upon him, becauſe he knows not his work and his time; the Devil takes, great advantage of poor Chriſtians that have ſtrong affections and but weak judgments, and does ſo bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them and caſt ſuch miſts in their way, even upon this very account that we are ſpeaking of, that I begin not to wonder at the many complaints I daily hear from Chriſtians of unbelief, unprofitableneſs under ordinances and the means of grace diſcontentedneſs &amp; falling out with their conditions; they are much unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their proper, work in its proper ſeaſon; <hi>Satan</hi> is a Spirit of diſorder and confuſion, and he knows how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the belt duty thou doeſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex the moſt regular exerciſe of thy Graces: the only way thou haſt to help
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46418:49"/>
thy ſely is ſeriouſly to conſider, whether this and the other notion and ſuggeſtion comes from God; is this according to rule, does the Goſpel bid me think this, and ſpeak this, and do this; to the Law and to the teſtimony. Let me take my Bible into my hand, and ſee whether I can find a fixed, a ſtated rule for ſuch i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, for ſuch perplexities, for ſuch becalmings, for ſuch expreſſions and actions; what faith the Scripture; and how readeſt thou; my Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour anſwered the Devil ſtill, <hi>with a Scriptum eſt,</hi>

Doſt not thou add nor diminiſh? Does the Lord indeed require and call for this thing at my Hands? is it any part of that work that he has appointed for me in my Day, that I ſhould at any time diſtruſt him, or look upon his care as inſufficient either for my Soul or Body? are not the alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient merits of the Lord Jeſus tendered to me without any exception, but what I make within my ſelf? Does not he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me to believe, and is not this my proper work that I ſhoud be found la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46418:50"/>
in? is there one in the Book of God that does incourage me to queſtion either his ability or willingneſs to ſave me? it is the work of <hi>Satan</hi> to make obſtructions in a Man's own ſelf, and then to lay them at God's door; but is it any part of my work to believe him of regard him? it is thy every dayes work to believe with all thy Heart; and if thou canſt ſay, that thou art willing to give up thy ſelf to the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> be ſaved and ſanctified by him, to be pardoned and purged by him, to bring nothing to him, to keep nothing from him, to deny thy ſinful ſelf, thy righteous ſelf, and (if he call for it) thy natural ſelf; thou mayeſt conclude thou art in thy proper work which is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for every ſeaſon, and that thou art obſerving the order of God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment the Lord Jeſus; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job.</hi> 6.29.</note> for, <hi>This is the work of God, ſaith our Lord, that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> And what ever it is that does obſtruct and hinder this work, comes from <hi>Satan</hi> and not from God; it is a work that was never numbred out by God for thee to do for it is according to his mind and pleaſure, that every one ſhould ſay as his Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>the Life that I live it is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46418:50"/>
by Faith in the Son of God;</hi> and the work that I do, is to be alwaies exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing and putting forth Acts of Faith upon the <hi>Lord Jeſus.</hi> And as for the concerns of my Body, is it any part of my work or duty, according to Goſpel-rule, to be carking, and caring, and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf, how I ſhall maintain that; what I ſhould Eat and Drink, and wherewithal I ſhould be Cloathed? has not he engaged his Providence for me? is not his expreſs word, and is it not my proper work to believe it? be content with ſuch things as ye have. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5</note> 
                  <hi>For be hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Hath he given me a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and will not he give me a ſtaff to walk to that Kingdom? as I have heard it well obſerved by a worthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, will he give me Heaven, and will not give me Earth? will he give me an inheritance and will he not give me ſpending money? can I truſt him for my Soul, and can I not truſt him for my poor frail Body? Is not food and ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within the Covernant as well as life and Salvation? Did he ever put me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch work as this, as to get my own Breads, and leave me to my own Hands. Its true, as he has told me, <hi>that in the ſweat
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46418:51"/>
of my Brows I muſt eat my Bread;</hi> but he never ſaid I ſhould do it in the care and trouble, and grief of my Heart, I muſt work indeed, but the care of me lies with him, he is bound to maintain me, it is not my labour, but his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that muſt do it.</p>
               <p>I am but a journy-man, the work is not mine but his; I muſt be at his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he has: ſet me my <hi>dimenſum,</hi> my task; and it is purely in his diſpoſal how I muſt be maintained, what he will give me of theſe outward things, whether much or little: he knows beſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; what I can bear, what may be convenient for my paſſage; what may be helping and not clogging in my journey to Heaven, and if I have but little of the preſent World; I muſt not call it Poverty, but Diſcipline. I conclude therefore, it was never intended by the Lord to be any part of my work, or to take up any part of my time, to ſret and perplex my ſelf, how I ſhould have proviſions to carry me or my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily through the wilderneſs of this World. But to proceed, this very thing of not numbring the work to the day, and ſo anſwering the deſign of God in giving the day, is that which proves fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46418:51"/>
to Perſons and People, and becomes their utter ruine.</p>
               <p>How does our Saviour weep over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and breaks out into theſe mournful expreſſions. <hi>Sayings, If thou hadſt known even thou at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes.

Doſt thou ask what have they done? It, is for ſomething they did not do when they had an opportunity on purpoſe given for doing of it. <hi>Becauſe thou kneweſt not the time of thy viſitation.</hi> God gave them his Ordinances, the means of Grace, he waited a great while upon them, to ſee whether they would profit under them, and prove an holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed People; but they not minding the Lord's end in being at ſuch charge

I have one Scripture more which I have promiſed you, and that is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.5. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to Repentance?

I have ſometimes thought that if the People of God had been more in condemning
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46418:60"/>
themſelves, they would not have been ſo much condemned by the World; let us ſay as the Church of old, <hi>As for our tranſgreſſions we know them.</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what I have met with in a learned Author, who writing freely of the faults and miſcarriages of Miniſters, comes to anſwer an Objection which Miniſters, comes to might make againſt his publiſhing their failings to the World, who were ſo ready to be offended with them, and to ſtumble at every thing; or if he would have diſcovered them, he might have writ in Latine, and ſo they might have been concealed from vulgar notice; he anſwers to this purpoſe, ſaies he, <hi>if we had ſinned in Latine, then our Sins might have been reproved in Latine;</hi> but ſeeing our failings have been obvious, let out acknowledgements, Confeſſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentace be ſo too; it is no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or leſſening to any Man that is guilty, to make confeſſion, but an effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual way to remove Reproach and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and to ſilence accuſers: accuſations have little place either with God or Man, where perſons are willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves; though there are ſome that are come to that height of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in this Age, which is ſo fruitful
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46418:60"/>
of Monſters; that take occaſion from the confeſſions of ſin which God's People make to him, to charge them, as it were out of their own Mouths as the vileſt Creatures on Earth; to draw out an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt them out of their own Confeſſions; a Bill of inditement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, from what they do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of themſelves: but theſe Men are little acquainted with the Scriptures, and the Myſtery of Godlineſs. The Lord tells us that his waies are not as our waies, nor his thoughts as our thoughts. <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin ſhall find Mercy;</hi> by God's own appointment confeſſion is clearing. Indeed I grant that among Men, confeſſion of the party is evidence in Law; but in the Court of God, at his Tribunal, confeſſion of the party takes away evidence: there is no more danger of our confeſſion of our ſins to God, in the World's hearing, than of doing it; in private in <hi>Satan's</hi> hearing. Its againſt all reaſon to charge a Man that is charging himſelf; if you would take a way ſins teſtimony, joyn teſtimony with it; among the Latines two Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives make an affirmative, but among the Greek's, two affirmatives make a Negative; if the World accuſe us, let
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46418:61"/>
us accuſe our ſelves too, and this is the way to be cleared; a Chriſtian is never ſo much in his Glory, as when he is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying God, and condemning himſelf. It will ſilence the railing <hi>Raſhakehs</hi> of this Age, for profeſſors to charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deeply and particularly before God; we have ſinned, we have done fooliſhly, we have broken thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, we have ſinfully complied, we have been too much partakers with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of their wickedneſs, we have been unprofitable, careleſs, worldly, covetous, greedy after the World; with our tongues have we diſhonoured God, and our Converſations have been ſuch as have but given too much occaſion to the Wicked to blaſpheme; we have given them juſt cauſe to open their mouths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Religion for our ſakes, we have not diſcovered that humility, meekneſs, impaſſionateneſs, weanedneſs from the world, mortification of fleſhy luſts, that might have been attractive and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring of others to a good likeing of the profeſſing of the Goſpel and Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; we have been ſeeking our ſelves, and ſetting up our ſelves, when we ſhould have been ſeeking and ſetting up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Lord Jeſus; we have practiſed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46418:61"/>
that in our ſelves which we have condemned in others; and never any People had more pretious opportunities and improved them leſs; we have put Death far from us, and lived as if this world would never have an end, and as if the World to come would never have a Beginning <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for others to lay theſe things to our charge, makes us odious and ugly; But for us to charge our ſelves will make us look lovely and Beautiful: there is a vaſt difference between others ſpeaking of us, and our own ſpeaking of our ſelves though the words be the very ſame. The ſtory of <hi>Jonah</hi> if another had writ it, would have made <hi>Jonah</hi> appear very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but as he writes it himſelf, it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dershim a true penicent: let us lament our not doing our work in our day, our not minding our work and ſeaſon and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them meet; what a deal of work might we have done more than we have, if we had forted, and counted, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred our work aright! we have been confounded as the Builders of <hi>Babel.</hi> We have done much that needed not have been done; and we have been doing of one thing when we ſhould have been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another; we have been repenting when we ſhould have been believing,

and believing when we ſhould have been repenting; we have been caring when we ſhould have been truſting; we have been weeping, when we ſhould have been rejoicing, and rejoicing when we ſhould have been mourning, we have been doing and undoing; and as a Man that has loſt his way, travels hard, but is no nearer his journeys end, may it may be comes to the place, whence he firſt ſet forth.

               <p>I might give you the Reaſons of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46418:85"/>
point, from the commonneſſs of them, few conſidering ſeriouſly, what is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and plain; from Man's curioſity, ſtill willing to find out ſome new thing; and from <hi>Satan's</hi> ſubtilty, who knows by experience, that there is no ſuch Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing as by the high way ſide; the great road, the known path: he Will let men alone in by-wayes, and more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate paths, in Truths of leſſer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and influence; but dees the great ſpoil in known confeſſed practical Truths and Doctrines. But I haſten to what remains, it may be the Lord may ſtir up ſome more able Pen, to ſhew the profeſſing World their great errours and miſtakes herein, that the Spirits of the power of Godlineſſ, which have been long uhder decay, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and the great arteties filled with good Blood; that the Truths, and the things of God may have their due conſideration and obſervation by the pretenders to them according to their nature, worth, weight, neceſſity and excellency of them. There are two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations behind, in the proſecutioh of which I ſhall be a little more large.</p>

               <p>The third Obſervation is this, That the right Art and Skill of numbring Dayes, is a point of Divine teaching: one have the wiſdom to number their Dayes aright but thoſe that have it from above, and are taught it by God; you muſt go to God and beg of him, that he would teach you this leſſon. This appears from the Text, that we have it expreſſed in the form of Prayer; as if he had ſaid, though I have caſt up the acount of my dayes in the 10th verſe, yet there is a further Myſtery, which I cannot diſcern without thy teaching, without that Spiritual light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which muſt come from thee; and here you have the Emphaſis of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle (10:) I have been taught this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon many a time, and can ſay it over; but I have not been ſo taught as they ſaid of Chriſt that never man ſpoke like him, ſo never any Man taught as God teaches; I have often conſidered the 14. <hi>Acts comp.</hi> v. 1. with 27. Where it is ſaid, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas ſo ſpake, that a great multitude of the</hi> Jews <hi>and alſo of the Greeks Believed. But when
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46418:86"/>
they came to give an account to the</hi> Church, the Text ſaies; <hi>that they rehearſed all that</hi> (God) <hi>had done with them, and how</hi> (he) <hi>had opened a door of Faith unto the Gentiles.</hi> If the Lord had not opened the door of the Heart, all their knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would have ſignified nothing, if the Lord had not ſpoke with them, all their ſo ſpeaking would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured belief from our Souls; it was God that ſo ſpake with them that made the door of the Heart to open.</p>
               <p>If the Lord Jeſus had only cryed, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus come forth,</hi> and had not by a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Hand communicated Life to him, he had never ſtirred out of his Grave. We read in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.27. That the Lord Jeſus beginning at <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all thePro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, he expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelf; but obſerve is ſaid in <hi>ver.</hi> 45. <hi>then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened he their underſtanding that they might underſtand the Scriptures:</hi> It is not enough, to, have the Scriptures opened, but we muſt have our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings opened too; If you had the knowledge, of an angel, and could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Divine Truth with undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Evidence and Demonſtration, yet this will not amount to right Teaching,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46418:86"/>
without Divine Bleſſing and Influence. I need not inſiſt much upon the proof of this, take that Text, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.4. <hi>Lord make me to know mine end, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of my dayes, what it is; that I may know how frail Iam.</hi> When once he is taught this by God, then he can ſay with ſenſe and experience, as it follows, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thou haſt made my dayes as an hand-breadth, mine age is as nothing before thee, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>V.</hi> 5, 6, 7.</note> verily every man at his beſt eſtate is vanity,</hi> Selah. <hi>Surely every man walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a vain ſhew, ſurely they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted in vain, he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who ſhall gather them: And now Lord, what wait I for, my hope is in thee, deliver me from all my tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp;c. You ſee that when he is taught this Leſſon of God, how feelingly, and ſweetly he breaks out; its only Faith and the Teachings of God that can give us to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> be under the power of things of Senſe: as by Faith we underſtand that the World's were made, ſo by Faith we muſt be taught that our time is ſhort, that our dayes are numbred, that we muſt dye: though we ſee perſons daily carried to the Grave, that never reached our years, and we know we are made of the ſame Corruptible Materials, ſubject to the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46418:87"/>
ſame Diſeaſes and Diſtempers, to the ſame Caſualties and Dangers, that our Breath, is in our Noſtrils, and may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon be ſtopped as theirs.</p>
               <p>Again, The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> when he comes in ſo with his But, <hi>But this Iſay, brethren, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29</note> the time is ſhort;</hi> ſhews plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it was a Point that was not ſo well underſtood; I ſhall endeavour to Demonſtrate this further to you in theſe following Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. None can know the uſe of time without Divine Teaching; and none can number his dayes aright, unleſs he know what uſe they are for: this has been already ſpoken to; I ſhall only add this, that as it is with a Merchant who Prepares his Ship for Sea, he provides only ſo much Victuals as may ſerve for the Voyage, he does not provide the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoft Beds to lodge in, but only makes ſuch preparation as may ſerve the end of his ſending his Ship to Sea, the leſs burden ſhe has, the ſwiſter ſhe ſails, and the ſwiſter ſhe ſails, the leſs ſhe will need: Juſt ſo it is in this Caſe; We are ſailing through this World, our Port is Eternity, our buſineſs is only to provide our ſelves for quick ſailing, and lay in ſo much Proviſion only as will ſerve us
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46418:87"/>
for ſo many dayes Voyage as we ſhall be out: the leſs Cumber of the World we have, the ſooner we ſhall be ſit for Heaven; and the faſter we move thither, the leſs we ſhall need.</p>
               <p n="2">2. None can know the end of time, (<hi>ſc.</hi> that it will end) but by Divine Teaching: And none can number his dayes aright, that does not know their end. What made <hi>David</hi> pray, as you have heard, <hi>Lord, make me to know mine end,</hi> &amp;c. Every one thinks he may live a day longer.

                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.19.</note> never knew how to number his dayes aright. Let us a little conſider the excellency of time. We read in the Old Law, that if one man ſmote another, he ſhould not only pay for his Cure, but for the loſs of his time: But more particularly;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Dayes and times are ſuch things as cannot be bought; did you yet ever know any dayes to be ſold, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what a day might be worth if it were to be ſold; we count thoſe things rare and excellent, that though ſome Men have them, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 3.21.</note> yet there are none of them to be got for Money. Let me therefore make much of my day; for if I loſe it, there is not one to be had if I would give all the World for it; a Man need not deſire more wealth than would by ſome be given him for one day if he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46418:88"/>
had it to ſell. This puts me in mind of a paſſage concerning a worthy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Lady which I do well remember; <note place="margin">The Lady <hi>Barwick</hi> of <hi>Toulſton</hi> in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> to whom I had the happineſs to be <hi>Chaplain</hi> for ſeveral Years, and muſt ever own my ſelf to bemuch obliged, and no leſs to the Right Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Lord <hi>Henry Fairtax</hi> her Son in Law, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Faithful friend in my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Chriſt.</note> ſhe had for ſeveral years been exerciſed with a ſore diſtemper of ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of breathing, and did for a great while long to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and to be with Chriſt, which ſhe did from that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Love to her Soul, which the Lord had been pleaſed graciouſly to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. A Perſon coming to the Gate that had ſeveral Wares to ſell, deſired that the Lady might have notice of it; ſhe very gravely and ſeriouſly asked if he had any Graves to ſell; for faith, ſhe, I know nothing I want in this World ſo much as a Grave, and I have been long ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for one, but cannot yet get it.</p>
               <p>It is true, Graves are dear Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities at ſome times, as <hi>Job</hi> tells us plainly, <hi>There are ſome that long for death, but it cometh not,</hi>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46418:89"/>
and will be found at laſt, but a day can not be purchaſed: Thus time cannot be bought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the ſingleneſs and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, for thoſe that have it; Pearls are called <hi>

It is but the preſent time we have, and that is ſo little, it can hardly be diſcerned, for it's gone as ſoon as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Time is ſuch a piece, ſuch a preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Commodity, that there is not any man in the World has two of them to ſhew, that if he loſe one time, he can ſay he has another, or if he loſe one day, he can ſay he has another. Time paſt is not our's, that's gone irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, time to come is out of our reach, it lies alwayes in God's hand; time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is only ours, and that's ſo little that a man muſt have a quick Eye that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it; and I never heard of more forts of time than that which is paſt, preſent, and to come.</p>

ſelf did not put God to the expence of much time; and haſt been ſanctified e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the womb; yet haſt thou not ſome Son or Daughter, or Friend, or brother, whoſe wicked lives thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wails? and wouldeſt thou have God to deſtroy them, to begin with them, to make them the firſt examples of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent revenge? Thou ſaies, why does God bear with the wicked ſo long? Why does God bear with thy Son, with thy Brother, with thy Kinſman? Thou wouldeſt deſire a little more time for them, and further forbearance in hope of amendment; that he would forbear them when they are young, for hope of reclaiming when they come to Man's eſtate, that he would forbear them then for hope of reclaiming when they grow old, that he would forbear them when they are old, yet one year longer, for hope of reclaiming the next, and ſo on; and therefore look either upon thy ſelf who once wert darkneſs, but now art light in the Lord, or upon Child or Friend who now are darkneſs, but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily one day may be light in the Lord, and then ceaſe to be offended at any pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God towards the wicked what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.

many damned in Hell if they had had the time and the forbearance that others have had might have been in the places of ſome that are in Heaven and they in their places, but for God's Patience? ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For the excellency of Time, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſweetneſs of it; how comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able do we reckon it, when we can get a little time with a friend to enjoy him without interruption, and not be called away! how ſweet to get a little time for retirement, a little time to hear a little time to pray, to read, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a little time for buſineſs, a little time for buſineſs! we are ſo poſted from one exerciſe to another, from one du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to another, from one poſture to another, that we look upon it as a great happineſs, to get a little out of the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of time, and that the Chariot-wheels of it ſeem to ſtand a little ſtill and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, that for a little ſpace they do not drive on: what a reſt is it to a poor toſſed hurried Soul? a little communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, a little freedom from the cares, the noiſe, the diſtractions, the diverſions, the interruptions of the World; to be able to ſit down, and be a little at quiet, and take ones breath,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46418:92"/>
and if a Man be in ſickneſs, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, to have a little time to ſwallow down his ſpittle.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth particular is this, none can know the Lord of time without Divine Teaching, and certain it is, that none can number his Time aright that does not underſtand this, that our Time is not our own; God is the Lord of Time, we are but ſtewards of it; we muſt be accountable for it, we are not proprietors, and for us to make bold, (as untaught Popple we too often do) with that which is the Lord's peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar is high preſumption and ſawcineſs: it's injury and ſtealth, for thee to meddle with thy fellow-creatures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty without his leave; what is it then at will and pleaſure to diſpoſe of thy makers right? what Conſcience or pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is it for thee to ſay, I will go to ſuch a place ſuch a day, and buy and ſell, or meet with ſuch a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and be merry? who gave either you or them power to name the day? you ſhould ſay if the Lord give leave, God permitting, if God grant Life and Health: Ah my Brethren, if we asked leave of God about the day, we ſhould alſo he brought to acquaint him with
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46418:93"/>
work we intend to do that day, and how many ill-done deeds and miſpent time might this prevent! you ſee what an intereſt the right conſidering of time has in every thing, and how great an influence it has upon all actions and affairs. What has thou to do to cut thongs out of another Man's hide, or carve at another Man's table without his licenſe? What Prodigals are we of that which is none of our own? canſt thou ſay that thou was ever worth an hours time of thy own in all thy life, and how is it that thou haſt ſpent ſo much and waſted ſo much? thou haſt no authority to appoint dayes or hours let me come cloſer to thee, thou haſt not only robbed God of that time which he has lent thee for thy own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, but thou haſt taken from him that time which he has ſeparated and incloſed and reſerved for his own work and Glory; review thy Sabbaths, and think with thy ſelf, how much holy time thou haſt ſpent upon thy own thoughts, thy own words, thy own actions; what great ſnippets of time thou haſt cut out of the Lord's holy dayes; canſt thou juſtify all this? is this the fruit of the Divine Teaching? No
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46418:93"/>
ſuch matter: our times are in God's hands and power, our times are not our own any more than our tongues; God is the Lord both over them and us; let us therefore when ever we have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for any time be it never ſo little, or ſeemingly never ſo near at our hand, not dare to reach it and uſe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt going to God, and asking his good will; by this means we ſhall not only pleaſe him, but likewiſe engage his aſſiſtance and direction in, together with his bleſſing upon, that work we have to do in that time: but if our work be naught them I confeſs we ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, to go to him for time for it, leſt he ask us how we will imploy it, and we ſhall be afraid and aſhamed to tell him, nor indeed has he allotted any time for bad deeds, but let us know this that if we ſteal time for works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Lord will ſeverely reckon with us both for our works and our time.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth particular is this; none can obſerve the waſters and devourers of time without Divine Teaching, and it is an undoubted truth, that no Man can number his Dayes, well, that is not an obſerver of theſe; theſe are Thieves and Robbers, theſe are eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and conſumers of time, that do very
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46418:94"/>
much perplex Chriſtians; and many times put them beſides right numbring: I Will name ſome of them to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unneceſſary cares; thoſe are very great intruders upon time, and will be cnotinually claiming a ſhare in it, though our Lord and Saviour has given poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive order that no room ſhould be leſt for them;<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. Unprofitable diſcourſes are great devourers of time, that tend to no good at all, neither to information, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, nor to prepare or fit the mind for work and buſineſs; much talk about others Mens affairs &amp; matters that we are not concerned in, and are forbid to meddle with:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.11.</note>

other Mens Actions, Trades, Shops, Families <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and its ſtrange if there is not mixture or backbiting, envy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, and evil ſpeaking throughout ſuch diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>He that conſiders time rightly and knows how to number his Dayes, as he ſhould, will ſee cauſe to wave ſuch need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs chat, and fill his time with better conference, that may leave a more ſweet ſavour and reliſh upon his own heart and the ſpirits of the company. The Lord knows how much we are to blame in this matter, that we cannot fit together, or meet together, but with <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> we muſt be taxing all the World; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as it may be differ from us a little in ſome ſmaller circumſtances, we cannot have a good word for them, nor hear a good word of them, but can be greedy and gape at half a word that is reflecting and diſparaging at a ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, at an appearance, true or falſe. My Brethren, theſe things ought not to be, I profeſs I often think of that place, <hi>James</hi> 3.2. <hi>In many things we offend all, but if any Man offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect Man, and able alſo to bridle the whole Body;</hi> and let me tell you, he that can manage his time aright,

will quickly order his tongue aright: Oh that I could perſwade you and my ſelf, that redeeming time lies at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bottom of the power of Godlineſs; Again, how much needleſs and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable talk about future events and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, about the Lord's matters, his diſpenſations and providences, what may come to paſs in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides murmuring and diſcontented ſpeeches about them; it does not become us to ſit in conſiſtory upon God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, to judge and paſs hard cenſures upon them; no time appointed by the Lord for it.

of all theſe things are; the vulgar <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb</hi> bears witneſs to vulgar practice, I thought as much of it as of my Death, as of the day of doom as of the worlds end.

Let me add one thing which was ſlipt in the proof of the point, when your bagging of God this holy Wiſdom to number your daise aright, be ſure you be earneſt with the Lord, that when you number your daies he would ſtill help you to make the number come even; what is that? that that you may ſee your good dayes to be as many and as long as your evil ones,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46418:100"/>
and your dayes to be full as good as any of your neighbours; thus to number will exceedingly conduce to give you content in your daies which the Lord numbers out to you in this World, and keep you from inordinate deſires after the changing of them, and having ſome other dayes in the room of them. The Wiſdom of God in ballancing Men's conditions in the World is much to be obſerved, though it is but little taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; every day has it's ſuitable good as well as ſufficient evil, every Man may ſee in his own condition, if he has but his eyes open, as much cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing as of mourning; and he may likewiſe ſee his own condition, take it all together, to be as good as any other Man's: what is the reaſon no Man is contented With his Lot and Portion? it is; becauſe they do not reckon right, they do not ſtand in right places to take a view and an eſtimate either of their own or others conditions; you ſtand on the inſide of your own, and on the outſide of another Man's, and by this means, your own ſeems to be much worſe, and his much better than indeed it is; do but change your ſtand, and go into the inſide of his, and the outſide of your
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46418:101"/>
own, and then you will ſet cauſe to change your Opinion; we may ſee the neatneſs of the ſhew but we little know where it pinches, and others at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance will judge your ſtate very happy, which it may be you do not ſit ſo eaſily in, but might, ſit more eaſily if thou would not ſit alwayes in one place and poſture. I am perſwaded the Lord hath in his Wiſdom ſo ordered Mens conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this world, that there's no ods, not one better than another if we could but ſee the ends and ſides of them, no room left for choice, and that condition which every Man is in, ought to be concluded, the beſt for him of any in the World, the Beggar's condition is as good as the King's take it all together: no ſtate in the World can be an object either of meer pitty or meer envy, none ſo bad but a great deal of good is to be ſeen in it, none ſo good but a great deal of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is to be found in it: the Lord in Wiſdom and Goodneſs has fitted every Man's condition for him (that another would not fit him ſo well) and it will be our Wiſdom (if the Lord will give it us) to ſee our ſelves fitted to our conditions, and to obſerve in every point how well they fit us, Here a bunch
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46418:101"/>
of pride is growing, ſtraighten and check there ſaies God; there ſenſual delight would come in, ſtop that place; here ſtrength is ready to be running over to be imployed in vanity, pinch there with a little ſickneſs; there a grace or two want imployment, ſend a croſs or two to give them ſome work and exerciſe: here the Soul is ready to faint; ſlacken a little and give a cordial, and there the Soul is like to fall, clap an hedge or a wall quickly in the way, &amp;c. What happy lives ſhould we lead in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what we do, if we did but know how well every thing we meet with fits us; what fitty dayes we enjoy: there is not the moſt croſs crooked thing comes to thee, but there is ſome part of thee that it will fit exceeding well; now the skill lies in putting it to the right part, a Man's ſhooe will not fit his head, nor his glove his leg; do not turn thy back to thy croſs when thou ſhould take it in thy armes, nor yet take it up at arms end, when thou ſhould bear it upon thy back; a little weight is heavy at armes end, which will be ſcarce felt upon the back which is a fifty place for a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: we muſt take up our Croſſes, as the Man did his ſheep upon his ſhoulder

               <p n="1">1. He is a wiſe Man that minds his greateſt concern, in the firſt place; now he that numbers his dayes aright, that reckons of ſhortneſs, of time, he makes it his firſt buſineſs to ſeek the Kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs thereof, he will take <hi>Maries</hi> part, and leave <hi>Martha's</hi> till afterward if there be time for it: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.38</note> Our Lord Jeſus in his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, <hi>comes into a certain Womans Houſe named</hi> Martha, and falls a Preaching: <hi>her ſiſter</hi> Mary, conſiders with her ſelf that ſhe might have time to provide food, when ſhe could not have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to hear a Sermon <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſate Jeſus feet and beard his Word;</hi> Matha <hi>was very buſie in ſerving</hi> and providing entertainment, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of her Siſters ſleight and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his perſon, and unkindneſs to her to ſuffer her to ſerve alone; our Saviour gives her a check, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Mary's,</hi> entertaining his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, before <hi>Martha's</hi> entertaining his perſon; Chriſt loves that Man ſhould look after their Souls, and not make ſuch a buſtle about their, outward cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make them eaſie, and ſplendid
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46418:103"/>
and delightful, but be content with ſuch things as you have, ſuch things as the houſe affords; as Chriſt would have been well enough, and have been better pleaſed with <hi>Martha,</hi> if ſhe had ſit down with <hi>Mary</hi> to hear the Sermon: if Chriſt gave ſuch a check to <hi>Martha</hi> for her great love to his outward Man, becauſe ſhe neglected the good of her own Soul; What a ſevere cenſure will he paſs upon many one day, whoſe care and cumber, and pains, and time, and ſtrength has been moſtly imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their own outward Man, and their Families, and Children, how to get them Bread, and Livings, and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and in the mean while have made no proviſion for their long home, for Eternity, for their precious Souls, but let them lie at ſixes and ſevens, hunger'd, ſtarved, defiled, naked and bare. He that reckons of the fewneſs of his dayes reaſons and reſolves thus; let me ſecure an intereſt for my Soul in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, let me be aſſured of a kind recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beyond the Grave, and a manſion in Glory, and then if I have time, I may look a little after the World, but if I leave the former undone, I ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever; I may leave the latter
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46418:103"/>
undone and no great loſs, God will take care of my Children, he is bound to it; and for my ſelf, if I be in the meaner condition here, as we uſe to ſay to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, no body will ask them, or tell them, when they come to be Men, what cloaths they did wear when they were Children; ſo when I come to Heaven, it will be all one then whether I had two coats here, or never a whole one, whither I lived in plenty here, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was in ſuch a ſtrait that I did not know where to get my dinner; let my Soul be once in a ſafe condition, and then I am ſure there can be nothing much amiſs in other things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a Point of Wiſdom to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee an evil, and to avoid it; <hi>the Wiſe-Man foreſeeth the evil and hideth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but the ſimple paſs on, <note place="margin">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46418:104"/>
for the Body; all on a ſudden, the Soul is carried by Angels into <hi>Abraham's</hi> boſom, and the Body laid as ſeed in the Earth, (not detained as a Priſoner under the grave's power) <hi>to be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain a Glorious Body at the Reſurrection of the Juſt;</hi> the Soul is continually whilſt here fortifying it ſelf, by Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and humility and ſelf-denial which are Armour of proof in every evih day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is a Wiſe-Man that knows how to carry himſelf ſuitable to his condition. The right numbring his dayes conduces much to this, as you have already heard, and therefore I need not enlarge upon this Head; only this, he reckons his time is ſo ſhort that it never concerns him whether he be in an high or in a low condition; it's no matter where or how I fit, I am not like to fit ſo long; no matter what part I act, I ſhal quickly be gone off the ſtage, I can take any part that is allotted me; it's no matter how I buy and ſell, or pofe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, for I muſt do all as though I did it not, becauſe of the ſhortneſs of time: ſo that in ſhort, as numbring our dayes aright is the fruit of Divine Teachings;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46418:104"/>
ſo it is the way and means to obtain Divine Wiſdom.</p>
