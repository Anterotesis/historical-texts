            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>BEfore I set down the particulars of this Dispute, it seems not amiss to premise (as an introduction to it) what passed between this <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> and the forementioned <hi>George Whitehead</hi> before it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>May</hi> last this <hi>Scholar</hi> walking over the Palace Yard about his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary occasions, chanced to see a great multitude of People over against <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster Hall</hi> compassed with Souldiers in red Coates. Drawing near, he heard <hi>Whitehead</hi> preaching against <hi>Universities, Learning,</hi> and <hi>Tithes,</hi> and the <hi>Clergy;</hi> and askt some of the red-coates whether he might <hi>speak a word?</hi> They answered they could not tell. Whereupon he crowded up to <hi>Whitehead</hi> and askt him the same question, who said No, no. Another Souldier that stood neer him, said, hold thy tongue or Ile stop thy mouth.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Scholar</hi> held his peace, till <hi>W.</hi> had done his railing, against the Priests. Then the People cryed out with one voice, <hi>Let the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man speak, let the Gentleman speak.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Scholar</hi> stood up, and used such arguments in few words against <hi>W.</hi> (in answer to which, <hi>W.</hi> said nothing; but another <hi>Q.</hi> stood up and prayed) that all the People showted. Notwithstanding which the <hi>Q.</hi> going on in his prayer, the people made an hideous shriek to disturbe him. The <hi>Quakers</hi> all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the <hi>S.</hi> to quiet them telling him they were <hi>his</hi> followers and Sons of <hi>Ishmael.</hi> At length the People (seeing that none of the <hi>Quakers</hi> would attempt to answer the <hi>Scholars</hi> argument, desired him <hi>to come away; lest the Q. should do him a mischief.</hi> So he left the Quakers, and with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im came all the People, leaving a few Souldiers and about a douzen Quakers at their exercise. The Day following, and severall dayes after the S. went to seek the Quakers at the said house, but found none, and never yet heard that any of them met there since.</p>
            <p>But upon <hi>Aug. 25. 1659.</hi> the same <hi>S.</hi> having been all the Afternoon (from one a clock till four or five) in St. <hi>Johns Coll. Library</hi> turning
<pb facs="tcp:62083:3"/>
over <hi>Arabick</hi> and other <hi>MSS.</hi> returning home wearied his nearest way, unexpectedly saw the same <hi>Whitehead</hi> preaching in the Quakers common meeting-house. So he went in, desired leave to speak: and (when <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> had done) confuted his Doctrine. Next day, considering how apt silly Women were to be led away captive by such deceivers, he sent this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Note to the <hi>Major</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> hoping in the conclusion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his Wife, who is a Quaker.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>George Whitehead</hi> preacher to the Quakers in <hi>Cambridge</hi> deliver'd in his Sermon among them Yesterday, 1. That they are not Hereticks, and 2. that they teach no other Doctrine but what <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> taught; and 3. afterwards said, that the Scriptures are not the word of God.</p>
                  <p>I am ready this Day (at any hour or place) to prove the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Doctrines very false, and 2ly. to defend those 3 argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that I urged against him yesterday, by showing that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, nor can answer any thing to them: and 3ly. to prove by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other arguments, that 'tis a damnable sin for him (or any such man) to preach, and a damnable sin for any man or woman to hear him.</p>

                  <hi>5. That the Bible is not the Word.</hi>
                  <p>These things I will defend against the contrary affirmations of <hi>T. S. George Whitehead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then he caused these three positions to be writ saying, he would defend them also.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>6. The Scriptures doth not say,</hi> If any man say he hath no sin he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himself.</item>

                  <hi>7. I deny that this is truth</hi> [If any man say he hath no sin he deceives himself] <hi>as concerning the Saints.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday night Aug. 27. T.</hi> S. wondring that he heard nothing of the time and place of meeting, went to the Major to ask what was resolved, who answered, that the <hi>Aldermen</hi> were not willing it should be in the <hi>Town-Hall;</hi> So that if there were any Dispute at all, it must be in the Quakers common meeting house, but that severall <hi>Aldermen</hi> were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there should be any Dispute, and that he himself would not advise <hi>T.</hi>S. to Dispute. Whereupon <hi>T. S.</hi> resolved not to dispute against the minde of the Corporation. Next day <hi>Aug. 29.</hi> between <hi>12,</hi> and <hi>1.</hi> a clock came this following Summons to <hi>T.

            <p>Immediately the same Person received another Summons from Mr. <hi>James Alders</hi> beginning thus.</p>
            <p>Sir, <hi>I was called this Morning to Mr.</hi> Major, <hi>and there I was told that 'tis the desire of the Quakers to meet you, at their house of meeting; they begin to think you are afraid to meet them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these <hi>T. S.</hi> continued in his Chamber, till a Messenger came from Mr. <hi>Alders</hi> to tell him, that the Quakers were met and reported that <hi>T. S.</hi> did not dare to come. Thereupon he went and found <hi>G. Fox</hi> preaching. Esteeming it not lawfull to hear him, he left the room, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred again, as soon as sermon was done. Then there was some debate where <hi>T. S.</hi> should stand, and because the Q. would suffer him to take no place but where he should be compassed with Quakers (as <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> was also) he stood where they appointed him.</p>

            <p>AS soon as T. S. had taken his place, <hi>G. W.</hi> made a long speech to tell the people the occasion of that dispute: and that the questions to be discussed were these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether it were a Damnable sin for him to preach and</hi> 2. <hi>a Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sin for any to hear him.</hi> And charging T.

            </p>
            <p>When he had done. T. S. said thus Good people; you come not hither to hear sermons and speeches but a dispute. This man hath troubled you with a long discourse wherein he concludes that I must begin at the latter end; which of what consequence it is, all you that have skil in any trade or science know as well as I. I shall not trouble you with many words, but (in short) shall only entreat you to hear <hi>him</hi> again, Ile read to you his own paper. <hi>George Whitehead</hi> is this your hand or is it not.</p>

               </p>
               <p>You writ this Book, therefore you open a door to damnable Heresies. <hi>Whitehead</hi> replyed, I deny it.</p>

               <p>That is my conclusion: you should deny one of the Premises.</p>
               <p>Here S. gave him the Book to look on: and then askt him whether he were the Author of that Book or not?</p>

               <p>True, here are some things writ on the back-side: Ile charge <hi>You</hi> with nothing but what is printed. Were you the Author of all that

               <p>I pray tell me plainly whether youl own it or not. If youl not own it all, then tell me what you will own, what not. Otherwise when <hi>I</hi> have proved it a most wicked book, you may disown it, and so all my discourse fall to the Ground. 'Tis no pleasure to me to speak, or this people to hear vain words. If you will not own it speak.

                     <hi>Here W. Allen</hi> a Quaker interposed and made a speech to tell the people that he did not like this way of disputing and bid T.S. dispute plainly without Logick and syllogismes, and vaine termes.</stage>

               <p>
                  <hi>Whitehead</hi> was the first that mentiond major and minor, and used a Syllogisme tother day to prove Scripture was not the word of God <hi>Fox</hi> said that the Major was universall. It seemes they both understand well enough what belongs to a Syllogisme. And I think I have not spoke a word which the meanest here doth not understand, and that this way of dispute is liked best by all: if not let them speak.</p>

               <p>My argument is this, All Papists open a door to damnable heresies, you who writ this book are a Papist, Therefore you who writ this booke open a door to damnable heresies.</p>

               <p>You deny my minor: which I prove thus. He who refuseth to take the oath of abjuration is a Papist. He who writ this book refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth to take the oath of abjuration. Therefore he who writ this book is a papist.</p>

               <p>A Papist will say so too. I might charge you with many Popish Doctrines; but now I only ask whether you will take the oath of abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or deny one of my propositions?</p>

               <p>Here <hi>Fox</hi> who had interposed severall times before made a long discourse to prove that 'twas unlawfull for a Christian to swear. <hi>S.</hi> did let him run on to the end, and let <hi>W.</hi> speak after him.

               <p>I came not hither to dispute with <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Allen</hi>; but since you are resolved to dispute three of you against one, I shall reply to you all (yea if there were three hundred, if you speak but one at once) Which of my propositions do you deny major or minor? For you must deny one unless you'l grant the conclusion that he is a Papist.</p>

               <p>Turn to 2 Cor. 5.20. Where you have these words, Now then we are Embassadours for Christ. From which words I prove that 'tis an appropriate Ministry; proper to some only, not common to all: and therefore that every Christian man and woman is not an Embassadour of Christ, as you <hi>G. W.</hi> told the people tother day. I frame my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus.</p>
               <p>He who pretends to be an Embassadour of Christ and hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to show, but what all the damnable hereticks in the world do or may show, that man opens a door to damnable Hereticks.

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Do you profess your self to be an Embassador of Christ, or do you not?</p>

               <p>Then that you may understand my argument the better (for I perceive you do not yet ken it) I'll illustrate it by a similitude. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we being not at peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> twelve men should go hence to the King of that Nation, and tell him that they are all sent Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to him from the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> He asks them for their Commissions. One of them shows him his Commission in Parchment: and the other 11 tell him they have a Commission, but he must beleeve them on their words for they cannot show it. Every one of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming against this man who showes his Commission, and against the other for counterfeits: crying aloud, that he himself, and he alone is the true Embassador, though he have nothing to prove it by, more then the other ten false. In such a case would you not say that these 11 are Knaves? Answer.</p>

               <p>If it be an heinous sin for any man to pretend a Commission from an earthly Prince or Parliament, when he hath none indeed to show, shall not his crime be incomparably more grievous, his condemnation unspeakably more dreadful, who pretends one from the King of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> when he hath none to show?</p>

               <p>They differ. For <hi>Moses</hi> had his commission from the power of God, yet had it not from Christ: who gave no commission to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Twelve Apostles.</p>

               <p>Well, we will not discuss any impertinent questions. Whether they be one or not, you do not answer my argument. 'Tis this.

               <p>Did ever any Heretick pretend a commission from Christ?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Yes <hi>Dav. George, Socinus, Arius,</hi> and all the Hereticks I ever read of.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>W.</speaker>
               <p>They could not prove it by the effects as <hi>I</hi> can; that is, show the people that were converted by them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Yes they could. <hi>Arians</hi> converted a nation of Infidels to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity (which is more then you pretend to) and his opinions spread so far among them who before his time were Orthodox, that in short time 'twas said, <hi>All the world seemed Arian.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>'Tis confessed by all the Ancients that <hi>Arius</hi> and his Followers did, by St. <hi>Austin</hi> that <hi>Pelagius</hi> did: and <hi>I</hi> remember no Sect-Master that did not.

               <p>'Tis taken out of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false Teachers among you; who privily shall bring in damnable Heresies, <hi>even</hi> denying the

               <p>And many shall follow their pernicious wayes, by reason of whom the way of Truth shall be evil spoken of. Hence <hi>I</hi> prove that <hi>I</hi> am no Heretick.

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> deny your major. All Hereticks do not deny the Lord that bought them. The Apostle there instances in one sort of false Teachers, the worst, who would even deny the Lord. Observe the word <hi>even</hi>: here is a special brand put upon them. It follows not hence that none are false prophets, none false teachers, or (as you would have it) none Hereticks, but those who do deny the Lord that bought them. Prove that. Prove your Major.</p>

               <p>You do not prove your major. <hi>I</hi> beleeve you do not understand my answer, I'll explain it. Suppose a man lying here sick unto death, will you prove that he is not sick at all, because he hath no plague-sore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, or hath no consumption: Because he hath not this or that, or a third disease, therefore hath he none. There be many sorts of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks (the Apostle here mentions damnable <hi>Heresies</hi> in the plural) as there be of diseased persons. Some deny the Lord that bought them, others not. 'Till not follow, that because you are not of one sort of these, therefore you be not of the other. Prove your major if you can; if not, give me leave to argue against you from this very Text.</p>

               <p>The Father, Son, and H. Ghost, have been in three places, and therefore are three Persons. At the baptisme of Christ while Jesus came up, the H.

And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and loe the Heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the H. Spirit of God descending like a Dove and lighting upon him. And loe a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. In this verse is mention of God the Father in heaven, God the Son coming out of the water, and the H. Ghost descending on this side Heaven like a Dove.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> do it thus, If Christ was coming up out of the water while the H.

            <head>A Letter sent to <hi>Mr. E.</hi> of <hi>Taft</hi> four miles from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> a Year since, to which no answer hath been returned.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p n="1">§ 1. SInce you had not so much patience as to hear me t'other day, nor would suffer your daughters to tarry, I now make use of my first hour of leasure to write to you part of that which you might have heard me speak then: Hoping that you and they (whom I look on as having more breeding then any other his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that I saw) will not believe him, whom his friends generally call the Tinker, upon his bare word; but like those noble <hi>Bereans, Acts</hi> 17.11. with readiness of minde search the Scripture whether those things were so.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I guess at the breeding of most of his followers by this passage; One of the chief of them, <hi>viz. Daniel Angier</hi> (who invites him to that Town, entertains him in his house, lends him his Barn for a meeting place) when I charged him in that place with maintaining that God was a body, (<hi>viz.</hi> that he had hands, feet, a face, &amp;c. like one of us) saying that he contradicted me in my Churchyard, after I had preacht the contrary from <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.24. he told me plainly before all the people, when he saw his Ring-leader <hi>T.</hi> would not defend it, that <hi>I lyed</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my whole Parish are ready to witness the truth of what I said.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But to the purpose, I shall in this paper follow that method which the <hi>T.</hi> commanded me (though I desired the contrary) shewing first his false doctrine, and then prove 'tis a dangerous sin in him to preach (as he did publikely, and in the people to hear him.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:62083:9"/>4. He said in his Sermon that God would lay before us at the day of Judgment 4 books, <hi>viz.</hi> the book of his remembrance, 2. the book of the creatures, 3. the book of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> 4. the book of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. By the book of the creatures, he said, he meant this or that cup of bear, or pot of wine whereby a man is drunk, the timber in the wall, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I answer, that 'tis impossible God should set these (this book) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us at the day of Judgement, because the Scripture saith, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. that the earth, and the works therein shall be burnt up. If all these shall be burnt up, how shall they be laid before us, pots and cups, &amp;c. Had he said that the Conscience should represent these things unto us, he had spoken sense, but he made the conscience a witness at that bar, and not a book.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When <hi>I</hi> told him that Christians should not be judged at that day by the book of the creatures, but the Gospel; he answer'd that he did not take his Auditory to be Christians, but unbelievers, and in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>I</hi> heard him utter these words, <hi>I know that the most of you are unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Formerly <hi>I</hi> have wondred that most of his followers were sad melancholly persons, not looking nor behaving themselves like other folk; hereafter <hi>I</hi> shall never wonder, if <hi>I</hi> see or hear they are <hi>mad</hi>: for such speeches as these are dreadful and very uncharitable; tending to no other end, but to make good people run out of their wits, if they have not more then to believe him. For <hi>I</hi> pray consider that an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is an Infidel, that is, either a Jew, or a Turk, or a Pagan or an Atheist: persons who shall be damned as sure as that God is true, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. with whom 'tis unlawful for any Christian to marry, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. Now if this famous preacher should descend to particulars, come to you and your three children, and say to each singly, Thou art a Jew, and thou a Turk, thou an Atheist, and thou a Pagan, <hi>I</hi> am confident you would be ready not only to say, but (if urged) to swear that he did you a world of wrong. And you cannot but think the rest of the company in that Barn as ready to profess the same as you.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But supose most of them had been unbelievers, yet 'tis impossible that he being a stranger, and having never seen half those faces before could know it. For nothing can be the object of any mans knowledge, but that which is as certain as any thing can be.</p>
            <p n="9">9. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls those <hi>Saints,</hi> and beloved of God, to whom he wrote, he never called them unbelievers, though some of them were as bad as any of the people in your barn. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And (as <hi>I</hi> told him) all the Protestants beyond the seas call their
<pb facs="tcp:62083:9"/>
Auditors in their Sermons, <hi>Fideles,</hi> that is beleivers: and he is the first man that ever <hi>I</hi> read or heard of, who preacht among a company of people who were all baptized and professed Christianity, and yet called them unbelievers or infidells. Entreat him from me to consider that of our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.1. Judg not, that ye be not judged; or that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> which was the first place I urged against him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. Though <hi>I</hi> speak, with the tongue of men, and of Angels, and have not charity, <hi>I</hi> am as sounding brass, or a tinkling Cimball.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>I</hi> askt him what Scripture or reason he had to prove that Christians are to be judged at the great day, not only by the Gospell, but also the Law. He cited <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.12. and said, that the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> was there called, the Law of Liberty. I beseech you consult the place, and judg, you'l finde that not the Law, but the Gospell is there meant, quite contrary to this mans purpose, which <hi>I</hi> would prove by the context, if <hi>I</hi> thought it worth the while. This same Law is called the perfect Law <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.25. Now the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> is never termed the perfect Law in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> for it could not make the comers thereunto perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. But the Gospell is termed Liberty, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.13. Stand fast in the Liberty, &amp;c. You have been called unto liberty. By which name the Law is no where called in all the holy Scripture. For the more ample confutation of this his Doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position <hi>I</hi> pray read <hi>Gall.</hi> 4. from the 19th. verse to the end of that chapter.</p>
            <p n="12">12. These and severall other strange passages in that little of his Sermon that I heard (with confuting whereof I shall not trouble you now, because my leasure is not much, and I intend this paper chiefly to a better purpose) made me sadly think on that place of St. <hi>Peter</hi> (at the end of his 2d. Epistle) that there be some things in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles hard to be understood, which they that be unlearned, and unstable wrest, as they do other Scriptures to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p n="13">13. One of those hard places I take the Tinkers Text to be, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.16. which I did not know to be his Text till next day: otherwise I should have told him that his sermon (as far as I could hear my self, or gather by others) did not come any nearer to that Text then to those words, <hi>Abraham</hi> begat <hi>Isaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. Before I leave him let me mind you of two passages which he used to me severall times, and leave you to judg, whether he who spake those words often in that auditory can be a good Christian, or a man in his right wits. First, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me frequently fool, and giddy pated fellow, &amp;c. Concerning which, see <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.22. whosoever shall say to his Brother <hi>Racha</hi> (tis a Syriack word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying giddy-pate) shall be in danger of the Councell and whosoever shall say thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Hear what St. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, 1.26. If any man among you (though he be a wandring preaching. Tinker, for you must give me leave to call him so, till I know what other name he hath) seem to be religious and bridle not his tongue, that mans religion is vain. I shall not take upon me to censure him. I told him that I had not called him any such name, nor did I think it fit, but Ile entreat him to consider what St. <hi>Iude</hi> saith 9.10. that when <hi>Michaell</hi> the <hi>Archangell</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with the Devill about the body of <hi>Moses</hi> he durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. So that if he had been an
<pb facs="tcp:62083:10"/>
               <hi>Archangell,</hi> and I a Devill, he should not have used me (when he had nothing to answer) as he did. <hi>Michaell</hi> durst not—See what follows. These speak <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of those things which they know not, but what they know naturally, as br<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> beasts in those things they corrupt themselves.</p>
            <p n="16">16. This minds me of his 2d. passage which I before hinted, viz. his sayin<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> severall times that Logick was hell bred and came from hell. A way (quoth he) to <hi>Oxford</hi> with your hell bred Logick. Either this man knowes what Logick is or he knowes not: if he knowes not what it is, and railes against it, he incurre<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> St. <hi>Iudes</hi> censure speaking evill of those things which he knowes not, &amp;c. And I must, entreat him to remember the sad words of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. That those who as naturall bruit beasts made to be taken and destroyed, speak evill of those things which they understand not, shall utterly perish in their own corruption, and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness. If he know what Logick is, then he knowes tis a Greek word which signifies rationall, Rom. 12, 1, or rather the <hi>right way of arguing,</hi> which he reproved me for not knowing, in his first words to me. Now to blame me for not knowing how to argue; and at the same time (almost in the same breath) to blame me for discoursing Logically, that is (if he understand himself) for knowing how to argue, is to speak contradictions. And he that will do so and defend it, is no fit man to be a Preacher, nor to talk with any rationall man, much less to be followed by any wise person.</p>
            <p n="17">17. And <hi>I</hi> pray ask any man in the world that knowes what Logick is, whether it doth not put a difference between a man, and a beast: which proposition <hi>I</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and he severall times denyed but would not let me prove it. He saying 'twas sin that put the difference, whereas nothing but sin can turn him, (who in one of his books, saith, if you would go to Christ, go as filthy as you can) or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other man into a beast.</p>
            <p n="18">18. <hi>I</hi> shall leave his Logick, when <hi>I</hi> have told you, that <hi>I</hi> am ready to prove, whensoever you desire me, that Christ used Logick in every discourse in the Gospell, and the Apostles in every Epistle; and that without Logick 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for any man to understand, much lesse to interpret, either the Epistles, or Gospells.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Thus much briefly concerning the <hi>T's</hi> errours publisht in the barn tother day, <hi>I</hi> could name more (for he delivered much falsity in those few words that I heard) but I hope this will suffice to let you see clearly, he is not such a true Preacher as you have lately took him to be. For sure if you had not took him to be excellent, you would not have stood up in the barn severall times to defend him, and rebuke me, who offered not to speak a word till all where coming out. And if you had not done so, but would have had half the patience to have heard me as you had for the Tinker, I would not have troubled you with this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Without which (as the case stands) I know not how to perform that promise which you forced me to make before them all of satisfying you some other time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20. And now <hi>I</hi> proceed to the 2d. generall head which <hi>I</hi> promised to prove <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis a dangerous sin in him to preach, as he did, and in the people, to hear him. <hi>I</hi> argued to him thus; To do that which God strictly forbids all holy men both under the Old and New Testament, is to commit a dangerous sins.
<pb facs="tcp:62083:10"/>
But to preach publickly as he did being not ordained, is to do that which God <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rictly forbids all holy men both under the Old and New Testament, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the doing it is to commit a dangerous sin.</p>
            <p n="21">21. For the Old Testament, <hi>I</hi> proved that all Gods people who were not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained or consecrated to be Priests, were forbid to meddle with any Sacerdotall Office, <hi>Num.</hi> 18.22, 23. <hi>Ex.</hi> 28.1. And as by these two places so by two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Gods dreadfull judgment upon <hi>Vzza</hi> and <hi>Vzzia,</hi> who offended against this Law. <hi>Vzzia</hi> though he were a King (and so you'l say might take more upon him then any Subject) was withstood by the Priests, and forbid to burn incense before the Lord. while the censure was in his hand, the Leprosy arose in his forehead, and continued there, as a brand upon him, as long as he had a day to live, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16. &amp;c <hi>Vzza</hi> did but put forth his hand, to take hold of the Ark, to stay it from falling, while the Oxen shook it, and presently the anger of the Lord was kindled against him, and God smote him dead upon the place, 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 6.6, 7. To which add the judgments that fell upon <hi>Cora</hi> and his company, who for offering incense were swallowed up alive by the earth, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.3.39, 40 Upon <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and his family, who for setting up Priests of the meanest of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> People, who were not of the sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.13. Had those fearfull curses denounced against them, <hi>c.</hi> 14.10. I will take away the remnant of the house of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> as a man takes away dung till it be all gone Him that dyes of <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> in the City shall the Dogs eat, and him that dyes in the Field shall the fouls of the Air eat, for the Lord hath spoken it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="22">22. For the new Testament I urged <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. No man takes this office to himself, unless called of God as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> For there be Evangelical Priests and Altars, as well Legal, which appeares, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. And in many other places of that Epistle. Christ was faithfull in all his house, as was <hi>Aaron, Heb.</hi> 3.2. And if he was so faithfull in his house, that is the Church, then he appointed some to Minister, as well as <hi>Aaron</hi> did. As <hi>Aaron</hi> made Legal Priests, so Christ Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ministers. As <hi>Aaron</hi> had an Altar, circumcision, and the passover, so Christ, the Lords Table, Baptisme, and the Eucharist.</p>
            <p n="23">23. When he ascended he gave some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, &amp;c. Till we all come in the unity of the faith; that is, till the end of the World. He gave some Pastors, therefore not all. Every man may not take upon him to be a Pastor, nor a Prophet, because Christ appointed onely some, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Nor is there any thing more Evident in all the Book of God, than that there ought to be a distinction of Sheepheards and flocks, Learners and Teachers, some that are charged with the cure of Souls, others that are charged to attend and obey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. Some that are separated from the affaires of this life, that they may give themselves wholly to reading, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. to exhortation to Doctrine, and therefore are to be partakers of other mens temporals, that others may be partakers of their Spiritualls: Others to plow, and sow, and harrow the ground, and use other lawfull trades, working with, their hands the thing that is good, that they may have to give to him that needeth.</p>

And when he who was the Wisdome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, names a thing not only four times, but upon four notable occasions, can you imagine that matter a trifle, and intended only for some very few years? The thing which I mean, is the power not only of preaching the Gospell, and administring the Sacraments, but also of remitting, and retaining sins, which was mentioned by Christ. 1. Upon occasion of <hi>St. Peters</hi> confessing him, promising, and foretelling that he would enstate it upon the Apostles <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.19. 2ly. Upon occasion of exemplifying that necessary truth, that the cheif end of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World was to save that which was lost, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.11. He speaks of the institution of this power as evidently instrumentall to that design, 3ly. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before his final departure out of this World, he enstated them initially in this ghostly power <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.21.22. with significant ceremonies and important circumstances, saying, As, my Father hath sent me, so send I you. He breathed on them and said, receive the H. Ghost. Lastly immediately after his Ascention, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great promise of his Father, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.49. Tis absurd to think that this power thus insisted on by Christ, thus given to the Apostles, was to expire with their persons; especially considering that at his bestowing it on them, He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be with them, to the end of the World, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.20.</p>
            <p n="26">26. I hope youl not wonder I mention this power which our Saviour gave his Ministers of remitting and retaining sins; when I believe this very Tinker ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates it to himself, as well as the power to preach. For in the midst of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned dispute about his false doctrines, he breaking out into very many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent di<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erting questions (as asking me when I was converted? what were the signes?) at length he demanded what were the particular sins which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to Almighty God when <hi>I</hi> last received the body and blood of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>? As if I were bound to confesse my private sins, not only to him (when, as I told him, God hath not made you my Confessour) but also to the meanest of all the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in the Country.</p>
            <p n="27">27. But to proceed. The Apostle asks Rom. 10.15. how shall they preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les they be sent? He puts the question, as if he should say, what man in his wits can think it lawfull? who that hath read one leafe either of the law or Gospell?</p>
            <p n="28">28. Considering the examples not only of <hi>Vzza,</hi> and <hi>Vzzia,</hi> under the Old Testament, but in the New of <hi>Matthias:</hi> who had been as well as any man else, a witness of the Doctrine, and life, and miracles, of our B. Saviour, yet was not by any thought fit to be termed an Apostle till he had a speciall call to that office Act, 1.23.</p>
            <p n="29">29. 2ly. Considering that <hi>Ioseph</hi> sirnamed <hi>Barsabas,</hi> was a witness to all this as well as <hi>Matthias,</hi> yet never exercised the Apostleship (though it seems the
<pb facs="tcp:62083:11"/>
Church of Christ esteemed him fit for it) because he was not ordained thereto; <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nymore then many others who where educated in the schole of Christ as well <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s the best.</p>
            <p n="30">30. 3ly. Considering that the most Blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> himself, the only begotten son of God, often profest that he came not without being sent <hi>Io.</hi> 17.8.18. Nor preacht any thing, but what he heard, nor did any thing, but what he was commanded: and this in a time when there was confessedly very great necessity of Reformation. And then with what face (other then brazen) can any man now justifie the doing these things of himself, who neither pretends that he is the Son of God, nor yet that he seeth such a necessity of Reformation.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Lastly considering that not only those Christians who lived neerest the times of our Saviour (who probably might know more of his institution than tis possible we at this distance should) but all succeeding ages for 1600. Years have had a Clergy and a discipline; Certainly, Sir, we have sins as great as any of them, the old sins to mortifie (I heartily wish to God we had no new ones too, then unheard of) and therefore certainly we stand in as much need of Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as any of them did; of all the blessed remedies and wholesome medicines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, which our good God hath appointed.</p>
            <p n="32">32. I might adde many other places of Scripture, as 2. Cor. 5.19. God hath reconciled us to himself by Christ Jesus and <hi>given to us</hi> the Ministery of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. Now then <hi>we are Embassadours</hi> for Christ. Wherein I entreat you to Observe that he saith, committed to us the ministry of reconcilation, here then is an appropriate Ministry not common to all the vulgar. We are Embassadours. Tis limited to some few by vertue of a commission. All cannot be Embassadours The Church is a body, and all cannot be ears, or eyes, 1. Cor. 12.14.15.16.</p>

That, that which he called the Church of Christ at <hi>Bedford,</hi> could not send <hi>him,</hi> or give him power to preach, &amp;c. Because nothing can give that which it self hath not. That Church consisting only of women and a few Lay-men is not in indeed a Church of Christ; none of them hath power to preach or administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therefore none of them can give the Tinker power to preach and administer the Sacraments.</p>
            <p n="34">34. 2. The Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> was in all probability very numerous in those dayes when miracles were ordinary, and three thousand were converted in one place at one sermon: and yet in all the Scripture you shall not find by any word, the least sign that those many people who were thus converted at <hi>Antioch</hi> did joyn together in Church-duties and ordinances (as the Lords supper, which the primitive and best Christians received every day Act. 2.42.46. and the people of your <hi>Town</hi> have not desired, as I hear, these fourteen years) untill <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had been with them. When these two who were ordained Ministers of the word came unto them, then (and not till then) were the Christians at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> termed a Church.

But all this your T. hath been guilty of, and much more. For he hath not only intruded into the Pulpits in these parts, and caused the people of your Town to hate their lawful Minister, [Mr. <hi>Iohn Ellis sen.</hi>] but (as he told me) encouraged them to proceed so far as to cudgel him, and break open the Church doors by violence. <hi>I</hi> wonder what example or precept in the Scripture he hath for this.

            <p n="37">37 Give me leave to tell you a storie, (you gave the Tinker leave to tell you several of things done at <hi>Bedford</hi>) Tis out of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> Notes on <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>All things were made by him.</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, that a Manichee &amp; another being troubled with Flies, and disputing, one of them said, he thought that our good God could not be the Creator of such troublesome Insects. Why then replied the other, who made the Bee which is somewhat bigger, and hath a sting? He yielded that the Devil made it. From a Bee they proceeded to a Locust, from a Locust to a Lizard, so to a Bird, to a Sheep, to an Oxe, to an Elephant, to a Man. And thus was the silly man deluded into a perswasion that he himself was not Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Just such a dreadful Conclusion do most of these people make, who think it lawful for a Tinker, (or a man not ordained) to preach, are they not ready
<pb facs="tcp:62083:12"/>
to pull down the Church walls to mend the High wayes? (you know who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it.) To take the Bells out of the Steeple, and carry them in Butter-panniers to <hi>London,</hi> and sell them, (you know who did it.) Do they not cry that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are needless, meer empty Ceremonies? Preaching Foolishness? <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the sons of the Prophets, Bablers? Are they not ready to cry down Faith for a fancy? All Clergie-men as Limbs of Antichrist? Devotion as an emasculating trick of <hi>Machiavel.</hi> In a word if these men may prevail, down go Presbyters as well as Bishops, Universities, Schools, Hospitals, All thoughts of God, All Reverence to his Word, and all that is Holy. And instead of these, in rusheth <hi>Carneades</hi>'s Philosophy, <hi>that gain is Godliness</hi>: and then the poorest hireling in the Town will soon have as much land as you, or your Heir. For men will turn from being an orderly Common-wealth to be a Community of Bears Tygers, to delight in tearing and devouring each other; from living in civil conversation, they come to joyn hands in that grand piracy, wherein the stronger swallow up the weaker, upon no other pretence of right or reason ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, but because they are the stronger: saying with the Atheists, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 2.1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="41">41. But I see this paper swells above the ordinary extent of a letter and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall draw to a conclusion, when I have spoke to one particular, which is the common talk of this County, viz. That one of your daughters being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in mind you sent for this Tinker to quiet her conscience.</p>
            <p n="42">42. Sr. I know you are a man of so much prudence, that if her or your tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life were shaken with a palsy, or the title to a parcell of your visible estate questioned by some potent-man; you would not think it enough to employ a cheap Atturney or an ordinary Agent, or send for some country dame to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister her kitchin physick, but the ablest counsellors and the skilfullest Doctors should be posted to, and exceeding much wariness and diligent attendances made use of: and all thought little enough. For truly a mans life and health, and sometimes his estate is worth all this: and in some cases it needs it all. But then, I beseech you, do you beleeve your immortall soul (for which Jesus laid down his precious bloud) the only triflle and toy about you? Are there not a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand dangers, and a million of difficulties and innumerable possibilities of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage? And how then comes it to passe that you think a Tinker or mean ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant person can serve here? If a man or woman, be sick saith St. <hi>Iames</hi> 5.14. let him send for the Presbyters of the Church and let them pray over him. 'Tis needfull certainly to have such guides (St. <hi>Iames</hi> knew which were best) to steer the vessell when a stormy passion or a violent imagination (despair or presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption) transport a man, to awaken his reason, and quicken his devotion.</p>

            <p n="44">44. I would now use some arguments drawn from reason and common sense to prove tis unlawfull for this Tinker to preach; but supposing that you believe Scriptures to be the word of God, I think such arguments needless.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Remember that he who commits <hi>Ieroboams</hi> sin, doth justly incur <hi>Ieroboams</hi> punishment, and to hear such a person as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> set up, is to commit <hi>Ieroboams</hi> sin: For if such men had no hearers, no applauders, they would soon lay preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside; To hear him then is to partake of his sin, which the Apostle bids us beware of <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.7. Besides, he that hears such throwes his Soul unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily upon temptations and out of the promise of Gods blessings, for no bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is promised to any, but while he is doing that which God commands: now he commands us to hear our Sheepheards <hi>Io.</hi> 10.1. to hear <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.31. and those that sit in <hi>Moses</hi> chair, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.3. But never commanded us to hear the lowest of the people, or men not ordained. To this I might add that the flock must be under an oversight. <hi>Act.</hi> 18.23.-20.28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.24. A mans own pastor hath a more speciall dispensation of the grace of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.2. and a pastors more especial tye to his flock than another, argues that they are more especially tyed to him. He is appointed to feed them; they therefore to hear him.</p>
            <p n="46">46. I shall commend you to the work of Gods grace when I have entreated you to consider the words of our Saviour, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.5. the sheep of Christ will not hear the voice of a stranger, but will fly from him. The sheep here, are those who shall stand at the right hand of Jesus in the day of judgment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.33. (as the T. confessed when I urged this text against him) And that by a stranger is meant an intruder into the sacerdotall office appears by comparing this place with, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.40-1.51-3.10-18.7. And with other texts where this word is interpreted to be one that is not a <hi>Levite</hi> one not ordein'd by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands as the Preachers were, not only in the first and best times of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 15-5.22-2.22-3.10.6.13.14. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.
