            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>WHo's Body is deceas'd! Old <hi>Albemarl's?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He whom our grateful gracious Lord King <hi>Charls</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Cal'd Father? He that did out-wit the crafty</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Rump-Rulers</hi> with their <hi>Committee of Safety?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He that (without Ieaſt loſs of Bloud) did bring</l>
               <l>Our much deſir'd, long baniſh'd Lord the King</l>
               <l>Home to his Crowns and Kingdoms? Is He gon</l>
               <l>Why then a Pillar of the State is down.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Great Brittain</hi> may put on a Mourning dreſs</l>
               <l>The Court hath one great Conſtellation leſs</l>
               <l>No loyal <hi>Engliſhman</hi> that now draws breath</l>
               <l>But hath a fatal int'reſt in his death:</l>
               <l>For the whole Kingdom was concern'd in Him;</l>
               <l>The Body Politic hath loſt a Limb;</l>
               <l>The Camp doth miſs an Arm, the Court an Eie,</l>
               <l>The King an Heart fild full of Loyaltie.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As he had Prudence, Courage, Worth and Wit,</l>
               <l>So he had Fortune, which makes all things hit.</l>
               <l>As He had Reſolution to Doo,</l>
               <l>So He had judgment to know When and How</l>
               <l>VVitneſs his <hi>Iter Boreale</hi> when</l>
               <l>He was myſterious to the wiſeſt men</l>
               <l>And did not agitate ſo much with Swords</l>
               <l>As by a well-rul'd Regiment of VVords</l>
               <l>Intricate motions which though high and right</l>
               <l>VVere ſwift and ſubtle as a Swallows flight:</l>
               <l>For though beſieg'd with Queſtions, Foe, nor Friend</l>
               <l>Could tell to what intent his March did bend.</l>
               <l>In brief, 'twas deſtin'd by Divine Decree</l>
               <l>In God's High Court that He and none but He</l>
               <l>Should have the fate (though much before was done)</l>
               <l>To fix the injur'd Heir ſafe in his Throne</l>
               <l>VVhich our abſtruſe Star-ſtudents could not ſee</l>
               <l>But put a Period to Monarchie:</l>
               <l>And did proclaim their Sence with Tongue and Pen,</l>
               <l>That we ſhould never have a King agen:)</l>
               <l>By His example we may all agree,</l>
               <l>That Honeſty is the beſt Policie:</l>
               <l>And that to do things juſtly, may befriend</l>
               <l>A man in the beſt way to his own End:</l>
               <l>In this wiſe Art he was a man compleat,</l>
               <l>And by his being Good grew to be Great:</l>
               <l>For we may ſee by what was lately done,</l>
               <l>His only aim was not Ambition.</l>
               <l>For when He had his Dukedom and Repoſe</l>
               <l>In the Kings Arms, Enfranchis'd from all foes:</l>
               <l>In his old Age (His Loyalty was ſuch)</l>
               <l>He ventur'd Life and Honour' gainſt the <hi>Dutch:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>No petty Peril, but as fierce a ſlaughter</l>
               <l>As could be acted by Sword, Fire and Water:</l>
               <l>Where He was liable by one ſmall ſhot</l>
               <l>To leave at once, even all that he had got.</l>
               <l>This Action made it Evident he ſtood</l>
               <l>Not for His own End, but His Country's good;</l>
               <l>VVhich made the King invite him to retreat,</l>
               <l>Never was King and Subject better met,</l>
               <l>Or ever did things with more due regard,</l>
               <l>One to Deſerve, and tother to reward.</l>
               <l>No King ſuch Servant in ſuch great diſaſter,</l>
               <l>Nor ever Subject had a better Maſter:</l>
               <l>But Death hath parted them, and VVe (in groſs)</l>
               <l>At once may weep for Him and the Kings loſs.</l>
