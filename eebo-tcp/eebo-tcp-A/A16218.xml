            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Inding here to treate of the Art of Logike in our vulgar tongue, for the profit of those my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that are not learned in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine tongues: I thinke it no shame nor robbery to borrow termes of the said Art from the Latines, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as they did from the Greekes: and specially such termes as cannot be aptly expressed in our natiue speech: and yet therewith I doe not forget plainly to shew the signification of cuery such terme, so as euery man may easily vnderstand what each terme signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth: thinking it much better so to doe, then to fayne new wordes vnproper for the purpose, as some of late haue done. And as my minde is hereby to please the vnlearned, that are desirous of learning, hauing both good wits, and also good disposition with aptnesse to learne. So my hope is not to offend the learned, who, I am sure doe well allow of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in saying, that euery good thing, the more common it be, the better it is: neither are they ignorant, that in old time past, aswell the Greekes as the Latines, of what Art soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:16061:3"/>
they wrote, each one wrote the same, for the most part, in his owne vulgar speech. Euery man is not able in these costly dayes, to finde either himselfe or his Child at the Vniuersitie, whom if God not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hath indued with a liuely wit, and made him so apt to learning, as hauing some helpe at home, he may by his owne industry, attayne vnto right good knowledge, &amp; be made thereby the more able to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and to profit his Countrey. Truly, I see no cause why the learned should disdayne, or be miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that such Man or Child should be freely taught this or any other good Art, without any cost or charge. Wherefore arming my selfe with assured hope, that with this my labour, I shall greatly profit and pleasure the vnlearned, and not hinder or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please the learned, I will boldly follow mine enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, and here briefly shew the order of my said Worke, which is diuided into sixe Parts or Bookes: for sith Logicke is chiefly occupyed in discussing of Questions, and that such questions, both simple and compound doe spring of wordes, the first Part of my Booke shall treate of Wordes, shewing which be Simple, which be Compound, and also which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend more, and which comprehend lesse: &amp; which be of affinitie, and which be not: leauing out no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Rules belonging thereunto, that are taught either by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or by any other Moderne writer:
<pb facs="tcp:16061:3"/>
Secondly, because all simple questions consisting of single wordes, are to be discussed by Definition and Diuision: the second Part treateth of them both, and therewith sheweth also with what methode and order such simple questions are to be handled. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because all compound questions are to be discussed by reasoning or argumentation, and that euery kinde of argument doth consist of Propositions: the third Part treateth of a Proposition, and of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereunto. Fourthly, because no sound argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be made to proue or disproue any thing that is in question, vnlesse the Disputer know from whence to fetch his proofes: the fourth Part of my Booke treateth of all the places from whence any argument is to be fetched. And the fifth Part treateth of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation, and of all the kindes thereof, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how euery kinde is to be performed. The sixt and last Part treateth of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, shewing how all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall arguments are to be confuted.</p>

            <head>A Postscript.</head>
            <p>THough I wrote this Booke many yeeres past, whil'st I sojourned with my most deare Brother in Law, <hi>M. William Hurnell,</hi> a man of most singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar humanitie, and of great hospitalitie, at his house in Winkborne in Nottinghamshire, not farre from South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well: yet notwithstanding vpon diuers necessarie consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations (as I thought) since that time mouing me thereunto, I still stayed it from the Presse, vntill now of late that I was fully perswaded by diuers of my learned friends, to put it in print, who hauing diligently perused the same, and liking my playne order of teaching vsed therein, thought it a most necessary Booke for such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters as had not beene brought vp in any Vniuersitie: to many of which Ministers though God had giuen the gift of vtterance, and great good zeale to set forth in good speech the true Christian doctrine: yet, if they should haue to deale with subtill Sophisters and caue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Schismatikes (whereof in these dayes, the more is the pitty, there are too many) they were not able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of Logike, to defend the truth of Gods Word, and orderly to confute such false Conclusions as peruerse Schismatikes and Heretikes are wont to gather out of the very wordes of holy Scripture: wherefore, through my said friends perswasions, I haue now at length committed my said Booke to the Presse, praying all those that shall vouchsafe to reade it, as thankefully to accept the same, as of my part it is friendly offered: <hi>Vale.</hi>

And therefore it is defined of some, to be the Art of Arts, and Science of Sciences; not for that it teacheth the principles of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Art or Science, (for those are to be learned of the Professors of such Arts or Sciences) but because it sheweth the method, that is to say, the true order and right way that is to be obserued in seeking to come to the perfect knowledge of any Art or Science. Of which methodicall part, mine old friend, <hi>M. Iacomo Acontio Tridentino</hi> hath written in the Latine tongue a very proper and profitable Treatise.

                        <p>It is a naturall and vsuall kinde of speech, whereby one thing is naturally, and properly spoken of another, or as the Logicians say, when words superiour are spoken of their inseriours being of one selfe affinitie, as when the generall kinde is spoken of any his speciall kindes, or the speciall kinde of any his <hi>Indiuiduums,</hi> or when the difference or propertie is spoken of their speciall kindes, or of any of the <hi>Indiuiduums</hi> comprehended vnder the said speciall kindes; as when we say, Man is a sensible body, or that <hi>Iohn</hi> is a man, or, <hi>Iohn</hi> is reasonable, or, <hi>Iohn</hi> is apt to speake, or such like: for such speeches are both naturall, and of necessitie, because the predicate is aptly applied to his subiect.

                        <p>Predication accidentall is when an accident is spoken of his subiect, as, Wine is sweet, or, Wine is sowre, <hi>Socrates</hi> walketh; for this is a casuall kinde of speech, imploying no necessitie, as doe the other essentiall or naturall speeches before recited. To this also may be referred predications by way of similitude, as when we say, One man is a God or Deuill to another, A Tyrant is a Wolfe or Fox, that is to say, like a Wolfe or Fox, which are otherwise called figuratiue or metaphorical speeches. But whilest we talke here of accidentall predications, it shall not be amisse to shew you that the Schoolemen, the more distinctly to expresse the nature of accidents, doe vse two termes, <hi>Abstractum</hi> and <hi>Concretum. Abstractum</hi> is the bare shape of any subiect separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by imagination from the same, as the whitenesse or black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a wall, or any other thing that is either white or blacke, which abstract cannot be properly spoken of his subiect; for it were no proper speech, to say, that this wall is whitenesse: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee must vse the adiectiue called <hi>Concretum,</hi> signifying the shape, together with the subiect, as when wee say, This wall is white.</p>

                        <p>Predicaments are certaine Titles or Tables containing all things that be in the world: for euery thing, whatsoeuer it be, is either a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or accident: and if it be a substance, it is found in the Table of substance hereafter following: if it bee an accident, it belongeth either to quantitie, qualitie, relation, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, passion, time, place, to be scited, or to haue: for these be the Tables of accidents, in one of the which euery accident is easie to be found.

The second is, when one selfe name is giuen to diuers things of purpose, for some likenesse that is betwixt them, as a painted man is called man as well as the liuing man; for wee will commonly say, Here is King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, when indeed it is but his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.

                        <p>Substance is a thing consisting of it selfe, and needeth no helpe to sustaine the being thereof: and yet it is clad with accidents; for otherwise we could not discerne with our outward senses, whether it were a substance, or not: for we cannot see the substance of any thing with our bodily eies, but only with the eies of our minde and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; but we may see the shape, the quantitie, the colour, and such like accidents cleauing to the substance, without the which those accidents haue no being at all: and therefore in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such accidents, we may assure our selues that there is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance sustaining those accidents, which doth alwaies remaine, though the accidents doe faile or change neuer so often. As for example: Wee see in water, that though it be sometime hot, and sometime cold, now of one colour, and now of another, yet the substance of water doth still remaine, so as we may perceiue those accidents to be one thing, and the substance of water to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now as touching the kindes of substance, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> there be two, that is, first and second.</p>

                        <p>First substances be those substances which the Logicians call

                           <hi>Indiuidua,</hi> as <hi>Iohn, Thomas,</hi> this man, or that man, this horse, or that horse, and by reason of their accidents are to bee discerned with outward senses.</p>

                        <head>Which call you second substances?</head>
                        <p>Second substances are those which they call speciall kindes, and generall kindes, as man, a sensible body, a liuing body, and such like, which are to be comprehended only by mans reason, and be not subiect to our outward senses, as first substances bee.

                        <head>How many properties doe belong to substance?</head>
                        <p>These three: First, substance is contained in no subiect, as an accident is: for though the parts of a mans body be contained in the whole, yet euery such part is a peculiar body or substance, and hath his proper being of it selfe so well as the whole, whereas accidents without substance haue no being at all. Secondly, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are said to be diuers, but not contrary one to another: for neither is fire, as touching his substance, contrary to water, nor the Wolfe contrary to the Lambe, but onely in respect of their qualitie, whereunto contrarietie doth properly belong. Thirdly, of substances, one cannot be more or lesse then another; for the greatest Giant, as touching substance, is no more a man then the least Dwarfe that is; neither is a man full growne, more a man, then a childe newly borne: for more or lesse appertaineth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to quantitie, and not to substance. But if you will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how farre the predicament of substance doth extend, and what it comprehendeth, consider well this Table following, whereby you may learne how to define any kinde of substance, whatsoeuer it be: for there you shall finde all the kindes, both generall and speciall, together with their differences, most plainly set forth.</p>

                        <p>Habit is a constant and absolute perfection in any thing, not giuen by nature, but gotten by long vse and exercise; and it is twosold, that is, of the minde, and of the body: againe, habit of the minde is twofold, whereof the one is called intellectuall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the reason and vnderstanding of man, and the other morall, belonging to the will of man.

                        <list>
                           <item>1 Intelligence is the knowledge of speculatiue principles, as 2. and 2. make 4. the whole is more then his part; take equall from equall, and equall remaine, and such like.</item>
                           <item>2 Science is the knowledge of true conclusions, consisting of most certaine and infallible propositions; as, Man is a sensible body, Man is apt to learne: and vnder Science are comprehended the sciences rationall, as Grammar, Rhetoricke, and Logicke; also the sciences Mathematicall, as Arithmeticke, Geometrie, Musicke, and Astronomie, which are otherwise called Quadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uials, that is to say, the foure waies or kindes of mathematicall discipline; and finally, the science physicall, that is to say, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as the naturall philosophie of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or of any other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treating of the secrets of nature.</item>
                           <item>3 Prudence is an habit working with true iudgement, and according to right reason in all things appertaining to man, bee they good or euill. Prudence may be diuided into prudence mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall,

                           <item>4 Art is an habit of knowledge consisting of assured and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rules, tried and approued by experience, and learned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, teaching to doe or to make something that is profitable to mans behoofe: and Art comprel end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>Figure, according to some, is that which is enclosed with one bound or limit, or with many, as a circle enuironed with one round line, called the circumference, or as a triangle or foure-square figure, whereof the one is enclosed with three lines, and the other with foure, and such like: but forme is the drawing or describing of the said figure. Againe, according to the opinion of some, figure is compared to an image representing some liuely thing: and forme is said to be the due proportion and feature of the same. Some againe doe attribute figure to things without life, and forme to things, that haue life, briefly set downe in this verse following:</p>

For this is a generall rule of Correlatiues: If the one be, the other must needs be: If the one be taken away, the other must also be taken away.</p>

                        <p>First, by time, <hi>Cicero</hi> is said to be before <hi>Quintilian,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> before <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and such like. Secondly, by nature, that thing is said to be first, or before, from which the consequent cannot returne backward: by which way all generall kindes are said to be before their speciall kindes, and speciall kindes before their Indiuiduums: for if man be, then sensible body (which is the generall kinde) must needs be, but not contrarily: so likewise, if <hi>Iohn</hi> be, man must needs be, but not contrarily; for it followeth not of necessitie, Because it is a sensible body, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is a man, or because it is a man, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is <hi>Iohn.</hi> Thirdly, by order one thing is said to be before another, as one before two, and two before three, letters before syllables, and syllables before words, and words before speech. To this also appertaineth that which is said
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16061:34"/>
to be before by situation, as in going from <hi>Norwich</hi> to <hi>London, Thetford</hi> is before <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and <hi>Newmarket</hi> before <hi>Ware,</hi> and so forth. Fourthly, by honour or dignitie, an Emperour is said to be before a King, a King before a Duke, a Duke before an Earle, an Earle before a Baron, &amp;c. Fiftly, the cause is said to be before his effect, as the rising of the Sunne is said to be before day; so the difference is said to be before his speciall kinde, and the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall kinde before his propertie. And these be conuertible: for if it be day, the Sunne must needs be vp: and if the speciall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be, the speciall kinde must needs be, and so contrarily.</p>

So likewise he that will teach the nighest way from <hi>Norwich</hi> to <hi>London</hi> by order compositiue, will bid him first go to <hi>Windham,</hi> from <hi>Windham</hi> to <hi>Atleborough,</hi> from <hi>Atleborough</hi> to <hi>Thetford,</hi> from <hi>Thetford</hi> to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> from <hi>Newmarket</hi> to <hi>Barkway,</hi> from <hi>Barkway</hi> to <hi>Ware,</hi> from <hi>Ware</hi> to <hi>London.</hi>

                        <p>It is, when in defining and diuiding we descend orderly from a most generall kinde to all the speciall kindes contained vnder the same, and so to the lowest of all: as hauing to speake of qualitie, we define it, and diuide it into his foure speciall kindes, and euery such speciall kinde into his parts and members, euen till we come to the lowest of all, as you see in the Table of qualitie before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.

                     </head>
                     <p>FOr the first office of Logicke teacheth how to finde out the truth in any speech: but method teacheth how to attaine to the Art or knowledge of any thing. In which method, three things (as he saith) are to be considered: First, what method is: Secondly, what is the effect or vttermost end thereof: Thirdly, what be the causes of that end or effect.</p>
                     <p>Method is a certaine right way, whereby wee may search out the knowledge of any thing; and hauing attained it, how to teach the same commodiously to any other, without examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or false; for that belongeth to the first part of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke.</p>
                     <p>The effect or vttermost end of method, is the knowledge of anything.</p>
                     <p>The causes of that end are these three, forme, matter, and cause efficient.</p>
                     <p>Forme here seemeth to be that which is knowne by all the parts of such knowledge, being gathered together (as it were) into one selfe body: which parts are these; first, what the thing is; secondly, what be the causes thereof, and also what be the causes of those causes, euen to the last or vttermost cause: thirdly, what be the effects, and also what be the effects of those effects, as well when the thing is taken generally, as for some whole thing, or as when the whole is diuided into all his parts, euen vnto the parts indiuisible.</p>
                     <p>Matter here is generally taken, and not for the matter of any determinate or certaine kinde: vnto which matter doe appertaine all things that be finite, perpetuall, and immutable, that is to say, all vniuersals.</p>
                     <p>The causes efficient are partly those things that are more knowne, as first, to know what the thing is by definition consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of the generall kinde, and of the differences thereto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: secondly, what is the effect or end of the thing, as in those things which doe not depend vpon our will: and thirdly, what
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16061:41"/>
be the causes of that end or effect, the consideration of which end belongeth to those things which doe depend vpon our will, and partly the cause efficient is the right applying or ordering of the more knowne things, which order containeth two parts: for first wee must proceed alwaies from the most generall kindes to the next generall kindes, as hauing to begin with the definition of the thing which you seeke to know, when need requireth, you must proceed from the most generall kinde of all, that is to say, from the highest generall kinde, and so descend downward, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you come to the thing that is to be defined: but if you haue to begin from the vttermost end of the thing, then next of al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that, from whence the end doth immediately spring, and what doth follow next to that, and so proceed from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till you come to the first cause of all. Finally, if you haue to begin from the first causes, then you must orderly proceed from that which is first vnto the second, and so to the third, and so forth vntill you come to the vttermost effect or last end.</p>
                     <p>Now as touching the second part of applying or ordering the more knowne things, you must haue consideration of euery whole thing, and of all his parts: wherefore if you haue to define any thing, Art, or science, whereof you treat, you must define the whole, and then euery part thereof, vntill you come to the lowest part thereof, and yet euery one in his proper place. And if you cannot comprehend in one definition all those things that are to be referred to one head, then vse diuision in diuiding the whole into his parts, and define euery such part in order. But if all the parts which the thing containeth, haue not one selfe end, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, then diuide it by such differences as euery part may haue his proper end.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, if the forme, matter, or cause efficient haue diuers respects and considerations, then (according to that diuersitie) make diuers diuisions, and first declare what is common to all the parts in generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what is proper to euery one in particular.</p>
                     <p>Finally, if some one whole thing lieth hidden, then it is to bee found out by looking into some of the particular parts thereof.

Fourthly, the kindes of vertue be diuers, as Prudence, Iustice, Temperance, Fortitude, Modestie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and such like.

The first way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiuely, is, when no negatiue is added either to the subiect, or to the mood; as, for a man to be iust, it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, contingent, impossible, or necessarie. The second way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiuely, is, when the negatiue is added to the verbe of the subiect, the mood remaining still affirmatiue; as, for a man not to be iust, it is possible, contingent, &amp;c. The first way negatiuely, is, when the negatiue is only added to the mood; as, a man to be iust, it is not possible, contingent, &amp;c. The second way negatiuely, is, when the negatiue is both added to the verbe of the subiect, and also to the mood; as, a man not to be iust, it is not possible, contingent, &amp;c. which is all one and equiualent to this affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue proposition, saying, that for a man to be iust, it is possible, contingent, &amp;c. for two negatiues, as well in the Latine tongue, as in ours, do alwaies make an affirmatiue.

As for example, the Carpenter is the Cause Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of the house which he maketh, and so is euery Artificer of his owne worke. Causes Efficient are deuided into two kinds (that is to say) Cause Absolute, and Cause Adiuuant. Cause Absolute worketh by his owne force and vertue, as the fire that burneth. Cause Adiuuant worketh not by himselfe, but is a helper, and such cause is sometime principall, as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16061:61"/>
is a Principall Cause of blessed life, and sometime not Principal, as the gifts of the body and of fortune be helpers to the happy life: but not Principall Causes thereof. Againe of Causes, some are of Necessitie, without which the thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made, as the Instrument or matter, and some are said not to be of Necessitie, as when we say, The speaking of truth causeth hatred, and yet not of Necessitie. Also of Causes Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, some be Vniuersall, and some Particular, as the Eclipse or euill Coniunction of certaine Planets is the Vniuersal cause of Pestilence: but the corruption of humours in mans body is the particular cause thereof. Againe, of causes some bee called of the Latins <hi>Propinquae</hi> (that is to say) nigh vnto the Effect, as the father and mother be the nighest Causes of Generation of Children.

                        <p>Two manner of wayes: first, from the denying of one part or more of the diuision, to affirme another part therof, as thus: Euery sensible body is whole or sicke, but <hi>Peter</hi> is a sensible body and not sicke: <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee is whole: or thus.

In these two kindes of examples the diuision consisteth onely of two parts, wherein it sufficeth to denie the one for affirming the other.

                        <p>Materiall Principles are three simple Propositions, and three termes, (that is to say) the Subiect, the Predicate, and the meane terme hereafter defined, whereof the Subiect and the Predicate are said to be the outermost limits or bounds of any simple Proposition.</p>

This Syllogisme concludeth directly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Maior terme, substance, is the Predicate in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: but if the conclusion were thus: <hi>Ergo,</hi> some substance is a man, then it should conclude indirectly: because this word man which was the subiect of the question in this conclusion, is made the Predicate.</p>

                        <p>Because the conclusion being implyed of the premisses, ought alwayes to follow the weaker part of the same premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but the particular is alwayes accounted weaker then the vniuersall, and the Negatiue weaker then the Affirmatiue.</p>

                        <p>Reduction by impossibility is, when the goodnesse of the Syllogisme is so proued, as the aduersary denying the same, must needs be brought to some absurditie, as to confesse two Contradictories to be both true at once, or some proposition to be false, which he hath confessed before to be true, or is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly true of it selfe. But first we wil speake of Reduction of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue, and then of Reduction by impossibility; and because that Reduction offensiue is done sometime by conuersion, and sometime by transposition, and sometime by both at once: and againe, that sometime one of the premisses, somtime both, and sometime no more but the Conclusion onely is conuerted, and that sometime by simple conuersion, and sometime by conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <hi>per accidens:</hi> the Schoolemen for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The second rule is, that whatsoeuer follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon a good Consequent, must needs also follow vpon the Antecedent therof: As for example, if it be a good Consequent to say, it is a man: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a sensible body: ye may aswel say, if it be a sensible body: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a substance: and sith that a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body is a substance, you may therefore aswel conclude that a man is a substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion or Consequent is a true Proposition of it selfe: As in this example. Euery sensible body is a tree, but euery Peare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree is a sensible body: <hi>Ergo,</hi> euery Peare-tree is a tree.</p>

                        <p>Things probable, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> are these that seeme true to all men, or to the most part of men, or to all wise men, or to the most part of wise men, or else to the most approued wise men: whereby it appeareth that things probable may be said fiue manner of wayes.</p>

                        <head>Shew how.</head>
                        <p>First, those things are probable, which vnto all men aswell learned as vnlearned being in their right wits, doe seeme to be true, as these: Euery mother loueth her childe: we loue them that loue vs: we must doe good to them that doe good to vs. Secondly, those things that seeme true to most men, as these: it is better for a communalty to be ruled by one Prince, then by many: It is not good to serue many masters at once. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, those things that seeme true to all wise men, as these: what thing soeuer is honest, the same is also profitable: Vertue is better then riches. Fourthly, those that seeme true to the most part of the wise and learned, as thus: the soule of man is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall: the Sunne is greater then the earth. Fiftly, those things that seeme true to the most approued wise men, as these: The world had a beginning: it is better for a Prince to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, then feared of his Subiects. And generally vnder things probable are contained all true Propositions that be casuall, and not implying any necessitie. I say here true Propositions, to exclude false Propositions, whereof Sophisticall Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes are made, and not those which we call probable or Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Syllogismes; and yet such Propositions be not so true in deede, as those that bee required in a Syllogisme demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, but onely doe seeme true, ingendring a certaine opinion in mans minde, doubting notwithstanding the contrary: for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16061:94"/>
it breedeth not a perfect knowledge as Science doth, whereby the minde is of all doubts throughly resolued.

                        <p>Induction is more familiar to man then a Syllogisme, for the Syllogisme proceedeth from vniuersalities vnto particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which vniuersalities be more knowne to nature (that is to say) to the discourse of reason, and lesse knowne to our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sences.

                        <p>This kinde of Argument differeth in forme from all the rest before taught, for a Syllogisme proceedeth from the generall kinde to the speciall kinde, or otherwise. An Enthimeme imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating a Syllogisme, reciteth in his Antecedent the cause of the Conclusion. Againe, an Induction out of many particularities gathereth an vniuersalitie, none of which things is to be found in an Example, proceeding onely from one particular to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like particular. Notwithstanding <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that it may be reduced partly to an Induction, and partly to a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme: for in taking the first particular, you may by an vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Induction imply an vniuersall Proposition. And so from that vniuersall Proposition to proceed by order of Syllogisme vnto the other particular implyed in the conclusion of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as in this Example: <hi>Iuaas</hi> died euill: <hi>Ergo, Pilate</hi> also died euill: it may be first reduced into an vnperfect Induction thus: <hi>Iudas</hi> dyed euill, because hee was the author of Christs death, and did not repent: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Euery man that was author of Christs death, and did not repent, died euill. Into a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme thus: Euery man that was author of Christs death, and did not repent, died euil; but <hi>Pilat</hi> was author of Christs death, and did not repent: <hi>Ergo, Pilate</hi> died euill.</p>

                        <head>When is this kinde of Argument said to be of force?</head>
                        <p>When it is made of Affirmatiue Propositions, wherein words of affinitie are necessarily ioyned together, as when kindes generall, differences, or properties, are ioyned with those speciall kindes, of whom they are spoken, or when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effects are ioyned with their proper causes, for if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions be eyther Negatiue, or doe not necessarily hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, then it is no good Argument, as in Negatiues let this be your example: A Man is not a Lion, a Lion is a sensible beast: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Man is not a sensible beast. Now of Propositions not hanging necessarily together, because that proper effects are not ioyned with their proper causes, let this common iest be your example:</p>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Whoso drinketh well, sleepeth well,</l>

                           <l>Whoso sinneth not, shall be blessed:</l>
                           <l>

                        </lg>
                        <p>Which is no good Conclusion, for much drinke is not alwayes the cause of sleepe, nor sleeping the cause of not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

                           <item>2 The Crocodolite is, when being deceiued by some craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie manner of questioning, we doe admit that which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary turneth againe vpon vs, to our own hindrance, as in the fable of the Crocodile, whereof this name Crocodolite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth: for it is said, that the Crocodile hauing taken away a childe from his mother, reasoned with her in this sort; I will deliuer thee thy childe againe, if thou wilt say a troth: whether therfore shall I deliuer him or not? The mother answered, thou shalt not deliuer him, and therefore of right thou oughtest to deliuer him. No, saith he, I will not deliuer him, to the intent it may seeme that thou hast said troth; and though thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest said that I should deliuer him, yet I would not deliuer him indeed, for making thee a lyar.</item>
                           <item>3 Assistaton, is a kinde of cauelling, not consisting of any sure ground, as if a man did say, that he doth hold his peace, or lyeth, or knoweth nothing; another by and by might cauill thereof in this sort: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He that holdeth his peace, speaketh, he that lyeth, saith truth, he that knoweth nothing, knoweth something.</item>
                           <item>4 Pseudomenon, is a false or lying kinde of cauelling, as thus: The heauen couereth all things: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it couereth it selfe. <hi>Epimenides,</hi> being a Candiot himselfe, said, That the Candiotes were lyers; the question is, whether he said true or not; for though he said true, and that the Candiotes were lyers, yet it is false, because a Candiot said it: againe, if the Candiotes be no lyers, nor <hi>Epimenides</hi> is a lyer, then hee is to be beleeued.</item>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Isputation is a contention about some questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken in hand, either for finding out of truth, or else for exercise sake, and there bee foure kindes of disputation, whereof the first is called doctrinall, because it appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to Science.</p>
                     <p>The second is called Dialecticall, which belongeth to proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion.</p>
                     <p>The third is called Tentatiue, which serueth to trie another mans knowledge, in any kinde of Science.</p>

                        <p>The Doctrinal Disputation vseth no other but Syllogismes Demonstratiue as this is, whatsoeuer hath reason, is capable of learning; but <hi>Iohn</hi> hath reason: <hi>Ergo, Iohn</hi> is capable of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Dialecticall Disputation vseth onely probable Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes, as the former example of <hi>Medea,</hi> euery mother loueth her child; but <hi>Medea</hi> is a mother: <hi>Ergo, Medea</hi> loueth her childe: against this another probable argument may be made thus: whosoeuer killeth her child, loueth not her childe: but <hi>Medea</hi> killed her child: <hi>Ergo,</hi> she loued not her child. Tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue disputation vseth such arguments as are made of the first common principles of any science, in which principles who so is ignorant, cannot be skilful in that Science; as if a man would professe Geometrie, and know not the definitions of a point, or pricke of a line, or superficies, or of such common Maxims, as these are; the whole is more then his part: take equall from equall, and equall remaine, &amp;c. should quickly bewray his owne ignorance.</p>

                        <head>Giue example of all these fiue Markes.</head>
                        <p>Of the first Marke, let this be your example: If in disputing of Vertue, you haue perhaps granted, that the meditation of Vertue doth make a man sad, the Sophister will force you by argument, to denie againe that which you before granted, thus: all things that bee contrarie, har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap> contrary effects: but it is proper to vice to make the minde of man sad: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Vertue maketh his minde glad: This kinde of reasoning is more plainely taught before, when wee talked of Reduction by impossibilitie.</p>
                        <p>Of the second Marke let this be your example: Euery dog hath power to barke; but there is a certaine Starre called the Dog: <hi>Ergo,</hi> that starre hath power to barke. The Fallax of this argument consisteth onely in the word Dogge, which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke, as shall bee declared more at large hereafter, when wee come to speake of that Elench or Fallax.</p>
                        <p>Of the Paradox, which is the third Marke, let this be your example: the Sophister will make you to grant, that a rich and happie King is wretched, by force of argument, thus: Whosoeuer is subiect to sin, is wretched: but all rich and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Kings are subiect to sinne: <hi>Ergo,</hi> all rich and happy Kings
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16061:103"/>
are wretched and miserable: in this is also a Fallax, because that happinesse is spoken heere in two respects, for there is worldly happinesse, and heauenly happinesse.</p>
                        <p>Of the fourth marke called incongruitie of speech, I can hardly giue you any fit example in our natiue tongue, because that our English Adiectiues doe not differ in Case, Gender, and Number, and therefore I pray you content your selfe with this Latine example, for it is an easier matter for an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to speake false Latine, then false English: the Sophister will make you to allow of this false Latine, <hi>mulier est candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> by force of argument thus: <hi>Omnis homo est candidus, at mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier est homo, ergo mulier est candidus;</hi> the English whereof is thus: Euery man is white, but woman is man: <hi>Ergo,</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is white: heere this word white in the Latine is of the Masculine gender, contrarie to the rules of Grammar, but this may be very wel referred to the Fallax, called forme of speech, hereafter declared.</p>
                        <p>Of the fift marke called Nugation, let this be your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: the Sophister will make you to allow of this vaine repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition: <hi>Plato</hi> is learned, a man learned, by force of argument thus: <hi>Plato</hi> is learned, but <hi>Plato</hi> is a man learned: <hi>Ergo, Plato</hi> is learned; a man learned: heere the premisses and the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are all one thing, and therefore contrarie to the rules of Logick. But leauing these things as superfluous, and in my iudgement seruing to small purpose, if I may so say without offence, I minde therefore now to returne to my matter first intended.</p>

                        <p>Composition or coniunction, is the ioyning together of<note place="margin">3 Compositio.</note> things that are to be seuered.

Of like sort is this old iest of a Master that said to his seruant: Go heate this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons legge, who immediately did eate it: then his Master be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angry, said, I bade thee heate it, with an h: no Sir (said the seruant) I did eate it with bread. Likewise this Fallax may chance by not obseruing the right quantitie of syllables, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny word, as <hi>Populus</hi> hauing o, long, is a Popple tree, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing o, short, it signifieth a people. Or when a word vsed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatiuely, is made to haue an Affirmatiue signification, as for example: <hi>Caiphas</hi> said to Christ, Art thou a King? <hi>Ergo,</hi> He confessed Christ to be a King. Or when a word pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ironiously is turned to good earnest, in speaking one thing
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16061:105"/>
and meaning another, as thus: My Master said, Come hither, you honest man: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He said that I was an honest man, when indeed he called him knaue.</p>
                        <p>The Fallax of forme or manner of speech may be diuers<note place="margin">6 Forma Oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note> wayes, as first, when words are falsely supposed to be like ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in signification, in case, or in gender, or to be of one selfe Predicament, because they are like in termination, as <hi>Poeta,</hi> in English a Poet, and <hi>Poema,</hi> in English a Poesie or poeticall worke: these two words, because they end both in a: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are both of the Masculine gender. Also coloured and numbred are like in termination: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are of one selfe Predicament, and yet the first belongeth to the Predicament of qualitie, and the other to quantitie. Secondly, when a word is vsed in one selfe argument, sometime according to his proper signification, and sometime as a terme of Arte: as for example, God is euery where: euery where is an Aduerbe, therefore God is an Aduerbe. A Mouse eateth cheese, but a Mouse is a syllable: <hi>Ergo,</hi> a syllable eateth cheese. Heere Mouse in the Maior hath his proper signification, and in the Minor is vsed as a terme of Arte: and the like is to be said of the word Euery where in the first example. Thirdly, when a word hath not his proper signification, or is not vsed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true phrase of speech wherein it is vttered, as thus: Whatsoeuer thou hast not lost, thou hast still, but thou hast lost no hornes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> thou hast hornes. Heere this word, to lose, hath not his proper signification, for wee are said to lose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that which wee had, and not that which we neuer had. And finally, this Fallax is called the common refuge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of all such kinde of Sophistrie. Hitherto of the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes in words, now of the Fallaxes in things.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Fallacia Accidentis,</hi> may be diuers wayes: as first, when any<note place="margin">1 Fallacia acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis.</note> thing belonging onely to the substance of some thing, is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted also to some accident of the said substance, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, as thus: Whatsoeuer thou hast bought, thou hast eaten, but thou hast bought rawe flesh: <hi>Ergo,</hi> thou hast eaten rawe flesh: heere the Consequent is to be denied, because the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior hath respect to the substance, and the Conclusion to the qualitie. Another example, What I am, thou art not, but I am a man: <hi>Ergo,</hi> thou art none. Heere in this the Maior hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the qualitie, and the Conclusion to the substance. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when Accidents are not rightly ioyned together, as when the qualities of the bodie are ioyned with the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the minde: as <hi>Homer</hi> is a Poet, and <hi>Homer</hi> is blinde: <hi>Ergo, Homer</hi> is a blinde Poet: heere the Conclusion is to bee denied, because to be blinde, and to be a Poet, are diuers qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, whereof the one belongeth to the minde, and the other to the bodie, and therefore are not rightly ioyned together. Thirdly, as (<hi>Melancthon</hi> saith) when an accidentall cause is is made a principall cause, as thus: <hi>Elias</hi> was an holy Prophet, but <hi>Elias</hi> was clad with Camels haire: <hi>Ergo,</hi> I being clad with Camels haire, am a holy Prophet. Heere the Conclusion
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16061:106"/>
is to be denied, because to be clad with Camels haire, was not the cause of <hi>Elias</hi> holinesse. But me thinkes that this and such like examples doe belong rather to the Fallax of <hi>Causa pro non causa</hi> (whereof we shall speake hereafter) then to the Fallax of the Accident.</p>
                        <p>The Fallax <hi>A dicto secundum quid ad dictum Simpliciter,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Dictum secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid.</note> chanceth when we goe about to make a thing to seeme abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that is spoken in some respect, or to be in all, when it is but in part, as a Moore hath white teeth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> a Moore is white. Againe, it may be in respect, by reason of time, place, person, comparison, and such like. Of time as thus: I saw <hi>Iohn</hi> yesterday, but I saw him not to day: <hi>Ergo,</hi> I did see him, and not see him. Of place thus: It is not good to buy and sell in the Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not good to buy and sell. Of person thus: A Magistrate may kill a theefe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> euery man may kill a theefe. Of comparison, thus: Riches are not good to him that cannot vse them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Riches are not good.</p>
                        <p>Hauing now to speake of the Fallax, called the Ignorance<note place="margin">3 Ignoratio Elen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi.</note> of the Elench: I thinke good to call againe to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the definition of an Elench before briefely set downe, which is a Syllogisme rightly gathering a Conclusion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the assertion of the respondent, which contrarietie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of foure principall points or respects, whereof, if any be wanting, then the contrarietie is not perfect.</p>

                     <div type="question_and_answer">
                        <head>Which be those foure points?</head>
                        <p>First, that it be to one selfe thing. Secondly, in one selfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. Thirdly, in one selfe manner. And fourthly, in or at one selfe time: for if you be deceiued at any time by some false Elench, in thinking that it rightly gathereth a Conclusion meere contrarie to your assertion, when it is not so indeed, by reason that it faileth in some part requisite and incident to a true Elench: then it may be rightly said that you are deceiued by ignorance of the Elench, which Fallax, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, comprehendeth almost all others, and therefore he maketh a long and obscure definition of an Elench, rehearsing all the particularities thereof, nothing apt to be vttered in our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish tongue.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="question_and_answer">

                        <head>Yet I pray you to giue examples of the foure chiefe points before mentioned.</head>
                        <p>Of the first, let this bee your example: foure is double to two, but not to three: <hi>Ergo,</hi> foure is double and not double; this is not to one selfe thing. Of the second thus: This peece of timber is double in length to that peece, but it is not dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the same in breadth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is to one selfe thing, both double, and not double to one selfe thing, but not in one selfe respect. Of the third thus: This Prince ruleth mightily, but not mercifully: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he ruleth, and not ruleth; this is not in like manner. Of the fourth thus: I saw <hi>Iohn</hi> yesterday, but not this day: <hi>Ergo,</hi> I saw him, and saw him not; this is not in one selfe time. And all these foure wayes in mine opinion are comprehended in the second point; which is when any thing is spoken not absolutely, but in diuers respects: wherefore, it differeth not much from the Fallax of speech respectiue before declared, sauing that this Fallax is more generall, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth more kindes of Fallaxes then that doth.</p>
                        <p>Petition of the Principle is, when the Antecedent doth not<note place="margin">4 Petitio prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipij.</note> proue the consequent, which chanceth most commonly three manner of wayes: that is, eyther when the proofe is as little knowne, as the thing that is to be proued. Secondly, when the proofe is lesse knowne then the thing to be proued. Thirdly, when the proofe, and the thing to be proued, doe not differ, but is all one speech, signifying one selfe thing, called of the Greekes <hi>Tautologia.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="question_and_answer">
                        <head>Giue example of these three wayes.</head>
                        <p>Of the first thus: The Sunne moueth not, but standeth still in the middest of heauen, giuing light to all the world: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the earth is moueable; or thus: The Heauens are not made of Elementall matter, subiect to corruption: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Heauens are incorruptible. Heere in both these examples the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is as doubtfull as the Consequent, and therefore proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing. Of the second way thus: Euery sensible bodie sometime sleepeth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Man sometime sleepeth. Heere it is more to be doubted whether all sensible Bodies, all Beastes, Fowles and Fishes, doe sometimes sleepe or not, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16061:107"/>
man doth sometime sleepe: for it is an easier matter to knowe the nature and propertie of one speciall kinde, then of all, or many kindes. Of the third way, thus: <hi>Iohn</hi> is learned: <hi>Ergo, Iohn</hi> is learned. The soule doth liue euer: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</p>
                        <p>The Fallax of the Consequent chanceth two manner of<note place="margin">5 Fallacia Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentis.</note> wayes, that is, either when wee thinke the Consequent to be conuertible with the Antecedent, but it is not so in deede, or else when we thinke, that vpon the contrary of the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, the contrary of the Consequent must needes also follow.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="question_and_answer">
                        <head>Giue examples of both these wayes.</head>
                        <p>This is a man: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a sensible body: now if I would hereof by conuersion conclude thus: it is a sensible bodie: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> it is a man: this were no good Consequent; for euery sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bodie is not a man. Likewise when it raineth, the ground is wette: <hi>Ergo,</hi> when the ground is wette, it rayneth; for these speaches are not conuertible. Of the second way thus: It is a man: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a sensible body. It is no man: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is no sensible body. Here you see that this Proposition, it is no man, is the contrary of the first Antecedent, which saith, It is a man. Of which contrary, the contrary of the Consequent doeth not necessarily sollowe: for though it bee no man, yet it may be some other sensible bodie. This Fallax compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth all such false Arguments, as do not obserue the Rules of right and true Consequents before giuen.</p>
                        <p>The Fallax of <hi>non causa pro causa,</hi> is, when that thing is<note place="margin">6 Causa pro non causa.</note> made to bee the cause of the Conclusion, which is not the cause in deede; as Wine is naught, because it will make a man drunke. Of which drunkennesse, Wine is not the cause, but the intemperance of the man, and his immoderate vse thereof, for many things that be good of themselues may bee abused, yea, euen the libertie of the Gospell, and yet the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospell is not cause thereof, but the malice of<note place="margin">7 Plura interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta pro vno re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsu.</note> man abusing the same.</p>
                        <p>The seuenth and last Fallax, is when vnaduisedly, and without vsing any distinction, you make an answere to manie
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16061:107"/>
questions, as though they were but one; as for example, The Sophister, seeing two men standing together, whereof the one is blinde, and the other hath his fight, will aske you perhaps whether they see, or not; whereunto if you answere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, either yea, or no, you are by and by taken: for if you say that they see, then you grant that the blind man also seeth, and if you say, that they doe not see, then you grant, that he which seeth, is blinde; but if you answere, that the one seeth, and the other not, you shall by such distinction easily auoid the Sophisters cauillation: for diuers questions hudled vp in one, doe alwayes require diuers answeres. And thus I ende, with the order of confuting all false Elenches, and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes; the knowledge whereof is very necessary, for the maintenance of the trueth, which God loueth, who is the fountaine of all trueth, yea, and very trueth it selfe; to whom be all honour, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and prayse, world without end,</p>
