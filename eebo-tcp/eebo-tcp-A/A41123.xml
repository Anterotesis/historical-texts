            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Should all men be ſilent, <hi>ſtones would ſpeak</hi> for him; thoſe at leaſt, of whom through Gods mercy he <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up children to Abraham.</hi> He was a man of great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, great experiences, and great induſtry; which three concurring, muſt needs make him <hi>a workman that needs not be aſhamed.</hi> He was a man well ſeen in the ſtate of ſoules, and one who knew with wonderfull pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and judgement to accommodate himſelfe to mens various conditions, which is a chiefe part of a ſpirituall Phyſitian. The ſubject here preſented to thee is of great worth, and great difficulty, it is about the beſt created object, a Saint, <hi>&amp; de corruptione optimi,</hi> the corruption of the beſt, the eclipſes of thoſe Lights; the falls, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the tremblings of thoſe pillars: a point wherein, if in any, there is need of great accurateneſs, leſt a man <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whiles he avoyds one extreame runs into another: Need of great warineſs,<note place="margin">Quae Deus abſcondit, ne ſcrute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur; quae in apertum protulit ne negligamus; ne aut unâ ex parte nimiae curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitatis, aut alterâ iugra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis damnemur.</note> leſt a man either harden the hearts and ſtrengthen the hands of evill doers, or ſadden the hearts of thoſe whom God would not have made ſad. It is one of thoſe points which, it is like, many think fitter to be ſmothered in perpetuall ſilence, becauſe of the ſad conſequences will almoſt unavoidably follow upon it. But ſurely there is a great deale of truth in that ſaying, <hi>To ſearch into thoſe things which God hath thought fit to conceale is boldneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:94114:3"/>
and curioſity; to neglect thoſe things which God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led is groſſe ingratitude.</hi> And therefore leaving events to God, for our parts we conceive the pains of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Authour are to good purpoſe, and ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject deſerved to be handled by ſuch an hand. The former part (ſetting aſide what concerns the Miniſters of Chriſt, &amp;c.) ſpeaks to dead Chriſtians, to the ſect of <hi>Nominales,</hi> ſuch as had meerly <hi>a name to live, but were dead</hi>; and diſtinguiſheth between the dead child and the living. This ſecond part ſpeaks to the diſtempers of living Chriſtians, who, though they <hi>ſhall not ſee death,</hi> yet may with <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> be brought <hi>nigh unto death</hi>; yea, with <hi>Eutychus</hi> may be taken up for dead, and ſo judged by the ſtanders by: You have here a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in his Autumne, or his winter, wanting not onely the bloſſome of a glorious profeſſion, but alſo the fruit of a pious converſation for ought that either himſelfe or others converſing with him can diſcover.</p>
            <p>Surely this is one of the ſaddeſt and moſt amazing meditations that a gracious heart can pitch upon: it is one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the hidden things of God, which we ſhall never throughly underſtand the reaſon of, <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec Elias venerit,</hi> untill the comming of <hi>Elias:</hi> for the proſecution of this point, the Authour takes that courſe which a prudent Phyſician doth in the cure of bodily diſtempers: Firſt, he opens the natures, ſhews the cauſes, gives the ſignes both Diagnoſtick and Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick; and then comes to the Therapeutick part. And all of them handled ſo ſubſtantially, and ſeriouſly (<hi>pro more ſuo</hi>) that we doubt not, thoſe that feare God will look upon it as a ſingular providence of God, that hath brought ſuch a Treaſure to light. We may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that it will be a Book wherein the people of God vvill be ſeriouſly converſant, the ſubject matter thereof being of ſuch conſtant and neceſſary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>To this is added a Treatiſe of <hi>Effectuall Calling</hi>; and

Point why a child of God may think he is dead, or dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when there is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and that is this, Why a child of God may think himſelf to be dead when he is not, and think he is grown deader then ever he was, and there is no ſuch matter; and others may think he is grown cold and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and yet the truth is, he is more affected, and more alive towards God then formerly; this is a very needful point, and there be ſeveral cauſes of falſe livelineſs which a child of God may have, and when they go away he may ſeem to be deader then he was, whereas indeed he is not ſo.<note place="margin">Seven caſes of falſe liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is novelty of Religion and grace, when grace is yet new, and the word comes freſh to a man, and the promiſes of eternal life look freſhly into a mans heart, they will affect him much,<note place="margin">1. Novelty of Religion and grace.</note> and not only raiſe his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied affections, but his unſanctified too; for the unſanctified affections will ſtir at a novelty; a man that hath no grace at all, nor any life, will be ſtirred at a new thing; as when the Apoſtle preached new doctrine to the <hi>Athenians, Acts</hi> 17.32. <hi>we will hear thee again of this matter,</hi> ſay they; they cared not how often they heard this, becauſe it was news to them; ſo when Chriſt preached up and down, O what new doctrine is this! ſay they, <hi>never man ſpake as this man, Joh.</hi> 7.46. it was a new kind of preaching, new gifts, this ſtirred them mightily; ſo it may be with a true Chriſtian, when the word of God comes firſt to him, and grace comes firſt to him, the novelty of grace may affect him; when God firſt opens his eyes, how ſtrangely will he be moved in prayer? how ſtrangely will he carry himſelf at a Sermon? his very bowels yearn at a Sermon, and he will cry out, Oh the infinite mercy of God to my ſoul! what a beaſt was I before? I was an hell-hound, a child of the Divel; and now the Lord hath made me a child of God; I went on in the high way to perdition, and now God hath brought me into the right way; this is admirable; but do you think theſe are all good affections? there is a great deal of corruption in theſe; as new Beer, when it is firſt tunned, it hath a great deal of working then, but when it is ſtaler, it doth not work ſo much, yet then is the Beer more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and hath more life; as it is with a mans firſt entrance into an hot bath, it doth ſo ſtir him, as if it did ſcald him, but after he hath been in a while, he is ſenſible of little or no heat; the heat is as much as it was at the firſt, and works upon him as much, but he feels it not ſo much; ſo a good Chriſtian doth not ſeem to be ſo much affected afterwards as formerly; are his true affections therefore down? no, but his unſanctified ones are down; may be a man hath not loſt a jot of his true, and ſound, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied affections, but only his unſanctified ones; for when grace comes firſt into the ſoul of a new convert, there is a greater Army raiſed up for God
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94114:11"/>
then is likely to continue; there are a company of mercenary Souldiers ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſeem to go out and to fight for God, as well as the reſt; you ſhall have more fears in that man, then are true; and more deſires after grace then are true; carnal deſires, and joys, and delights, theſe will be all up at the firſt, and will go out, though they never go to the journeys end; it is with a new convert, at his ſetting out towards heaven, as it was with the children of Iſrael, when they came out of <hi>Egypt, there was a mixed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude went up with them, Exod.</hi> 12.38. why? the plagues of God had wrought upon many of the Egyptians, and they would go up with them, but they would not go into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but returned back again; the true Iſraelites, that were affected truly, they only went into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; but a mixed company went up with them; ſo when a man ſets forth towards heaven, there is a mixed company in that mans boſome, goeth along with him, mixed joy, and fear, and hope, and even corrupt nature is raiſed up at firſt; for you muſt think the fears of God lying upon the ſoul, and the newneſs of Religion, (he was in hell before, now he is in heaven) that will raiſe up even corrupt nature, for a time a man will ſeem to be ſo affected and ſo lively; now after a while theſe mercenary Souldiers, this mixed company go back again, and leave nothing but the bare ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied affections; and now the man ſeems to be deader then he was; as if he had loſt all; and may be he complains he is not the man he was he was thus, and thus moved before, and enlarged to good duties, now he is down the wind; I ſay this doth not follow, it is even as if a man that hath bought a buſhel of peaſe at the Market, when they are ſhell'd, and the pods are off, and none but the bare peaſe left, ſhould complain he hath leſs then he had at firſt; ſo it is here, there is nothing gone but the meer traſh and husks; when a man is firſt converted, there is a great deal of traſh with it, a great deal of corrupt nature that will leave a man in the lurch afterwards: yet it follows not, but the man hath the ſame ſanctified affections he had formerly.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Violent Commotions.</note> Violent commotions may ſtir a man, and make him ſeem to be more affected then he is; there are many ſeem to be full of life, whereas, if they were ſearched to the bottome, there is nothing but violent commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that will come to nothing; a child of God at firſt ſetting out, may be marvellouſly quickned &amp; ſtirred, and ſeem to be mighty zealous and fervent, when in truth the greateſt part of this is nothing but violent commotions; a little grace will ſeem a great deal when there are theſe violent ſtirrings; this man will make a greater ſhew, then the ſame godly man afterwards, when he hath more grace a great deal; as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſeemed to be very zealous, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.54. as zealous as <hi>Elias</hi>; you will ſay were they not affected? when they ſaw the <hi>Samaritans</hi> would not receive Chriſt, oh thought they, they deſerve to be burnt down to the ground; <hi>Wilt thou that we command fire, to come down from heaven to conſume them, as</hi> Elias <hi>did?</hi> they could have been content to have fired whole Towns that would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt; you will ſay this is admirable; but theſe were nothing but violent commotions; now when Chriſt had ſtilled theſe violent commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will you ſay they were grown cold and dead, and not ſo lively as formerly? you know the torrent, though it run not ſo violently as in a great flood, yet ſtill it runs; ſo it is here, may be a godly Miniſter at his firſt entrance puts forth himſelf more, and preaches as if he would fly in the face of the ungodly; afterwards he preacheth more gently and evenly; ſhall we ſay he is grown more dull and dead, and not ſo well affected as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? no, he may be more affected; ſo for a private Chiſtian, it may be ſo ſoon as ever God turned his heart and inclined him towards his heavenly Kingdom, and made him look out for the good of his ſoul

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Indiſcretion will make a man ſeem to be more affected then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is: as a godly man that is raſh and indiſcreet, let this man reprove a ſin, he will be ſo zealous and earneſt, nay, he will be ſo cholerick, that if you do not yeild preſently, he is in a combuſtion; afterwards, when God gives him more knowledge of his waies, and more diſcretion to reprove ſin, he will not be ſo cholerick, and in ſuch a paſſion; hath this man loſt his affections now? no, this doth not follow; he may keep his affections ſtill, and it may be hates ſin a thouſand times more then he did before, but he goes another way to work, and deals more compoſedly, and gravely, and zealouſly, for the good of the mans ſoul; as when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> ſo loving in the midſt of all his afflictions and ſufferings for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels ſake, ſending him ſo many hundred miles a great preſent to relieve him in his neceſſity, what doth he do? doth he bid them abate their love? no, <hi>encreaſe in it more and more</hi> ſaith he, but let it be <hi>with knowledge and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Phil.</hi> 1.9. a man that is of a loving nature, when he hath pared off all fooliſh charity, and all vain and proud charity, whereby he doth things out of pride, oſtentation, and vanity, as he will do when he comes to have more underſtanding; if he do not diſcern and compare himſelf with the word of God, he may ſeem to abate in his love, but he is not leſs loving but more judicious. So <hi>Samuel</hi> at firſt, he was ſo zealous againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> when he had ſinned againſt Gods commandment, that he would not ſtay with him by any means: no, ſaith he, <hi>you have rejected the word of the Lord,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> confeſſed his ſins, and entreated him to ſtay, and was very earneſt; no, by no means; <hi>what, ſtay with a wretch that hath rejected the word of the Lord?</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. yet afterwards he did ſtay; will you ſay now <hi>Samuel</hi> was grown cold, and leſs affected againſt ſin? no, but he was more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; he begun to conſider, certainly if I do not ſtay, it will be a diſparagement to the Lords anointed; I may diſparage the Lords ordinance, and diſparage the Kings Authority, and cauſe the people to ſcorn him; he began to ſee that <hi>Saul</hi> ſpake with ſenſe, <hi>honour me before the people</hi>; and he did ſtay then; now he was not leſs affected, but more judicious.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Preſumption may make a man ſeem to be more affected and quickned a great deal then indeed he is; as <hi>Peter,</hi> he ſeemed to be ſo mightily tranſported and enlarged towards Chriſt, and ſo full of zeal for him; <hi>though all men forſake thee, yet will not I</hi>: he thought he was ſo affected, that he could compare with all the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, and go beyond them all; but afterwards when Chriſt asked him, <hi>Peter, loveſt thou me?</hi> ſee his anſwer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.15. his anſwer was nakedly, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee</hi>; he would make no more compariſons; though Chriſt put him upon it there, yet he would not be brought to compare any more. Now was he leſs affected towards Chriſt? no, but he was leſs preſumptuous.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Activeneſs of natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> Activeneſs of natural diſpoſition may make a man ſeem to be more affected then indeed he is; for a man the more active his nature is, and the more ſpirits he hath, the more ſtirring he hath; a man that hath ſuch a diſpoſition, will go further then another of a ſlower ſpirit; there is a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94114:12"/>
great deal more grace required to make an heavy dull natured man to ſpeak a word for God, then to make a cholerick man ſtrike a blow for God; mens natures differ, ſome men are more active naturally; may be one man is full of activity and ſtirring, another man is of a dull diſpoſition; will you ſay this man is deader then he? no, this man may have more life of grace then he; it is as if one man ſhould ſwim with the ſtream, and another againſt the ſtream<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he that ſwims with the ſtream, will more eaſily ſwim a mile, then he that ſwims againſt the ſtream, will ſwim half a mile; will you ſay that this man cannot ſwim ſo well as the other? no, he may be a better ſwimmer of the twain; for this is the thing, we are not to judge of the life of our grace, by what we do, but by what labour we take in doing, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>remembring without ceaſing, your work of faith, and labour of love,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. may be another man is of a more loving nature then this man, but the man that is more unkinde naturally, and harſh-natured, he labours a thouſand times more abundantly then the other; who hath moſt grace of love now? the other hath moſt natural love, but this man hath more grace of love, as <hi>Paul</hi> proves he had the life of grace in him, becauſe <hi>he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more abundantly then they all</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not what thou doeſt, but what thou laboreſt to do, he that ſwims down the ſtream, doth not labour, if he ſhould do nothing but ſtir his hands and feet without any labour, the ſtream will carry him, ſo when a man hath nature to help him, he need not labour much, but when a man muſt fetch all out of the hard flint, how is he fain to labour? there thou mayſt try the life of thy affections, not by what thou prayeſt, but by what thou laboureſt in prayer, not by what thou remembreſt at a Sermon, but though thou haſt a blockiſh memory, how doſt thou labour to remember? ſo it is not the not doing of ſin, but the labouring againſt ſin, hereby thou mayſt know whither they zeal and affection be abated in thee: So again for a mans ſelf, may be he was more active heretofore, had a more nimble ſpirit and temper of body, now he is grown more ſad and melancholy, his head is diſtempered and grown more weak, his memory fails, and his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding decayes, that quick diſpoſition of his body is taken down, and he cannot do as he did before, is the man therefore not ſo quickned as he was before? is he grown more dead? may be the man complains, certainly he hath cauſe to ſuſpect himſelf, and he doth not think he is right; formerly he could remember a Sermon, be fixed in meditation, be attentive at the word, be fervent in prayer, and put forth himſelf in this faſhion: now he cannot, he was ſo lively before, now he hath not the ſame activity, and therefore begins to call all into queſtion, certainly all is not right. I anſwer, this doth not follow; it is true, in many a man it is the deadneſs of his heart, and the decayedneſs of his ſpiritual eſtate that cauſeth this, but it doth not follow that it is ſo with thee, but the cauſe is this, may be thou haſt worn out thy tools, therefore no marvel thou canſt not work ſo well as formerly; take a skilful Muſitian, whoſe inſtrument is crackt and marred, he cannot make ſo good muſick upon this inſtrument, as he could when it was ſound; doth it follow, he hath loſt his skill? no, give this man a ſound inſtrument, as he had before, and he will play as well as ever; all our operations, not only external, but alſo internal, do much depend upon the diſpoſition of the body; as for meditation, may be when the body was lively and active, a man could fix his meditations upon a thing, now it is weakned he cannot; may be he hath the ſame deſire and delight as he had before, but he cannot do it; ſo may be he hath as great a deſire as ever to remember the word, but his memory is gone; ſo may be he hath as great a deſire to put forth himſelf in any ordinance of God as ever in all his life, but his body will not bear it; I ſay, the ſpirits depend much upon the body; you may ſee this in natural operations; let a mans eyes fail, will any man
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94114:12"/>
ſay, that the ſoul of that man is leſs able to ſee then it was? no, the ſoul is as able to ſee in a blind man, as in a ſeeing man; in an old man whoſe eyes fail him, as in a young man that hath the quickeſt ſight; if this man had an excellent eye given him, he would ſee as well as any body elſe; the ſoul is able to do it, but it wants a tool; ſo many Saints of God, cannot do many duties as they were wont, not for want of love and zeal, and affections, but for want of tools; it is ſaid 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.16. <hi>that when</hi> David <hi>waxed old, they would not let him go out into the field</hi>; did they look upon <hi>David</hi> now as leſs worthy then before? no, they looked upon him as more worthy then before; the text ſaith, they looked upon him as the <hi>very light of Iſrael,</hi> though he could not fight for Iſrael ſo well as he did before; ſo you ſhall ſee many a godly man, and reverend father upon his death bed, ſhews no great matter in his dying; what, becauſe he is dead, and is not the man he was? no, but becauſe he hath worn out his tools; he is not the man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of operation, though he hath the ſame affections he had formerly.</p>

Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary aſſiſtance</note> Extraordinary aſſiſtance may make a man ſeem to be more lively and quickned then indeed he is; for God doth aſſiſt his people extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in their beginning; 'tis true ſome of his people he doth extraordinarily aſſiſt all their life long, but he doth not uſually do it, he doth chooſe rather extraordinarily to ſtrive and help his people at the firſt, and afterwards he helps them only ordinarily, leaving them to fight with their own corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; why? becauſe it is an extraordinary caſe; when a child is young, his parents will extraordinarily help him to go, and will not let the weight of his body li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, he had extraordinary aſſiſtance before, now he is left to himſelf and to his own legs; ſo it is with God towards his children; at firſt, when they are new beginners, when they are newly born again, he takes compaſſion upon them extraordinarily, helps them in prayer, and againſt their corrupt luſts; and if the Lord ſhould not do thus, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould ſtand, as the Lord ſaith of <hi>Ephraim, when he was a child I loved him, and taught him to go, Hoſ.</hi> 11.1, 3. he carried him in his arms as a child, when he was young; afterwards he looks he ſhould go alone; not as if any of Gods children could go alone, they have need of his help every day; but they muſt go alone in reſpect of extraordinary help; for God hath given them acceſs to the throne of grace, and hath given them underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſome ſtrength; and he looks they ſhould uſe theſe things not as though they could uſe them without his aſſiſtance, but without extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary aſſiſtance; now when God leaves his child to walk by himſelf, he will fall oftner then before; you ſhall have many grown Chriſtians fall oftner then young beginners; why? becauſe they are weaker and leſs quickned? no, but becauſe they have no ſuch extraordinary aſſiſtance; they can go alone. I ſpeak not as though it were without the aſſiſtance of God, but without extraordinary aſſiſtance; and though for want of care and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs they get a fall, yet they are not weaker; few new beginners ever fell as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> fell afterwards; no, the Lord bears them in his arms, but afterwards he lets them go alone; now when the Saints of God feel duties to come on ſo heavily, extraordinary aſſiſtance being gone, they think they are grown dead and lumpiſh; why? the load lies heavier upon their own backs then ever it did before; yet it doth not follow they are more dead; a child whom his father bears in his arms, may be carried along from one end of the houſe to the other, ſooner then another child that goes alone, can go it in thrice as much time; will you ſay this child is weaker then the

other? no, this child goes alone, and the other is extraordinarily helped; ſo the people of God, when they are firſt converted, they muſt know they are extraordinarily aſſiſted, and they muſt take heed leſt they be proud and conceited; oh they may think they have gotten ſuch a deal of grace and life already; no, no, alas you ſhall ſee what you have when you go alone.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7 Freedom from tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</note> Freedom from temptations may make a man ſeem to be more quickned then he is; as a heavy dull tempered man, may go faſter a great deal having no clog, then the nimbleſt man in the Country with a clog at his heels; a man at his firſt converſion, God will not let him be tempted, he is but in his nonage, in his entrance into the Kingdom of God, and if God ſhould let temptations preſently fly upon him, before he hath more grace and judgement, and more experience of the vileneſs of his own heart, and the goodneſs of God, he would break<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his neck; now God will never ſuffer a man to be tempted above what he is able; therefore when his people are firſt converted, he frees them from temptations a while, and then they go roundly on; afterwards when they have been ten or twenty or thirty years in grace, may be they are fouly overtaken, and go heavily on; ſhall they therefore complain they are deader then they were? as an horſe, when he carries ſingle may go roundly; afterwards, the ſame horſe being put to carry double, he goes more heavily; will a man ſay the mettal of the horſe is grown worſe? no, but he carries double; ſo it is with the Saints of God; may be formerly they carried ſingle, now they carry double; the Lord lets more temptations fall upon them then he did before; will you ſay that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was grown cold, becauſe he had gotten that vile cuſtome of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court? he never ſware at home, alas he had no temptations at home; if he had had thoſe temptations at home, and had had no more grace then he had then, it would have been the bane o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For firſt, This may greatly embolden the adverſaries of the Church of God. In ſome ſenſe it were well that the adverſaries of the Church did think the Church were more lively then they are; it might be a great means to curb them of doing that they do; as it is noted of the Scribes and Phariſees, that conceiving that the people were more lively then they were, it did withhold them from what they otherwiſe would have done; as when Chriſt ſpake of <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm, they would have vilified it, but that they thought the people were ſo affected to his miniſtry, that they would ſtone them; I do not think they were ſo affected and wrought upon; I do not think there would have been ſuch a ſtir in the Country, but this was wel they thought ſo, for it ſaved a great deal of miſchief, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.25. <hi>when the good mans ſervants were aſleep, then the enemies ſowed tares</hi>; ſo when the enemies of the Church ſhall ſee thee grown dull and careleſs, and ſleepy, the Sabbaths are little ſanctified, and the holy ordinances of God, and powerful preaching little looked after, nay even ſuch as were ſtrict people are grown cold; this doth embolden them to bring in errors, and broach what they liſt, when they durſt not do it if the Church were lively; ſo that it is ſomething dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to tell this in <hi>Gath,</hi> and publiſh it in the ſtreets of <hi>Aſhkalon.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, This may hearten abundance that are ſtanders by, that are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, to be hardned under their deadneſs, and to be ſecure; for when a Miniſter ſhall ſhew how that the children of God may be marvellouſly dead, and may be quite off the hooks, and their zeal be quite gone, the life and livelineſs that hath been formerly is not ſeen; when they hear this, this may help them to hope, 'tis true I am dead, and my heart is like a ſtone in prayer, and like a block at the hearing of the word of God; I have no ſpirit, nor heat, nor affections in the ordinance of God; yet Gods bleſſing on the Miniſters heart; I heard him ſay a child of God might be dead like a dead tree, and I hope I may be a child of God for all this; no queſtion when a carnal heart ſhall read how Chriſt upbraided his own Diſciples with unbelief and hardneſs of heart, no queſtion when they read ſuch paſſages, but they have a great deal of ſuccour to their own conſciences; for when their conſciences flie in their faces for their unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and heartleſſeneſs in any thing that is good, they think the Saints of God have a great deal of heartleſſeneſs, and ſo reckon themſelves to be Saints of God; and ſo the Church of God when it was grown to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous remiſs, and prophane, and looſe (<hi>Jer.</hi> 7.) though God had told the ten Tribes that he would out them off, yet they comforted themſelves; how did they comfort themſelves? they comforted themſelves in this, they thought verily they were a Church; ſo people, if they can get any word that falls out of the Miniſters mouth that may make for themſelves, they catch at it; if any word drop out from a Miniſters mouth, or if any miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage or diſtemper be ſeen in a godly mans life, they lie at catch for theſe things; therefore it is dangerous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is dangerous becauſe it may teach people how to be dead; nay, people that were ſtirred at their deadneſs, and ſaw an infinite need of laying it aſide, and took pains to do it, yet when they hear this Doctrine, through the corruption of their own hearts, they may grow careleſs, and think,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94114:14"/>
what need I keep ſuch a pudder? I am a child of God ſtill, though I am ſo dead and heartleſs, and have no more feeling under Gods word, yet I may be a child of God; I heard a Miniſter make an excellent Sermon upon that point, that a child of God may be very dead; but let me tell you, if any of you came to Church this day with a kind of joy and delight, oh, this day we ſhall hear how a child of God may be dead; if it be thus, you may juſtly fear that you have a rotten heart; for what is this a ſign of? but that your hearts lie at catch, and if you have but any argument to make you think you are a child of God, this is enough; I know this may be a comfort to the children of God, but they are ſuch as are abſolutely dejected and caſt down, and wrought upon; and whatſoever they hear out of the word of God, they uſe it for their help, that they may be recovered out of their deadneſs; but if any of you hear this to the end you may be ſecure, this will be your bane.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Though it be dangerous,<note place="margin">5. Needfulneſs of the point.</note> yet it is a neceſſary point to be inſiſted upon, the people of God may have need of it; but you will ſay, it is pitty ſuch a Sermon ſhould be preached to ſhew how far a child of God may be dead, there be ſo many ſtumbling blocks, and ſuch a deal of miſchief; I anſwer, whatſoever truth may tend to the eſtabliſhing of the people of God, and the building of faith, is not to be omitted, though thouſands of reprobates break their necks at it; as Chriſt, when the Phariſees ſtumbled at his doctrine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.12. ſee how he anſwers, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted up</hi>; ſo I ſay we muſt hazard that; we muſt tell people what danger they may catch if they take not heed; and we muſt deliver the truth, for it is helpful to the people of God; we know that the credit of his ſervants is precious in his ſight; and yet he hath diſgraced his ſervants in the Scriptures as it were, and hath left their dulneſs and untowardneſs upon record, that the world may know it; as who ſhould ſay, it is of ſuch uſe to all generations to know this, that it may not be concealed from the world; you may ſee thoſe horrible ſins of <hi>David,</hi> and fowl offences, that one would think the ſpirit of God would caſt a vail over; yet he is ſo far from hiding of that his murther and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and making <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> drunk, that he doth not only record his murther and adultery once, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. but again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. and committed the Pſalm to the Muſitian, to be ſung in the Church to the end of the world; ſo <hi>Peters</hi> denial of his Maſter, one would have thought the Scripture would have ſaid nothing of that; what a Diſciple of Chriſt to deny his maſter, and curſe and ban himſelf? yet the ſpirit of God is ſo earneſt to have this known, that he will have all the Evangeliſts ſet it down; you have things of great importance, that our eternal life depends upon, yet there is but one Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt toucheth them; but every one tells us of <hi>Peters</hi> fault; how ſhamefully he did forget himſelf, and how he was carried away with his luſts, ſo that it is very needful to be known: now then to come to the ſixth thing,<note place="margin">6. How far forth a child of God may be dead.</note> how far a child of God may be dead; for this we will ſhew you theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he may loſe all his zeal; you know zeal is a thing that God bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth his people with, not only with the holy Ghoſt, but with fire; yet a child of God if he ſtand not upon his guard, and looks to himſelf, if he grow ſecure and drowſie and give way to ſin, he may come to this, to loſe his zeal, it was the caſe of many of Gods people in <hi>Laodicea,</hi> though the chiefeſt bulke in the Town were lukewarm; yet it is plain that many of thoſe that were neither hot nor cold, were Gods own children; for he ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>as many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten</hi>: ſo in the daies of <hi>Saul,</hi> when Religion went down the wind, and the Ordinances of God were ſlacked, every thing went to wrack during his government, you ſhall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94114:15"/>
ſee how the Church of God had loſt their zeal, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.16. it is ſaid there, that when <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath</hi> came into the hoſt, and all Iſrael were there, and the main bulke of the Church of God were looking on, and hearing what this fowlmouth ſaid, there he ſtood defying and blaſpheming the Army of God, and he ſhewed himſelf ſo forty daies together, and all Iſrael heard him, and they were all dull and blockiſh, and not a man ſtepped out to hazard his life to appear in Gods cauſe, until it pleaſed God to make a little child take up a weapon, and fight againſt him; ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt ſhews us in the laſt times (which is ſtrange) for in the laſt times knowledge ſhall abound, <hi>the love of many ſhall wax cold, Mat.</hi> 24.12. you know what zeal is; it is when a man doth not only walk in Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements and do them, but uſeth Gods arguments, and uſeth them with all his heart, and ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold on God; he preſſeth hard after the mark; he is a man that ſtands upon his guard; a man that will be preciſe and ſtrict in every thing; he will eſchue every evil; if he find any luſt riſing, he is never at quiet till he get it down again; if this man be in company, he will not ſtand upon curteſie to ſee who will begin to ſpeak, but if others will not, he will; and he will not ſtand upon terms and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, but come what can come, he will ſtand for God; now 'tis ſtrange how this zeal may be taken off, in a man that is otherwiſe a good man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He may loſe all his affections, which is a ſtrange thing; you know what the affections are, they are the wings of the ſoul; if the wings be off, the bird cannot flie; now a child of God may loſe all his affections; as it was with <hi>Sardis,</hi> they had not only loſt all their zeal, but their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. <hi>ſtrengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die</hi>; they had loſt all, and but a little remained, and that little was ready to die;<note place="margin">2 Chro. 16.</note> what a poor heartleſs, lifeleſs creature was <hi>Aſa?</hi> he was grown to that paſs, that though God ſent his Prophets to him, yet his affections were not ſtirred; nay, they were ſtirred the clean contrary way; he was angry with him; and when God laid afflictions upon him, he was ſo little affected with his ſins, that he ſought not to the Lord, but to the Phyſitians; a child of God may loſe his ſorrow and grief for ſin; though he be privy to a world of corruption and diſtempers, and dulneſs, and blockiſhneſs, yet he is not able to relent and grieve for them, there is no ſorrow in his heart; as <hi>David,</hi> when he had committed thoſe horrible ſins, there were no affections in him; when <hi>Joab</hi> ſent him word that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> was dead, which he had a hand in, one would have thought it ſhould have made him cry and roar, and made his heart to burſt; but he was ſo far from being affected with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, as that he made nothing of it; oh ſaith he, tell <hi>Joab, the ſword kills one as well as another,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.25. ſo a child of God may loſe all the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſhame. It is one of the duties we owe to God, that all the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and untowardneſs that is in us, we ſhould be aſhamed of them; now a child of God may loſe this ſhame; <hi>David</hi> when he had committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, he was not aſhamed of it, he did not bluſh, nay he was impudent, he durſt let his ſervants know it, and be privy to his villany; he could ſay to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>go and fetch me the woman,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. Again, he may loſe all his delights in good duties, and the ordinances of God; he may go to them, but with poor delight; what poor delight do you think <hi>David</hi> had in good duties for the ſpace of ten months, till <hi>Nathan</hi> came unto him? we may well think what a blockiſh and feared heart he had; again, he may loſe all his deſires and yearnings; he may pray, and have no heart to lift up his ſoul to God, and be earneſt for the having of thoſe graces he ſtands in need of, but pray ſo coldly, as if indeed he would teach God to deny him; again, he may loſe all his fear, he may grow to be ſo marvellous venterous and bold, he may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94114:15"/>
grow to be familiar with ſins, he may grow to come neer the occaſions of ſin, and thruſt himſelf upon temptation; again, he may loſe his affections of love, and have hardly any love at all to God, as Chriſt complains of <hi>Simon,</hi> who otherwiſe was a good man; he <hi>forgave his ſins,</hi> and yet he complains <hi>he loved him but a little, Luke</hi> 7.44. <hi>ſc.</hi> in one word, a child of God may loſe all his affections.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He may grow to be even ſenſeleſs of ſin, and of the grace of God; I may ſhew this in divers examples; to inſtance in the Patriarchs, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired the death of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> afterwards flung him into a ditch, which was a moſt horrible and unnatural thing; one would think this ſhould have been as an arrow unto their hearts, and they ſhould have been aſhamed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but were they ſenſible of this, or moved at it? no, but <hi>they ſate down to eat and drink</hi> when they had done, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. ſo for the children of Iſrael in the wilderneſs, when they had committed that horrible ſin, of making a golden calf, and the Text ſhews that many of the children of God were guilty of it; when they had done, did their hearts ſmite them? were they affected with their ſin? did it work any impreſſion upon their hearts? no, <hi>they ſate down to eat and drink, and roſe up to play, Exod.</hi> 32.6. ſo <hi>David,</hi> when he had committed thoſe horrible hainous ſins of murther and adultery, ſins which deſerved death by the Law, his fault was aggravated by many circumſtances; he had wives of his own, he was not a young man, but well grown in years, he was no novice, he was not ignorant of God, but an old diſciple, and one that had had a great deal of experience of Gods goodneſs, one that was the moſt noted man in all Iſrael for forwardneſs for God, one that as himſelf confeſſeth, had more underſtanding then any one in the world, more then his teachers; theſe do aggravate his ſin, but when he had done, was he ſenſible of this? no, he was ſo far from it, that he laboured to father his baſtard upon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> had been a great whiie from his Wife, and muſt have known it to have been a baſtard, if he had not ſent him down to his houſe; now thought he, if I can but get him to go down to his houſe, and lye with his Wife, the child may be thought to be his child, and not mine; nay, when <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> ſpake words that might have burſt his bowels, when he bade him go to his houſe, you may ſee what a gracious anſwer he gave him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.11. <hi>The Ark and Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> as who ſhould ſay, I had more need to be at prayer, and keep a faſt; all Iſrael is in the field againſt their enemies, therefore I had more need to ſeek God, then look after my pleaſures, and pampering my body; now one would think this ſhould have been as a dagger to <hi>Davids</hi> heart, and made him aſhamed; yet he was ſo ſenſeleſs that he laboured to do it more and more, and was never at quiet till he had made him drunk, thinking he would go home; thus we ſee that a child of God may be ſenſeleſs of his ſins.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A child of God may grow to be notoriouſly vain, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly worldly, and to be notoriouſly guilty of ſin. I do not ſay to live in ſin, but to ſin notoriouſly, that a man that hath but half an eye may ſay, Yonder man is notoriouſly proud and conceited of himſelf, he is marvelous froward and given to his paſſions; yonder man is marvelous remiſs in his place and calling, marvelous dull and idle, and ſluggiſh; and even thoſe that are without may ſee this, much more the children of God; thus it was with many of <hi>Pauls</hi> brethren and companions he had at <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he did conceive theſe were the children of God, yet they were grown notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and groſſely worldly; when <hi>Paul</hi> had occaſion to ſend ſome Miniſter or other to fight againſt the falſe Apoſtles, he ſpake it ſeems to all his brethren and acquaintance, to intreat them to go to <hi>Philippi,</hi> but he could not get one of them to go; what excuſe they made we know not, whither they were loth to be at that charge, or whither they loved their own eaſe, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94114:16"/>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. he breaks out into this ſpeech, <hi>they all ſeek their own, and none the things that are Chriſts</hi>: Not as <hi>Calvin</hi> notes upon the place, as though they had no grace or life in them, but they were grown marvelous worldly and earthly, and carried away with their luſts, marvelouſly tender of their profits, ſeeking their own, and not the things of Chriſt; though <hi>Paul</hi> told them, it was the cauſe of Chriſt required it, yet it was againſt their profits and eaſe, he could get none of them to go; ſo <hi>David,</hi> that ſin of numbring the people, it lay upon his heart nine months, and he came not to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yet <hi>Joab</hi> ſaw this thing, and he uſed gracious arguments to divert him; he ſaw plainly that he was tranſported with ſome luſt or other.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The child of God may grow to that paſs, that the ſervice of God may be a burthen; 'tis true, it cannot be abſolutely a burthen to any child of God; ſo the wicked only are abſolutely without zeal and affection, they are abſolutely wicked and worldly; therefore this cannot be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in a child of God; yet it may be horribly and groſſely, even to be tired and jaded under Gods ſervice, even to count it a burthen, to cry out with thoſe <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. <hi>what a wearineſs is it Lord!</hi> even to be loth to go to prayer, to go to it dully, as a trewant goes to his book; and when they are at it, to be blockiſh and without any ſpirit in it, and have no life, not ſo much as to heave up their hearts to the Throne of grace; nay, they may think it too long, and wiſh it were done; and they may think the opportunities to do and receive good come too often; this is an horrible thing, yet thus it may be; what was the reaſon that the <hi>Galatians</hi> were ſo open-eared to the falſe Apoſtles that came with another Goſpel, that ſeparated from the Goſpel of Chriſt? what is the reaſon that they opened the ear to them, and were even poyſoned by it? O ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>be not weary of well doing, Gal.</hi> 6.9. as who ſhould ſay, you are weary of well doing; you were once affected with the word, and would have plucked out your eyes to do me good; you were wonderfully wrought upon, and went on in a right manner in ſome meaſure; Oh be not weary of well doing; as who ſhould ſay, the cauſe of your yielding is becauſe you were weary of well doing; you ſeek out for new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and errours, and are ready to receive falſe doctrines, contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt; therefore, take heed that you be not weary of well doing.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, A child of God may be ſo dead that nothing can quicken him; nay, the whole Church of God may be ſo dead, that the Goſpel may be going away, and God may be ready to depart, and ſhew ſigns of his going away from them, and yet they may have no heart to humble themſelves, and ſeek the Lord, to be moved and ſtirred to get more life, and intreat God to turn away the plague, as God ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.16. <hi>I wondred there was no Interceſſor</hi>; he ſent Prophet after Prophet to tell them that he would take away his Kingdom from them, and ſcatter them among the Nations; but though he had told them of theſe things, over and over again, yet there was none to ſtand in the gap; he ſpeaks in the general, there was not a man (though otherwiſe good) that could cry to God in this diſtreſs; ſo that I ſay, a man may grow to this paſs, that nothing can quicken him; all the ordinances of God cannot, nay, though he have many judgements of God upon him, and his conſcience lies digging in his ſide from day to day, yet nothing may work upon him, unleſs the Lord be more ſtrangely merciful to his ſoul; till a whale was provided to ſwallow up <hi>Jonah,</hi> there was no bringing of his heart to relent.</p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>But you will ſay, Where is the ſign of Gods grace all this while? may a child of God be thus dead? certainly the life of the children of God is eternal; and when God gives his children grace, it continues for ever, it is ſpringing up
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94114:16"/>
to eternal life; now if a Saint may be thus dead, where is grace? is he unchilded again?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, the grace of a child of God can never be taken away, not for any goodneſs in himſelf, but through the goodneſs of God.</p>
               <p>For firſt, there is the ſeed of God remaining ſtill in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>a godly man cannot commit ſin,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>for the ſeed of God remaineth in him</hi>; that is, he cannot commit ſin as the wicked commit it, he can never grow to be a wicked man again, to do as the wicked do; why? the ſeed of God remaineth in him; you know ſeed is a little thing, there is a little thing left ſtill in that man, that ſhall ſtill difference him from ungodly men, that he cannot commit ſin with that fulneſs of ſway as the wicked do; now by this ſeed the Scripture means regeneration; regeneration is immortal, it is <hi>that ſeed which remaineth for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. the laſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As there is a ſeed of God remaining in him, ſo there be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural habits; and the difference between this ſeed, and theſe ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural habits is this; this ſeed is immediately in the ſoul, though it runs through all the powers of it; but theſe ſupernatural habits are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in the powers and faculties of the ſoul; now theſe habits are ſuch, whereby they have heavenly inclinations to good, and inclinations againſt evil; and theſe ſhall never be quite extinguiſhed, though they be not like to moral and natural habits; for they do actually incline but ſupernatural habits do never actually incline that way, but upon concurrence of ſpecial grace; though they be in the ſoul yet they do not actually incline but upon concurrence of grace; now theſe habits can never be taken from a child of God, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.24. <hi>though the righteous fall, yet he ſhall not utterly be caſt down</hi>; he may fall upon his hands and knees, but he ſhall not quite fall; he ſhall have ſomething or other to moderate and break the fall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A child of God ever hath <hi>an anointing,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. that is, a gift and grace of God, whereby he doth enlighten his eyes by the ſpirit of revelation, whereby he looks upon God, and all ſin and iniquity, and the ordinances of God, with an heavenly eye; now I ſay, this eye can never be taken away; let a child of God be at the loweſt ebbe, he looks upon ſin, and Gods wayes after another faſhion then other men; he looks upon corruption after another manner then any other man; ſo he looks upon Gods holineſs, and righteouſneſs, and graciouſneſs, he looks upon theſe ſo as no natural man doth; if a man do but talk with him, he will ſee that he hath anointing at the loweſt ebbe; he will not talk of the wayes of God as a natural man; he will diſcover that he hath ſomething of God, ſomething of this oyntment left in him ſtill.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is a <hi>little ſtrength</hi> in his heart, as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8. A child of God, take him at the loweſt ebbe, yet he hath a little ſtrength; I ſpeak not here of actual grace, for a child of God may have no actual grace ſtirring, it may be quite in a ſwound; as <hi>David</hi>; I hardly think there was any grace ſtirring in his heart when he lay with <hi>Bathſheba</hi>; but I ſpeak of the frame of a child of God; when he is grown dead in his general bent, frame, and inclination, he hath yet a little ſtrength; he doth a little fear God, though it be much born down; he hath ſome good deſires, though but weak and in a great meaſure ineffectual; he hath a little endeavour to pleaſe God, though the pleaſing of his fleſh and corruptions be ſo much, that his grace doth ſcarcely appear.</p>
               <p>The firſt uſe is this, Is it ſo, that a child of God may thus far grow dead?<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> let us know, this is not to encourage any man in ſin, that any man ſhould conclude, well then it is no great matter though I ſin now and then, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94114:17"/>
lie and ſwear now and then; in many things we offend all, and we are all ſinners; the Miniſter told us to day how dead a man may be, and yet be a child of God for all this; this is a damned uſe of this doctrine; there is no doctrine, no example recorded in all the whole Bible, to encourage men to ſin; therefore when we look into the lives of <hi>Noah,</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Lot, &amp;c.</hi> and read of their great falls, this is not to encourage any man to ſin, but rather to ſtir up a man ſo much the more to labour againſt ſin; for if the children of God that have his favour, and have got into his covenant, and have got power in grace, and have traded in Religion, and have waded far in mortification and newneſs of life, and have gone many degrees to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Gods Kingdom; if theſe men give way never ſo little, may be dead, if ſin may get dominion over theſe; how ſhould others quake and tremble, and reaſon thus, Did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> fall? how then ſhall I ſtand? how careful ſhould I be? <hi>David</hi> had a thouſand times more grace then I, and was more mortified then I, and had a better heart then I; if he were ſo weak to overcome ſin, when he had given way to it; if he could not preſerve his affections from being deaded; and if he could not preſerve his ſoul from being a block in Gods ſervice; if he had ſo many advantages beyond me, and yet giving way to idleneſs and drowſineſs, were born down in that faſhion; oh how ſhould I take heed then?</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94114:17"/>
for ſuch peoples learning, that they may take comfort in the Scriptures, that they may not be altogether out of heart, but have ſomething to lay hold on; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his ſins of being a perſecutor,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note> and a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he ſaith, it is recorded, that I afterwards may be an help to them that ſhall believe; and as the ſins of Gods elect before converſion are recorded, that this may be a means to perſwade Gods elected (not yet converted) that they may find grace, though they be never ſo vile ſinners; for God hath left a pattern and pledge, he hath been merciful to hainous ſinners; ſo the fall of Gods Saints and children after converſion, are recorded to this end; and I can tell you in time of temptation, when conſcience ſhall be awakned, and the wrath of God ſhall ſtick in a mans ſoul, a man cannot ſpare any one ſweet propoſition in Scripture, nor any one example in Scripture, nor any tittle of comfort; it will be little enough to bear up the ſoul from deſpair <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd from being overwhelmed; all will be little enough to aſſure the ſoul of Gods favour, and that he can and will pardon ſuch tranſgreſſors; therefore I ſay look upon this doctrine, it is for thoſe that are dejected with their dead hearts, that they may yet receive ſome comfort to their ſouls.</p>
               <p>The laſt day I ſhewed you how far forth a child of God might be dead;<note place="margin">The deadneſs of a child of God ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> but ſome may ſay, I cannot believe a child of God may come to this; and thou art confident thou ſhall not come to this; therefore I will ſpeak a little further of it.</p>
               <p>And firſt, Let me tell you, there is not the fowleſt, haynouſeſt,<note place="margin">A child of God may fall into very foul ſins.</note> abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableſt, the moſt notorious, ſcandalous ſin in the world, but the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, godly mortified man upon the face of the earth may fall into it, if he take not heed, (except the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt) I will inſtance in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For Idolatry, groſs Idolatry; will you think that ever a child of God, that believes in his name, and is acquainted with his word, and his goodneſs and mercy, and his jealouſie againſt this ſin and iniquity, ſhould fall into it, ſhould fall down and worſhip a ſtock, a ſtone, a creature? you will never believe it; yet you ſhall ſee the wiſeſt man that ever was, and one that was beloved of God, did fall into this ſin in a great degree, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.4. Solomons <hi>wives drew his heart away from God</hi>; they drew away his heart from God in an high degree; and they did not nakedly draw away his heart from God, but <hi>they drew his heart after other gods.</hi> If a man ſhould ſay, I hope I ſhall never fall into this ſin; I ſay let us hope ſo ſtill, and go on in uſing the means; if we be ſo confident, let us take heed that none of us come to bowe to the creature; let our own hating and abominating of it, be a watch-word to us to take heed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What ſay you to apoſtacy? nay, almoſt totall apoſtacy, that a child of God ſhould grow to be an apoſtate, which of you would think it; that he ſhould come to curſe and bann himſelf, if ever he knew Jeſus Chriſt, or loved him, or ever did countenance him? yet you may ſee a child of God, and a notable one too, fell in this faſhion; <hi>Peter,</hi> he <hi>did curſe and ban himſe;lf, that he never knew the man, Mark</hi> 14.71. this is very far.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What ſay you to perſecution? to perſecute a man that is godly; doſt think that a man that hath the image of God in him, that hath the knowledge of the Scripture, that hath the fear of God before his eyes, and a ſympathy with all the Saints of God in the world, that this man ſhould ever perſecute one that is godly, and for his godlineſs too? would you think this? yet directly thus it is; <hi>Aſa,</hi> a godly man, for a fit, as long as the time laſted, when the Prophet reproved him for his ſins, and dealt roundly with him, what was this but gracious dealing? yet the man did not only not ſubmit to the Prophets reproof, but his very heart roſe up
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94114:18"/>
againſt him, and he caſt him into priſon, he was a perſecutor of him 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 16.10. in one word, what enormous flagitious ſin in the world is there, but a child of God (if he look not to himſelf) may actually fall into (but the ſin unto death?) <hi>Noah</hi> a Preacher of righteouſneſs, the holieſt man upon the earth, the world had not his fellow, yet he fell to be once drunk; <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods own heart, a man of admirable experience, a man that traded as far in mortification, in holineſs and righteouſneſs, and walking with God, and acquaintance with him and his Laws and promiſes as ever any Saint in the Old Teſtament; yet he fell into the ſin of murther and adultery, yea, to make a man drunk, and that otherwiſe a good man too, one of the worthieſt of all the Kingdom; you ſee this is clear, there is no ſin ſo deſperate (the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt excepted) but a child of God may fall into it; therefore he had not need to be carnally confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. A child of God may be hardned in ſin.</note> When a child of God hath fallen thus into ſome fowl ſin, he may be much hardened, wofully deaded and benummed, and grow blockiſh and untoward to call upon God, and go on in any of his waies, become marvelouſly unfitted and indiſpoſed to the uſe of Gods ordinances; nay, he may be grown to that paſs that he ſhould never riſe up more, but that for the infinite goodneſs of God that doth bring him again home, and lift him up again by renewing his faith, and his repentance; you may ſee when <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> had ſtruck with <hi>Ahab,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 19.</note> and helped the ungodly, and loved him that hated the Lord, though he were ſmitten in the field, and were like to have loſt his life, and ſaw what danger he was in for joyning with <hi>Ahab,</hi> yet all this did not humble him; the Lord ſent after him by hue and cry, rouſing up his conſcience by his Prophets; if he had not done thus, God knows how long he might have lain thus; ſo <hi>David</hi> he found a deadneſs in all goodneſs, when he had committed thoſe foul ſins, he found no working of Gods bleſſed ſpirit, his own ſpirit grew dull, his own heart grew dead, he was as if he had never known what grace meant; <hi>create in me O Lord a new heart, Pſal.</hi> 51.10. his ſin was like to a ſweeping rain that leaves nothing; like to a conſumption that waſtes all; it was even like a Thief, that breaks into a mans ware-houſe in the night, and a man knows not what he hath loſt, till he caſts up his accounts, and then he ſeeth he hath loſt almoſt all his eſtate; ſo it is with the beſt of Gods ſervants; if they give way to ſin, contrary to evangelical obedience, God knows what a Thief they let into their ſoul; they know not what they have loſt, till God give them an heart to caſt up their accounts, and then they may ſee that they have loſt almoſt all that they have; who knows what God may do? it is a fearful thing; you ſee a child of God may not only fall into foul and fearful ſins, but he may lie in them.</p>
               <p>Then Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. A child of God may be long in ſin.</note> To go further, when a child of God is come hither, then you will ſay, certainly this man muſt riſe up again quickly, grace will not let him lie dead; 'tis true, God will not for ever let him lie dead; but for how long he ſhall lie dead, no man nor Angel can tell; as the Church ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her miſery, <hi>there is never a Prophet,</hi> never an ordinance of God, all is gone to wrack, <hi>and there is none among us can tell us how long, Pſal.</hi> 74.9. ſo when a man hath fallen into ſin, and hath pulled diſtempers into his ſoul, there is none among us can tell us how long; 'tis true, <hi>Peter</hi> got up again within a few hours; but <hi>David</hi> got not up again till after ten months; and may be another not till after ten years, may be twenty, forty, nay, who can tell how long? grace is free; therefore no man can preſcribe any time, <hi>the wind blows where it liſteth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 3. Reaſons of the point.</note> and how long it liſteth, and how long it will be ere it blow again who knoweth?</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> The Reaſons of this, firſt in regard of Satan, he fights moſt of all againſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94114:18"/>
the children of God, his fingers itch to be at them, and at them moſt; his greateſt ſpight is againſt them, the very bowels of the enmity is between him and them; the children of God come to take his place that he once had in heaven; the children of God are ſet up againſt Satan, as <hi>David</hi> was put in the room of <hi>Saul</hi>; therefore I ſay, all the ſtrength of hell is ſtill a working againſt the Church of God, and the Saints of God, and every one of them, from that very moment that the woman was delivered of a man child, he ſought to deſtroy it: <hi>Simon, Simon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 12.13.</note> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Satan deſires to winnow thee, &amp;c. Luke</hi> 22.31. he is the god of this world, and his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are welcome enough with any body but the children of God; none reſiſt his dominion but they; he is the Gaoler, and hath all the world in cloſe priſon, but only them; they are the only ones that have broken looſe, that have gotten away out of the power of Satan; therefore all his malice, and all the gates of hell, they are up to ſend hue and cry after them, to hook them in again if they can; he is juſt like a Pyrate; a Pyrate will rather ſet upon one rich ſhip, then upon a thouſand beggarly barks, becauſe there he may have a rich prize; ſo the Divel knows he can advantage his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if but one fall that is a Saint, more then by the falls and the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſeſt falls of millions of others; therefore no wonder that a child of God ſhould grow remiſs and careleſs at any time, that he may have a miſchief; for it is all the Divels buſineſs, he hath nothing elſe to do but do miſchief, to be buſie to get a child of God down, and if he have him down, to hold him down if he can.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another reaſon is, in regard of the children of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> they carry fleſh about them as well as other men, they have a Traitor in their own boſomes, that lies in ſcout every moment to work them woe; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I find another law in my members, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 7.23. though a child of God hath wounded all his luſts, nay, though he hath given them their deaths wound, yet there is never a one but may revive and make head again, if he take not heed, and that in a woful degree; as the Lord ſaith of the <hi>Caldeans, Jer.</hi> 37. (I quote it only for a ſimilitude) <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>though you had ſmitten all the whole army of the</hi> Caldeans, <hi>yet they ſhall come and fire the City</hi>; when <hi>Judah</hi> had provoked God, though they had woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> yet thoſe wounded men ſhould come and fire the City; ſo let a man take heed he doth not give way to ſin; for though his luſts be mortified, and he hath given them their deaths wound, yet theſe wounded <hi>Caldeans</hi> may come and fire all his ſoul, if he take not heed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In regard of God himſelf; God is pleaſed to try his people, to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> withdraw himſelf now and then from them, to leave them to themſelves, and the grace they have received; to let them alone with that; and when he doth thus, no wonder though they fall; for every man hath ſome vileneſs and rottenneſs in his heart; the wholeſt ſimpleſt heart in the world hath a deal of rottenneſs in it; I ſay, the Lord doth ſometimes leave his children to themſelves, as he did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the buſineſs of the Ambaſſadors, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 32.31. as the Church ſaith, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. <hi>my beloved had withdrawn himſelf</hi>; the lovingeſt mothers may ſometimes let their little child go alone, though they know he will fall; they provide may be a rouler about his head, that whither they fall backward or forward, or any way, they may not break their skull, and do themſelves a miſchief, to undo themſelves; but when they have done thus, they will ſometimes leave them to themſelves to go, though they know they will fall; ſo the Lord doth put a rouler upon his people, that when they fall, they may not fall totally and finally, as the wicked men do; they ſhall never ſtrike into a wicked courſe, as the ungodly of the earth do; that he takes order for; but he doth many times leave them, not out of any ill will to them, but he leaves them
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94114:19"/>
to themſelves, though he knows they will fall; and that for divers reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That they might be patterns to others of Gods people, that if they ſhould fall (as they may do) when they are down, they may have wherewithal to get up again; I ſay, the Lord leaves the eminenteſt of his people to themſelves, to fall into lamentable miſcarriages, that they may help inferiour people, and they may have ſomething to encourage them that God will recover them, and relieve them again, and that God will not caſt them off for ever; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. ſaith he, <hi>for this cauſe I obtained mercy, that in me firſt, Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, for a pattern to them who ſhall hereafter believe</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, there may be a perſecutor, a blaſphemer ſmitten, a vile wretch, a fighter againſt God and Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch a one may be ſmitten, and come to ſee his damned eſtate; a thouſand to one, but this man will be overwhelmed and drowned in deſpair; but ſaith he, The Lord, though I was one of his elect, yet he let me fall to this paſs, that I might be a pattern to them which ſhall afterwards believe; ſo we may ſay of Gods children after converſion; <hi>David</hi> may ſay, For this cauſe among the reſt the Lord left me to my ſelf; the Lord let me fall ſo fouly, and lifted me up again, that I might be a pattern to many poor people to the end of the world, that they may ſee the loving kindneſs of the Lord, and the infinite compaſſions, and bowels of mercy that is in the father of mercy towards them that truſt in his name; we ſhould never believe the mercy of God, the freeneſs of his grace, the goodneſs of his nature towards his beloved, towards thoſe whom he hath effectually called, were it not for ſuch examples.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord doth this for to puniſh the careleſſeneſs of his people, and their ſecurity many times; what ſin is there that is more apt to grow upon them then ſecurity? it is a ſtealing ſin, it is a ſecret and cunning ſin, that comes cloſely and ſlightly upon a man, before he is aware, if he look not to himſelf; now when a man grows to be ſecure, the Lord takes this courſe many times to eat it out, to puniſh the ſecurity of his people; <hi>Peter</hi> when he had gotten faith in Chriſt, and affection to Chriſt, when he felt that his bowels did yearn after Chriſt, and his heart was enlarged towards him,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> he grew ſecure upon it; <hi>though all forſake thee, yet will not I</hi>; he was confident, but it was carnal confidence; for though the thing a man truſts in be the grace of God, yet as long as it is grace received, it is truſting in a mans ſelf; he therefore was carnally confident; now he would venture him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the high Prieſts hall; thought he thus, affections will never be drowned; he might go any whither; well, he comes into the high Prieſts hall, and there comes into the very mouth of temptations and dangers; he doth not dream how eaſily his heart may be cauſed to deny Chriſt, he did not dream what a tickliſh heart he carried in his boſome, he grew to be bold and venturous; now the Lord to heal this ſecurity, let him fall in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate manner;<note place="margin">Mat. 26.74.</note> he let him get a knock almoſt to beat out his brains, even to curſe and ban himſelf; not only to deny Chriſt, but with abjuration; the Lord ſeeth it is needful to do thus when people grow ſecure; we ought alwaies to carry a covenant about our eyes, to take heed where we look; and when we are in company, to have a bridle in our mouth, to take heed what we ſpeak; now if we grow careleſs and negligent, and this bridle is gone, and this covenant is gone, and our watch is taken away, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel though the Lord be provoked againſt us, to puniſh us, and that ſoundly, and let many of his people get a knock; and who knows how great a one? and how hard to heal again?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord ſometimes leaves his people to themſelves, that ſo they may ſee they ſtand meerly by grace; I doe not mean by grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94114:19"/>

Now the Lord in his infinite goodneſſe to his people, leaves them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; are you ſo mortified? come, let us ſee how mortified you are, and ſo leave him to himſelfe, to ſee what the man can doe with all his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and zeal, and mortification; and now this man falls: Look how far God leaves a man, ſo far he falls; he will have his people ſee that they ſtand not by grace received, but by the free grace and favour of God: <hi>It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>but in God that ſheweth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> No, though a man have never ſo many gracious endowments, and heavenly vertues, it is not in him that willeth, but in God that ſheweth mercy; it is in the fountain of mercy and loving kindneſſe in God. Let a man keep cloſe to God, let a man ſtill obſerve the pleaſing of God, that there may be a continual fountain open, running down upon him from day to day; for if he grow ſecure, and look not to himſelfe, he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf to woful dangers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Lord leaves his people ſometimes thus fearfully to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that he might teach us to be ſenſible towards our brethren; to be mild, and meek, and piteous, and full of bowels and compaſſion towards the weakeſt and meaneſt of all the Saints of God; if we ſee but any thing of God, nay, but any likelihood that a man is of God, to be tender, for fear we ſhould wrong a childe of God; the Lord doth this of purpoſe to breed bowels, and meekneſſe, and gentleneſſe towards his people: As God lets men fall horribly before converſion, that they may carry themſelves meekly towards thoſe that are unconverted, for fear any of them ſhould be of the Elect of God; ſo he lets them fall after converſion, that they may carry themſelves ſo towards them that are converted; I ſay the Lord lets his people fall horribly into woful evils, that though they ſee a man fall never ſo much, yet they may not omit any thing to doe him good, that they may not be taken off from their bowels and compaſſion; who knowes but this man may be of God? for I was as wretched as he once, as <hi>Paul</hi> would have the <hi>Cretians</hi> take notice of this, they were horrible ſinners before converſion, lyars, ſlow-bellies; now ſaith he, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Speak to them that they ſhew all meekneſſe to all men.</hi> Mark

his reaſon, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>We our ſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, &amp;c.</hi> We our ſelves were thus, therefore let us ſhew meekneſſe to all whatſoever, and let us be kinde, and full of bowels and compaſſion towards them, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying how to doe them good, and prevent all manner of evil, and labour to win them, if it be poſſible, with all meekneſſe and condiſcending; who knows but they may be of God? for we our ſelves have been malicious and ſpightful, ignorant, haters, and have ſerved divers luſts and pleaſures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo it is with people after converſion; the Lord lets them fall into horrible ſinnes, and diſtempers, that ſo they may be gentle, and that they may have the ſpirit of meekneſſe towards all men; a man is apt to be ſevere, and rude, and rigid towards others, if he hath gotten any thing himſelfe; if he hath gotten a little knowledge, a little zeal, a little faith, a little humility, a little ability to pleaſe God, he is apt to think it ſuch a deal, and he is apt to cry down every one that is not as he is, You are ſo proud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo thus and thus: and to take off his heart from doing thoſe duties which he owes towards him; a man is apt to be very inſolent in the Church of God; many are thus, till God doth take them down; therefore the Lord by this means doth teach his people gentleneſſe and meekneſſe; indeed God teacheth people many wayes beſides this; if they will take warning by his Word, or ſome other courſe, they ſave him a labour; but if that will not doe, God takes this courſe with a man, to make him ſee his pride, and conceitedneſſe, and his want of mercy, and unlikeneſſe to Chriſt, in bowels, and pity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards his brethren.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Lord leaves his own children to themſelves ſometimes to fall ſo foulely, that he may humble them, and bring them down low, that he may make them ſee yet further into the corruptions of their own hearts, that ſo he may make them capable of more grace; for <hi>he gives grace to the humble.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">James 4.</note> Now when he would give more grace to a man, may be he lets him fall into ſome horrible ſinne, that he may be the more humbled, and ſee the naughtineſſe of his own heart, that he may be driven to God, and may be deeper in mortification; may be he thought he could goe no furthrer; he did pleaſe himſelf in his prayers; as I have heard of one that ſaid, when he had prayed, he could hardly ſee any ſinne in his prayer. Now when the Lord is pleaſed to beſtow upon them more grace, he doth ſhew them the corruptions. You know how often God let his people fall in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that horribly, by murmuring, and repining, and infidelity; though they were his own choſen, yet he let them fall at the waters of ſtrife, and at the red Sea he let them fall; he let them fall concerning Manna: why was this? the text ſaith, <hi>The Lord thy God he proved thee, he led thee up and down in all this barren wilderneſſe, where were Scorpions and fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, that he might humble thee, and doe thee good in thy latter end,</hi> Deut. 8.15, 16. Meaning, the Lord let them fall into thoſe horrible evils, that he might humble them, that they might ſee the wickedneſſe of their own hearts, and the infinite need they had of grace, and the fear of God, and ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their guard; this did he to humble them, and do them good in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end.</p>
               <p>The firſt Uſe may ſeem to condemn thoſe ſpeeches that commonly go up &amp; down in Chriſtians mouths,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> let me tell you they are wicked ſpeeches; O, ſay they, grace will not let a man have ſuch pride and vanity in him; grace will not let a man do thus and thus; I ſay theſe ſpeeches are not good; they favour of a world of ignorance of the grace of God: Indeed in three caſes theſe are admirable ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Certainly grace will bring a man home to God that belongs to him; it will put him into Jeſus Chriſt; it will certainly make him a new creature, and bring him out of the eſtate of ſinne; he ſhall not live in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94114:20"/>
eſtate of ſin; grace will do that, and God in the covenant of grace doth ſet down that it is a fundamental promiſe, he will do this <hi>for every one</hi>; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7. this grace will ſurely undertake that a man ſhall be a believer (if he belong to God) and he ſhall be juſtified and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in ſome meaſure, he ſhall hate ſin, and love goodneſs in ſome meaſure, and delight in Gods ordinances in ſome meaſure; he ſhall be in the eſtate of grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not in the eſtate of ſin; grace will do this; this we may boldly ſay, if a man have grace he, muſt do this, for God will teach him to do it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Grace will undertake that a man ſhall not fall finally away; that is certain, that we may boldly ſay, if a man be of God, grace will teach him that he ſhall not fall away finally, grace will uphold a man and maintain him; when we ſee a man fall away finally, we may conclude he had no true grace; Gods children ſhall never fall finally away, God will preſerve and keep them; <hi>whom he loves he loves, to the end; of all thoſe that my Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, We may ſay that grace will not ſuffer any man that is of God to fall totally away; as not finally for ever, ſo not totally; he ſhall not be altogether without grace, from that moment he began to have it for ever and ever; <hi>he that drinketh of this water ſhall never thirſt, &amp;c. Joh.</hi> 4.14. that is, he ſhall never thirſt with total indigency again, he ſhall never thirſt with total want; he ſhall ever have ſome grace, and ſome of the image of God, and ſome of the fear of God, and ſome of the love of his truth, and ſome deſire to his name, and ſome hatred of ſin, though in a poor degree, yet he ſhall have ſomething of God in him; there <hi>ſhall be the ſeed of God remaining in him at all times,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>my feet were almoſt gone</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2. they were but almoſt gone, they were not quite gone; as it is ſaid of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, ſhe had a little ſtrength</hi>; ſo let a child of God be at the loweſt ebbe, yet there ſhall be a little water of life,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.8.</note> it ſhall not be quite exhauſt; <hi>though he fall he ſhall not be utterly caſt down, for the Lord will uphold him, Pſal.</hi> 37.24. ſo that all this you may boldly ſay, for in theſe things it is not conditionally Gods covenant, but abſolutely for God will give thee ſtrength and power, and faith, and direction, and aſſiſtance; he will not only give thee the thing, but the condition alſo here, that a man ſhall be a believer, and a new creature; and if a man be once a new creature, he ſhall never be an old creature again altogether; the covenant of grace is ſo, which is an everlaſting covenant; God will forgive their ſins, and remember then no more: but now for particular paſſages; for a man to ſay that a man cannot be proud and diſtempred, but grace will heal him; a man cannot have an hard heart, but grace will ſoften it; theſe are ill ſpeeches, men know not what they ſay when they ſay thus; for in particular paſſages the children of God have no promiſe, but only upon condition that they

God hath ſhewed us when we may have all grace, and be kept from all deadneſſe; and when we may have life, and comfort, and quickening, and when he will be found of us, namely, when we ſeek him with all our hearts; but let a man be careleſſe of ſeeking of God, he will be careleſſe of him; and if a man doe not ſtir up the grace of God, let him know he falls into the hands of a conſuming fire; he is not only ſo to the Reprobate, but even to his Saints and children, if they grow careleſſe; therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> was about to leave the world, he gives <hi>Timothy</hi> this charge, <hi>O Timothy, preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, &amp;c.</hi> what followes? <hi>watch thou in all things</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, may be you ſhall meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptations and diſcouragements, and therefore <hi>watch in all things,</hi> 2

               <p>Becauſe we ſee this by experience in the Saints of God in all ages, that ſometimes God leaves his people; and when he doth leave them, they fall into grievous ſinnes; this cannot be denied; for experience proves it in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry generation: You ſee <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelfe, how grievouſly he ſinned, he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Mother to tell a lye, thinking to get a bleſſing by an untruth, by ſaying he was <hi>Eſau,</hi> when he was not; and you ſee what miſery he brought upon himſelfe by it; even twenty years bondage that one ſinne did coſt that poor man; he thought to get the bleſſing; for it was Gods promiſe; but by his unlawful going about it, God kept him from it in a terrible manner, and brought him a wide way about; and ſo we might inſtance in many other Saints of God; for this is moſt certain, let a man be the deareſt of Gods ſervants, yet if ſinne be yielded unto, it will difuſe a man of Gods Ordinances, and make a man untoward to good duties; it will make a breach between God and the ſoul; it will drive him, and carry him into thickets and buſhes, as <hi>Adam</hi>; the Spirit of God will turn away the gale of his breath, and then how uncomfortable a man ſhall be in good duties, we may think with our ſelves, and reaſon the caſe in our own ſouls; it will be ſo, for God is an holy God; for though he love his people that rejoyce in his name, yet he hath ſaid, that all <hi>their wayes ſhould be with trembling,</hi> Pſal. 2.11.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>For firſt grace when it comes into the ſoul, it ſets up an univerſal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſerve God, not only in the main courſe of his life, but in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to hate all ſinne, and in every particular, to love all good duties; and every particular, to be careful at home and abroad, and in his calling; in company and alone; in health and ſickneſſe; in all eſtates; whether he be rich or poor; whether he be perſecuted or not perſecuted; in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life to hate all ſin, and follow all goodneſſe; grace ſets up this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple whereſoever it is; but yet a man may fall into a thouſand ſinnes, if he be not watchful; but if there be not ſuch a principle in thy heart, thou art not a child of God, and a believer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>3.

               <p>Secondly, It is plain that cannot be the meaning of it, that grace is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, becauſe that if grace be truly in any man, it doth ſet up a watch in the ſoul to preſerve it, that the man ſhall be eager not to ſin in any particular, and deſirous in ſome meaſure, and careful in ſome degree, to doe all manner of good; if a man give way to the luſts of the fleſh, his care may be brought to a low ebb; but grace ſets up a watch in the ſoule, and breeds care, and deſire, and purpoſes, and reſolutions, and revenge upon his own luſts, and abundance of things, as you may ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. So that grace will not let a man be indifferent; therefore when we ſay for particulars, God doth not undertake this or that; the meaning is not as if grace would only convert a man, and keep him from falling totally and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally away; but for particulars it is indifferent; this is to blaſpheme the grace of God; but the meaning is, though a man be the childe of God and never ſo much mortified, if this man ſhould grow careleſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94114:22"/>
and ſecure, and give way to ſin, grace doth not undertake to keep a man from the fearfulleſt falls that can be, nor from the fearfulleſt diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Indeed when a man hath play'd the beaſt, God may preſerve him, but a man cannot look for this at the hands of God; who knows how God will deal with him, if he be unthankful to God for his grace and goodneſs, and mercy vouchſafed unto him?</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>3</label> let not any man ſtumble at this Doctrine; let not any think a childe of God cannot fall to be ſo dead; I ſay, doe not ſtumble at it, but rather ſee if it be not thy caſe, if thou art not fallen down into this depth of miſery; for what have I ſaid? did not I ſay that a childe of God might loſe his zeal? Look abroad what zeal is up and down, what yearnings when the Church is in miſery; nay, what need we look abroad? who hath zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own ſins and corruptions? Again, did I not ſay that a childe of God may loſe his affections? what affections are now a dayes? we heare Sermons, but what affections are ſtirred up, either in hearing, or ſpeaking the Word of God? So for prayer, what affections are there in prayer? So for ſin, what griefe is there for our ſins? There is no affection or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at all in us. Where is that ſame anguiſh of heart that ſhould be in us for our corruptions? they are even loſt; I ſpeak not of wicked men only, but even of good people, though they be ſenſible of their deadneſſe, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, though they ſee it, yet they are not able to relent at it; Then for deſires, where are they? Did I ſay a childe of God may have hardly any deſire almoſt, not be able to wreſtle with God for grace, and tug for it; and is not this our caſe? What frozen prayers? what cold devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſent up from day to day? So, did I ſay a childe of God may be ſenſeleſſe of ſin? How far hath this diſtemper grown upon us now a dayes? our hearts might even ake to be privy to that backwardneſſe, and untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and unfruitfulneſſe; I ſay, it might make us to be at our wits end, until we were delivered, and yet no man complaines; there is complaining in a dull manner, but no mans heart burſts almoſt. Again, did I ſay a childe of God may grow palpably vain, and proud, and worldly, that a man that hath but halfe an eye may ſee it, and take notice of it? is not it thus among us? how do we diſcover our ſhame whereſoever we come? thoſe that have but half an eye ſee how worldly we are, and how we have

               <p>The firſt reaſon is, becauſe ſin is a ſoul killing thing; it is like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Mare Mortuum,</hi> the fiſhes dye as ſoon as ever they come there; ſo when the Divel hooks a man into ſin, he hooks him into the dead ſea; as the Apoſtle ſaith of the <hi>Epheſians, you were dead in ſins</hi>; if the Divel can but hook a man into ſin,<note place="margin">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94114:23"/>
the Law of death; <hi>the Law of the ſpirit of Chriſt hath freed us from the Law of ſin, and of death, Rom.</hi> 8.2. ſin doth even bring a man to deaths door; it doth weaken all the powers and faculties of the ſoul, that a man cannot ſtir to any duty; it makes a man like a ſnake that is frozen with the cold, it cannot ſtir; ſo it is with a man when he gives way to ſin and iniquity, it freezeth all the powers that are in him, and leſſeneth all the powers of Gods ſpirit; it is even like a <hi>weight,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. If a man ſhould have a great weight upon his back, fetters upon his legs, how can that man go? he muſt needs go very dully; ſo it is with ſin and iniquity; when a man gives way to it, it is like plumets of lead, like great weights and burthens that clog a mans heart and affections, it makes them dull and lumpiſh and heavy to any thing that is good; as Chriſt ſpeaks of the cares of this life, if a man give way to them, <hi>they will overcharge the heart</hi>; they will lie heavy that the heart cannot ſtir, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. ſin poyſons all the ſoul, it poyſons the mind that a man cannot look upon things as he did; it poyſons a mans heart, though his heart were deeply affected towards God; it is ſtrange, if a man give way to ſin, how it will take off the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from God, it ſeparates between God and the ſoul, and comes between God the fountain of life and the ſoul, and therefore muſt needs be a killing and deading thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sin is a deading thing, becauſe it doth grieve the holy ſpirit of God that dwels in a man; you know all the quickning of a Chriſtian conſiſts in the gracious aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit; as long as Gods ſpirit is pleaſed to go along with us, and work our works for us, then we can pray and deny our ſelves, then we are fitted to every good word and work; but if the ſpirit of God retire, if it withdraw and ſuſpend his actions, and forbear his operations, what can a man do? a man is even a block without the ſpirit of God; now though the ſpirit of God delight never ſo much in doing good to the Saints, and delight in accompanying of them, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ting of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enlarging of them in all their wayes; yet if they give way to ſin directly, he will be grieved, and ſent ſad back again to heaven, as it were; and when the ſpirit of God is grieved, all muſt needs go ſad and heavy with the child of God; ſuppoſe a child of God give way to vain talk and diſcourſe; you ſhall ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith, this will grieve the ſpirit of God; <hi>grieve not the ſpirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed to the day of redemption, Eph.</hi> 4.13. he ſpeaks of that very ſin, if a man give way to it, the ſpirit of God will be grieved; though formerly he was pleaſed mightily to help, yet now he will withdraw: and then how dully ſhall a man go on? ſo if we ſhould give way to the ſuffering of our hearts not to be affected with God and his truth, not to ſee God in all his wayes, in all his goodneſs, and dealings, that we ſhould not be thankful, this will quench the ſpirit of God, it will quench its motions; as if a man ſhould pour pail-fuls of water upon the fire, ſo this will <hi>quench the ſpirit of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.18, 19. there is a manifeſt dependence between all thoſe exhortations; and this is certain, let a man once not be affected with God, let him not ſee Gods goodneſs in all his wayes, let him not be affected with Gods mercy and loving kindneſs, it will quench the ſpirit of God; and then conſider what a lamentable caſe a man ſhall be in.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Sin muſt needs dead a mans heart, becauſe it doth put a moſt woful bitter hard task upon the ſoul to go through; for you know hard tasks ſtir up reluctancy againſt them; when a man hath an hard task to go through, the very thought of it dulls him; it is like a ſtone upon his heart; now let a man ſin againſt grace and the goodneſs of God, and Gods gracious dealing, let a man ſin againſt theſe, it doth put a man to a moſt hard task to go through, to go and humble himſelf before Almighty God; and the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94114:24"/>
ſoul ſhall find a world of conflicts, that he is loth to come to it, loth to deal about this bitter buſineſs, to go about to renew his repentance with bitter remorſe for his ſins; it is like a deſperate debtor that hath run himſelf over head and ears in debt; the very thought of coming to a reckoning is death to him, he cannot abide to think of it; it is like a boy that hath made falſe Latine; if his Maſter ſhould call him to conſtrue and pearſe it, and give a rule for every word, he knows it is not according to rule, he hath not looked after rule, and every thing is falſe; now he cannot abide to come to conſtrue and pearſe it; ſo when a man hath provoked God by his ſins, and hath broken his covenant, and ſlighted his ordinances, when God calls him to conſtrue and pearſe, what do you make of ſuch an action, and ſuch a word, and ſuch a thought? the heart is even afraid of theſe things, as a dog is of a whip; it is an hard task to be brought to this; as <hi>David,</hi> when he had yielded to his ſecurity, and idleneſs, and unwatchfulneſs, and ſo had given way to Satan, you may ſee what an hard task he brought upon his ſoul, and how his ſoul was ever afraid to go about humiliation; how many frowning looks doth a man caſt upon the pykes he muſt go through, if he mean to obtain mercy; it even deads him as a dagger at his heart; <hi>David</hi> was loth to come to this, to come to a reckoning, to come to be humbled; when <hi>Bathſheba</hi> ſent him word that ſhe was with child, then God called him to a reckoning to be humbled; God told him to his face it is high time to be humbled, and aſhamed; God hath been laying rods in brine for thee, and to bring thee upon the ſtage, and to make thee odious and vile in the ſight of the world; yet he was loth to come to a reckoning, he ſhun'd it, and ſhut his eyes from ſeeing it, he deviſed tricks to ſend <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> home to his Wife; and when this would not be, but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> carried himſelf conſtantly, with feeling of the caſe of the Church that then lay in the field againſt their enemies; this could not but call for humbling, yet he ſhunned it ſtill, and inſtead of humbling himſelf, he went further into the briars, and made <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> drunk, thinking then he would go home; it is impoſſible but he ſhould ſee the hand of God in all this, that he gave him a warning to down on his knees; but he ſhunned it again, and inſtead of humbling himſelf, he deviſed the death of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and when news came <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> is dead, which one would think ſhould have been as an hammer to have knockt him down, he puts this off, <hi>the ſword kills one as well as another</hi>; and till the Lord was pleaſed to ſet it on, he could not be brought to humble himſelf; thus it is, ſin puts an hard task upon a man; a man may eaſily ſlip into ſin, it is a merry way unto it; but when a man is once in, he cannot get out again, without tearing and rending, and abaſing, and caſting himſelf down before God; this is an hard task, and the ſoul ſhall find abundance of reluctancies, and the very thought of it deads the ſoul, unleſs the Lord be the more merciful.</p>
               <p>A fourth reaſon why ſin deads a man, is, becauſe ſin defiles the conſcience, for ſin is a dead work, and it goes into the conſcience and defiles it, until <hi>it be purged by the blood of Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 9.14. ſin is a dead work, and the winding ſheet of it is the conſcience; preſently as ſoon as a man doth iniquity, this dead work runs into the conſcience; and catcheth hold, and this defiles the conſcience, and puts guilt into it; and nothing in the world more deads a man then a guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>conſcience; why becauſe it knocks a mans fingers off from that which ſhould enliven and quicken him, it makes him ſee that he doth defile Gods promiſes if he medle with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.16. the promiſes of God are the <hi>things by which men live</hi>; now when the conſcience is guilty, it doth even knock a mans fingers off from the promiſes, it tells him this guilt muſt out firſt, before he can apply the promiſes, nay, the very hearing of the promiſes deads his heart, and this is the reaſon why good
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94114:24"/>
people, as long as they have not clear conſciences, rather call for Sermons of judgement then of mercy; and their conſciences ſay the promiſes doe not belong to me; I know God is an holy God, and his promiſes holy, and it is no meddling with them without holineſſe; therefore when a man gives way to ſin, he muſt needs dead his heart, becauſe he defiles his own conſcience; and therefore no wonder that there is ſo much deadneſſe up and downe, when there is hardly a clear conſcience in the Country; nay, good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how ſlightly doe they deal in this caſe, and hinder their own life and quickning, becauſe they have not a care to come before God with a cleare conſcience!</p>
               <p>The fifth Reaſon is, Becauſe ſin doth either utterly deſtroy, or mightily weaken all aſſurance of welcome with God; and therefore no marvel if it dead the heart; for if a man cannot look for comfort and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with God when he goeth to him, it takes man off from that willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to come into Gods preſence, it makes a man ſhie of God, and of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and his Ordinances; it makes a man that he hath no deſire to pray almoſt, nay, ſometimes he hath no heart at all; nay, ſometimes he to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally omits the duty, he is ſo afraid, he cannot goe to God without carnal feares and miſ-givings, and horrours; and this takes the heart quite off for a time, that he cannot pray at all; it is like a childe when he hath committed ſome villany that he knows his father knowes, he is ſhy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his fathers preſence, he is afraid to come where his father is, he knowes be ſhall be chid, and hear of his doings; ſo it is in this caſe; it is not thus with wicked and ungodly men; for they can look God in the face; but Gods own people, when they ſin againſt God; it muſt needs take off that cheerful willingneſs to goe before God, that delight to be in his preſence, that comfort in prayer; ſinne makes it an irkſome thing; ſinne makes a man to have little heart to deal with God; for the heart doth not love to be caught by God in Satans company, or of any luſt; as a ſervant cannot abide that his Maſter ſhould take him in any villany or unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if he hath been unfaithful, it would kill his heart that his Maſter ſhould take him in it; ſo it is with Gods children, let them ſinne againſt God; it doth dull and dead their hearts, in regard of the throne of grace, it makes them have ſmall heart to come before it: See it in <hi>Jonah</hi>;<note place="margin">Jonah 1.</note> when he had fled away from God, and had put off Gods charge, and was gone downe to <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus we ſee for the general, that it is ſinne that deads mens hearts, when they give way to it.</p>

                  </note> What are thoſe ſins that cauſe this deadneſſe up and down?

then be wanting; there are many duties in Religion that we have no expreſs text of Scripture for, for ſuch a quantity, or ſuch a meaſure, or ſuch a time, or how often; as how often we ſhould pray in ſecret every day, how often we ſhould meditate, and how long at a time, how much we ſhould give out of almes, how much we ſhould doe thus and thus; the duty is commanded, but the quantity for time or frequency is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Scripture; there be a thouſand things of this nature. Now a man that loves his own quickning, will rather overdoe in this caſe then underdoe; as it was vvith <hi>Philemon,</hi> Phil. 21. <hi>Paul</hi> you knovv was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him to doe an act of kindneſs to receive <hi>Oneſimus</hi>; now, ſaith he, <hi>I know thou wilt doe more then I ask of thee, &amp;c.</hi> He would rather over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe then underdoe: So it was with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when God would have them offer to the building of the Tabernacle; he did not tell them how much, but they would rather overdoe then underdoe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36.5. They brought ſo much, that the Lord was fain to ſay <hi>there was enough, and too much</hi>: So it was with the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Paul</hi> asked a little, they gave more: So it is with a man that loves quickning; if God bid him pray twice a day, rather then fail he will pray thrice a day; if God hath required ſome time in his ſervice, he will rather give him more time then afford him ſmaller time, as Chriſt ſaith, If a man will have thy coat, let him have thy cloak alſo; as who ſhould ſay, rather overdo then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdoe, if thou beeſt called to doe any thing for the glory of God, and the good of thine own ſoul, or the good of others; we ſhould imitate God in this; God gives his people above that which they ask; ſo we ſhould doe more then is asked. I doe not mean as if we could do more then God bids us; for God requires <hi>all the heart, and all the minde, and all the ſtrength</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> but I ſpeak of a frank and free heart; when he doth not know what meaſure God ſets down in his Word, he will rather doe more then leſſe; he will rather be with the forwardeſt then with the backwardeſt, if he love his own quickning; but when a man growes niggardly in Gods ſervice, and will doe no more then needs muſt, and takes advantage that he may doe as little as may be, this deads the heart; becauſe there is no expreſſe place in Scripture for prayer in this kinde, he will take any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the world, for his own ſecurity, and worldlineſs, and littleneſs in Gods ſervice, he lieth at catch; in this caſe this man ſets open his heart to all deadneſs; therefore no marvel he hath no life; where is a man in town or country, that is like to <hi>Philemon,</hi> that a Miniſter may ſay, <hi>I know thou wilt doe more then I ſay?</hi> It were well if we could ſay, thou wilt do as much as I ſay; nay, it is come to this paſs, we may ſay, I know you will doe nothing at all; I may bid thee doe this and that, but thou wilt do nothing at all; people will hardly regard the Communion of Saints at all, they will hardly regard ſecret prayer at all, they will heartily regard any of thoſe duties upon which life and quickning ſo much depends; and this is one cauſe of the horrible deadneſs that is everywhere.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another cauſe is unwatchfulneſs; people doe not watch over their ſoules, and over their wayes, they doe not ponder their paths, they have not an eye to their wayes; this is a great cauſe of deadneſs of heart; therefore here when Chriſt chargeth the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> with deadneſs, <hi>I know thou haſt a name to live, but art dead</hi>: In the next words he gives a remedy, <hi>Be watchful therfore</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, here is the cauſe of thy deadneſs, thou haſt not been watchful; if thou hadſt been watchful, thou hadſt eſcaped all this deadneſs; if thou hadſt ſtoop upon thy guard, and looked well to thy wayes, this had never been; if a man be quickened at any time, the Devil lieth at catch; and if he doe not vvatch, he vvill be deaded again, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. A man had need be vvatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, elſe he can never preſerve himſelfe from the temptations of Satan;

when a City is beleaguered with the enemy, there are ever ſome Watchers and Scouts that lie in wait, that ſo if any danger be towards, they may give warning, leſt it be ſurprized on the ſudden; ſo when God doth good to our hearts, how ſhould we keep watch over our ſoules; for we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguered on every ſide, ſometimes with preſumption, and ſometimes with deſpair; we are every way in danger, therefore we had need to watch; no ſooner had <hi>Eve</hi> gone apart from her husband, and looked here and there, but the Devil took her preſently; no ſooner had <hi>Noah</hi> begun to taſte the liquor of the grape he had planted, and delighted in it, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Devil hooked him in, which he might have prevented if he had been watchful; the Devil is that <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that greedy hunter, that goeth up and down, and makes pits, and layes ſnares to catch ſouls, and if we doe not watch, we fall into them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was among you with much feare</hi>; he knew what danger he was in, therefore he was in much fear; if we did love our own quickning, and the cheriſhing of whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grace we have received, we would watch over our ſelves; but where is this? generally all the world is faſt aſleep, even good men and all; the Devil may ſow what tares he will, there is no watching in prayer and in hearing of the Word, and doing good duties; no watching in obſerving the Sabbath; no watching in company; no watching alone; what may not the Devil doe, when we are all as ſleepy dogs, and love to ſnoar? and dulneſſe, and deadneſſe, and blockiſhneſſe, and worldlineſſe, and unſetled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe grows upon us to the utmoſt; there is no body watching againſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, they may come flowing in like violent waters, there is no with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them; people are like to <hi>Saul,</hi> that was marvellous finely quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at one time, he would not goe on in his envy againſt <hi>David,</hi> he ſhould not die by any meanes; no, his heart was ſo enlarged, that he bound his ſoul by a covenant, that he would be as good as his word, <hi>As the Lord lives he ſhall not die. Jonathan</hi> had uſed many arguments, and they ſo wrought upon him, that he could give the right hand to <hi>David,</hi> and all his malice was out, and <hi>David</hi> was a great man at Court again, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.6, 7, 8. But for want of watchfulneſſe, within a little while the evil ſpirit came into him, and he would have murthered him again; ſo <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he had run from God, and God had humbled him, now he would never follow lying vanities any more; now he would goe to <hi>Niniveh</hi> and preach, let what danger would come; but by and by, not looking to himſelfe, he is as much out of tune again as ever he was, as if he had never had theſe ſhinings, he was overgrown with paſſions, <hi>I doe well to be angry,</hi>

                  <hi>even to the death</hi>; I cannot tell which was the fouler diſtemper.</p>
               <p>A third Cauſe of our general deadneſs, is the lowneſs of Religion, which men generally content themſelves withal; a low kinde of Religion, that will never reach half way to Heaven, that will never attain to any quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; Religion, it is a very high thing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.24. it is a thing <hi>alone,</hi> a man muſt raiſe himſelf aloft, when he means to come into the way of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; it is an <hi>high calling, Phil.</hi> 3.14. It is ſaid of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> that <hi>his heart was lifted up in the wayes of God; Jeruſalem,</hi> that is <hi>above</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Chron. 17.</note> all godly ſouls that have true Religion indeed, are men <hi>above</hi>: Now people generally content themſelves with a low kinde of ſerving of God, that doth not come out of the ſuburbs of Hell and condemnation;<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> the ſuburbs of hell reach a great way, a man may goe even to heaven-gates, and yet be in the ſuburbs of hell; but to get into heaven, and eſcape hell beneath, is an <hi>high pitch</hi>; but men ſeek out a low way by the valleys, they think to come to heaven this way, it would choak moſt people to ſay, that <hi>their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is in heaven,</hi> as the Apoſtles was; that they are <hi>ſtrangers upon earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> as the Patriarchs were, that they hate every ſinne, as all godly men doe, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94114:26"/>
they go mourning all the day long under their corruptions and failings, and that it is the greateſt grief of their hearts that they walk not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods goodneſs, and that they uſe all means to get rid of their ſins; that they delight in every ordinance, that they delight in Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; it is the greateſt deſire of their ſouls and hearts to do thus; it would choak them to ſay thus, no they never attain it; this is the way of life that is above, but it is too high for fooles; therefore no wonder that men never come to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Pro. 15.</note> for they are not in the way of life, for <hi>the way of life is above,</hi> and they grope after the things below, and have not their converſation above; now how can we look for quickning, when we do not go in the way of life which is above?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another reaſon is the vanity of mens minds; this is the cauſe of horrible deadneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.37. vanity when a man gives way to it, it doth horribly dead the heart; vain thoughts, vain ſpeeches, vain expences of time, vain meetings together without benefit, theſe are deaders, they lock up mens hearts, and exhauſts all the good, and all the ſap of any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them; 'tis true, the children of God may talk how things go in a far country in the Church of God and other places, and they may talk of their buſineſs in the world, and this may be like bottle-beer; when it is firſt poured out into the cup it ſeems to be all froth, but by and by it turns to good liquor again; ſo though theſe diſcourſes about worldly affairs, and how things go are froth, if they go no further; yet if they turn to good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and are ſanctified, and brought home to the heart, to edifie and awaken, and bring a man nearer to God, now they are good where there is a good uſe made of them; but otherwiſe they are horrible inſtruments of death, and ſoul-murther among men.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Mutual example; we do even dead one another; for people are apt to look upon one another; Miniſters upon people, and people upon Miniſters, and Miniſters one upon another, and if we be not much caſt behind one another, we hope all is well with us; this is that which deads peoples hearts; whereas people ſhould follow Gods light, Gods dealing with them, and not look upon others; and if we look upon others, we ſhould look upon thoſe that are quickned, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.44. <hi>ſeeſt thou this woman, &amp;c.</hi> there was a woman was quickned indeed, her bowels melted, her eyes were fountains of tears, her very ſoul was affected, ſhe was quickned indeed; <hi>ſeeſt thou this woman?</hi> ſo if we will look upon others, upon the Saints of God, <hi>ſeeſt thou this woman?</hi> look upon thoſe that are moſt quickned; but when we look upon others, and ſay, ſuch a one doth ſo and ſo, and why may not I? I may do as well as he; when we do thus, this is apt to dead our hearts.</p>
               <p>The ſixth cauſe of deadneſs, is covetouſneſs and worldlineſs; Chriſtians that have been weaned from the world, ſo long as they keep their minds off from the world, and ſet them upon better things, they are full of life and quickning, and are able to pray and confer ſweetly; but when as once they come to let in the world again, this doth mightily dead and damp their hearts, this doth wonderfully lay bolts and fetters upon their ſoul, that it cannot go on as formerly, as the Apoſtle ſhews, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. as ſoon as ever a man gives way to look after the world, preſently, if he had any faith he erres from it, if he had any quickning before, he is now deaded; this deaded <hi>Demas</hi> his heart; for a time he was ſo full of life, that he was able to hold company with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but when this came once to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Demas hath forſaken me,</hi> he was gone, he was able to hold company with <hi>Paul</hi> no longer; worldlineſs will quickly take off all the affections, and all the quickning that was in the ſoul, it will preſently fail, and die, and decay; therefore you ſhall ſee when the Lord would ſet down
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94114:26"/>
how dull <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hearers were, and how heartleſs, he ſets down this as a reaſon of it, <hi>their heart is gone after their covetouſneſs, Ezek.</hi> 33. no marvel then they went not after <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Sermons; for their hearts could not go after both at once; ſo long as their hearts were after the world and profits, they muſt needs be dead and untoward to the word of God; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3. <hi>let not covetouſneſs be named among you, as becometh Saints</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, it will utterly dead and kill all your Saint-qualities and diſpoſitions that are in you, if you ſuffer your hearts to grow earthly; the damps of the earth as one ſaith, doth not more quench a candle and put it out, then the love of the world doth damp grace, and put it out preſently; and this is the cauſe of that deadneſs that is grown among us; we are grown worldly, and the world carries us away; we are all for the world, ſo that all our words, thoughts, affections, carriages, they are all little elſe but worldly; moſt people have many buſineſſes abroad in the world, riding abroad into the world; but who takes that ſhort journey into his own heart? people can tend buſineſſe with every body elſe but themſelves; they know what is done beyond ſea, and the countries round about, and yet hardly any one marks how things go in his own ſoul, whither he goes backward, or forward; whither he gets, or loſeth; every body can ask how others do, but no man looks how his own ſoul doth; people are grown at great diſtance from themſelves; I ſpeak not of drunkards or prophane perſons, ſuch as are abſolutely dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, but I ſpeak of Chriſtians in whom we ſhould look for life; we are grown ſtrangers to our ſelves, we are out of our own reach, we are grown to a mighty diſtance from looking to our own eſtates and conditions as we ought to do; our minds are ſcattered up and down about other things; therefore no marvel we are ſo heartleſſe towards God.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The next cauſe is idleneſs and ſpiritual ſloth, when men let their minds go as a boat without a guide; the boat goeth uncertainly when it hath no body to guide and ſteer it; ſo people let their thoughts, and hearts, and minds run at all adventures; people do not take pains with their own hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hold them to that which is good; we let our hearts be like the field of the ſluggard, any thing may grow in them for all us; we do not look to our hearts, that we may have good things grow in them, and that we may fence our hearts from thoſe things which may make us untoward in the wayes of God; if we have any ſtirrings at any time, we are like idle huſwives; when the liquor hath done working they forget to ſtop up the bunghole; ſo when men have any ſtirrings, then they are in motion and action; but when they are gone, they let their hearts get a vent and they are deaded again, as if they had nothing at all; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhews, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.15. though a man hath enough for the preſent, yet if he grow idle, when that is ſpent he will famiſh and ſtarve, and die; <hi>the idle ſoul ſhall ſuffer hunger</hi>; may be he hath ſomething now, but if he be idle and ſluggiſh, that may be all ſpent, and then for want of ſupply he may famiſh; ſo it is with the ſoul; though it hath ſomething for the preſent, yet if it be idle, and ſluggiſh, and ſlothful, and take not pains from day to day, it muſt needs go to wrack; when God gives us knowledge of ſin, we ſhould improve that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to root out ſin; when God gives us inſight into graces, we ſhould employ it, that we may get thoſe graces; if God give us his ordinances, if he give us a Sermon at any time, we ſhould preſently work with it. As it is with a graft that a man cuts off to plant and ſet, if he lets it lie till it be dead, it will never grow, but if he preſently plant it, it will take in the ground and proſper; ſo if a man would preſently take a good motion when it comes, if he would preſently take hold of a reproof or counſel given him out of the word of God, while it hath life in it, and works upon his heart,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94114:27"/>
the heart might receive much benefit; but when people are blockiſh and dull, they are not willing to take any pains, no wonder though they go down as they do, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>18. <hi>by much ſlothfulneſs the building decayeth, &amp;c.</hi> it is ſo in the ſpiritual building; if people be ſlothful, all gracious things muſt needs vaniſh away, and go out more and more; and this is a moſt grievous thing, it is generally among all people, nay, among the better ſort; for wicked men that live palpably in ſin, they are ſtruck dead in ſin, and never had any colour of life; but I ſpeak of thoſe that have had ſome kind of quickning, yet notwithſtanding ſuffer themſelves to be deaded through idleneſs; when we go to prayer, we do not put forth our ſelves in prayer, our prayers are dead; when we go to the word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> we do not put forth our minds, and therefore our hearing is dead; our hearts are like to a ſieve; when it is in the water it is full, but when it is once taken out again, not a jot remains; ſo it is while people are at a Sermon, may be they ſeem to drink in ſomething, and their hearts are affected (yet theſe people are rare too) but when they are gone, all is gone, all leaks out again for want of ſtopping, for want of obſerving the things they have heard; this is the reaſon there is no more life among Chriſtians, becauſe they are ſo idle and ſluggiſh;<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note>

               <p>Eighthly, In the next place, the neglect of ſecret duties is the cauſe of the deadneſs of our hearts in all duties of Religion; ſecret duties are the beſt quickners; when a man goeth alone, and ſerveth God alone, as it is ſpoken of <hi>Peter,</hi> when his heart was dead and untoward in the high Prieſts hall, if he had had any life, he would have ſtood for Chriſt; What if I be one of them? what ſay you to that? I am one, and I confeſs it, and if that be my fault, it ſhall be my fault ſtill; but he was dead and had no life; now what courſe did he take?<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>he went out</hi> (and went by himſelf) <hi>and wept bitterly</hi>; he went to a private and ſecret duty, to humble his ſoul before Almighty God; when a man is ſick and would recover his health, he go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a chamber, and ſhuts the windows, and will not let the air come in; ſo if a man would recover life and quickning, the ſaving health of his ſoul, he muſt take himſelf to his chamber, and privately deal with God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his own ſoul, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. <hi>every family apart, the houſe of</hi> David <hi>apart, and the houſe of</hi> Nathan <hi>apart</hi>; when <hi>Jeremiah</hi> would humble himſelf before God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 17. <hi>I ſate alone,</hi> ſaith he; ſo even go and ſit alone.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, are not publique duties better then private? 'tis true; they are ſo, when we may have publique duties as on the Sabbath day, or any other day, when we may go to publique ordinances, then to go to private duties, to private prayer, &amp;c. this is to deſpiſe Gods publique worſhip; but if we be not diligent in ſecret duties, in private calling upon God, if we be not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94114:27"/>
frequent in theſe, all outward duties of Gods worſhip will do us no good; the preaching of the Word will do us no good, except we preach to our ſelves; the prayers in the congregation will do us no good, if we pray not in our cloſets; now when men neglect private prayer, and ſeeking of God; when a good motion comes into their mind to ſeek God in ſecret, they put it off, they will do it anon, they ſhall have more lieſure another time, and if they do it, they do it lothly and hoverly, even ſo, ſo, they do not do it roundly and throughly as they ought to do; this deads their hearts, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.28. the Church <hi>ſate alone</hi>; that is the way to be quickned; if a man did love quickning, he would plot and ſtudy to be alone, nay, he would ſearch all the corners of his houſe for privacy; if he did love his own quickning, he would do thus, he would be frequent with God in ſecret; it is noted that the greateſt work that ever <hi>Jacob</hi> did, it was in private, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. he had ſent all his company away, and diſpatched them over the brook, he <hi>was left alone, and ſo went to tug with God all alone, and there wreſtled ſo hard, that he would not let the Angel go until he had bleſſed him</hi>; ſo this were the way for people to take God aſide, and go between him and them, and there afflict their ſouls and acknowledge all their vileneſs, there to be inſtant with him, and look up to him and bleſs him; as it is noted of our Saviour Chriſt, he would ſhift out of the way many times, and go and pray alone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.23. We may do that when we are alone, that we cannot do in any company; we may ſpeak that in private, which is not fit for the Wife, or the brother to hear; a man may do that alone, which he is not able to do when he is in company; how many ſecret arguments hath a man to move God in private? many ſecret buſineſſes that only God and his own ſoul knows off; ſo that if he would be diligent in private duties, he knows not what good he might do to his own ſoul: Now the neglect of this bleſſed Ordinance of God, of ſeeking of him in ſecret, is the cauſe of this dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nay, the want of this duty is the cauſe why publique Ordinances do us no more good.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, The next cauſe of deadneſs is the not looking after inward duties in a mans own breſt; ſpiritual life and quickning is an inward thing, and it is inward duties that muſt cheriſh it; and the omitting of theſe duties doth moſt deſtroy it and let it die. I ſay inward duties; outward duties it is more eaſie doing of them; as for a man to pray, and hear, and receive the Sacrament, and externally to obſerve the Sabbath, or outwardly to confer and ſing Pſalms, and read a Chapter; theſe outward duties a man may do them with more eaſe; nay, hypocrites may do them, and do do them, and yet never come to life and quickning; they do them after their manner; but there is no man can do them aright, but they that are quickned up to God; but I ſay men may do this, and never be quickned; but now there be inward duties, and theſe are the main quickners of the heart, and the careleſneſs of theſe is a great cauſe of deadneſſe; but what are theſe?</p>
               <p>It is the ſetting of God before a mans eyes, thinking when he goeth up and down of God, of his holineſs, of his precepts, of the danger of being under his diſpleaſure, and of the happineſs of being in his favour; it is for a man to be ſtriving againſt temptations, and oppoſing his own wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if ſin riſe up at any time, to beat it down; theſe be inward duties, which no man can ſee; if a man were in the market croſs, he might do theſe duties and no man ſee him; no man can tell what a man thinks, what he is doing in his boſome; now I ſay, if a man would be careful of theſe inward duties, what a deal of good might he gain? theſe inward duties are they that raiſe up quickning, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. <hi>take heed to the ſpirit</hi>; many take heed to their lips, they will not ſpeak; and to the outward man, they will not do evil; but <hi>take heed to your ſpirit, Eph.</hi> 5.19. <hi>ſpeak to your ſelves,</hi> ſaith the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94114:28"/>
Apoſtle, we ſpeak, may be, to others about God; this is an outward du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but we ſhould ſpeak to our ſelves; if a man loved quickning, he would reaſon the caſe with his own ſoul, and ſpeak to himſelf, and ever and anon upon occaſion retire into his own boſome, and recoile upon his own heart, and commune with himſelfe; this is it, to be inwardly reſiſting the Devil, and cheriſhing of good motions; this is an excellent thing, and nothing deads a Chriſtian ſo much as the neglect of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It is obſerved of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he was ſpeaking to the King, he was doing of an inward duty at the ſame time, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.4. At the ſame time that he ſpake to the King, he was careful of the inward duty <hi>to ſpeak to God</hi> to bleſſe him, and to be with him: So when <hi>Moſes</hi> was exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to believe in God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13, 14. At the ſame time when no body knew what <hi>Moſes</hi> did, he was doing of an inward duty, he was crying to God; as the Lord ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Moſes, why crieſt thou unto me?</hi> This was when he was converſing with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and talking with them; theſe inward duties may ſtand with any duty; they run along in prayer, and hearing of the Word: they run along when a man is in company, and when he is alone; when he is at home, and when he is abroad; when he is eating and drinking; theſe inward duties, if men would make much of them, it would make a man to have a gracious living heart. Now what ſhould ayle us but that we may doe theſe duties? we have no excuſe for the not doing of them; when we are in company, what ſhould ayle us but we may think thus? I will take heed now, I will not ſpeak words that my heart may reproach me for afterwards, I will behave my ſelfe as I ought; though a perſecutor of Religion were in company, can he know theſe thoughts? No man can perſecute or mock him for any of theſe; a man may think as good thoughts as he will, if he hath an heart to them; and this will keep up a mans quickning; when a man goeth abroad, what ſhould hinder but he may be imployed in inward duties, conſidering ſeriouſly, and thinking ſolemnly, how it ſtands between God and his ſoule? what ſhall hinder a man from theſe duties? Now the neglect of theſe is the cauſe of the deadneſſe of mens hearts; people come to Church, and hear Sermons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what do ye do within? do you ſet up Gods Ordinances in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes? do you ſet up a Chriſtian watch in your boſomes? and prayer in your boſoms? how do you go up and down all day long? is heaven in your boſoms? is the fear of God in your boſoms, preſerving and keeping of you? This is that which will quicken you; and a man can never be quickned, if he make not conſcience of this.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Another cauſe of deadneſſe, is peoples contenting themſelves with what they have attained unto; if they have gotten any thing, they are apt to ſet up their ſtaves there, and content themſelves as if all were well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the cauſe of the deadneſſe of peoples hearts, becauſe every little ſufficeth them; if they have but any hope that they are of God, and fear his name; if they finde they have any thing in them, they are apt to be ſecure, and not to be earneſt to grow in grace from day to day. Now when this gets into a mans heart, it will dead him preſently; therefore the Apoſtle, when he perceived many of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> deaded their hearts this way, he ſhakes them up, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on unto perfection:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, Let us on, on, for ſhame unto perfection, let us proceed further, let us not ever be learning and never come to the knowledge of the truth; let us not be ever laying a foundation, and never building thereupon; let us not be ever going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout repentance, and faith, and the firſt principles of the Oracles of God, and never come to perfection: This is the effect of the Epiſtles of <hi>Peter,</hi> that people ſhould not content themſelves with what they have, but that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94114:28"/>
they may grow and goe forward; <hi>Deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. <hi>and grow in grace,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. He is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon this, that no man ſhould content himſelfe with any meaſure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained; if he do, his heart will be deaded, and made dull and bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh to all goodneſſe; and this is another cauſe of the deadneſs of peoples hearts, they are at a ſtay, they are at a ſtand; every man (may be) would be a good Chriſtian, and a childe of God; and if he can get but any hope that he is a childe of God, now he is ſafe, and now he goeth dully and blockiſhly on, if he can but hold there; and if he hath any fears that he is not right, then may be he begins to ſtir himſelfe a little; but as ſoon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he gets any hopes again that he is right, he goeth on in a blockiſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and paſſeth over holy things otherwiſe then he ought to doe; and then if any ſpurs come into his conſcience, and awaken him, may be he ſtirs again, till he gets up a little hope that his condition is good, and then he falls off, and grows as ſecure again as he was before; and this deads the hearts of people.</p>
               <p>I come now to the meanes how a man may be quickened,<note place="margin">Means of quickning.</note> and the firſt is this. If we would be quickened, we muſt believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">1. Means.</note> we muſt goe to him (I ſpeak now to good people) if you would be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, you muſt goe and fetch it from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; he is a fountain of life opened unto all that come unto him; <hi>I am come</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly,</hi> John 10.10. Chriſt is not only come to quicken the dead, and raiſe them up that they may be alive towards God, barely, and nakedly; but he came to make all his people lively, that they ſhould have more life and quickning, and be more enlarged in grace; he came not onely to work the thing, but to work a growth and increaſe of it more and more: Now if you would know how to come by this life in Chriſt Jeſus, the only way is to believe in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 7.38 <hi>He that believeth in me, out of his belly ſhall flow Rivers of living water</hi>; there ſhall be rivers of ſpiritual life in that man, that ſhall never be drawn dry; ſo then, doe any of us ſtand ſticking at this, how ſhall we be quickned, and ſhake off this deadneſs that is in us? I ſay, look up to Chriſt, and labour truly and unfainedly to deſire him, and hunger and thirſt after him; if we did ſearch after Chriſt, wee ſhould be quickned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; there is no man is dead, but he that hath no care to look after Chriſt, and deſire him; if we would have Chriſt, if our hearts be open to him; if we doe but deſire him, and long for him, if we have but theſe groanes, and outgoings in our ſouls, oh that I had but Chriſt ſhed abroad in my heart! if I had him, I ſhould have life and quickning; if I had him, I ſhould have right and title to all Gods heavenly comforts; if our hearts did but goe up and down longing after Chriſt, this is the way to attain to quickning. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, &amp;c.</hi> Come, and ye ſhall have waters that ſhall never be dried up; the want of faith is the cauſe of hardneſs of heart, and of deadneſſe; as our Saviour Chriſt, when he ſaw they were dead, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. he did upbraid them <hi>with unbeliefe</hi>; if a man did but once believe, if a man did but truly caſt his ſoul upon God, if he had but once his eyes opened to ſee the vanity of all other things, to ſee the danger of ſinne and iniquity, the miſery of all unregenerate people, and to ſee the worth of Chriſt, and the infinite goodneſſe of God in Chriſt, what an admirable pearl it is to enjoy him; how it is better then life it ſelfe, better then the whole world, yea, then thouſands of worlds; if a man did but ſee this, and had his heart affected with this, to be drawn to Chriſt, and to have his heart and minde run after him, to be poſſeſſed of him, this is faith; you that would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have faith or no, if you had all the faiths in the world, you are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94114:29"/>
infidels without this faith; but if you have this faith, you have true faith; if you have a heart running after Chriſt, minding him, and longing for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and caſting your ſoules upon him for all good, accounting this your principal, and total, and main good, and accordingly affecting this, theſe are the works of faith; and if you have theſe works, you may be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſet your hearts upon him, and ſeek after him, and you ſhall have all manner of good, even life it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meanes is,<note place="margin">Second means</note> a careful learning of the Word of God preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were marvellouſly blocked up in their minds and hearts, and were ſtraightned in good things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 12. mark what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Our mouth is open to you. &amp;c.</hi> as who ſhould ſay, In our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery there is abundance of grace, abundance of life, and largeneſſe of heart, abundance of gracious things; all manner of good things we bring with us in our Miniſtery; peace, and comfort, and hope, and all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, and all the rich treaſures of Jeſus Chriſt; we come with our armes full; <hi>you are not ſtraightned</hi> here, <hi>but you are ſtraightned in your own bowels</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, you may be enlarged ſweetly by our Miniſtery; we deliver unto you abundance of grace and mercy, and abundance of ſupply; all thoſe deadneſſes, and lockings up of heart in you, would be healed by the Miniſtery of the Word; ſo may, I ſay, if your hearts are locked up, certainly it is for not taking what the Word offers; if you would come hungerly and greedily to the Word of God, with an heart deſirous to be edified and inſtructed, and to apply what the Word ſpeaks to your ſoules, certainly you ſhall here meet with abundance of grace and life; for the Word is the Word of life, and the Miniſtery of the Word is the Miniſtery of the Spirit of God and life, ſo that the deadneſs of all people is meerly from their own bowels; <hi>you are not ſtraightned in us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; no, in the Miniſtery of the Word is abundance of life.</p>
               <p>The third meanes is, A careful ſhunning of all thoſe cauſes of deadneſs which we named formerly; we muſt take heed of ſin; for if we give way to ſinne, it will dead the heart, it will make a make a man ſhy of God, and put a man to woful tasks, and breed lothneſs to goe about duties; it will make a man to have a guilty conſcience, and dead a man that way; it will grieve the ſpirit of God, and quench all the operations, and ſweet influences, and gracious motions of the Spirit, that the ſweet livelineſſe of his workings will be gone away, if a man give way to ſinne; if he give way to the world, or ſlackning in a godly courſe; if a man give way to pride or vanity, or any ſin; this will dead the heart, a mans heart will preſently be deaded, if he give way to the Devil, and to his temptations. In particular, you muſt take heed of niggardlineſſe in Religion; they that love quickning, muſt labour for a frank and free ſpirit, that will rather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdoe in Gods ſervice then underdoe; as long as a man hath a free heart, he ſhall have a quickened heart; therefore labour to preſerve it; doe as <hi>Philemon, I know thou wilt doe more then I ſay. Paul</hi> knew he had a free ſpirit, that if he commanded him a little, he would doe more; he would rather overdoe then underdoe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Saviour Chriſt calls for this free ſpirit; <hi>If a man take thy coat, give him thy cloak alſo</hi>; rather overdoe then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe in any good thing; have a free heart; if God bid thee pray, pray three times, five times a day, rather then not often enough; there be many duties that God doth not ſet down how often, and how frequent, and how long; now labour for a free ſpirit; rather do twice as much, then underdo.</p>
               <p>Again, Take heed of lowneſſe of Religion, of taking up a low, and baſe, and mean kinde of Religion, that will not reach the Kingdome of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94114:29"/>
God; there is a low kinde of Chriſtianity, that wil not be able to attain to ſalvation; a low faith, that doth not make a man to have his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven; a low repentance, that reacheth not to mortification; a low profeſſion of Religion, that comes not to the power of Godlineſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.24. <hi>The way of life is above</hi>; it is an high thing, therefore take heed of low Religion; for people think that any kinde of righteouſneſs will ſerve turn; if they have but a little Reformation and Religion, they preſently think this is godlineſs; but let us take heed of this low Religion, that will never do the deed.</p>
               <p>Again, We muſt take heed of want of Watchfulneſſe; we muſt ſet up a gracious and Chriſtian watch in our hearts from day to day; when the Lord had found fault with the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> for being dead, in the next words he bids them <hi>be watchful</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, the want of this watchfulneſs, and looking to your ſelves, and having a care over your thoughts and affections, leſt you ſhould be drawn aſide, the neglect of this is the cauſe of all deadneſs.</p>
               <p>Again, We muſt take heed of vanity; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.37. <hi>Turn away <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ne eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken me O Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, We muſt take heed of covetouſneſs; for we ſhall never have any gracious work upon us, if we give way of it.</p>
               <p>Again, We ſhould take heed of ſlacking and abating private duties; we ſhould carefully call upon God every day in ſecret, when there is no body by but God and our own ſouls; if we finde backwardneſs to this duty, know it comes from the Devil, that would drown us in perdition if he could; therefore we muſt reſiſt him, and goe about it; for certainly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we cannot be quickned.</p>
               <p>Again, We ſhould take heed of ſlighting inward duties, the holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God in our boſoms, holy meditations, gracious ſtrivings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt corruptions when they ariſe, ſetting the Lord before us, ſeeking Gods preſence in all places; we muſt have a care we have gracious purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and endeavours, and ſtrivings inwardly in our boſomes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Let us take heed of contenting our ſelves with any pitch we have attained; but ſtill labour to grow in grace, leſt we fall ſhort, and never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Gods reſt.</p>
               <p>The next meanes is to be earneſt with God to quicken our hearts;<note place="margin">The fourth meanes.</note> to pray to God for his grace, that God would be pleaſed to put life into us; we ſhould make <hi>Elijahs</hi> prayer, that prayed to heaven for fire to come downe upon the ſacrifice; ſo pray earneſtly to God to ſend down his celeſtial fire into thy heart, to warm thee, and heat thee, and ſtir thee up to that which is good; as the Church doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.18. <hi>Quicken us, and we will call,</hi> &amp;c. Of all Petitions under heaven, we ſhould pray moſt of all for life, next unto the glory of God, and the ſalvation of our ſouls (nay indeed, as the very means for both) we ſhould pray that God would quicken us; into all our prayers let us put in this Petition, that God would quicken us; evermore to have it as the ſtanding deſire of our ſouls, and the daily requeſt and ſuit we have at the throne of grace that God would quicken us; there is no grace we have more need of then this; and indeed it is that which ſets all other Graces a work; if we did know how ready God would be to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch a ſuit, we would be more ready to pray to God for it; there is no man ſo tenderly welcome to God, as he that prayes for quickning; the more he is weary of deadneſs and common profeſſing of God, the more welcome to God; he would fain fear God indeed, and pleaſe God indeed; when a man is poſſeſſed with deep ſtudies how to attain to this, this man is a welcome man to the throne of grace; therefore let us ſtir up our ſelves to this; there is no mercy better then this, that God ſhould quicken us, <hi>Pſalm</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:94114:30"/>
119.156. <hi>Great are thy tender mercies, quicken me, O Lord!</hi> He takes here quickning for all Gods gracious mercies and tender compaſſions; he takes the quickning of his heart as a gracious effect of Gods infinite mercy to his ſoul; if we had but this, how welcome would good duties and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of doing and receiving good be unto us?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5. Meanes.</note>The fifth meanes is to be diligent, and to take earneſt and effectual pains in this work, and in all Chriſtian duties, in all the worſhip of God; there is a ſecret bleſſing of God upon thoſe that take pains, even in the meaneſt calling; you ſhall have poor Widows that have four or five ſmall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to keep; yet being painful, it is a wonderful thing what a bleſſing of God is upon them, that they make a ſhift to live, and never come to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Pariſh; ſuch a bleſſing of God there is upon the diligent, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The band of the diligent maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10.4. So it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſpiritual life; there is a ſecret bleſſing of God upon the men and women that labour, and are diligent about the meanes of grace, and are careful to take paines to have them made profitable to their ſouls; upon thoſe that are diligent in prayer, and ſtriving againſt ſin, diligent in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word, diligent in partaking of the Sacrament when it comes, and diligent about the Sabbath, that they may not loſe the benefit of it; it is a wonderful bleſſing that ſhall accompany ſuch men; they ſhall thrive in grace, when as others ſhall be like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean kine, that devoured all their fellows, and yet were lean and ill-favoured ſtill; it is not the greatneſs of a mans comings in that makes a man rich, but the well-managing of it; there is many a rich Heir comes to poverty, when as another that was never born to a foot of Land, yet with pains, and labour, and induſtry, is well able to live, and give more to any good uſe, then twenty baſe idle fellows; let a man hold but a little ground, twenty acres, he may grow more rich upon it, being a good husband, then another man that holds twenty times as much, and is a ſpend thrift, and lazy, and careleſs, and never looks how buſineſs goes forward; there is a bleſſing of God upon labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.11. <hi>He that gathers by labour ſhall increaſe.</hi> So it is here; it is not he that lives under the beſt Miniſtery, that is moſt quickned, but he that lives under a poor Miniſtery, and is diligent, he is better then hundreds that live under the powerfull Preaching of the Word, and never are carefull to improve it. It is noted of <hi>Johns</hi> hearers, that many of them had more life, then they that ſate under Chriſts Miniſtery: It is noted of <hi>Job,</hi> though he dwelt in <hi>Midian,</hi> where was no meanes of grace, yet he had more grace and life in his heart then almoſt all the Church of God that dwelt in <hi>Zion</hi>; there was hardly a man in all <hi>Iſrael</hi> like <hi>Job; Paul,</hi> though he came into the Vineyard after all the Apoſtles, yet by his labour and diligence he gat before moſt of them all; ſo a man that ſits under the Miniſtery, and takes pains with his heart, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons he heares may do him good, that he may be the better for them; if a man labours to get good by the Sacrament, to get good by conference; if he labour to have every Ordinance of God made profitable to him; this man, with a little grace, ſhall grow more then thouſands that goe on idly, and yet have more helps then he; therefore if we deſire to be quickned, let us be diligent, and take pains, and not go with our hands in our boſomes, like <hi>Solomons</hi> ſluggard.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6. Means.</note> Another means is to exerciſe that grace we have; there is never a man in this Congregation hath ſo little grace, but if he did exerciſe it, ſo far as it would goe, who knows how much quickning he might quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have? which of you do not know that there is a God? and that there is a Heaven, and an Hell, and the Principles of Religion? if you would but make conſcience to make uſe of all the checks of conſcience, and the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94114:30"/>
knowledge you have, if you would but make uſe of the relentings you have now and then, and the motions you have now and then, if you would but make uſe of them, and exerciſe them, this is the way to quicken you; let a man have but a little knowledge, and let him exerciſe it and improve it, and frame his life and converſation accordingly, knowledge ſhall be multiplied to this man; and ſo again, let a man have any relentings, any meltings now and then at a Sermon and exerciſe theſe, ſtrike while the iron is hot, and put them to the utmoſt, this is the way to be quickned; as it is the ſaying of one, Every thing is increaſed with the exerciſe of its own kind; as it was with the bread in the Diſciples hands, while they were diſtributing of it, it increaſed; ſo it is with the graces of Gods ſpirit, peculiar and ſaving graces, and common graces; let a man exerciſe the graces of Gods ſpirit, this is the way to abound in them, and to have them quickned and ſtrengthned, and made more and more operative in a man; therefore let us exerciſe all the graces of Gods ſpirit, and improve them all; grace is like a ſnow-ball, the more it is rouled up and down, the bigger it grows; ſo let a man but go and improve all the graces of Gods ſpirit that he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him, there will be addition to every one of them; by repenting a man may learn to repent; and by relenting, a man may learn to relent; and by ſtriving againſt ſin; he may learn to ſtrive againſt ſin more and more.</p>
               <p>The laſt means is to conſider the examples of the worthies in all ages,<note place="margin">7. Means.</note> and ſuch as are even in our dayes, we ſhould conſider theſe, and theſe will quicken us up to be more forward;<note place="margin">James 5.</note> when St. <hi>James</hi> would quicken up the Chriſtians to whom he writes, to waite with patience the coming of the Lord, he quickens them by the example of <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>the Prophets</hi>; ſo when he would quicken them up to prayer, he preſſeth them by the example of <hi>Elias, he was a man as well as we,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and had the like paſſions, yet he prayed when the heavens had been ſhut three years and ſix months, &amp;c.</hi> Conſider this; the zeal of others may provoke us; ſpecially if we ſet it before our eyes, we ſhould think with our ſelves, What he ſo believing, and I ſo full of doubting? he ſo lively, and I ſo dull and blockiſh? he ſo affected, and I ſo untoward? this ſhould ſhame us, and provoke us to ſtir up our ſelves by looking upon ſuch, eſpecially upon thoſe that have taken up the profeſſion ſince we did, and yet have gone beyond us; it ſhould awaken us; this is an excellent means to quicken us; as our Saviour Chriſt, when he would exhort his Diſciples to ſuffer perſecution, ſaith he, conſider the <hi>Prophets that were perſecuted before</hi> you,; ſo if we would be quickned up,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> we ſhould look upon the Saints that have been quickned before us, that we may have their grace and comfort.</p>
               <p>We come now to the laſt thing, and that is to perſwade you by ſome Motives to ſhake off this deadneſs;<note place="margin">Motives. 5</note> Motives are ſpecial things to quicken up a man; the Apoſtle when he would quicken up the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to love, he uſeth divers Motives unto them; the firſt is taken from the collation of love, with all the extraordinary gifts of Gods ſpirit; he ſhews, without love they are all nothing, <hi>though a man had all knowledge, and all faith, ſo that he could remove mountains, and had not love, it were nothing</hi>; ſo that you ſee love is an excellent grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. Another Motive he takes from the effects and adjuncts of love, <hi>love ſuffereth long, &amp;c.</hi> from the fourth to the ſeventh <hi>verſe.</hi> Thirdly, He uſeth another Motive to ſhew how love doth generally ſurpaſs moſt graces in the endurance of it; <hi>Propheſies they ſhall ceaſe, knowledge that ſhall ceaſe and be done away, but love that ſhall never be done away</hi>; love never faileth. Laſtly, He compares it with the cardinal vertues, with the principal graces, namely, faith and hope, and ſhews how love is beyond them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hope edifies a mans ſelf, but love edifies the whole Church
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94114:31"/>
of God; faith and hope muſt vaniſh, and will not go into the Kingdom of heaven with us, but love it doth alwayes accompany us; ſo that you ſee the Apoſtle is careful to uſe motives to quicken up people to that which he exhorts them unto; the Scripture as it doth bid us do a duty, ſo it uſeth motives to quicken us up to the doing of it.</p>
               <p>And again, When it forbids any ſin, it uſeth motives to take off our hearts from that ſin; as when the Apoſtle would diſwade from the unworthy receiving of the Sacrament, what abundance of motives doth he heap one upon another to terrifie us from it? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the firſt is from the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>I have received of the Lord that which alſo I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> as who ſhould ſay, what will you prophane his inſtitution. Secondly, From the time when he inſtituted it, <hi>the ſame night he was betrayed</hi>; in his agony and in the midſt of his ſorrows he thought of your good; &amp; will you prophane ſuch a mercy &amp; bleſſing? Thirdly, From the nature of the Sacrament, <hi>it is the Sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and will you not reverence that? Another is from the end of the Sacrament, it is <hi>to ſhew forth the Lords death till he comes</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how ſhould we have a care of this? that we may come to the Sacrament in a gracious and reverent manner, duly meditating what it is, having a lively apprehenſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to keep a conſtant memory of what he hath done for us. Another is from the greatneſs of the ſin of unworthy receiving, <hi>he ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt</hi>; again, from the danger of it, <hi>whoſoever eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himſelf</hi>; again, from the particular judgements that God had inflicted upon that town, <hi>for this cauſe many are ſick among you, and many ſleep</hi>; and queſtionleſs it is for this cauſe, for your unworthy receiving of the Sacrament; you ſee what abundance of motives he brings for this; now I ſay if Motives be good in any point, look whatſoever we exhort people unto if it be good to uſe Motives to ſtir them up to it, then much more in this point; in the point of deadneſs to ſhake it off, in the point of quickning that they would labour to get it; and indeed when a man uſeth Motives to faith and repentance, it is not only to get that, but to quicken them up to faith and repentance; when a man ſpurs a horſe, it is not only to make him go, but to quicken him up to go; we are all dull and careleſs and blockiſh; now Motives ſerve to ſtir us up, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. <hi>the words of the wiſe are as goads</hi> to provoke and ſtir up people.</p>

               <p>Firſt, There is a dulneſſe and blockiſhneſſe of mind, dull and heavy to learn any thing that is good; as it is ſaid of the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.27. when a man hath an unteachable mind, though he be never ſo long under the word of God, it cannot ſtrike into his heart, and enter into his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, his mind cannot feel the weight of divine truths; take outward truths of profit and pleaſure, a man may lead him up and down with theſe truths he feels weight in theſe; but for the word of God he hath no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in that: may be he can tell what the Miniſters ſay, and talk of it; but for the weight of divine reaſon, the mind is blockiſh to this; men are like to a blockiſh ſcholler that hath gone ſeven years to ſchool, and yet is not beyond the primmer; ſo when a man ſhall ſit ſo long under the Miniſtry of the word, and yet be a ſtranger to it, as if he had never heard of it; he hears diſcourſes of faith, and can ſpeak of it, and talk of it, of the letter of it as well as the beſt believer, and yet is as blockiſh to go about it as can be; what an horrible thing is this? that the truth ſhould come to a mans mind, and a man ſhould be dull to conceive it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:94114:31"/>Secondly, Another evil is awkneſs and averſeneſs of heart, liſtleſeneſs to the wayes of Jeſus Chriſt; as Chriſt ſaith of the Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.8. their hearts cannot be pulled to that which is good, their hearts are untoward, and have no liſt or diſpoſition that way; even as if a man ſhould go about a thing that he hath no heart to, ſo people go about prayer and the hearing of the word, as if they had no heart to it; they have no heart to prayer, they have no heart to think ſoundly of God, and of their latter end; they come to duties, but their hearts are a thouſand miles off.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is ſenſeleſneſs of conſcience, it is not tender of little ſins, it feels them not at all; and as for great ſins, it feels them but a little; may be peoples conſciences find fault with them from day to day for doing what they do, and tells them they ought not to do it, but yet they will not leave their ſins; it tells them thus and thus they ought to do, but it hath no power to make them do it; may be it accuſeth them, but they are never the better, peoples conſciences are dull and blunt and have no force at all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For coldneſs and lukewarmneſs of affections; the affections of a man are not ſet upon God; they pray without affections, and hear without affections, the doctrine of eternal life doth not affect their hearts; hatred of evil is cold, and love of God and goodneſs is cold, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>the love of many ſhall waxe cold,</hi> and ſo their deſires are cold and languiſh and come to nothing; we can find tears for other matters,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> but not for our ſins; we can have our affections ſoon ſtirred when our ſelves and our own wills are croſſed, but God may be diſhonoured a thouſand wayes, and we never grieved or moved at it; ſo when we hear a fine ſtory, and carnal news, this delights; but when we hear the word of God, the truth of God that concerns our eternal well doing, we are not moved, or affected at all with that.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Another ingredient of this ſin is the weakneſs and faintneſs of endeavours; if people have any endeavours, any kinde of putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forth to that which is good, it is with faintneſs, as if they cared not whither they went about it yea or no; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.4. people deſire mercy and pardon, and would have hope and ſalvation, and the Kingdom of God, but will not be at the coſt and charges they ought to be at for theſe things; this is nothing but the deadneſſe of our hearts.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That ſame dulneſs and drowſineſs of the whole man; though men be careful enough of outward things, yet how careleſs are they of their ſouls? were our hearts broken and contrite under theſe things, we ſhould be ſoon quickned; as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>I revive the ſpirit of the contrite one</hi>; ſo God would revive us if we were ſenſible of theſe diſtempers of ours; if we would humble our ſelves before God, and plead to him for help, he would help us; but when we do not lay theſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to heart, and ſeek out to God for redreſs, no marvel though we are dead and dull ſtill; well then, is it ſo? that there are ſo many horrible ingredients in this ſin of deadneſs, then how ſhould we labour to fling it away, and uſe all means to be quickned? the Apoſtle being to diſſwade from following the will of the Gentiles, he uſeth this very argument, the abundance of the vile ingredients that is in the will of the Gentiles, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. ſo you may ſee how the wiſe man diſſwades, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.25. <hi>when he ſpeaketh fair, believe him not; for there are ſeven abominations in his heart</hi>: ſo let us think there is ſeven abominations, yea ſeventy times ſeven abominations in this ſin of deadneſs; therefore let us look out that God may help us and quicken us, and revive us in all our wayes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond motive is to conſider that as long as we are dead we cannot <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>2</label>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:94114:32"/>
pray, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.18. <hi>Lord, quicken us and we will call upon thy name</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, Lord, we are not ſit to pray and call upon thy name except thou quicken us; therefore quicken us, that we may call upon thee: So Miniſters cannot preach unleſs they be quickned; as Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> tells a ſtory of a godly man of <hi>France,</hi> there was ſuch cold preaching that he was fain to go out of the Town to ſit under a powerful Miniſtry; therefore we cannot preach if we be dead; the Scribes and Phariſees preached without Authority and life, they were dead, and therefore had no authority in their preaching, but Chriſt preached with Authority; if we were quickned we ſhould be the better able to preach: So again, you are not able to hear unleſs you be quickned; a dead heart may hear a thouſand Sermons, but what doth it work upon them? even as good as nothing; if <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or an Angel from heaven ſhould preach to us, unleſs God quicken us, all is nothing; nay, Chriſt tells us, that his own Miniſtry, and <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtry, there were not two ſuch in all the world again, yet how dead and fruitleſs were they? <hi>whereunto ſhall I liken this generation? &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 11.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the meaning is this, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt he came mourning and in a doleful manner, faſting and afflicting himſelf, and crying out Repent; he mourned but none would relent; Chriſt he came piping, he came in another manner, he came eating and drinking, and he preached gracious things, the Kingdom of God and the acceptable year of our Lord; now ſaith he, <hi>you have not daunced,</hi> all theſe things have not affected your hearts a jot, you are as blockiſh as if you had no Miniſtry at all; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.22. <hi>let the dead bury their dead</hi>; what doth he mean by that? he means thoſe that are dead in their ſouls; thoſe that are dead in their ſpirits and ſouls, they are fit for dead imployments and nothing elſe; the coherence was this, there was a man came to Chriſt, and was willing it ſeems to be the Diſciple of Chriſt; but oh ſaith he, <hi>firſt I pray thee, let me go and bury my father</hi>; bury thy father? ſaith he, any man may ſerve for that, <hi>let the dead bury their dead,</hi> thoſe that are fit for nothing elſe may do that; but if thy heart be alive, thou art fit for me, thou art fit for ſpiritual employments; but when a man hath a dead heart he is fit for nothing; as Chriſt, he gave the bag to <hi>Judas,</hi> he was the fitteſt man for that; ſo let a man be in office, if he be dead, he hath no heart to puniſh ſin, no not ſo much as to uſe his faithful endeavour to root it out; nay, he will pull down the guilt of the ſins of the pariſh upon his own ſoul, rather then he will ſtickle a little for God, <hi>Judg.</hi> 4.8. how back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was <hi>Barak</hi> to go againſt the enemies of the Lord? <hi>if you will go, I will go,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Deborah,</hi> otherwiſe he had no heart to go; ſo <hi>Eſther,</hi> how dull was ſhe to ſtand for the Church of God? ſhe would let the Church be ruinated rather then ſhe would go and ſpeak to the King in the behalf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but that <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſtirred her up ſoundly; now is not this a ſufficient motive to ſtir us up to labour for quickning? how can we do the things God calls for from day to day? we ſhould ſtand for him, and call upon him, and ſet up his worſhip in our families; we ſhould fear his name, and ſet him before our eyes, and fight againſt ſin, and labour to pleaſe him in all our wayes; now without being quickned we are fit for none of theſe things; now what a woful thing is it when we ſhall not be furniſhed to every good work as we ſhould, and fitted to do that which God requires of us; therefore let us ſhake off this dulneſs and blockiſhneſs of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, Another motive is this, we can have no true ſign at all to our ſouls, that we have any true grace at all as long as we are dead; when Chriſt is ſaid to give a man grace, he is ſaid <hi>to quicken</hi> a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.21. converſion is called the life of the dead; a mans repentance is no better then the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a reprobate, unleſs it be repentance from dead works, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto life; if a man hath faith, it is not the faith of Gods elect if it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94114:32"/>
doth not quicken him, <hi>I live by faith,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2.20. juſtification is communicated only to a man that is quickned; God together with juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth quicken a man, he doth revive him and make him alive towards God; nay, we have no argument that we have our ſins forgiven us, unleſſe God hath quickned us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. <hi>he hath quickned them, having forgiven them all treſpaſſes</hi>; when God forgives the treſpaſſes of his people, he doth quicken them, he takes away the dulneſs of their hearts, and the blockiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their minds, and the ſenſeleſneſs of their conſciences, and their awkneſs and untowardneſs to that which is good; he doth quicken them up; every man hath life, for we ſee how lively men are in ſeeking after their profits and pleaſures, people have life enough, but it is upon things here below; and they have affections enough, love enough, and hope enough, and joy and delight enough in the world, but they are ſet upon carnal things; but if grace comes into the heart, it is the vigour of the heart; now as long as we are dead and dull, what ſign of grace can we have? if we have grace, yet we cannot have any proof and comfort of it as long as we are drowzy and dull; 'tis true, no man can have any grace but he hath ſome life; but if he doth not quicken up himſelf, he hinders himſelf of the peace and comfort that otherwiſe he might have; hence it is that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is troubled, and people are unſetled, and are ſo full of fears to dye; hence it is that people are ſo like to the ſea, the waves whereof cannot reſt; their minds are unquiet and unſetled; it is for want of quickning, if we were quickned we ſhould have great peace come into our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We cannot grow in grace unleſs we are quickned; as long as <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>4</label> we are thus dull and heavy and lumpiſh to the things that are good, we cannot grow in grace. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.7. <hi>they ſhall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine</hi>; firſt they ſhall revive, and then grow; firſt God quickens a man, and then he makes him grow; the <hi>Philippians</hi> love was dead to <hi>Paul,</hi> afterwards it quickned again; now ſaith he, <hi>your love flouriſheth, Phil.</hi> 4.10. now their hearts were quickned, it began to grow; but when a man hath a dead heart, how can he grow? as he ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4. <hi>can the branch bear fruit without the vine?</hi> ſo may I ſay, can a mans heart grow in goodneſs without life? it is only a living creature that can grow; if a plant be once dead, it withers away and cannot grow; if a man have a dead heart, though he ſhould hear lectures and ſermons every day, he would never grow, he would be never the more holy, never the more godly; if he ſhould have family prayer, cloſet prayer, yet if he ſhould be dead, he ſhould have never the more ability againſt his temptations; though the ordinances of God be admirable helps to growing, yet if a man be dead and dull, they will never help him to grow in grace; though grace be of a growing nature, yet a dead heart ſtarves all the graces that a man hath.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Another motive is this, as long as we are dead, we ſhall be ſo <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>5</label> far from growing, that we ſhall be hardly able to keep our own, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. <hi>ſtrengthen the things that remain, that are ready to dye</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, thou art ſo far from growing, that the good things that are in thee are even ready to dye; thou wilt loſe that very good that is in thee if thou doſt not ſhake off this deadneſs and careleſeneſs, and heartleſeneſs to that which is good; as it is with a man that hath a conſumption upon his body, he is ſo far from growing that he rather pines away, he waxeth more and more faint, and groweth deader, and waxeth neerer to his end, he pines away; ſo when a man is dead, (though not quite dead) his heart is deaded, he <hi>doth pine away</hi>; as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10. if we pine away, how ſhall we do? yet thus it is, if a man hath a dead heart he doth pine away; I, and again, how is it poſſible for a man whoſe heart is dead to prayer, and he hath no affections to that which is good? if there be any opportunity to that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94114:33"/>
which is good, he hangs off; how can this man doe otherwiſe but wax worſe and worſe? for he wants that which ſhould work out ſin; if it be a ſpringing water, it will work out the mud; but if it be a ſtanding water, it will grow thicker and thicker, and will be noyſome; ſo if the body be alive, though it be never ſo full of ill humours, if it be lively, nature will work them out; but if the pangs of death be upon a man, every diſeaſe and diſtemper gets the victory, his nature cannot work it out now; ſo it is with a man that hath a dead heart, he cannot work out the corruption that daily bubbles up in his heart; as <hi>Eli,</hi> though he had never ſo many corruptions, he had no heart to root them out; 'tis true, he reproved his ſons, but it was to no purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as good never a whit as never the better; ſo when <hi>Solomon</hi> was grown dead, and had loſt his former life of grace, afterwards when corruption grew in his heart, he could not work it out; for when God had choſen <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to be put in his room, though <hi>Solomon</hi> knew that it was of God, and he ſet him up to be King, yet he could not work out this corruption, but his heart to his dying day roſe up againſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> and he ſought to kill him; he wanted the life of grace he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſin got up, and he could not work it out ſoundly to his dying day. Now is not this a moſt grievous thing? the very conſideration of this, how ſhould it provoke us to ſhake off this deadneſs? Can that body do well that hath loſt his expulſive faculty? when diſtempers ariſe it cannot expell them, it muſt needs be the deſtruction of the body; ſo when the life of the ſoul is either in part or wholly taken away, how can he work out his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and diſtempers that daily ariſe in him? we have need of grace, and life, and quickning; we are tempted every day, and the corruptions that dwell in us, are ever boyling up. Now if we have not the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty to purge them out, the heart muſt needs be in a woful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>6</label> Sixthly, This ſin of deadneſs, in ſome ſenſe, is worſe then any other ſin, and that in ſix reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Other ſins, for the moſt part, are in one part of a man; as drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs is in the appetite, and covetouſneſs is in the concupiſcible faculty, and pride and oſtentation is in the heart, and ignorance is in the minde; but deadneſs is in all the whole man; as it is with a languiſhing diſeaſe; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſes, one may be in the head, another in the neck, another in the back; but a Conſumption runs over all the whole man; So it is with dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as it was with the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi>; when they were grown dead and careleſs, he chargeth them that they were dead all over; <hi>Thou art poor, and blind,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and miſerable, and naked</hi>; this heaps all miſeries upon a man; ſuch a man is like unto <hi>Judah, From the crown of the head, to the ſole of the foot, there was no ſound part,</hi> Iſa. 1.6. It is a general diſeaſe; it is like the deluge that drowned the whole world, it drowns the whole man; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe drunkenneſs, and adultery, and ſuch particular ſinnes, may kill and damn a man; but I ſay by accident, deadneſs is worſe then they; 'tis true, drunkenneſſe, and adultery, and prophaneſſe are worſe; but why are they worſe but becauſe they have this deadneſſe too? but if they could be taken alone, and a man might have a living heart towards God otherwiſe, they ſhould not be worſe then deadneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Other ſins are againſt one commandement of God, or two, or ſo; but this deadneſſe is againſt all the commandements of God; it is a ſin againſt prayer, for we ſhould pray with life; it is a ſin againſt hearing, for we ſhould hear with life; it is a ſin againſt the Sabbath, for we ſhould keep it with delight; it is a ſin againſt all the Ordinances of God, for we ſhould come to them all with life and affection. Suppoſe a ſervant, his Maſter ſhould bid him do a thing; he bids him goe to one place, he goes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94114:33"/>
to another; he goes &amp; drinks, and ſwills; another ſervant he goes about that his Mr. bids him, but whatſoever his Mr. bids him do, he goes about it ſlothfully, and by halfs; this ſervant is a worſe ſervant then the other why? becauſe this ſervant offends in all the buſineſs he hath to do whatſoever his Mr. ſets him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, he marrs it, and doth it to halfs: So deadneſs of heart it diſables a man to every duty, to whatſoever God requires of a man; and this is one of the reaſons why he that breaks one of the commandements of God, is ſaid to break them all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10, 11. Why? becauſe he deads his heart, a man that gives way to ſin againſt any one commandement, deads his heart to all; and ſo by reaſon of that deadneſs, he becoms gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lty of all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Other ſins are not ſo deep in the ſoul; but this deadneſs is deeper then all; a man will be willinger to lay down any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in then dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to take up any duty then quickning; a man had rather do any thing, if he may do it without life: if the bare hearing, praying, and profeſſion will ſerve turn, may be he will do that; but to do all with life this the heart is loth to come to; when it comes to lay out all the ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the whole man upon God, the heart cannot abide this. <hi>Judah</hi> was content to turn to God; but to do it with life, this they would not do, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Treache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As it was with the Ruler in the Goſpel, he was content to obſerve the commandements of God, not to murther, not to commit adultery, not to ſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l, not to ſwear; <hi>All theſe have I obſerved from my youth,</hi> ſaith he; but when Chriſt came to call for life,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.</note> that he ſhould <hi>ſell all, forſake all, and follow him</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is the life of a man, the ſoule and heart of a man muſt be put forth; he <hi>was ſad at that ſaying</hi>: So <hi>Laodicea</hi> was content to do any thing; the ſpirit of God layeth nothing to her charge, he chargeth her with no particular ſin, but lukewarmneſſe onely; ſhe would do any thing; but to be fervent and zealous in it, to lay out her ſtrength for God, that ſhe would not do; ſo that we had need to take heed of deadneſs of all other ſins it is a deep ſin, and is the harder to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut; and the harder it is to be gotten out, the more paines is to be taken.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, other ſins may be but acts; as a man may be drunk, but he may not have the habit of drunkenneſs; as <hi>Noah</hi> was drunk, but he was not a drunkard; we ſee <hi>David</hi> committed adultery, but he had not the habit of adultery; but deadneſs is an habit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. Now when a man leaves ſin in a dead manner, he leaves it, but his affections are not crucified to it; he doth good duties, but he is dead to them; this man comes neer to the eſtate of ſin: now an eſtate of ſin is worſe then any particular act of ſin.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Other ſins are the firſt death of the ſoul; we are all under treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> We are all by nature the children of wrath; we were all once dead, but now, if after we are Chriſtians, we grow dead again, we grow twice dead; of all ſins we ſhould take heed of deadneſſe, for that cauſeth the ſecond death; not the ſecond death of damnation, but of being dead after a man hath been quickned; as Saint <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>twice dead</hi>; ſo we are twice dead. Now other ſins do make a man but once dead; but after the Goſpel hath come among us, and hath ſtirred up our hearts, and quickned us in ſome meaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we grow remiſs and dead, and cold again, we are twice dead, or at leaſt grow and tend that way, and ſo our eſtate is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; therefore how ſhould we take heed of this!</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Other ſins, though God threatens hell and damnation againſt

You may ſee there how terribly God threatens, when we do not receive the truth in the love of it; we do not love Gods Word; we do not love prayer, and his ordinances; we do not love the communion of Saints; we do not love o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Gods truth; this is a moſt woful thing; though we doe receive it, yet if we do not receive it in the love of it, ſee there what he ſaith; <hi>For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lye, that they might all be damned, &amp;c.</hi> So when <hi>Epheſus</hi> leſt her firſt love, God threatned to remove the candleſtick, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4, 5.

Nay, ſaith he, <hi>I will judge his houſe for ever for this thing,</hi> v. 13. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains then, but that we ſhould with all our might, and all care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, even ſet to both our ſhoulders for the caſting off this ſin of deadneſs, that if it be poſſible, we may come to be quickned, and ſerve God as we ought to do, and follow his heavenly Kingdome with eagerneſs, that none of theſe things we have ſpoken may befall us.</p>
               <p>Conſider firſt, we have life, and why may not God have it? He hath breathed into our ſouls the breath of life; in him we live, move, and have our being; he hath given unto us all life and breath; and if we have life, why may not God have it? if he hath given us affections, why ſhould they not be given to him again? if he hath given us thoughts, why ſhould we not beſtow them upon him? if he hath given us diſpoſitions and inclinations, why ſhould they not be ſet upon him? The Rivers that come from the ſea, return to the ſea again. It is ſaid of the <hi>Macedonians, that they did yield themſelves to the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.5. So we ſhould yield our ſelves to the Lord; if God did ask any thing that were not in us, it were another matter; if we had no thoughts and affections; if we had no heart and inclinations; then no wonder thought we did not give him them; but when we have them, why ſhould not he have them? all things are of him; therefore let all things be to him; ſhall our luſts have our thoughts, and not God? ſhall the world carry away our minds, and not God? that is againſt reaſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider that all the world is alive in their own courſes; let Chriſtians be alive in theirs; as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cah</hi> 4.5. <hi>Every man walks in the name of his god, let us walk in the name of our God.</hi> So I ſay, every man follows his god; thoſe that have their belly for their god, all their minde and affections run that way; thoſe that have their pleaſure for their god, and their profit for their god, how eager are they after theſe things? as one ſaith, the world is like the Ant; poor little creatures, they goe carrying of ſtraws after their manner, and are ſo buſie; ſo it is with the world; what a deal of drudging up and down, and going this way and that way is there in the world? one for one thing, another for another; one for his Mammon, another for the luſts of his fleſh, and the pride of life; men are buſy and ſtirring, every one is ſetting forward; why ſhould not we be as forward in our way? if we be Chriſtians, and the ſervants of God, why ſhould not we beſtir our ſelves for him? the Devil himſelfe is a ſpirit, and is working and buſie, as himſelf ſaith, <hi>Job.</hi> 2.2. Then let us walk up and down, and beſtir our ſelves this way, and that way, and every way for God, and be as active and agile for him; let us conſider how the poor priſoners in <hi>Ludgate</hi> beg for a token, what eagerneſs they uſe, that though a man

had no minde, yet their importunity will make him give them ſomething; and ſhall not we beg earneſtly of God to pardon our ſins, and quicken us, and humble us for our deadneſs, and for the time to come, to make us ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for the Kingdom to come; if men be ſo earneſt for bables, how earneſt ſhould we be for theſe precious jewels?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider the worth of theſe things, the worth of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, the worth of eternal life, the worth of the Goſpel, the worth of prayer and all Gods holy Ordinances; are they ſuch poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly trifles, that we follow them with ſuch a ſlender purſuit? are they ſuch beggarly commodities that they are not worth the looking after? Certainly Heaven may juſtly challenge our beſt deſires, our beſt affections, our beſt pains and endeavours, and the beſt and flower of all our parts and learning, as the Church ſaith, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.9. <hi>My beloved is ſweet</hi>; ſo our beloved is ſweet; ſweet things goe down pleaſantly; ſo how ſhould the word be, and prayer be? how ſweet ſhould all the things of our beloved be? they ſhould goe ſwee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly down, nothing ſhould delight us more. When <hi>Solomon</hi> ſet up his Throne, it is ſaid that he laid out the beſt gold upon it; ſo if we would have the crown of life, we muſt lay out our beſt parts, and affections, and endeavours upon it; how ſweet ſhould the calling upon God, and the going to Gods houſe be? what a ſhame is it, that when ſuch heavenly things, ſuch precious jewels are to be had, people will not come to them, whereas theſe things ſhould be the ſweeteſt things in the world? if we were carefull of the good of our ſoules, and were affected with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and heavenly things, as we ought to be, we ſhould be tender of this; how ſhould we take heed of pride, and covetouſneſs, and any thing that ſhould hinder us of ſo great ſalvation?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ider, if we be quickned, nothing will be hard; all the difficulty of Religion is over, if a man be quickned; for nothing is hard to a willing minde, when a mans heart and ſoule is ſet upon it; nothing is hard, as the Apoſtle ſaith, to him that loves God,<note place="margin">1 John 5:</note> 
                  <hi>His commandements are not grievous</hi>; all the difficulty, that we cannot pray, and hold our hearts to the Word, and overcome our corruptions, all lieth in the deadneſſe of our hearts; if we would have maſtery over our corruptions, if our hearts be dead, we muſt look for the more toyle, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the iron be blunt, if a man doth not ſharpen the edge, he had need put the more ſtrength to it,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.10. So when a mans h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>art is dull and dead, there is the more difficulty in the overcoming of any luſt, in the doing of any good duty, every thing comes hardly off. Now when a mans heart is quickned, it is like oyle to the wheele, it makes it goe eaſie; when a mans heart is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up towards God, what is it but that man can do?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Conſider, If we be quickned, we ſhall have a great deale of peace, and joy, and comfort. I may ſay as the Church in another caſe, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive us again, O Lord, and we ſhall rejoyce in thee,</hi> Pſal. 85.6. So I ſay, if we were revived, if God did quicken our hearts, if we were earneſt with him to do it, and we could once attain unto it, we ſhould rejoyce in God; thoſe that follow God with an earneſt heart; they have thoſe joyes, which no other can intermeddle with; God gives them unknown comfort, unknown peace, and unknown ſupport; the more a man followes after God, the more he ſhall partake of God, a man ſhall have joy unſpeakable and glorious.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, We ſhould make all heaven to rejoyce; when the Father had his prodigal Son come to him, that was before dead, and was now alive, ſaith he, <hi>It is meet we ſhould be glad,</hi> Luke 15.32. So when any poor creature that was dead before to all goodneſs, is now made alive, and is quickned up in all the wayes of God, it is even meet that there ſhould be mirth in Heaven, that the Angels in Heaven ſhould rejoyce; whereas if a man go on in Gods
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94114:35"/>
ſervice dully and blockiſhly, it is as vinegar to the teeth, and ſmoak to the eys, and the heavens are ſad over us.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If we were quickned, we ſhould not only do our ſelves good, but we ſhould do others good too; we ſhould be earneſt to do it; there is an excellent place for this in the ſtory of <hi>David; David</hi> being marvellouſly quickned, juſt as he came from <hi>Gath,</hi> there met him 400 poor deſtitute and afflicted men, and preſently he made the 34 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> wherein he ſaith, <hi>O come and taſte and ſee how good the Lord is; bleſſed are they that truſt in the Lord</hi>: preſently he calls upon them to be quickned alſo. So <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was quickned up himſelf, though he were before the Judge, and went upon life and death, yet he regarded not that, but he laboured to quicken <hi>Agrippa</hi> too, inſomuch that he made him to cry out, <hi>Thou perſwadeſt me almoſt to become a Chriſtian</hi>; and he would not leave him there, but ſaith he, <hi>I would not that thou only,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 26.</note> 
                  <hi>but that all that do hear me this day, were not only almoſt, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuch as I am, excepting theſe bonds</hi>: O, thought he, that all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were but acquainted with that I feel and finde; a quickned heart will labour and ſtrive to do good unto others.</p>

The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof we have ſpoken of already; and now we are come to the ſecond part, and that is the Remedy; for when Chriſt doth reprove them, he doth it not for ill will, but for their good; and therefore he gives them good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. The Remedies he gives this Church are five.<note place="margin">Five Remedies given the Church.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>Be watchfull,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, This is the reaſon you goe down the wind, and want life, and are dead and dull in Religion, becauſe you are not watchful.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Direction is, <hi>Strengthen the things that remain</hi>: as who ſhould ſay, if you would be careful to fortifie thoſe good things that are in you, you may ſtand out againſt theſe temptations; a little grace will go a great way if it be well managed. Now he doth urge this direction three ways. Firſt, becauſe theſe things they have are but <hi>remainders</hi>; they had a great deal more once. <hi>Strengthen the things that do remain</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, all is even almoſt quite gone; you had a great deal more zeal and forwardneſſe; but what you have now, is but the remainders and the leavings; therefore it is high time to look about you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe even thoſe remainders were almoſt gone too, <hi>Sreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the things that remain, that are ready to die</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, they will be gone too, if you beſtir not your ſelves, and look well to your eſtates and conditions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe thy <hi>works are not perfect</hi>; they are nothing elſe almoſt but hypocriticall and unſound, <hi>I have not found thy works perfect before God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Remedy is, <hi>Remember how thou haſt received and heard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 3.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as who ſhould ſay, conſider how thou haſt been formerly; conſider how the Word hath been delivered, and how thou haſt received it.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Remedy is, <hi>Hold faſt</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, labour to get up again, and hold faſt, that the Devil, and the world, and the temptations to ſin; may not get away the good things that are in thee, that they may not ſpoil thee of the good things of God, and of the hope of eternal life.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Remedy is, <hi>Repent</hi>; that is, bewail thy ſelfe, and lament thy unfruitfulneſſe, and unwatchfulneſſe, and careleſneſſe this way, and humble thy ſelfe before Almighty God; thou mayſt yet have mercy;<note place="margin">1 John 1.3.</note> when <hi>a man doth confeſs his ſins, God is juſt to forgive them,</hi> and is ready to vouchſafe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and quickning, and comfort; therefore <hi>repent,</hi> ſaith he.</p>
                  <p>Well then, the firſt remedy is to be watchful; to watch, is to be attentive, to be conſiderative, to look what may doe a man good and what may doe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94114:36"/>
a man hurt, that he may thereafter carry himſelfe; it is for a man to have his eyes in his head, to have his wits about him for ſpiritual things: This is the ſubject of it, it is properly in the minde, and in the heart; it is a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor taken from the body; for the body when it is aſleep, the ſenſes are lockt up; the eye cannot ſee, the eare cannot hear, they are all wrapt up, they are not lively and operative; but when the body is awake, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are all open, the eye can ſee, and the eare hear, and the ſenſes are ready for every Object; from hence it is derived to the ſoules of men, they may be ſaid to ſleep or watch; for when the ſoul is careleſs and negligent towards a thing, may be dangers are towards a man, and he doth not fear them, nor ſtudy to prevent them; may be there is a great deal of good coming towards the ſoule, and he goes drowſily about it the ſoule now is ſaid to be aſleep; but when the ſoule looks ſeriouſly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideratively about things, then it is ſaid to watch; ſo that there is a ſleep of the ſoule, and a watch of the ſoule, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5 6. So that this watchfulneſſe is nothing elſe but the active prudence of the ſoule, whereby it ſtirs up all the faculties to look about, that if any good be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, it may get it; if any danger be towards it, it may abhor it; this is the watchfulneſs here ſpoken of; for this drowſineſſe and ſleepineſſe is a part of the corruption of our natures, whereby we are marvellous careleſs of God and eternal life, that though we be in the gall of bitterneſs, and by nature the children of wrath, yet this is the corruption of our nature, to look ſleepily upon this, that danger may be upon us, and we never obſerve it; and though there be eternal life to be had, yet we are as it were aſleep, we doe not ſtudy how to attain it; though there be miſery inſupportable, and unſpeakable, and ſure and certain to fall upon us, unleſſe we be delivered; yet we doe not think of theſe things, we have no fear at all, or elſe our hearts are drowſie, and are content to make any thing ſerve the turn. Now when the ſoule is rowzed up, and made to have a due conſideration of theſe things, now is is awakened, now it is watchful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note>The Point we obſerve from hence it this, That it is an excellent &amp; ſoveraign thing for a Chriſtian to watch; and therefore Chriſt commends it to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and commends it to all people to the end of the world, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.37. <hi>That which I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, watch.</hi> Now it is good to watch in five reſpects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> Firſt, In regard of our ſelves; for our own ſelves are falſe unto our ſelves; if we be godly men and women, we are two ſelves; we have a bad ſelfe, whereby we are apt to be proud, and carnal, and ungodly in all our wayes, and to forget God; and we have a good ſelfe, that is better minded. Now it is an excellent thing, when this good ſelfe ſhall watch over this bad ſelfe, and have an eye to it; as if a man had a pilfering ſervant in his family, would he not watch him, and eye him? would he not watch him what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he had in his houſe, and obſerve what is in his houſe from day to day? So we having ſuch a deceitful ſelfe about us, we had need to watch conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>John,</hi> 8. <hi>Look to theſe, that we loſe not thoſe thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, you will loſe the benefit of all the good things that are in you, if you doe not look to them? there is a thief in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, a deceiver that will ſteale and coſen thee of all, if thou look not to it.</p>
                  <p>And here firſt we ſhould watch our own hearts; for our own hearts are deceitful, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things,</hi> Jerem. 17.9 It is very ſly; and how eaſily doth it deceive us, and carry us aſide? therefore we had need watch over it, as the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence.</hi> If a man were to ride upon a wilde horſe, would he not have a care to keep the bridle? would he let the bridle goe? then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94114:36"/>
he would run away and he ſhould hardly catch him again; his buſineſs will be hindered and his time ſpent; ſo it is here, a mans heart is like a wild Colt, like an untamed Heifer, if a man let it go; a man had need alwayes to have the bridle in his hand; if a man do not watch it and obſerve it, and hold it in, it will run away, and a man cannot catch it again; as a man that is ringing a bell, if he let the rope go, he cannot readily get hold of it again; ſo a mans heart is ſlippery, therefore a man had need ever to be watching of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We had need watch our thoughts? what ſlippery things are our thoughts if they be upon that which is good? will they be long there? they are now there, now gone again; therefore how careful ſhould we be to hold our thoughts to that which is good? the thoughts are ſo looſe and fickle, and unconſtant, and uncertain, that though they be on good things for a minute of an hour, they will be ten times as long upon vain things; there is no truſting of our thoughts, we need not ſay as <hi>David</hi> of the men of <hi>Keilah, will they deliver me to Saul?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 23.11:</note> will the luſts of my heart deliver me to Satan? nay, they will deliver us, if we watch not over our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ſhould watch over our affections; they are admirable things, if we ſet them upon the things that are above, and be watchful to keep them there; what admirable advantages are they? they are the wings of the ſoul to help us in prayer and any good duty we go about; they will wipe away the difficulties of the wayes of God; but they are marvelous uncertain things, that if we be not alwayes looking to our ſelves, though our joys and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, &amp;c. be upon heaven and heavenly things, they will run upon the world again and loſe themſelves there, ſo that our affections had need to be looked unto.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Conſcience had need to be looked unto; for though the Conſcience be the beſt part of a man, yet it will flatter us and ſpeak peace to us if we look not to it, where is no peace, and will check us very careleſly, and will not hold forth our duties nakedly, if we do not watch over it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, So again, We ſhould ſet a watch over our tongues, over our very words that we ſpeak; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will ſet a watch before the door of my lips, Pſa.</hi> 141.3. when a man ſpeaks his words, it is as if he ſhould bend his bow to ſhoot; now when a man bends his bow to ſhoot, he had need level well, or elſe he will not hit the mark; ſo if we be not watchful over the words we ſpeak, we ſhall ſpeak vainly, and to Gods diſhonour; therefore ſaith <hi>Solomon, he that keeps his mouth, keeps his own ſoul</hi>;<note place="margin">Prov. 13.3.</note> he that watcheth over his lips that he may not offend, watcheth over his own ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is good to watch in regard of the world, for the world will <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> get in, and undo us if we take not heed, when we are about our callings, when as we let our eyes look upon our wares and commodities, upon our barns or our Cattel, or the like; whatſoever comes into our eye is apt to poyſon us, and whatſoever we ſee or touch, or handle is apt to do us miſchief; how many thouſands are carried away by their eyes, by what comes into their ſenſes? as <hi>Amaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>I hear he deals ſubtilly</hi>: So it were good that the Divel heard that we dealt ſubtilly; for he deals ſubtilly with us, and collogues, and colours, and varniſheth; in matters of evil, he ſets the beſt ſide outward; and in matters of good, the worſt ſide outwards; if any good be to be done, he labours to make a man dead in the doing of it; if any thing be ſinful he hides the danger of it, and ſhews a man nothing but the pleaſure and delight and profit of it, and a man ſhall ſee nothing elſe almoſt; the Divel is ſo ſubtle that he knows what we delight in, and where he may have us; he knows what ſins we are prone to, and where he may get us; he knows what will hit our humour beſt, he knows what will like us beſt; there was but one paſſage wherein <hi>Peter</hi> was naked, and the Divel caught him there; if he had taken any other courſe, a hundred to one but he had withſtood him; he ſeeth where the water is low, and there he leaps over; therefore how careful ſhould we be when he is ſo ſubtle?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider how diligent he is; he is ever trudging up and down from place to place; as <hi>Saul</hi> hunted <hi>David</hi> up and down Town and Country, ſo the Divel hunts up and down; all places are full of him, the ſtreets, the market, the houſe, the fields, our beds and cloſets, our Pulpits; whereſoever we are, he will be ſure to be there too; he is diligent to follow us everywhere; now if we do not watch we ſhall be caught by him; we may ſay of Satan in ſome ſenſe, as <hi>David</hi> of the ſpirit of God, <hi>whether ſhall I go from thy ſpirit, and whether ſhall I flee from thy preſence? &amp;c.</hi> ſo, whether ſhall we go from Satan? we can go nowhere but he will follow us; he is as buſie as a fly about a bald head; though they be beaten off again and again, yet they will come again; though our Saviour Chriſt beat him off, yet he comes again and again, and hath more and more flings at him; nay, he ſet <hi>Peter</hi> to tempt Chriſt: He rangeth over all the earth, therefore we had need watch.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider his ſtrength; he is a ſtrong enemy, he is the <hi>ſtrong man, Mat.</hi> 12.29. 'tis true, notwithſtanding all his ſtrength, he cannot force us to ſin; he can but ſay as he did to Chriſt, <hi>caſt thy ſelf down</hi>; he can but ſay lye, and covet, &amp;c. he cannot force a man; nay, whatſoever he puts into us, it is not a ſin if we give not way to it; a man may put it out again if
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94114:37"/>
he will; he did but provoke <hi>David</hi> to number the people, he might have reſiſted it; he cannot force a man; but yet he is a ſtrong enemy, and comes with <hi>fiery darts</hi>; and he is ſtrong in regard of our luſts and corruptions that are ſo ſtrong; there lies the Divels ſtrength;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> he hath that in our own boſomes that is ſo mightily on his ſide; therefore we had need to watch.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Again, Conſider the malice of this enemy; he is the enemy that doth it, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>your adverſary the Divel</hi>; he is an adverſary <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, his temptations may be overthrown, but his malice can never be overthrown; a man can never make his peace with him, ſo long as he lives in this world; he is like a frenzy man, as 'tis ſaid,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.12.</note> 
                     <hi>he is full of wrath,</hi> knowing his time is ſhort.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Again, Conſider the Divel hath nothing elſe to do; if the enemy had ſomething elſe to do, a man might be the leſs careful; as it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to <hi>David</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> had ſomething elſe to do; when <hi>Saul</hi> was on one ſide of the mountain, <hi>David</hi> on the other, becauſe he had ſomething elſe to do, the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> invaded his land, this took him away; but the Divel hath nothing to employ his time about, but only to watch to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; therefore we had need be wondrous watchful over our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is good to watch in regard of the wicked, the Divels inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label> and where ſhall we not meet with them? we muſt go out of the world, if we will go where they are not; they are everywhere: Now if we do not watch, it is impoſſible for us to walk up and down in the world, but we ſhall be ſurprized and learn their works; how many thouſands are poyſoned with the errours of the wicked for want of watchfulneſs? the <hi>Galathians,</hi> if they had watched, they had never been drawn from the truth; ſo for practical errours, how many curſed principles get into mens hearts and appear in their lives? that ſuch kind of Religion is good Religion; that ſuch kind of faith is good faith; they have abundandance of curſed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: Now if we look not to our ſelves, <hi>how ſhall we be carried</hi> away, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. ſo may be thou art in a wicked family, as <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom</hi>; now I ſay it is impoſſible for thee to ſtand in ſuch a place, but thou ſhalt be hooked in, in an horrible manner; the Apoſtle puts a chiefly upon the Saints in <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.22. <hi>chiefly thoſe that are of</hi> Caeſars <hi>houſhold</hi>; it is a wonder of wonders there ſhould be Saints in <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſe; it is impoſſible for a man to be among the wicked, to have wicked neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and companions, but he ſhall be drawn away by them, if he be not watchful over his own ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It is good to watch in regard of good things. I ſpeak to the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>5</label> Saints of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is good to watch in regard of our graces; look what grace a man hath, it is as a precious jewel, and thou mayſt loſe it if thou be not watchful; thou mayſt loſe a great deal of faith, and quickning, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindedneſs, or any good that is in thee, thou mayſt loſe a great deal of it, if thou look not well to it: As a ſheep that hath a great deal of wool, if ſhe go among briars and thorns, how ſoon may a great deal of it be torn off? ſo a poor creature that walks in the world among ſo many briars and thorns, among ſo many temptations, he may have all good things rent away if he look not to it; if a man had a great deal of money in his purſe, and were among cutpurſes &amp; cheaters, would not a man have an eye about him? it is ſaid of a godly one, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.18. <hi>he keeps himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> he looks what he hath and carries about him, that he may not loſe it.</p>
                  <p>Again, We ſhould watch our graces, to encreaſe our graces, and ſtrengthen them; watchfulneſs is an excellent thing to ſtrengthen grace; as it is in the Text, <hi>watch, and ſtrengthen the things that remain</hi>; whereas if a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94114:38"/>
man do not watch, his graces will dye and decay, every temptation will overcome him; now we have need of more grace, though we be mortified, and lively, and fear God, and regard his name, and are humble, &amp;c. yet we had need be more humble, and more vile in our own eyes; now, how can we have this unleſs we be watchful? the Apoſtle therefore when he had called upon Chriſtians to be watchful, in the next words ſaith he, <hi>grow in grace,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. for if a man be watchful, it is the way to grow.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ſhould watch our graces that we may work with them, and exerciſe them, and improve them upon all occaſions, we ſhould watch all opportunities to occupie with our talents; it is ſaid that God will have his people to <hi>ſeek good, Amos.</hi> 5.14. to ſeek how to do good from day to day; ſo we ſhould watch all opportunities to do good, and to ſtand for God, and glorifie his name, and adorn the Goſpel that we profeſſe; opportunities do not come ſo often, we had need take them when they come, they are precious things; now if we do not watch, God will many times tender us theſe things, and we ſhall have no heart to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is good to watch all good duties; What is the reaſon that people pray no better, hear no better, draw neer to Gods table and partake of the Sacrament no better, they get no power againſt ſin, no power againſt corruption? it is becauſe they do theſe things without watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>watch unto prayer</hi>; we muſt be watchful if we will get good by the Ordinances of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We ſhould watch before the duty; when we are going to prayer, and going to Gods courts, we ſhould be watchful; <hi>a prudent man looks well to his goings, Prov.</hi> 14.15. whereſoever he goeth he looks well about him, that he may obſerve all circumſtances; how many thouſand lets and impediments are there? which if a man take not off aforehand he cannot perform the duty aright; if we had been watchful we might have done the duty better a great deal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We ſhould be watchful in the duty; when we call upon God, we ſhould take heed how we come into his preſence; when we hear the Word, we ſhould be careful that we be not carried away with vile thoughts, nor ſuffer anything to attempt us when we are about any good duty; the Divel will be about us to interrupt us, therefore we had need be watchful againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Again, We ſhould watch after the duty, that we may not loſe the fruit and benefit of it; moſt people when they have been at the Ordinances of God, are as if they had not been there; when they have been at prayer, as far from power againſt ſin,<note place="margin">See more of this in the Sermons upon 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5.</note> and drawing mercy down from heaven, as if they had never been down upon their knees.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is good to watch in regard of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Sometimes God comes with motions, and draws nearer to us then he doth at other times; therefore now we had need take hold of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>call ye upon him while he is neer</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, ſometimes God is neerer then at other times; O now have your eyes in your heads, and let not God go, but make uſe of this; if ever God ſpeaks to our ſouls, or open our eyes, let us make uſe of theſe things, and be up and a doing, leſt they ſlip away from us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sometimes God doth extraordinarily help us, and give us extraordinary favours; let us watch thoſe favours, for then the Divel is moſt buſie; when God doth any notable thing for us, when he gives us peace, or joy, or comforts or power againſt ſin, or whatſoever it be, then Satan is moſt buſie; ſo ſoon as Chriſt had that extraordinary favour from his Father, to be owned from heaven before all the ſtanders by,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.17.</note> 
                     <hi>This is my beloved ſon &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:94114:38"/>
The next newes we hear of, he had a terrible aſſault by Satan; when God had ſhewed great favour to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in wraping him up into the third Heaven, the next thing he met with, was Satan to buffet him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sometime God doth puniſh us and afflict us: now how ſhould we watch to get good by our afflictions? This is the reaſon that afflictions, and croſſes, and diſtreſſes are ſo often among us, and do no good; it is for want of watchfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that it is good to watch? Then how may we lament the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> neglect of this duty? I ſpeak not to drunkards and prophane perſons; no wonder though they doe not watch; neither doe I ſpeak to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of Chriſtians, that content themſelves with civility and fair car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: but I ſpeak to thoſe that are of the better ſort; how horribly is this duty laid aſide? this is the reaſon of the want of grace, and that people go down the wind, and that there are ſo many Apoſtates and Decliners; and this is the reaſon that ſo many become very unſavoury and unfruitful in their lives; the reaſon is becauſe they do not watch; what drowſie thoughts have we to be delivered from the wrath of God? what lumpiſh, heartleſſe care have we to doe good duties? This is the reaſon of the vanity of our minds, and the hardneſs of our hearts, and that ſo little good is done by preaching among us, becauſe people doe not watch. When you ſow your corn, you ſet hullers to drive away the fowls: ſo why doe you not ſet up hullers, a watch over your own hearts, that ſo it temptations come to pick away the Word, and the benefit of it, you may reſiſt them? how ſhould we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to hide the Word in our hearts, that it may do us good?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Uſe is to exhort us all to take up this duty of watchfulneſſe,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> nay, <hi>to watch in all things,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 5. to watch in our eating and drinking, that we may not eat and drink our bane; to watch in company, that if they be good, we may get good by them; if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, we may get no hurt from them; we ſhould watch in good duties, for we ſhall meet with the Devil there too; every one that hath the fear of God before his eyes, whatſoever grace he hath, he ſhould watch over it; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good work he hath to doe, he ſhould watch, that he may goe on in it; for watchfulneſſe is an helpfull duty; <hi>watch and pray</hi>; it is helpful to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſo for all other duties, it is a duty deſtinated to another duty, ſo that we can doe no other duty without watchfulneſſe; therefore we had need to watch.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſider the miſery of them that doe not watch, they muſt needs decline, and wax worſe and worſe; you ſee the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> here for want of watchfulneſs grew dead, nay the very good things in her were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to die.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider the good of watchfulneſſe; if we watch we ſhall be ſatisfied with grace; if we have grace, we ſhall increaſe it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Slothfulneſs keeps a man in poverty, but he that openeth his eye ſhall be ſatisfied with bread.</hi> It is true, as in outward things, ſo in ſpiritual things; let a man be drowſie and ſlothful, he ſhall be a poor man and a beggar, and ſhall have nothing to ſhew for eternal life; but if thou wilt open thine eyes, and look about thee, thou ſhalt be ſatisfied with bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the bread of life, with the image of God, with righteouſneſs and holineſs; the more thou watcheſt, the more abundantly will God bleſs thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider that men in their outward callings are watchful; the ſhepherds watch their flocks, and the husbandman his ſeaſons, when to ſow, and when to reap his corne; when to ſell it, and when to buy it; how much more ſhould we for the good of our ſouls?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We ſhould conſider the examples of Gods Saints;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.92.</note> 
                     <hi>David</hi> he watched, <hi>at midnight I will ariſe and praiſe thee</hi>; he would riſe out of his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94114:39"/>
bed in the night, and pour out his heart before God, and bleſs God for his goodneſs; he would not doe it in his bed, but he would goe out of his bed and doe it by his bedſide upon his knees; how ſhould this ſtir us up to watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe?</p>
                  <p>Now I come to the ſecond Remedy,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Remedy.</hi>
                     </note> and that is <hi>to ſtrengthen the things that remain,</hi> and the rather, becauſe they are but <hi>remainders, and ready to die, and their deeds are not perfect before God.</hi> Theſe words are diverſly interpreted by Divines; ſome underſtand them perſonally, Strengthen thoſe perſons that remain; as if he ſhould ſay to the Angel of the Church, Thy people are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally cold and dead, and drowſie, there is hardly any life in them; now thoſe that do remain, ſtrengthen them, that they may be awakened, they are ready to die; there are hardly any of thy hearers that are upright and ſincere before God, therefore ſtrengthen them; thus <hi>Pareus,</hi> and many others interpret it; and this is a very good ſenſe; for a Miniſter is bound to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then all his people, if any be drowſie, to awaken them; if any be dead, to quicken them; and the Lord complains againſt Miniſters when they doe not doe thus, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.4. <hi>The diſeaſed have they not ſtrengthened, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then there is another Expoſition of theſe words given by Divines, that underſtand it of things, and not of perſons; and ſo it is in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, Strengthen the things that remain; that both Miniſter and people would ſtrengthen the good things that were in them; for the Miniſter was grown weak and remiſs, and the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> weak in all good things: Now the Spirit calls upon the Angel of this Church, and in him upon all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to ſtrengthen the good things that were in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note>So that the point of Doctrine is this, that it is every Chriſtians duty to labour that he might be ſtrengthened, ſpecially if he hath had more grace formerly then now he hath; it is every Chriſtians duty to ſtrengthen the good things that are in him.</p>
                  <p>For the opening of this word <hi>ſtrengthen,</hi> it hath an oppoſition to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now there is a double weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of thoſe people that are unconverted, that are weak to the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of ſin, and doing any that is good; they have ſome principles in them to reſiſt ſin, and doe good, but they are weak, as common illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and natural conſcience, and fear of wrath, and hope of Heaven, and ſhame of others, and the good example of others, and living under the means, and reſtraining grace, and the like; theſe things may do a great deal of good, but they are weak, and cannot make them reſiſt ſinne, and doe good ſoundly; thus unconverted people are weak. This is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the weakneſs that is oppoſed to ſtrength, that he would have them get out of the weakneſs of unconverted people.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſecondly, There is another weakneſs, and that is of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God themſelves; they have weakneſs to reſiſt ſinne, and doe good; and this is twofold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is a weakneſs of Beginning. Secondly, of Declining.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In beginning; when a childe of God is a beginner in grace, and is but a babe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. <hi>When for the time ye ought to be, &amp;c.</hi> Such as are babes have need of milk, they cannot digeſt ſtrong meat, they are too weak for that; as may be a new beginner hath gotten faith, but it is weak, he is not able to apprehend the promiſes of ſalvation, and the aſſurance of Gods goodneſs and mercy towards him; he hath much ado to apprehend Chriſt himſelf, and uphold his heart; ſo a man may have ſome knowledge, but it is weak; and ſome reſolutions and endeavours, but they are weak; corruptions bear him down, and his mortification is weak; he cannot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter many of his heady and mighty luſts. Now ſuch people as theſe are to be exhorted to ſtrengthen theſe good things that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in them: Hath God begun any good things in thee? any lively fear of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94114:39"/>
his name, any hatred of evil, any love to goodneſs, any longing and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting after righteouſneſs, any endeavour after eternal life, any faith? thou ſhouldſt labour to ſtrengthen theſe things, that they may abound in thee, and that they may be confirmed and eſtabliſhed in thee, that thou mayſt be made unblameable againſt the coming of the Lord Jeſus; but this is not the meaning neither.</p>
                  <p>Secondly therefore, There is a weakneſs of declining, when a man hath been ſtronger, and now hath abated of his ſtrength, and is grown wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; a ſtrong man may grow into a conſumption, which may ſpend him away till he comes to be an Anatomy, and ſo is grown weak; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians that have been ſtronger, they are now grown weak, they are grown into a conſumption of graces, they are grown to be an Anatomy, to be nothing but even skin and bone; they were wont to have more faith to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a promiſe, but now they have more doubting; they could pray ſtrongly, but now they are faint and weak; they were powerfull in every good duty, but now they are down the wind; they are like a Jack that wants wanding up, they had need be wound up again; they are grown more cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, and peeviſh, and pettiſh, and have leſs ſtrength over their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and are made more ready to be drawn away. Now ſuch perſons are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to ſtrengthen theſe things; and the rather, becauſe they are but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders; you have had more grace, and have let it die and decay; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrengthen that which remains, and is ready to die; ſo that there are two parts of this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That every man ſhould be earneſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Part</hi> 1.</note> and uſe all manner of holy meanes to ſtrengthen himſelfe. 'Tis true, Firſt it is every Miniſters duty to labour to get ſtrength into his people, to ſtrengthen their underſtanding, and knowledge, and judgement, to ſtrengthen them in the promiſes, to hold forth Jeſus Chriſt nakedly unto them, to expound the free grace of God, that they may be ſtrong in faith: So if a Miniſter ſees they are weak to bear afflictions, he ſhould labour to ſupport and bear them up, and poure ſome ſpirit into them, and enable them to bear: So if he finde they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear temptations, he ſhould uſe all arguments to piece them up that they may ſtand againſt the wiles of the Devill; a Miniſter hath his own ſtrength given him of purpoſe to ſtrengthen his brethren, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.3. the Lord ſaith, <hi>Strengthen the weak hands, &amp;c.</hi> He would have Miniſters call upon people to get ſtrength, and to uſe all means by preaching and teaching, and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to get ſome ſtrength into his people; it is a Miniſters duty, not only to gather Saints, but to perfect the Saints; whither ſhould the people come but to the Miniſter to get ſtrength in grace?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is every neighbours duty to ſtrengthen his neighbour; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould ſtrengthen one another in all manner of good duties, as coals of fire doe warm and heat one another when they are together; but if they are ſevered, they will be dead; ſo Chriſtians, when they meet together, ſhould labour to warm, and heat, and quicken one another. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to mark all the weak and feeble people among them, and <hi>to ſtrengthen the feeble-minded,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.14.</p>
                  <p>But then thirdly, Every man ſhould doe this duty to himſelf, to ſtrengthen the good things that are in him; we ſee all the world labours to be ſtrong in outward things, ſome to be ſtrong in riches and wealth, ſome to be ſtrong at the Court, and others to ſtrengthen themſelves in their friends and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; as <hi>Abner</hi> laboured to be ſtrong for the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> for he knew he ſhould be no body if that went down; if a man have a caſe to defend, he will make himſelfe as ſtrong as he can to defend himſelfe; if a man be to fight a battel, he will make himſelfe as ſtrong as he can; nay, people will ſtrengthen themſelves in their wickedneſs. Now if it be ſo; then how much

                  <p>And firſt labour to have ſtrong minds and underſtandings; I do not mean ſtrong literal knowledge; for with a little of that a man may have ſtrong love to God, and zeal to his glory, as we may ſee in the book of Martyrs. <hi>Elizabeth Sackwell,</hi> and <hi>Katharine Hurſt,</hi> and others, they were marvellous ignorant; when they were asked what a Sacrament was, and how many there were, they could not tell, and yet were admirable Martyrs, and ſealed to Gods truth according to that knowledge they had, and laid down their lives for the Goſpel, though they had not this knowledge; therefore I mean not that, though that be be very good; and without ſome literal knowledge the mind cannot be good; a man may have literal knowledge without ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, but not ſpiritual without literal; therefore it is good, but that is not it; therefore we muſt labour to have ſtrong ſpiritual underſtandings, that we may underſtand ſpiritually the things of God, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.34. <hi>Give me underſtanding, and I ſhall keep thy Law</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, if ever any man doth ſin againſt thy Law, it is becauſe he doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand himſelf; therefore you ſee how eager he is that God would give him underſtanding, that he might underſtand his wayes, and underſtand what his will is, that ſo he might do it, that he might underſtand it ſavingly, powerfully, and deliver his Law into his heart; God delivers his Law into every mans heart;<note place="margin">

                     </gap> ſtrength hath that little knowledge of God that is in their hearts? when a wicked man knowes that his courſes are of the Devil, and he is informed and reads it in the Word of God, he knows his wayes are condemned of God. I tell you this knowledge keeps a great deal of ſtir in his heart, and makes his conſcience afraid, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times qualms come over his heart, and ſometimes makes him reſolve I will be a drunkard and adulterer no more; it makes him that he cannot goe ſo freely about his wicked courſes, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>When Herod knew John Baptiſt was a godly man, this made him fear him.</hi> So when <hi>Saul</hi> knew aſſuredly that <hi>David</hi> ſhould be King, though he went out to deſtroy him, he let him goe; nay, a very perſecutor, if he knows they be the people of God he perſecutes, it will make his very heart ake, and will make him give over his perſecution, except he be marvellous ſtrong, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9. Why? how will God bridle perſecutors? <hi>The earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord</hi> There ſhall be ſuch a deal of knowledge, that they ſhall not <hi>be able to hurt in my holy mountain</hi>; nay this knowledge may make wicked men mightily to deny themſelves. <hi>Balaam,</hi> though he was greedy after riches and preferment, yet when he knew that it was Gods mind that he he ſhould not curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he ſhould provoke God; ſaith he, <hi>If Balak would give me his houſe full of

ſilver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, knowledge may work Reformation, <hi>After they eſcaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20. Now if knowledge be ſuch a thing where it is not rooted ſoundly in the mind, then how ſtrong would it be if we did get our underſtandings ſoundly informed? if we would get knowledge rooted in us, the very knowledge that God hath commanded us, to ſerve him, and fear him, that he hath revealed his wrath from Heaven upon all diſobedience; that Chriſt is the Saviour of the world, it would ſtrengthen us againſt ſin, and to do good; therefore let us labour to have ſtrong minds.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us labour to have a ſtrong will, as <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.15, 16. <hi>I will meditate in thy precepts, I will delight my ſelf in thy ſtatutes, I will not forget thy Word.</hi> You ſee how abſolutely he is ſet upon it, I will do thus and thus, and I will not do the contrary; this is a ſtrong Will; and therefore you ſee what admirable things he could do, becauſe his Will was ſtrong; what is the reaſon people are ſo weak? they cannot reſiſt ſin, they cannot give over ſuch a luſt, they cannot get life and quickning in prayer and other duties; if an Enemy come, they cannot put it up; if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction come, they cannot bear it patiently; if they are called to ſtand for God, they cannot put off carnal fears; this is the weakneſs of our Wills; if our Wills were abſolutely ſet that way, we ſhould be marvellous ſtrong, and break through all oppoſitions; all the ſtrength of a man lies in the Will of a man; if a mans Will be ſet upon a thing, he will go through fire and water; he will do it; therefore we ſhould labour that our Wills may be ſtrong in the works of God, to the pleaſing of God, and hatred of evil, and oppoſing of all the wayes of the fleſh; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.10. <hi>I have ſought thee with my whole heart.</hi> We ſhould do thus; you may ſee this in wicked men, when their hearts are abſolutely ſet to do evil, how do they go through difficulties? nothing ſhall hinder them; how wonderfully did <hi>Saul</hi> perſecute <hi>David,</hi> over hills and dales, and caves of the earth, over rocks and craggy places? if he had not been furious and mad, he could not have followed him in ſuch places; nay, he ſpurned againſt conſcience; God met with him oftentimes, and infatuated his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which could not but be as hedges in his way; but he broke over all: Whence was this? his Will was abſolutely ſet, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.23. he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if <hi>David</hi> were to be found under the copes of Heaven, he would have him; ſo if our hearts, our wills were abſolutely ſet to finde God and his grace; if we would ſay, if Chriſt be to be found, we will have him; if he be in Heaven or Earth we will have him; we will run over all Ordinances and duties; what ſin will we not leave? what courſe will we not take? if he be to be found, we will have him. A man might go through any difficulty, if his Will were abſolute; the Will is a ſtrong faculty, it hath the command over the whole man; the mind thinks, and the heart intends, and the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſtir, and the tongue ſpeaks, and the foot walks, and the hand works, but the Will ſways all; nay, if a mans appetite be to a thing, yet if he will not do it, he may refrain it; the Will is the ſtrongeſt faculty in a man; as ſoon as we heare the Prodigal had a Will to goe to his Father, the next news we hear, he did go; I will ariſe and go to my Father, and now nothing could ſtay him; if our Wills were ſet earneſtly towards God, that we would ſerve him, and obey him, and would not be carried away with our luſts, what a deal of ſtrength would this help us with? we ſhould be ſtrong to trample Satan under our feet, and mortifie our luſts; and this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon God accepts the Will above all, if there be a willing mind, God accepts it, nay, not only accepts it, but rewards it alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19. <hi>If I do it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, I have my reward.</hi> The will is the ſtrongeſt faculty God knows; if
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94114:45"/>
he hath a mans will, he hath all that ever a man can do, he hath all his power, nay, he hath more then his power; the will is able to go beyond a mans power; as it is ſaid of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.3. <hi>they did to their power, and beyond their power</hi>; the will is a mighty ſtrong thing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we will be ſtrong in the Lord, let us labour for ſtrong wills.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let us labour for ſound affections, that our affections may be converſant about God and all his holy laws and commandments; which way a mans affections run, ſo they run mightily; that way a mans ſtrength runs, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15. <hi>look down from heaven; where is thy zeal and thy ſtrength?</hi> that is, when God is zealous for his peoples good, he puts forth his ſtrength for their defence; therefore the Prophet cries, <hi>Lord, where is thy zeal and thy ſtrength?</hi> ſo we may ſay, where is our zeal to God, and againſt ſin, where is our zeal for good duties, for heavenly-mindedneſs, and the ſpreading of the Goſpel, and doing good in our places? if we were bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> zealous and earneſt in our affections, we ſhould not go ſo dully and faintly in the wayes of God as we do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it would make us ſtrong; we ſee how ſtrongly men follow after the world, when they are zealous for the world; ſo if we were earneſt after God, we ſhould be ſtrongly carried after him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we would get ſtrength, let us labour to believe; for when a man hath once gotten faith, now, though he be never ſo weak, he may ſay, <hi>God is my ſtrength, Pſal.</hi> 73.26. A man that hath gotten this faith, may ſay as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 71.16, <hi>I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord</hi>; I will go to prayer, to the word, to the Sacrament, I will go about my calling, when I am put upon my buſineſs, I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord to do it; if this man wants ſtrength, he goes and even borrows ſtrength from heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34. <hi>by faith, of weak they became ſtrong</hi>; as the rivers that watered Paradiſe, their heads and ſprings were out of Paradiſe; ſo though there be ſtreams of mercy and grace, and power, and love communicated to us, yet the heads of theſe are out of us; Chriſt is the head from which we muſt fetch all; <hi>I can do all things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me, Phil.</hi> 4.13. I can do all things; you will ſay, this is to brag and boaſt; alas no, I can do nothing, it is Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me; like the Ivy that creeps up by the wall, ſo a Chriſtian creeps up by Chriſt; there lies all our ſtrength; therefore all our care ſhould be to believe, to get off from our own bottoms: a true Chriſtian is never ſo weak as when he will be himſelf, when he goes about actions himſelf; if he would let Chriſt do all, and he only take that courſe Chriſt bids him, and never go his own way to work, he were a ſtrong man, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.7. <hi>It is your ſtrength to ſit ſtill</hi>; the children of Iſrael were ſo bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie to help themſelves, they would to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they ſhould help them; ſaith God, you ſhall never have help this way; your ſtrength is to ſit ſtill and wait upon God, and truſt in him; ſo I ſay, then is a true Chriſtian weak, when he departs from Chriſt, and doth not keep cloſe to him; ſuppoſe a man ſhould be in miſery, there be but two wayes to help him, the one is by himſelf, the other is by Chriſt; now, ſuppoſe a man were in ſuch a ſtraight, that he muſt be delivered in a quarter of an hour, or elſe he is undone; ſhall a man go to prayer now, or to his own ſtrength? to prayer if it were for a mans life; now when a man goes to his own ſtrength and parts, this weakens him; we ſhould do every thing better if we would go to Chriſt, and ſet our hearts upon him, if we would uſe the means, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hang upon God, this were our ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ſhould fly all occaſions of evil; may be a child can contain it ſelf from the dug (when it is newly weaned) ſo long as it comes not near it; but when the child ſeeth the dug, now the fancy runs upon the dug again, and now it cries for the dug again; it is becauſe it is not perfectly weaned; if it were perfectly weaned, though it ſaw the dug, it would not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94114:46"/>
look after it; ſo we are not perfectly weaned from ſin; therefore though when we reſiſt occaſions and temptations of ſin, we are able to abſtain and contain our ſelves, yet becauſe we are not perfectly weaned, if we give way to occaſions we loſe all; when we will raſhly venture upon the occaſions of evil, we loſe our ſtrength; therefore ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 101.3. <hi>I will ſet no evil thing before mine eyes</hi>; as he would not do it, ſo he would not have it in his ſight; every man is privy to himſelf, and may know what thoughts, what deſires, what appearances, what cuſtoms, what ſpeeches are occaſions of evil to him; he might know what doth occaſion him to ſin; may be he had not committed ſin but for this or that; now when a man ſhall give way to theſe occaſions, and not ſtand upon his guard, this loſeth all a mans ſtrength; as <hi>Saul</hi> he was privy to himſelf how teſty and furious he was, and if he had any inſtrument of fury in his hand, he had no power over himſelf; yet he would ever be with his javelin in his hand, when he was in the field, or in the houſe, ſtill he had his javelin in his hand; now you may ſee what miſchief he expoſed himſelf unto, he flung it twice at <hi>David,</hi> and a third time at his own ſon <hi>Jonathan</hi>; if he had been careful not to have given way to the occaſions of ſin, knowing how weak he was, and that he had not command over himſelf, he might have eſcaped this; a man that is furious had not need alwayes to have a ſword about him; a man had need ſhun all the occaſions of evil; <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a ſtrong man, <hi>how can I do this wickedneſs? &amp;c.</hi> all the temptations of his Miſtriſs could not allure him; what was the cauſe of this? <hi>he would not hearken to his Miſtris, nor be with her, Gen.</hi> 39. What made <hi>Achan</hi> to be ſo weak? he muſt needs take the Babyloniſh garment, and the wedge of gold; he gave way to the occaſion, <hi>I looked upon it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joſh. 7.21.</note> ſaith he; he being privy to his own covetous heart, ſhould have been ſhy of giving any occaſion to the fleſh; but he giving way to the occaſion was weak and not able to ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We ſhould never go up and down without a conſtant continual purpoſe to pleaſe God; when we firſt riſe in the morning, we ſhould think with our ſelves, well, I purpoſe to take heed of ſin this day; ſo when I am at dinner, I will take heed that I let not the remembrance of God go out of my mind; I will have freſh thoughts of him while I am at board; as it is ſaid of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 1.8.</note> 
                     <hi>be purpoſed not to defile himſelf with the Kings meat:</hi> So when we go into the fields, we ſhould think with our ſelves, I purpoſe God willing, to beware that I may not come home with a guilty conſcience, &amp; do things that may be to my ſhame and wounding another day; when we are to come among wicked people, we ſhould reſolve before we come, I will let fall nothing to diſhonour God; thus if we would go armed up and down, we ſhould go ſtrongly; if we would make ſerious reſolutions to cleave to God, and not to do evil, this would ſtrengthen us; now when temptations meet us unreſolved, we are not able to put them off.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We ſhould frequent the Ordinances of God. Firſt, We ſhould be careful of hearing the word of God in a godly manner. <hi>Strength and beauty are in his Sanctuary, Pſal.</hi> 96.6. there is ſtrength to be had in Gods houſe, in Gods courts; his Word and Ordinances are the food of the ſoul, that as bread ſtrengthens a mans body, ſo this ſpiritual bread of life ſtrengthens a mans ſoul. So again, For prayer, to go to God in prayer, that would ſtrengthen us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.10. So the Sacraments, they are a means to ſtrengthen us; to go to the Lords Table with hunger and thirſt, and ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our own unworthineſs, and of our need, and with true faith unto it; the Lords Supper is a means to ſtrengthen, as it is noted in the primitive Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. ſo again for meditations, if we would medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of the things we hear, of Gods word, and his bleſſings, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and warning we have from day to day; if we would digeſt theſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94114:46"/>
things, and chew them from day to day, they would yield a great deal of nouriſhment unto us; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe meditations are in Gods Law, he ſhall be like a tree planted by the rivers ſide; and his leafe ſhall not wither, Pſal.</hi> 1.2, 3. that man ſhall flouriſh like a green bay tree: So for holy conference, that is a great means to ſtrengthen all good things; as thoſe good people, when the times were bad, mark how they ſtrengthned themſelves, that they might not be infected with evil; <hi>they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another, Mal.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, We ſhould put forth our ſelves to the utmoſt in good duties; it is our lazineſſe and idleneſs that we are not more able to do good, and that we are ſo frail and infirm to do any thing that is of God; if we would take pains and put forth our ſelves, we ſhould be ſtrong; and indeed what is ſtrength but taking of pains when a man puts forth himſelf? as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.10. that is, a man muſt take the more pains; the more pains a man takes, the more ſtrength he puts forth; there is no creature that God hath made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but doth act to its utmoſt ſtrength; the fire burns as much as ever it can; and the light ſhines as much as ever it can; and the ſtone goes down as low as ever it can; every creature works as far as it can; but now man he can limit his ſtrength, becauſe he hath reaſon and will, and according as he ſees a thing more or leſs neceſſary, according as he ſees it eaſier or harder to be attained, accordingly he leſſens or puts forth his ſtrength; and it is great reaſon that God ſhould give man power to limit his ſtrength, for he is to deal with the creature as well as with the Creator; and if he ſhould love and ſeek the creature as much as ever he can, this were Idolatry; therefore the Lord hath given a man power to limit his ſtrength, not to let out all his love or fear upon any thing here below; but yet God doth not give a man that power to limit his ſtrength, and the exerciſe of it towards his Maker, but he ſhould let out all towards God; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>let all that is within me praiſe the Lord</hi>; he opens his floodgates wide,<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.</note> and lets out all towards God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Conſider that all received ſtrength is worth nothing unleſſe God give us new ſupply; wherefore are true Chriſtians weak at any time, but becauſe they think thus? I had true grace in the morning, and an hour ago I had the fear of God and the hatred of ſin; and the conſideration of this makes him that he is not ſo careful to keep cloſe to Chriſt, and to take heed of falling; he thinks, I had power the other day, and I was able to reſiſt temptations then; this makes a man weak; he thinks he had grace a while a go, and ſo truſts to that; for if a man do not ſtill look up to Chriſt, and cleave unto him, as if he had no ſtrength, the man is preſently a weak man, as weak as another man, and cannot ſtand; a man cannot be ſtrong in the grace that is in himſelf, but in the grace that is in God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Brethren, be ſtrong in the Lord and in the power of his might</hi>: And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Timothy,</hi> though <hi>Timothy</hi> were a man that was as ſtrong as any man upon the face of the earth almoſt, yet he bids him not count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>ſtrong</hi> in the grace that was in him, but <hi>in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. As it is with the air, which is not ſtrong with the light that is in it ſelf, but with the light that is in the Sun; therefore we are careful not to ſhut the windows; for if we ſhut the light of the Sun out, the air though it be light now, will be dark again in a moment; therefore though the room be light, yet we keep the windows open, for the light of the air is ſtrong in the light of the Sun; ſo a Chriſtian ſhould keep his windows ever open towards Chriſt; if a man ever turn his back again upon Chriſt, and neglect Chriſt, if he do not cleave to Chriſt, and take heed he do not provoke Chriſt againſt him, he is gone, he is as weak as can be; as <hi>Ezra</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7.28. <hi>I was ſtrengthned as the hand of the Lord was upon me</hi>;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94114:47"/>
no otherwiſe, if the Lord ſhould take away his hand, he were gone though he had never ſo much ſtrength, wiſedom and parts; he were no body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Laſtly, Take heed of ſtriving againſt knowledge, or willingly; that weakens us horribly; and in particular take heed of pride; no man ſo weak as a proud man, nor ſo ſtrong as an humble man, as a Divine ſpeaks; a man that is ſenſible of his own weakneſs, of his own being no body, of his own folly, and that he is able to do nothing of himſelf, he that is ſenſible of this is ſtrong; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. <hi>when we are weak then are we ſtrong</hi>; that is, when we are humble and weak in our own apprehenſion and conſideration, when we lay this to heart, that we are weak, then are we ſtrong; for this makes a man lay about him, to cleave unto God.</p>
                  <p>I have laid down divers directions for the ſtrengthning of thoſe good things that are in us, and I will now adde one more, becauſe it is ſeaſonable for the time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Direct.</note>Make conſcience of uſing and improving the Sacraments, for they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ordinances to ſtrengthen a man.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Sacrament of Baptiſm; I do not mean the meer receiving out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward baptiſm, that is a weak thing; but when a man hath a care to improve his baptiſm. It is noted of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he had faith before his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; but he received circumciſion, the ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith, for this, that he might be the father of the faithful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19. Now he could believe incredible wonderful ſtrange things, that would have ſtaggered him before: So when <hi>David</hi> was to fight againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> he was a great warrier, and a mighty ſouldier, and <hi>David</hi> a weak ſtripling; now ſee how he ſtrengthned himſelf againſt <hi>Goliah</hi>; he uſeth three argument, and one is taken from the Sacrament of Gods covenant; he was an uncircumciſed man,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.</note> but <hi>David</hi> was circumciſed, and within the covenant; What is this uncircumciſed Philiſtin, to one that is circumciſed and in covenant with God? and he hath given me the Sacrament of it, that he will help me and be with me, and ſtand by me in all eſtates and conditions. So it was with the Gaoler; before when the Magiſtrates bid him put <hi>Paul</hi> and his fellows in the worſt priſon, he durſt do no other; and when he ſaw the priſon doors open,<note place="margin">Acts 16.</note> he would have killed himſelf, he was not able to have any power over himſelf; but when he had faith and was baptized, now he was able to take them out of the priſon, and carry them to his own houſe, and give them the beſt entertainment; though the Magiſtrates counted them Roagues and vagabonds, he had gotten ſtrength now.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Sacrament of the Lords Supper is of great force, being uſed with faith and due preparation according to Gods Ordinance; it is a Sacrament for the very nonce to help a mans faith, and ſtrengthen him in every good thing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe this is the very nature of the Sacrament; it is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of growth and increaſing in grace; the other Sacrament puts a man into the eſtate of grace, and this ſtrengthens a man in the eſtate of grace; therefore when Chriſt adminiſtred the Sacrament, he tells us, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as our very bread;<note place="margin">Matth 26.</note> now <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. <hi>bread ſtrengthens a mans heart</hi>: He tells us if we come to the Sacrament aright, as our bodies receive bread and it ſtrengthens them, ſo we may receive that which will nouriſh our ſouls; <hi>take, eat, this is my body</hi>; will not this bread nouriſh you? directly my body is ſuch a thing, that do but take it by faith, it ſhall ſtrengthen you, juſt as this bread ſtrengthens the body;<note place="margin">1 Kings 19.</note> as <hi>Eliah</hi> went in the ſtrength of that meat he eat forty dayes and forty nights; ſo if we come to this Sacrament underſtandingly and preparedly, it is moſt certain we ſhall have ſtrength; may be not that we would have our ſelves; may be we would have more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94114:47"/>
grace, and more aſſiſtance, but we ſhall have that ſtrength whereby we ſhall be able to go on in the ſervice of God, doing good, and ſhunning evil from day to day; <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, &amp;c.</hi> And indeed it will nouriſh a man; as it is ſaid of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> he was weak and faint,<note place="margin">John 6.55<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and his eyes grew dim; but when he taſted a little honey, his ſtrength came to him again:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.</note> So the Sacrament received by a true Communicant, that ſets himſelfe to prepare his ſoul to partake of it, he ſhall have his eyes enlightned, and his heart quickned, he ſhall have ſome ſuccour and relief from it to go about e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good word and work.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a ſeal of Gods Covenant, and therefore muſt needs ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then a man that is in Covenant with God, if he come to it as it ought to be come unto; for what is the Covenant a true believer is in? <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant, never to turn away from them to doe them good; and I will put my fear into their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 32.40. It is an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, I will never let them goe, I will put a ſtrong fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not doe as the wicked doe, they ſhall ſtand in awe of God; it is a ſtrong light; others ſhall be deluded; they ſhall not be deluded; it is a ſtrong apprehenſion of the Word and Will of God; this is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God. Now when a man ſhall come to have this ſealed, when God ſhall give this Sacrament to make this good, and he takes the Sacrament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that he will walk according to this Covenant, according to the grace that God hath given him; this man hath all the witneſſes in heaven and earth; why ſhould he be weak in faith then? <hi>There be but three witneſſes in heaven</hi>; he hath theſe that hath faith; <hi>there be but three on earth, the ſpirit,</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, This Sacrament is Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? &amp;c.</hi> So that when a man comes to the Sacrament aright, he hath communion with Jeſus Chriſt; therefore he muſt needs be ſtrengthened, though he were never ſo weak before; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of <hi>the Coni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So true Chriſtians are a feeble folk, and yet they make their houſes in the Rock, where they eat this ſpiritual meat, and drink this ſpiritual drink; they drink of that Rock Jeſus Chriſt; when they draw neer to this Table, they draw neer to Chriſt, and therefore muſt needs gather ſtrength; they come to this Rock to be rooted and eſtabliſhed in this Rock; and therefore muſt needs get ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe this Sacrament is a Sacrament of communion with the members of Chriſt; a man that rightly receives it, doth increaſe the communion of Saints over all the world; though he never ſaw them, yet he is loved more and more of all the Saints; therefore he muſt needs grow ſtronger: Take a man that is woven into every man, there is hardly any man of any power but loves him, he hath friends everywhere; this man is a ſtrong man, as it is ſaid of <hi>Abſolom, he grew ſtrong, for the people increas'd continually with him,</hi> 2 Sam. 21.15. So a Chriſtian muſt needs grow ſtrong, that truly heares the Word, and receives the Sacrament; for people ſtill come flocking more and more unto him; for ſtill as the Church comes to grow or any ſoul comes to believe in Chriſt, he ſtrengthens himſelfe; as <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtrong in every Town where he went, in regard of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints; ſuch a man is ſtrong in regard of his infirmities, he hath many to help him to bear them; he is ſtrong alſo in regard of advice and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94114:48"/>
counſel, he ſhall have the counſel of the Saints, <hi>Job</hi> 4.3. If a man be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what courſe to take when inſtruction comes, it ſtrengthens a man much: Now when a man hath communion with all the Saints, what abundance of counſel hath he?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.</note> you may ſee how weak <hi>David</hi> was, he was not able to beat down his wrath and impatience: Now when <hi>Abigail</hi> came with her good counſel, he bleſſed God for it.</p>
                  <p>Let us have a care to come ſo to the Sacrament, that we may be ſtrengthened in all good things, that we may be more quickned up to every good word <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> and work; for it is a ſtrengthening Ordinance; it is appointed of God for the very nonce to ſtrengthen Gods people in all buſineſs and employments they have to doe from day to day. When <hi>Moſes</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> received the Paſſeover, <hi>God ſmote the firſt borne of all Egypt,</hi> Pſal. 105.30. This was a ſeal that God ſmote all the ſtrength of the <hi>Egyptians, but there was not one weak perſon among the Iſraelites</hi>: So if we did receive the Sacrament aright, there ſhould not be a weak Chriſtian among us, God would ſmite the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> and weaken the ſtrength of all their luſts and corruptions; is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any among us weak, and he cannot do this and that? his luſts are like <hi>the ſons of Zerviah</hi> to <hi>David, too hard for him; Though I be anointed King, I am weak, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Sam. 3.39. So doſt thou ſay, I am very weak this day, and though God hath anointed me King over my luſts, and I am a Chriſtian that ſhould have power over my luſts, yet theſe baſe luſts and curſed corruptions are too hard for me; I ſay, if we did but wiſely and carefully, as we ought to do, goe to the Word and Sacrament, and the reſt of Gods Ordinances, we ſhould have marvellous ſupply and help to carry us on in our Chriſtian Combate: It is a very remarkable thing, that when God would have <hi>Joſhua</hi> and al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This may ſeem to condemn the moſt of us all generally. How do Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans miſſe of the partaking of the Sacrament? what a deal of weakneſs is <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> there among us? where is there a ſtrong Chriſtian? they can hardly doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, or ſuffer any thing; whence is all this? this comes from not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament as they ought to doe; as the Apoſtle ſaith of bodily weakneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep.</hi> He ſpeaks there of their unworthy receiving the Sacrament; this is the cauſe that your bodies are weak: So this is as true of the weakneſs of the ſoule; for this cauſe many are weak among you, and many have ſuch ſick ſouls; nay, many are even dead to all manner of good, even for this cauſe, the not receiving the Lords Supper in a right manner; for if the Sacrament were duely come unto as it doth require, it is to ſtrengthen us in grace, and againſt Satan; but when people come hand over head, when they pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

rather ſtrengthen themſelves in ſinne and Satan againſt them; as it is ſaid of <hi>Judas,</hi> after he had received the ſop, the Devil entred into him, <hi>John</hi> 13.27. you ſee he went away with more hardneſs of heart from the Lords Supper, then he came to it; he went away with more wrath and diſcontent againſt Chriſt and his bleſſed company then before; the Devil had more ſtrength then he had before: A true Chriſtian that comes to the Sacrament as he ought, gets more ſtrength to his faith, more ſtrength to his lively hope, more patience and meekneſs; he ſtrengthens all the graces of Gods ſpirit, and ſtrengthens himſelfe againſt Satan and his own fleſh, and againſt his luſts and corruptions; but when a man comes otherwiſe, he doth not only not get ſtrength againſt corruption, but corruption gets ſtrength rather; he goes away with more corruption of heart, and more guiltineſs of ſinne then before, and is more heartleſs to prayer and good duties: The Devil deals with men, as the Monk did with <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. Emperour; it is reported that he was poyſoned by coming to the Sacrament; for he had poyſoned it; ſo the Devil poyſons the Sacrament to moſt men, they eat and drink their own damnation, when they goe away from the Lords Supper they are worſe then when they came, more weak and unable to put off Satan, and more expoſed to his fiery darts; whereas if the Sacrament were approached unto according to the due order that God hath ſet down in his Word, we ſhould gather ſtrength from it.</p>
                  <p>This may ſerve to ſhew the reaſon why people get no more good by the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> Sacrament, and doe not meet with this ſtrength that the Sacrament admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to every worthy Communicant in general, becauſe they doe not come in a right manner to the partaking of it; and when they doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the manner, God doth not regard the matter; when they doe not come faithfully, and readily, and preparedly to the Table of the Lord, the Lord regards not their coming, and they ſhall get no good by it; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>When a man is not ready to heare, he offers the ſacrifice of fools,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.1. So when a man receives the Sacrament, and is not ready to receive, he receives the Sacrament of fools; he doth not conſider what a ſacred thing it is, and what great matters are required of him, and what care and conſcience is requiſite thereunto; <hi>we ſhould examine our ſelves,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. We muſt not only eat of that bread, and drink of that cup, for ſo even wretches and carnal people do, and never partake of any ſtrength; but we muſt partake of it after a right manner, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47. <hi>He that knew his Lords will, and prepared not himſelfe to doe it, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes</hi>; ſo when we know it is Gods will we ſhould come preparedly, and we will not prepare our ſelves; God will not ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us and help us againſt our luſts, but our luſts ſhal get head againſt us. This is in general. Now I come to ſpeak of ſome particular reaſons that hinder men from partaking aright of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe people come not to the Sacrament with a ſenſe and feeling of their own wants; if we would partake of ſtrength by the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come we muſt feel our wants, how we want hope, and patience, and faith, and ſtrength, we want ſpiritual underſtanding in the wayes of God; we ſhould not only ſee this, but feel it; people, may be, ſee this, that they want this or that; but there is no ſound feeling of their wants; they are without faith, and do not feel it; without hope and patience, and doe not feel it; they do not find the want of theſe things. Now <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.4, 5. Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſaith to him that wanteth underſtanding, <hi>Come eat of my bread, &amp;c.</hi> When a man doth want underſtanding, is not onely without it, but feels the want of it; he is not only without ſtrength and faith, but feels the want of it; he ſees the want of wiſedom and diſcretion, and Gods helping of him more and more; if it be ſo, <hi>eat of my bread, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:94114:49"/>Secondly, Becauſe people come without true repentance to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they do not repent of their ſins, they do not break the league between them and their own wayes, they come to the Sacrament, and mean to think as they have done, and ſpeak as they have done, and keep company as they have done, and behave themſelves in their places and callings as they have done, and no otherwiſe then they have done; and though they cry God mercy, and make ſome prayers, yet the covenant between them and their wicked courſes was never broken; and therefore it can do them no good: People come to the Sacrament as <hi>Judas</hi> did, he came freſh from the Phariſees conſpiring the betraying his Maſter, and as ſoon as he had done, he meant to go to them again, and ſo got no good by it; whereas if we would get good by the Sacrament, that it may build us up in knowledge and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in having a care to pleaſe God, and making conſcience of all our wayes, we ought to root out our ſins and corruptions, and fling away our luſts and vile affections; we ſhould throw ſin out of doors, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to throw leaven out of doors, and not to have any in their houſes; nay we ſhould deal with ſin, as <hi>Ammon</hi> did with <hi>Thamar</hi>; he hated her now more then he loved her before; nay he put her out, and bolted the doore after her; ſo though we loved vanity, and worldlineſs, and paſſion before, yet now we ſhould hate them, and put them out of doors, yea bolt the door after them, that they may come in no more. This is the way to come to the Sacrament, ſo as to get ſtrength thereby; and the want of this is the cauſe that people go away ſo weak.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe they come without faith; they come doubting to the Sacrament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>He that doubteth, is damned if he eat.</hi> I may apply it to this; he that doubts is damned if he receive the Sacrament, his own conſcience will reprove him, his own ſoul will ſay, I have not done well, I have not pleaſed God in comming; his own conſcience will condemn him, and damn him; when he looks upon the Covenant of grace, he cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it, conſcience puts him off: This is for want of true faith; if people would come to the Lords Table with faith, they would receive ſtrength, as it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 11.28. <hi>By faith he received the Paſſeover</hi>; ſo if by faith we would receive the Lords Supper, and beat down all doubts and fears of fleſh and blood, and reſolve to caſt our ſelves upon Chriſt and his promiſes, and let him have the diſpoſing of us; if we would truly caſt our ſelves upon Chriſt, and believe in his name, and ſo come to the Sacrament, we ſhould have ſtrength; how can we get ſtrength without this? <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. When we come to the Sacrament, we come to partake of Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, that we may dwell in Chriſt, and he in us. Now he will not doe thus without faith; faith is the wedding garment; if we come without it, we ſhall be bound hand and foot and caſt into utter darkneſs; may be thou wert fettered before, but now thou ſhalt be more bound, even bound hand and foot, that thou canſt not ſtir, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Above all things take the ſhield of faith</hi>;<note place="margin">Eph. 6.</note> ſo I may ſay, if you will come to the Sacrament to your own peace and comfort, above all things take the ſhield of faith. When men come to the Sacrament only with bodily eyes, and bodily hands, what do they get? nothing but a piece of bread, and a drop of wine; but if they had faith, they ſhould have the evidence of things not ſeen; Chriſt, and heaven, and the covenant of grace, are not ſeen with bodily eyes; faith would help them to the evidence of theſe things not ſeen; as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of a worthy Martyr, when he was to ſuffer Martyrdome, he took the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to ſtrengthen him to ſuffer Martyrdom; and the Martyrs in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, every day expecting Martyrdom, they every day received the Sacrament to help them with ſtrength; but when we come to the Sacrament without faith, we deprive our ſelves of this benefit. Now as long as we
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94114:49"/>
give way to our ſins, doubting will reign, and faith cannot be in our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe they do not ſeek earneſtly to God to bleſſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, they do not make themſelves ſtrong in heaven before they come; they do not go with ſtrong cries and groans to the Throne of grace, that God would quicken them that they may get the good they ought to do at it. If we would come to the Sacrament of Lords Supper as we ought to do, we ſhould be earneſt with God and wreſtle with him, that he would make us ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our wants, and that he would pluck up our hearts to come with faith, that he would ſtrengthen us, that we may behave our ſelves well when we are there, and when we come away; every Ordinance of God is ſanctified by the word and prayer, 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 4.5. Now becauſe either people do not pray at all, or if they do, they are not earneſt with God, therefore it is that they return home little the better.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Becauſe they do not behave themſelves well when they are at it, they are not well occupied when they ſit at the Lords Table, they know not how to employ themſelves as the duty requires; this is that would help us to true ſtrength by the Sacrament, if we were well employed when we were at it. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.12. <hi>While the King ſitteth at his table, &amp;c,</hi> ſaith the Church, that is, while the King was enjoying communion with me, and I with him, I was juſt at the ſame time very well employed; I laboured in ſome meaſure to ſtir up all the graces that were in me, that my Spikenard might ſend up a ſweet perfume into his noſtrils, that my faith might work, and my love might work; ſo while we are ſitting at the Lords Table, and the King ſitteth down to bid us welcome; we ſhould labour to be well employed, to keep vanities out of our minds, and employ them well, that we may have a good meal before we go.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Becauſe people when they have been at the Sacrament, they do not examine themſelves diligently, whither they have got any good by the Sacrament; I have received the Sacrament, have I got any good by it? is my faith ſtrengthned? am I yet backward to Gods will, untoward in his worſhip, dead in his ſervice, am I ſtill hovering and doubting in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, have I no care of God, have I got no good by the Sacrament? if people would but call themſelves to account, whither they have got any good by the Sacrament, this would do them a great deal of good; it would make them bewail and lament, and cry out if they got no good; people let things run on at ſix and ſevens; if they get good, ſo it is; if they get none, ſo it is, but lay it not to heart; whereas a godly heart when he hath been at an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, calls himſelf to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>unt, and takes it marvellous heavily if he ſee he hath got no good; as the Church when ſhe prayed, and ſaw her prayers did not prevail, it was a bitter thing to her; <hi>Thou haſt covered thy ſelf with a cloud, that our prayer ſhould not paſs thorow,</hi> Lam. 3.44. when ſhe ſaw ſhe prayed, and ſtrived, and tugged with God, and there was no comfort, O how ſhe took it to heart, ſhe made it the burthen of her complaint; ſo if Chriſtians would do thus, The Sacrament doth not take, the Lord covers himſelf with clouds, and hides himſelf from me, he will not own me; we ſhould go crying and yelling up and down to ſee that we do not get good by the Sacrament; if we would do thus, we might get good by it.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, If people do get good by the Sacrament afterwards, yet they do not interpret this to be by the goodneſs of God in the Sacrament; may be they meet with ſome comfort and aſſiſtance now and then which might do them a world of good, and ſtrengthen their hearts wonderfully if they did look to it; when they have gotten many good bleſſings, now they do not conſtrue this to be by reaſon of Gods Sacrament and Covenant; if they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94114:50"/>
did look upon it, O this came by vertue of Gods Covenant, and the ſeal of his Covenant to my ſoul, this would make them ſtrong in Gods Covenant, and help them exceedingly; thus <hi>David</hi> did, if he got any mercy at any time,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> ſtill he laid it upon going to Gods Ordinances; <hi>this I had becauſe I kept thy precepts</hi>; This I had becauſe I prayed unto thee, and ſought thee earneſtly; I followed God earneſtly, and now I ſee his infinite goodneſſe and mercy towards me, how he hath rewarded me; I confeſs it was a poor thing I did, God might even have flung it as dung in my face, but ſee how he hath rewarded me: So if Chriſtians would ſay, this I had becauſe I was careful, though I had formerly neglected Gods Ordinances; yet at laſt I came to ſeek him earneſtly with my whole heart, and to come more prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly and diligently to the Lords Supper, and now this I find I had by it; how hath God bleſſed me ſince? how hath he aſſiſted me, and lifted me over many rubs and temptations? I will have a care of this therefore afterwards; this would ſtrengthen a man wonderfully, but for want of this people get litttle good.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Becauſe Chriſtians do not rowſe and ſtir up the Sacraments that they have partaked of formerly, they do not provoke their ſouls to extort the efficacy and fruit of former Sacraments; when <hi>Moſes</hi> had perceived that all Iſrael had entered into Covenant with God, he rowſeth up their hearts to look upon this Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17, 18, 19. <hi>Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, &amp;c.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, you have entered into covenant with God this very day; now rowſe up your ſelves and and conſider what God hath done; this very God hath promiſed you to ſet you up above all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; then ſtir up your ſelves and believe God, and ſay, Why ſhould I diſtruſt God? certainly he will bleſſe me, and do good to me; and this day thou haſt vowed thy ſelf to God, therefore rowſe up thy ſelf and think there is no going back; I have made a covenant, and taken the Sacrament upon it, and now there is no going back; as <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks of a good Virgin, ſhe was marvellouſly tempted by her luſts and corruptions; ſhe helped herſelf by the covenant; I am a Chriſtian, and am baptized, I have taken the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, and will not yield; and this did marvellouſly help her; but when Chriſtians neglect this, no marvel though they continue weak ſtill; nay, moſt people though they have been at the Sacrament make no conſcience of their vows to God, they break covenant with God, therefore no marvel they get no good by the Sacrament.</p>

Now I will tell you, Firſt, What is not the reaſon of this. Secondly, What is the reaſon of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Not any thing in himſelf; it is not any grace received in it ſelf,<note place="margin">1. What not the Reaſon.</note> it is nothing in thee; no not the image of God in thee, nor any holineſs, nor mortification; there is nothing in him keeps him from falling away; for let a man have all the grace that ever any man had, he may fall totally for all that; nay, if he were as holy inherently as <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, he may fall away totally; nay, if he were as holy as the Angels in Heaven,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94114:51"/>
and were in the ſame eſtate that the Angels in Heaven are; they are not immutable in their own nature, therefore that they are confirmed in grace, it is Gods goodneſs and mercy to them, it is nothing in themſelves; thoſe Angels that do ſtand, may fall notwithſtanding any thing that is in them; no grace received will keep a man from falling totally away, if he have not the fountain and the favour of God to keep him, if he have not a better bottom then himſelf; intrinſecal unchangableneſs is only a property of the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. All creatures may change, if they had a thouſand times more of the image of God, yet they may change and fall, and loſe all not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any thing they have received; it is nothing in a mans ſelf; Now I will make this appear that it is not any thing in a mans ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Evid.</note>Firſt, Becauſe the godlieſt man in the world is bid to look upon himſelf as one that may fall abſolutely into any ſin in the world in himſelf; for all the love he hath of God, he may yet hate him; for all the fear he hath of God, he may yet ſlight him; a child of God is commanded to look upon himſelf, as left to himſelf, to be in a woful caſe; that he may fall finally and totally away, to be nothing and worſe then nothing; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye that are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch a man, knowing that ye your ſelves alſo may be tempted; that is, conſider, it may be thy caſe, thou mayſt be tempted to fall as well as he, and worſe too; you that are ſpiritual, though you be never ſo ſpiritual, though your minds be never ſo wrapt up with God, and taken up with ſpiritual things, yet you are not ſo ſpiritual, but if you will hearken to the counſel of your own hearts, you may be carnal and brutiſh; look upon thy ſelf as a poor miſerable creature; though thou haſt never ſo much grace, thou canſt not keep it, unleſſe thou haſt a better keeper then thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe the people of God are bound to fear themſelves (I bring the very arguments that they bring that hold a child of God may fall away totally; therefore I grant them that the arguments are good, that in themſelves they may fall away) and I ſay a child of God is commanded to fear; be not high-minded but fear; that is, though thou haſt an excellent faith, and ſtandeſt by faith, yet be not high-minded, do not think thou art higher then thou art, and remoter from the power of the fleſh then thou art; be not proud and conceited; for all the faith thou haſt, thou mayſt diſtruſt God; and if God leave thee to thy ſelf thou mayſt be an unbeliever, and as vile an infidel as ever breathed upon the face of the earth; in thy ſelf thou haſt as vile a wretched heart as any man, which if thou wert left to thy ſelf would quickly ſhew what it is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12.13. work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling; for God worketh both the will and the deed: As who ſhould ſay, I do not deny but a child of God both depend upon the good pleaſure of God, and is built upon his eternal counſel; he is not built upon his own pleaſure, he doth not ſtand upon the hap hazard of his own will, but upon the good pleaſure of Gods will; but ſaith he, it is our part to fear: for we for our part may fall, we can do nothing, no more then we are holpen; no more then God doth ſtand by us, and keep us from falling; it is our part to fear and tremble from day to day; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1 let us fear, leſt having the promiſes of entring into his reſt, any of us ſhould fall ſhort: Let us fear; as who ſhould ſay, we are in danger of coming ſhort, we are in danger to fall, and not to reach the Kingdom of Heaven; how many temptations are there? what a vile fleſh do we carry about with us? therefore let us fear.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The children of God are commanded to take heed, leſt they fall totally away; where note they may for all that is in themſelves, for any grace that is received; therefore God calls upon them to cling to him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o cleave to him, that he may not be provoked to withhold himſelf from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94114:51"/>
them; as we may ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. take heed <hi>leſt any man fail of the grace of God, &amp;c.</hi> Take heed, look diligently to your ſelves, leſt any man fail of the grace of God; if you mean to go to heaven, I can tell you you muſt have care and diligence, and look to your ſelves; take heed you be not proud and worldly; take heed you ſuffer not ſecurity nor any other corruption to ſteal upon you, and hinder you from going on in a godly courſe; take heed leſt any of you fail of the grace of God; what do theſe words import but that a man in himſelf is in greiveous danger, in regard of falling totally away? ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. he that ſtands, let him take heed leſt he falls, though he ſtand never ſo firm for the preſent, though he be never ſo ſtout and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; no man ever went ſo far in the wayes of God but he might turn back if he lookt not to himſelf; no man was ever ſo zealous, but he might be lukewarm if he lookt not to it; no man was ever ſo quickned, but he may be deaded, if he look not to it; therefore he that ſtands let him take heed leſt he fall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the children of God are commanded ſtill to grow in grace, becauſe there is no grace yet received, or that can be received in this world, is enough to keep them from falling totally away; if a man think with himſelf, this grace I have is enough, I need no more, if he do ſtand at a ſtay, and limit himſelf, and think this will ſuffice, he is miſtaken; there is no grace, if it were a thouſand times greater then that which the beſt Saint in the world hath, that can ſecure a man from falling away; therefore when the Apoſtle would perſwade Chriſtians to take heed that they did not fall away, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. he bids them grow in grace; would you not fall, but ſtand ſtedfaſt? would you not be led away with the errours of the wicked? know aſſuredly that all the graces you have received are not ſufficient; but grow in grace, labour to be more humble, and meek, and patient, and zealous; labour to make more conſcience of your wayes, to have a more tender heart, to be more taken up with God, and more careful to pleaſe him; to be more earneſt and frequent in prayer, to mark his word, and look to your ſteps every day; labour to ſtand firmer and ſtronger yet; for all that you have attained to it is not ſo much, but it may be weakned and born down; <hi>Therefore grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Becauſe the examples of Apoſtates and backſliders are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the very Saints, for them to take warning by; as the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the example of the Jewiſh Apoſtates to the <hi>Romans; if God ſpared not the natural branches, &amp;c.</hi> Look upon them, ſee how they are fallen away,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.21.</note> how that Church is Apoſtatized; therefore look thou to thy ſelf, leſt that which befell them befall thee; leſt thou ſin againſt God, as they did, and ſo that light upon thee, which did light upon them; ſo the Apoſtle doth propound the example of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> even to <hi>Timothy</hi>; though <hi>Timothy</hi> was elect of God, yet he knew <hi>Timothy</hi> was of a flexible nature, and might change and fall, and fall totally in himſelf, if he did not look to it; O ſaith he, <hi>hold faith and a good conſcience, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. He propounds it even to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that the falls of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates might make him wary and careful to ſtand upon his guard.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Becauſe the children of God are fain to pray that God would keep them from falling away finally &amp; totally; which is a ſign that they may fall away totally in themſelves, notwithſtanding whatſoever acquaintance they have with God, or whatſoever vertue they have gotten from Chriſts death, yet they are to go to God to keep them from falling away; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.43 44. take not away the word of thy truth, &amp;c. As who ſhould ſay, Lord, for ever keep me, do thou never forſake me utterly, though I may provoke thee to forſake me very much, yet never take away the word of thy truth utterly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94114:52"/>
out of my mouth, then I ſhall never be able to hold out to the end; if thou wilt keep me and uphold me, then I ſhall keep thy Law for ever; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſhall never do it: Nay, Chriſt plainly tells us, that he is fain to put in, and pour out his prayers before his heavenly father, that his deareſt Saints and elect may not fall away; as who ſhould ſay, Father, they may fall totally away, if thou do not preſerve them; as he ſaith to <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>I have prayed that thy faith fail not</hi>; faith is the beſt grace that any child of God hath, and love proceeding from faith is a good grace; but they are all failing things, and may be worn out by corruptions; therefore Chriſt prayeth his heavenly Father that it may be fed and cheriſhed, and kept by his heavenly Father, that it may never fail; implying it would fail otherwiſe: Nay, the children of God are fain to confeſſe in their prayers it were juſt with God to let them fall totally away, by reaſon of their ſins, by reaſon of their unthankfulneſſe and unfruitfulneſs under the means, and want of knowledge of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt; they confeſs it were juſt with God to be weary of them, and give them for gone; nay, the children of God, the beſt of them all do find that it is a very hard thing to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from decayes of grace, and declinings, and weaknings; they find that they have much ad o to hold their own, much more to grow in grace, and increaſe more and more; to grow more and more heavenly, and more and more vertuous, and more and more ſelfdenying; they ſee how many thouſand corruptions and temptations they have, and how backward their own hearts are, and how ſoon they are ſurprized, that they have much ado to keep that which is begun in them, much more to encreaſe it, and grow in it: Nay, the children of God may ſo far fall away, that in their own ſenſe and feeling they may think that they have not a jot of grace, ſo that they are ſometimes ready to conclude againſt themſelves, that they have no grace, they were never wrought upon, never ſubdued; many times it is thus, and though they do not conclude thus, yet how often are they put to this deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate lift? to look every moment when they ſhall fall, and fall totally and loſe all, they ſhall not have a relique of grace in them; it is thus with the Saints of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Becauſe there is no grace received is able to hold without continual influences from Heaven; this is the nature of the grace of the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that it is by continual influence; it is not like the firſt Covenant; when God gave <hi>Adam</hi> all his portion in his hand, not only for the preſent, but for ever; if he would he might ſtand for ever, he need not pray to God to keep him, but if he would obey God, he might ſtand of himſelf, by the Covenant that God had made with him; but under the Covenant of grace, grace runs thus, that grace is but for the preſent; if a man ſtand now, if he would ſtand the next hour, he muſt have a new ſupply of grace; though he be never ſo patient now, he may be impatient in a quarter of an hour; though he be never ſo humble now, he may be as proud as <hi>Lucifer</hi> in a quarter of an hour; I ſay, God under the Covenant of grace gives a man only for the preſent, ſo that now he may know it is in Gods hand; he is kept by the power of God, through faith unto ſalvation; ſo that grace is in a child of God, as light is in an houſe; light is never ſo in an houſe, but in a moment it will be dark if you ſhut the windows; ſo it is with a true Chriſtian, he had need keep his windows open towards Chriſt, he hath need of continual ſhinings of grace from heaven; as Chriſt teacheth us concerning our daily bread, <hi>give us this day our daily bread</hi>; ſo it is much more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of grace for our ſouls; good Lord give me wiſedom and faith, and patience this hour, and ſo the next hour, and the next day; give me the comfort of this day, and the aſſiſtance of this day, give me the concurrence of thy grace this day, and ſo the next; and we muſt never leave praying
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94114:52"/>
to God to accompany us with his grace from day to day; for a man ſtands not by the grace that is in him, but by the grace that is in God; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. be ſtrong in the Lord, by the power of his might; he doth not ſay, be ſtrong by the grace ye have received, but be ſtrong in the Lord; be ſure you call upon him, and keep cloſe to him; there is all you ſtand by. So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. be ſtrong in the grace in Chriſt Jeſus; if any man in the Church might be ſtrong by the grace in himſelf, <hi>Timothy</hi> might; he was as vertuous a young man as any in the Church; no man that <hi>Paul</hi> loved ſo as <hi>Timothy</hi>; I know no man like minded, ſaith he; he was ſo endued with Gods ſpirit, and the graces and vertues thereof that there was none like him; yet <hi>Paul</hi> doth not bid him be ſtrong in the grace that was in him, but be ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus; grace is in a child of God, as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94114:53"/>
                     <hi>He that heareth theſe ſayings, and doth them, I will liken him to a man that built his houſe upon a rock, &amp;c.</hi> The houſe fell not, but he may thank the rock; it was built upon a rock; ſo a childe of God is built upon a rock; as we have a Proverb, how can he but ſwim that is held up by the chin? ſo a child of God, the Lord holds him up by the chin, he ſhall never ſink ſo as to be drowned; he may fall, and fall fearfully, but not totally; but there ſhall be ſomething of God remaining in him for ever, the Lord will ever keep ſome truth of grace in that mans ſoule that he hath given the truth of grace to. 2 <hi>John</hi> 2. <hi>For the truths ſake</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which dwelleth in us, and ſhall be in us for ever.</hi> When God hath put in the truth of ſaving grace into any of his peoples hearts, it ſhall dwell in them for ever, the Lord will take an order for the keeping of it; therefore though a childe of God may be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly overcome, yet God doth ever let ſomthing or other remain he doth ever exempt ſomething; God deals with his children in regard of their ſouls, as he dealt with <hi>Job</hi> in regard of his body; though he let the Devil have a great deal of power over him, yet he did limit him; he is in thy hand, but ſave his life; though he would not let him have power over his life to kill him, he let him have <hi>Jobs</hi> children in his hands, and he let him have his goods in his hands, his cattel and his ſubſtance in his hands, nay he let him have his health in his hands, ſo that he did ſtrike him with boyles, and blains, and woful ſickneſſe, but yet ſave his life, you ſhall not take away his life; ſo God deals with the life of his Saints; though he may let the Devil horribly tempt them, and the World horribly carry them away, and the luſts of the fleſh horribly vanquiſh them; yet ſaith God, he is my childe, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and the Fleſh, and the Temptations of the World ſhall never kill him; ſave his life, let him never be dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes as a wretch.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, What is it that doth remain, and what ſhall for ever remain in the children of God? You know <hi>David</hi> fell into adultery to lie with another mans wife; he fell to that paſs, that he laboured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his ſin, and maintain it, that it might not come abroad; he added murder to it; what grace, what fear of God, what love to his Majeſty, what regard of Gods commandements, what goodneſs or holineſs at all was in <hi>Davids</hi> heart now at this time? So <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he gave way to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try over all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the Idols of <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> and the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins</hi> round about, that the true God was not truly worſhipped; what grace had he? was there any goodneſs or piety in <hi>Solomon</hi> at that time? So when <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Maſter, and forſwore him, and confirmed it with an oath, and curſed himſelf if he knew the man; what grace was in <hi>Peters</hi> heart at that time? So when <hi>Aſa</hi> threw the Prophet into priſon when he came to reprove him; what grace remained in him at that time? Thus the enemies of this Doctrine argue againſt it; therefore they ſay a child of God may fall totally. Was there any grace at all in <hi>Davids</hi> heart when he was committing adultery and murder? was there any grace at all in <hi>Lots</hi> heart when he was committing drunkenneſſe and inceſt one night after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, There are four things which ſhall ever remain in Gods children, and ſhall never be taken away quite and clean after they are once converted, and brought home to God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They have an Unction, an anointing from the holy one, and that is in them, and ſhall abide in them for ever, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>The anointing which ye have received of him dwelleth in you, &amp;c.</hi> This ſame anointing, it abides in the people of God for ever: By this ſame anointing, I mean the opening of their eyes, whereby they look upon God and Chriſt, and his goodneſs, and holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, and the commandements of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94114:53"/>
God; and ſin, and hell, and the world, and profits, and pleaſures; they look upon the things of the world, and upon the things of heaven, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner then any other people doe; God opens their eyes, that they look upon things in a different manner from other men; and this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhall abide in them for ever: 'Tis true, ſin may horribly dazle their eyes; by reaſon of the corruptions of the fleſh, and the deceivableneſſe of ſin; they may be marvellouſly weakened in this unction and darkneſs and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſoule may blinde their eyes, and dimme their looks; but it can never be quite taken away; they will have a better ſight of God, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Chriſt, and heavenly things, and of the Ordinances of God, and of the world, and their callings, and the buſineſſe of the world, they ſhall ſee theſe things after a different manner from the world; as for example: A child of God ſhall ſee more of the word then any other; others may ſee the word, and yet continue in ſin ſtill; but a godly man ſhall ſee that in the word, that he dares not live in any ſin for a thouſand worlds. So for the Sacrament, he ſeeth more then a natural man; a natural man ſeeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Sacrament, but he may come to it as he doth come to it, he may live in his ſins ſtill, he ſees nothing in the Sacrament, he doth not ſee that he eats and drinks his own damnation if he come unworthily; but a childe of God ſeeth that in the Sacrament, that he dares not come unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredly and unworthily by any means; he ſeeth that in the Sacrament that requires preparation and worthineſſe; ſo for ſin, he ſeeth that in ſin, that he dares not goe on in it; he will rather die at ſtake, rather then doe as the world doth; though through weakneſs and want of cautelouſneſſe, ſin may get great advantage againſt him, yet it ſhall never bear him down, and the unction keeps him that he dares not lay the reins upon his neck. This is one thing ſhall ever remain in a child of God; and this appears by two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt by this, That if ever the Devil get a childe of God to commit ſin, he cannot carry it away as others doe, but it makes the heart bleed, and wounds the conſcience; he ſeeth ſuch things in yielding to ſin, and giving way to the Devil (I ſpeak of known ſins) the unction doth ſo wound him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he cannot carry it as others doe; if he tell a lye, he cannot bear it as the wicked can doe, they can be merry, and jovial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carry it away, it never troubles them; but where this unction is, it lies heavy upon the ſoul; as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> had this unction in the midſt of all his falling into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery; for you may ſee, for all he lived ten months in the ſin before he came to thorough repentance; 'tis true, he did ſo, yet all this while he had this unction; for ſo himſelfe confeſſeth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. <hi>My ſin is ever before me.</hi> Though he never ſought to God ſoundly and thoroughly for ten months together, yet ſtill good things were in him, his ſins were ever before him, it did haunt him as a ghoſt, and wound his conſcience; his unction did ſhew him, what a beaſt am I, what a wretch, what have I done?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It appeares too by this; That a childe of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he hath ſinned never ſo much, yet he cannot ſtand it out; but let him be ſoundly dealt with, he is not able to hold out, but he muſt ſubmit to the Lord; it is a ſigne this unction is in him; for he ſeeth Gods Word, his diſpleaſure, his grace and goodneſſe; a childe of God may be horribly peeviſh, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tranſported in this faſhion, to the diſhonour of God, and opening of the mouth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the ungodly; but come and deal with him, ſhew him his ſins, he is not able to maintain bucklers againſt it; he ſeeth that in your reproof which will burſt all his bones, and make him ſtoop, and fling away his ſins, and caſt away his diſguiſements; as it was with <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Nathan</hi> came to him, O ſaith he, I have ſinned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he reſented preſently; the unction made him ſee that in <hi>Nathans</hi> Sermon, that he was not able to hold out any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94114:54"/>
but now his ſoule bleeds, and melts within him; ſo when a childe of God comes to the word, and heares his ſins reproved, he cannot carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as the wicked doe; they can heare the word, and keep their ſins ſtill; but a child of God hath an unction, and when the word doth diſcove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his ſins to him, he cannot hold up his hand againſt God, but he muſt fall down and bow before him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There ſhall ever remain in a childe of God luſting againſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry known ſin; there will be ever in a childe of God, both before and after the committing of known ſins, luſting againſt the fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſanctified part will luſt againſt the unſanctified; he ſhall never ſin with an whole will, and full conſent, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> There is a ſpiritual will in a child of God, that will ever luſt againſt the carnal will, ſo that a man cannot commit ſin with his whole will, as a wicked man doth; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. He did not ſin with all his ſoule, with all his heart; his mind was for God, the ſpiritual part of his will was againſt his ſin; <hi>I find another law in my members, rebelling againſt the law of my minde, &amp;c.</hi> He did not ſin with all his will; for he had another law in his heart, rebelling againſt the law of ſin and death; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.18. <hi>Whatſoever is borne of God ſinneth not</hi>; that is, he cannot ſin with his free will, with his whole conſent. I will make this appear by five things, that a child of God can never ſin with his whole will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A childe of God cannot ſin with his whole will.</note>Firſt, Becauſe he never ſins, but it is againſt his ſtanding purpoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and determination in himſelfe; a childe of God hath a purpoſe never to ſin againſt God, by uſing all manner of wayes, by ſtriving, praying, labouring, endeavouring, comming to all Gods Ordinances, and taking all courſes to reſiſt ſin; he hath this purpoſe; a wicked man now hath no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not to ſin, but he hath a ſecret purpoſe to ſin; a Drunkard hath a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe when he meets with his companions to goe to the Alehouſe and drink with them; and a covetous man hath a ſecret purpoſe to be worldly; ſo let a man be a vain and an evill companion, he will not give over his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany-keeping, they are his friends, and he will converſe with them; tell him he muſt converſe with the Saints of God, he will not, he hath a ſecret purpoſe to the contrary; but if a childe of God ſin, it is againſt his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he hath a ſtanding purpoſe not to ſin, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.3. So, <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, I will conſider thy teſtimonies, and I will turn my feet unto thy wayes.</hi> There are abundance of places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſhew that a childe of God ever takes up an abſolute purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning holineſſe and godlineſſe of life and converſation. Now if a child of God be born down at any time, it is againſt the purpoſe of his heart, which is a ſigne that he doth not ſin with his whole will; for if a mans will were abſolutely ſet upon wicked courſes, then he would have a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſolution to live in them; but a childe of God hath alwayes a purpoſe to doe the contrary, and to walk in Gods wayes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe a child of God never ſins, but it is againſt the ſtudy and compoſure of his heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is againſt his courſe againſt the frame he compoſeth to himſelfe, which is, that he may not ſin againſt God, but that he is borne down with ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.112. <hi>I have inclined my heart to keep thy ſtatutes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, even to the end.</hi> He had a ſtudy and compoſure in his ſoule to keep Gods ſtatutes and to keep them alwayes, even to the end; therefore when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>David</hi> ſinned, it was not with his whole will; for he ſinned againſt the ſtudy and compoſure of his heart.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A childe of God never ſins, but there is ſomething or other that breaks the fulneſſe of the voluntarineſs of it; as for example; if a childe of God ſins, ſometimes it is out of ignorance, he doth not know that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94114:54"/>
God; if he did, he would not doe it for a world. Now ignorance doth leſſen the voluntarineſſe of a thing; a man in ignorance may doe a thing which he would not have done if he had known it; therefore when a childe of God ſinnes in ignorance, his will is not with it.</p>
                  <p>Again, If he ſin againſt knowledge at any time, then it is through incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſſe, it is in his haſte; you know inconſiderateneſſe doth leſſen the will mightily; a man may in haſte doe a thing, which when he comes to think of, he would rather have cut off his right arm then have done it; therefore this is an argument that all his will was not in the committing of the ſin, becauſe he did not conſider of it, he did not doe it deliberately. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. <hi>In my haſte I ſaid all men are lyars; in my haſte I ſaid I am cut off from thy preſence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, If he he doe it with more deliberation, yet there is ſomething ſtill that doth leſſen the will; there be grievous and violent paſſions. Now violent paſſions doe exceedingly take away the will; a man in paſſion will doe things that his will is abſolutely againſt; a man will ſtab his deareſt friend in fury and paſſion; as when <hi>David</hi> murdered <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> it was meerly out of paſſion, the paſſion of ſhame, leſt his ſin ſhould come out; to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God, and the ſhame of his Kingdome and Crown; he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with ſhame and fear of the diſgrace of his ſins, and in fear he did doe it. So <hi>Peter</hi> was in fear when he denied his Maſter, in fear that he ſhould be put to death, when at the ſame time I dare ſay many qualms came over his heart, O that I were not here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O that I were not put to this! So when <hi>Jonah</hi> ran away from God, it was in a paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Again, Suppoſe that paſſion be down, yet ſomething or other there will be ſtill, that will leſſen the will, as violent temptations and impulſions to ſin; when a man himſelf at the ſame time hath a great act of his will to reſiſt theſe temptations and impulſions to ſin; when a man at the ſame time hath a great act of his will to reſiſt theſe temptations, but the temptations are greater, and ſo he is born down; but here is not all the will; for he would not do it; a wicked man may have reluctancy, and reſiſtance againſt ſin in his conſcience, but a godly man his will is againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A child of God can never be brought ſo low as to make a trade of ſin; <hi>He that committeth ſin, is of the Divel,</hi> 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3.8. that is, he that committeth ſin by way of trade; now this cannot be in a child of God; he is of the Divel that makes a trade of ſin; a child of God his courſe is to the contrary, it is his trade to cleanſe himſelf, and purifie his heart by faith from day to day; if he be impatient, he cannot make a practice of it; a child of God cannot ſin, <hi>for he is ſanctified. Pſal.</hi> 119.1.2. <hi>they do no wicked thing, &amp;c.</hi> This is by way of trade and occupation; a child of God doth never ſin in that faſhion; therefore it is certain his full will is not to ſin, for if his whole will were after ſin, he would go on in it, and live in it, and make a practice of it; but he dares not, nor will not make a practice of it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, A child of God doth never ſo ſin but he hath an aptneſs in him to riſe again; a child of God hath a greater aptneſs to riſe again and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and love God again; he hath a gracious heavenly aptneſs above all other men in the world; let him ſin never ſo much, let his fall be never ſo great, there will be this aptneſs left, and it ſhall remain in him continually; and this is an evident ſign he never ſinned with his whole will; for if he did ſin with his whole will, he would be as unapt to repent as if he had never been converted; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8. As who ſhould ſay, a wiſe man is apt to take a rebuke, he is apt to take it in good part; he will take it humbly and obediently, if he be a wiſe man; and this is a ſign his will is not abſolutely ſet upon folly; but if you tell him you have played the fool, and dealt unadviſedly, why would you be overtaken with ſuch a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94114:55"/>
corruption? you have provoked God, &amp;c. he will love you for it, he hath an aptneſs ſo to do, and this aptneſs ſhall ever remain; and this is another good thing remaining in the children of God, that is, a luſting againſt ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another thing is for ever to have a tender diſpoſition to look after God, and to have an eye to God; this ſhall never be taken away quite and clean; as you may ſee in <hi>Jonah,</hi> though he had run away from God in that lamentable manner, yet ſaith he, I will look towards thy Temple; his thoughts were there, his mind was to have Gods love, his goodneſs, and countenance to ſhine upon him; he muſt have an eye to that above all things in the world; but you will ſay, affliction made him do that, he was now in the Whales belly; but you may ſee, he looked upon God before he was in the Whales belly; for when the Mariners asked him what he was, ſaith he, I am an Hebrew that fears God; and as a proof of this fear, you may ſee how he ſubmitted to God; I have run away from God, ſaith he; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his ſin, and took ſhame to himſelf, and ſubmitted himſelf to be flung into the Sea, that God might have glory by his drowning if he would.</p>
                  <p>So that all was not drowned in him; now that this diſpoſition remaines appears by five things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Though a child of God ſhould grow to never ſo ſluggiſh a pace in Religion, that all his vigour in prayer is gone, he hath not the affection and heart in good duties that once he had, he is lumpiſh and untoward; yet in the midſt of all theſe diſtempers, he cannot lie down to this, but he hath abundance of heaves to God to quicken him again; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.25. <hi>My ſoule cleaveth unto the duſt, O quicken thou me according to thy word.</hi> His wings were off, and his chariot-wheels were knockt aſide, he could not goe on in good duties with any pace, he was lumpiſh and unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, his ſoule cleaved to the duſt; and yet you ſee what heaves he gives, he would be quickned, he would not be at this paſſe; Oh that God would quicken him! this was his diſeaſe, and the burthen of his ſoule, O quicken me! O the lamentable throwes and ſecret yernings that are in a poor ſoule that is dead and dull! he cannot pray, nor finde the Word work upon his ſoule, he can receive no fruit and benefit by the Word of God; O the moanes, and yernings, and lookings up to God, that God would quicken him! though he hath no heart almoſt, but is marvellouſly borne down, yet he is not able to lie down under this, it is a diſeaſe to him; O quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me!</p>
                  <p>Again, Let him be never ſo much hardened, as a childe of God may be fearfully hardened; yet in the midſt of all he hath a feeling of this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whereupon he makes out after God, and will never give him over, till he hath freed him from it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.17.</p>
                  <p>Again, Though a childe of God be never ſo ſecure, as he may be ſecure and grow careleſs of God, yet in the midſt of all, he can never be quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by ſecurity, ſo as quite and clean to forget God; no, he muſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten after God, and will hearken after God, and hear the voice of God in ſome meaſure, when the word reproves him, and finds fault with his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he doth hearken to it, he is not quite aſleep; as the Church ſaith, <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh,</hi> Cant. 5.2. She did take notice of God in the midſt of all her ſecurity; it is the voyce of my <hi>Beloved,</hi> ſaith ſhe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A childe of God can never ſo far goe down the wind, but he ſhall for ever love the Image of God, and love mercy, and love holineſſe and goodneſs, and love the Ordinances of God, and the Image of God, whereſoever he ſees it; nay, he doth love the children of God, and this is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94114:55"/>
a ſigne unto him that he is paſſed from death to life, when he hardly hath any other ſigne; 'tis true, when ſin and corruption hath exceedingly defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods childe, it may make him ſhy of Gods children, and make him winde out of their company; but yet grace makes him love them, they are the amiableſt perſons in the world in that mans eye, he bleſſeth the very ground they goe upon, he hath this ever left in him; and by this a childe of God may know that he is paſſed from death to life, becauſe he loves the Brethren, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, A childe of God ſhall never be brought ſo low, but in the midſt of all he ſhall chide, and check, and finde fault with his own ſoule, not as wicked men doe, by reaſon of the terrours of conſcience, but in a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner; why have I done thus? is this the thanks for the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world by Jeſus Chriſt? is this the thanks for the Goſpel? are theſe the fruits I bring forth under Gods Ordinances? why am I thus dull to good duties? why am I thus daſtardly and cowardly for God? there will be theſe gracious chidings; though ſin and corruption makes him full of legal terrours, yet there be ſome gracious checkings and expoſtulations, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Why art thou ſo heavy O my ſoule?</hi> O be quickned, O be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, hear better, and pray better! He doth check and condemn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a gracious manner, and he can never like of theſe courſes; this will be for ever.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Another thing that ſhall be in Gods children for ever, is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of grace; they ſhall ever have theſe; though the acts of grace may be aſleep, and ceaſe working, yet the habits of grace ſhall ever remain; as a man, though through violent ſickneſs he may run mad and frantick, and loſe the act of reaſon, and be like a mad man; yet the habit of reaſon is in him ſtill, becauſe he hath a reaſonable ſoule; and let the diſtemper be gone, and he will put forth the acts of reaſon: So a childe of God, though for the preſent he be horribly diſtempered, and all the acts of grace are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep; yet he hath the ſpirit of God in him, and therefore hath the habits of grace; although no grace were ſhining in <hi>Davids</hi> heart in the act of them, when he fell into the ſins of murder and adultery; yet he had all graces in the habit of them, in the root of them; as a tree, though it ſeem to be quite dead, yet life is in the root; ſo a childe of God will have the habit and life of grace ever remaining in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this appeares by two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A childe of God in the midſt of all his careleſneſs and negligence, there is a miraculous preſerving of that man, that though that man hath been very careleſs, and wonderful unwatchful, and expoſing himſelf to the temptations of Satan; yet he ſhall be ſtrangely kept, that he ſhall not fall, in a wonderful manner, though it be no thank to himſelfe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9. This is an evident ſign of Gods ſpirit in him, that though he let him get abundance of knocks, yet he will not let him get that fatal knock, but he carrieth him along from day to day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It appeares by this, that this man ſhall never be to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again, but he ſhall for ever be a new creature; though the ſpirit of God hide himſelfe, and withhold his former operations, yet he will not goe quite away, becauſe a childe of God ſhall never need to be converted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: 'Tis true, the riſing up of a childe of God out of ſin, into which he is fallen, is called converſion ſometimes; as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> Nay a childe of God may think he hath need of new converſion, and that he muſt begin all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new again; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Create in me O Lord a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit within me,</hi> Pſal. 51.10. as though he were to begin anew again: But a childe of God is never to begin anew; no, regeneration is an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94114:56"/>
thing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 11<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.5. His righteouſneſs remaineth for ever, he ſhall never have quite loſt it, ſo as that he ſhall be to ſeek again, as if he had never had it; for if regeneration were to be renewed, a man ſhould be reprobated again; but there is but one Faith, one Baptiſm, one Lord <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. Therefore if there be but one Baptiſm, there is but one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; <hi>The faith is but once delivered to the Saints,</hi> Jude 3. God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his vertues and graces but once to the ſoul, and is never to deliver them again; indeed they may be ſmothered and choaked ſometimes, and lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the aſhes, as coals under the embers, but they ſhall never be quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; there needs nothing but a ſtirring up and provoking of the gift of God that is in them; and this is a ſigne that they never fell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally away; for if they fell totally away, they muſt have new repentance, as if they had never had it, and they muſt be converted again, and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated againe with a ſecond regeneration, which was never heard of.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Uſe may ſerve for the confutation of thoſe that hold that a childe of God may fall totally away; here you ſee he cannot; though he may fall never ſo grievouſly into foul ſins and grievous diſtempers, yet he ſhall never fall totally, but ſome good things ſhall remain in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.28. <hi>The Lord preſerveth his Saints.</hi> And <hi>Jude</hi> 1. they are called a people <hi>ſanctified by God the Father, and preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. <hi>He that doth theſe things ſhall never fall.</hi> A childe of God ſhall never fall totally; it is everlaſting life that he hath; that faith which he hath is an eternal grace; he that believeth hath everlaſting life; ſo the fear of God is an everlaſting grace; <hi>The fear of God endureth for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Pſal. 19.9. And therefore thoſe that totally fall away, ſhew plainly that they were never the children of God; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If after they have been enlightned, &amp;c. they fall away, it is impoſſible they ſhould be renewed by repentance, Heb.</hi> 6. Becauſe they were never right, there was never any true grace in that mans heart; but ſaith he, <hi>I hope better things of you, and things that accompany ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 6.19. As who ſhould ſay, they that have things accompanying ſalvation, can never fall totally away.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Uſe is for comfort to Gods children. Haſt thou true faith, or any good things wrought in thy ſoule? thou ſhalt never loſe it; though thou mayſt ſuffer a great deal of ſickneſs, and fall into many decayes of grace and goodneſs, yet thou ſhalt never loſe all; there ſhall be ſome good things remaining in thee; the Lord will not ſuffer thy righteouſneſſe to fall for ever, he will have thee in everlaſting remembrance; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what a comfort ought this to be to every true beleeving ſoule?</p>
                  <p>Again, This is a great comfort againſt all fears. Art thou afraid thou haſt no grace? I beſeech thee believe the Word of God rather then thine own ſenſe and feeling; thou haſt heard the Word of God ſay a childe of God can never be without grace, he can never fall totally away; therefore though ſenſe and feeling tell thee thou haſt none, yet believe the Word that ſaith thou haſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We walk by faith, and not by feeling,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. The beſt of Gods children ſometimes are put to this, to live by faith, and not by ſenſe at all; though God help thee not in prayer, nor quicken thee in good duties, and though thy ſenſe and feeling tell thee thou haſt no grace, believe it not, but believe the Word of God that tells thee a childe of God ſhall never be without grace to the worlds end, but ſomething ſhall remain in him for evermore; therefore be of good comfort, though thou ſee nothing, and thy neighbours ſee nothing, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve neither thy ſelfe nor thy neighbours, but rather believe the Word of God then a thouſand witneſſes; for it is certain, a childe of God ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall totally away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:94114:56"/>Again, It may be a comfort againſt all manner of temptations; God knows how thou mayſt be tempted &amp; aſſaulted; the Devil may be let looſe upon thee; but ſtill remember and think with thy ſelfe, I was told, a child of God can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall totally away one whoſe heart God hath once inclined, one whoſe ſoul God hath once ſanctified, one whom God hath once turned, &amp; brought home to him in ſome meaſure, I have been told he ſhall never fal away; therefore hold this principle even to death, againſt all the Devils in Hell; God is my God, and I have grace, and ſhall have grace, and ſhall never be totally off the hooks as long as I live; as <hi>David,</hi> though he ſaid God had forſaken him in regard of ſenſe and feeling, yet he holds this principle ſtill, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> Pſal. 22.1.</p>
                  <p>Again, This is a great comfort againſt all perſecutions: we know not what perſecutions and what troubles we may come to, and what may become of us before we goe hence: Now it is a great comfort to hear this, that come proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, come adverſity, come what can come, come temptations on the right hand, and on the left hand, come fire and faggot, come priſon, come baniſhment, I tell you a childe of God ſhall never be a bankrupt, he ſhall never be void of all the ſpirit of God, and all the graces of God, he ſhall have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him ſtill remaining. 'Tis true, a childe of God may be brought to that paſs, that perſecutions may be heavy to him, and may be a grievous cut, and he may be ready to put off this, and ready to conſult with fleſh and blood to put it off; and unleſs a childe of God provide for perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it ſhall be harder for him to bear it; but yet if thou be a childe of God, the Lord will never leave thee nor forſake thee, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. though the croſs and affliction be never ſo bitter and irkſome to thee, yet thou ſhalt have ſomething or other that ſhall make thee able to bear it, and to go on in it; though thou doſt but hang by the fingers ends, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall bear thee up, ſo that thou ſhalt not fall.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Labour to make it ſure to our ſouls that we are godly; for we ſee what an happy eſtate it is to be godly; once godly, and ever godly; once a believer, and ever a believer; a man that is a godly man ſhall never fall totally away; therefore labour to make it ſure that thou art a child of God, and haſt the grace of life in thy heart; and then be of good cheer, and take that comfort the Prophet takes to himſelf; the Lord is my hope, I ſhall never be greatly moved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.2. As who ſhould ſay, I do not indeed deny but I may be moved; but though I be moved, I ſhall never be greatly moved; I ſhall never be ſo moved as to break my neck, and be utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; to be quite and clean forſaken, and given over for gone, ſo as to be removed from all hope of the Goſpel, and fear of Gods name; a man may be horribly aſſaulted, yet a child of God ſhall never be at ſuch a paſs as that the Lord ſhall leave him utterly.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the ſecond Motive, and that is that theſe remainders were ready to dye; we may take theſe words to concerne the whole Church, or every particular ſoule that was guilty of it; but we will ſpeake of them only as they have reference to the Church:</p>
                  <p>From whence we obſerve that a particular Church may be ready to dye;<note place="margin">A particular Church may periſh.</note> this muſt not be underſtood of the Catholique Church, or any part of it; as if the Catholique Church or any members thereof could dye; for there is no true believer, that believes in Chriſt by a true and a lively faith, can poſſibly periſh or be deſtroyed for evermore, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. this Church is a Church that Chriſt hath undertaken for, to defend unto the end, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>lo, I am with you to the end of the world,</hi> Mat. 28.20. So that this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church of Chriſt, in all the members of it, it is a ſafe Church; and though all particular Churches ſhould fail, yet ſhall not one member of this Catholique Church; the Church is the firſt born, whoſe names are written
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94114:57"/>
in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23. and if this Church cannot be in one Town, it will be in another; if it cannot be in one Kingdom, it will be among another peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the woman in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> hath the Wilderneſs to flye unto in the moſt deſperate times; God prepares a place for her in one corner or other; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the Catholique Church ſhould dye in any members or branches of it; God will have ſome to know his name; and if it cannot have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meetings and congregations, God will have it ſubſiſt in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; but a particular Church, a local Church, as it is taken for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of people in ſuch a place; any ſuch Church may fail and dye and come to nothing; you ſee it here in the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at this time it had only a name to live, but was dead; and what did remain, they were but the laſt throws as it were; they did go out at laſt, they were ready to dye.</p>
                  <p>Now that any particular Church in the whole world may dye, and ceaſe to be a Church, may be proved out of many places of Scripture: Chriſt ſpeaking of the Jews (that had as great priviledges as any people upon the earth) he tells them, that they might not only ceaſe to be a Church, but <hi>ſhould</hi> ceaſe to be a Church; as you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. <hi>The Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, &amp;c.</hi> here he tells them, that he will quite and clean depart from them, and take away all ſigns and marks of a true Church of God from among them; ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> he tells them they may come to be no Church, and that he doth greatly fear that ſuch an evil ſhall come upon them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. he doth not ſpeak to the particular perſons that were truly converted, for they were members of the Catholique Church, but he ſpeaks to the particular Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>; they did warp and decline; though many particular members ſhould be preſerved, yet he ſuppoſeth that particular Church might fail; ſo he tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that he did much fear them; you obſerve dayes and years, I am afraid leſt I have beſtowed my labour in vain; ſo likewiſe he gives the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to underſtand, though it were an excellent Church at that time; for he ſaith, their faith was ſpoken of abroad, and they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God; yet he tells them they have need to take heed, that they do not loſe their Crown; that they do not ſuffer Satan, or the world, or any other means to draw them away from their profeſſion; as goodly a Church as themſelves had come to warpe and decline and come to nothing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20, 21, 22. As who ſhould ſay, Thou haſt no priviledge of immortality, of being an immortal Church, that thou ſhouldſt ever be a Church, that God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Goſpel and Ordinances, and his name ſhould ever be within thy dwellings; you have no ſuch prerogative; take heed therefore you walk worthy the Goſpel, take heed you grow not high-minded and ſecure; it may be your caſe as well as any other; ſo the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Ten Tribes, they were a Church, but in the end they came to be no Church, they provoked God to give them over, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.9. it is a parabolical kind of ſpeech, that the Prophet ſhould marry an whore, and have a ſon, and call his name, &amp;c. and that was one degree of removing; and the ſecond ſhould be called, &amp;c. which was the utter renouncing of his people.</p>
                  <p>Now there are four ſeveral marks and notes infallible of a true Church;<note place="margin">4. Notes of a true Church.</note> and there is no particular Church but had them once, and my loſe them every one.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is,<note place="margin">1. Sincere preaching the Goſpel.</note> the ſincere preaching of the Goſpel is an infallible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable mark of a true Church of God; whereſoever there is the true Church in any Pariſh or Kingdom, there muſt be a ſincere Preaching of the Word of God; therefore a Church is deſcribed by the Preaching of the Word and Oracles of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. that is, they were a Church of God, the Oracles of God were among them, and were to be heard,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94114:57"/>
opened and declared among them; ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>and his: ſtatutes unto</hi> Iſrael; that is, he makes it a Church, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains his word, and makes it known there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. it is ſaid that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> went up and down and ordained Elders in every Church; if there were a Church, there muſt be Elders in it; there muſt be Elders, Paſtors and Miniſters, that may not only preach the Word, but open it aright; for the Scripture may be in an Antichriſtian Church, but if they in their preaching make the Scriptures doctrines of Divels, and expound them in that faſhion, they are no Church; but the Elders muſt ſpeak the word of God as the word of God, at leaſt in the fundamentals; now there is no Pariſh or Kingdom can be ſaid to be a Church of God, that have not true Miniſters able to preach the word of God ſoundly, to teach the Doctrine of faith and repentance, ſo as people may believe and turn from their ſins to God; and this is a grand mark of all other where the voice of Chriſt ſounds, it is a ſign he hath a Church there; now I ſay this ſincere preaching of the word of God, it is not tied to any place; there is no place but may be deprived of it, if they do not walk worthy of it; it is free, and hath all the whole wide world before it; the Lord hath not limited his Goſpel to any Town or Kingdom; he may ſend it where he pleaſe, and continue it as long as he liſt, and may remove it when he thinks fit; therefore when the <hi>Corinths</hi> were ſomething ſawcy and impudent, and bore themſelves upon this, that they had the word and Goſpel of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.36. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>What? came the word of God out from you? &amp;c.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, be humble, down with your pride, receive inſtruction; as the word of God is come to you, ſo you are not the only men in the world that the word can come to; the word may be taken from you if you take not heed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receive inſtruction by the word, and give way to it; for the word of God may go any whether elſe, and you may be deprived of it if you take not heed. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.2. Chriſt had his word on horſe-back; now if any Kingdom or Pariſh, or Congregation do not give him good entertainment, he is ready to go away; and the ſincere preaching of the word is the ſpiritual rain; now if any people grow unfruitful, and bring not forth the bleſſed fruit of the doctrine of life, God threatens to take away this rain; as it was with the Church of Judah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.6. he ſpeaks here of his vineyard, the Church he had in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he finds fault with their barrenneſs and unfruitfulneſs: when he looked they ſhould bring forth grapes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they brought forth wild grapes; nothing but covetouſneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and all manner of uncleanneſs, and they did not bring forth fruit anſwerable to the means of grace vouchſafed; therefore the Lord threatens to command the clouds that they ſhall rain no more upon his vineyard; thus you ſee the ſincere preaching of the Goſpel, any particular Church may loſe and be deprived of; there is no place or Congregation that hath a leaſe of the Goſpel, but it may loſe it again, and be left in blindneſs, and ſit in the region and ſhadow of death; now when a Pariſh or Kingdom is come to this, to be deprived of the ſincere preaching of the word, it ceaſeth wholly to be a Church of God. I do not deny but God may have ſome members of his Catholique Church there, for they may ſubſiſt without Congregations, though very poorly, and under a great deal of affliction; but there is no National Church, no particular Church, no Pariſh-Church; that Pariſh is not a Church of God; there may be ſome particular members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church there, but there cannot be any particular Church of God there; that Congregation is a Congregation without God; and that Kingdom is a Kingdom without God; as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.3. when as a Kingdom without a preaching Prieſt, &amp;c. He doth not here mean by a preaching Prieſt, one that barely did preach; but he means by a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94114:58"/>
preaching Prieſt, true ſincere preaching, at leaſt in fundamentals; now when <hi>Iſrael</hi> were without this teaching Prieſt, they were without God at that time, and therefore was no true Church; for Chriſt is ever among the candleſticks, as you may ſee in the <hi>Revelation</hi>; there is no Church but Chriſt dwells there in his Ordinances more or leſs; now when people are deprived of the ſincere preaching of the word, God goeth away together with his Goſpel from that Nation; and they are a people without God, unleſs God be pleaſed to look upon them again; they are a Congregation of undone people, and not a Congregation of bleſſed people as the Church of God is, ſo far forth as the judgement of man can judge; where the Goſpel is gone in the ſincere preaching of it, they are an undone people. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.18. <hi>Where there is no viſion, the people periſh:</hi> Now there is no Nation or Pariſh, but may be deprived of the preaching of the word, if they walk not worthy of it; therefore may ceaſe to be a Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another inſeparable mark of the true Church is this, a true and ſincere uſe of the Sacraments,<note place="margin">2. True and ſincere uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> at leaſt in the ſubſtance of them; you ſhall find a particular Church is deſcribed by this, to have the right admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments; as the Church of <hi>Judah</hi> is called circumciſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. the meaning is, what profit hath the Church of <hi>Judah</hi> above other people? and he calls them by that name, becauſe that was a Sacrament of the Covenant of grace which God eſtabliſhed among them; and ſo it is under the Goſpel; the Churches under the Goſpel are defined by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>we are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the ſpirit</hi>; As who ſhould ſay, they brag that they are the people of God, and have the ſeals of the covenant, as circumciſion, and the like; but we are the people of God, for we worſhip God in the ſpirit? Now any Church may loſe the right uſe of the Sacraments; the Sacrament of the Lords Supper was almoſt left out of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. ſaith he, <hi>this is not to eat the Lords Supper</hi>: They met together, and had a Table ſpread, and bread and wine, and had a form of conſecration; yet they were come to this paſs, that they did not receive the Sacrament. So the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath loſt this inſeparable mark of a Church of God, they have loſt the Sacrament; for the ordination of God is quite changed in the main eſſentials of it, and they are made the badges of an Harlot, rather then of a true Wife; They withhold the cup from the people, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacrament in one kind only, whereas Chriſt commanded it to be in both kinds; again, they deliver it in an unknown tongue, whereas Chriſt commanded it to be delivered in a known tongue; again, they turn it into Idolatry, to adore the hoſt, to adore the elements; ſo how many Churches are there up and down, that yield to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that have quite and clean loſt the right uſe of the Sacrament, nay, loſt the Doctrin of the Sacraments? for this is ſeen, as long as the word of God continues ſound in the fundamentals, the Sacraments continue in the doctrin of them; but the Church may loſe the Doctrine of the Sacraments, and the right uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another inſeparable mark of a true Church, is a ſincere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the word of God,<note place="margin">3. Sincere profeſſion of the word of God, &amp;c.</note> and true Chriſtian Religion, either in truth and uprightneſs of heart, or elſe ſo far as man can judge; for though the preaching of the Word come to a place, yet it doth not follow preſently that there is a Church of God; for ſuppoſe a Miniſter come to a place where they are all Pagans, this doth not make a Church; as when <hi>Paul</hi> came among the <hi>Athenians</hi> and begun his Sermon, they were all Pagans and Infidels, they were not a Church preſently, as ſoon as ever he begun his Sermon, but when divers of them embraced the word, either ſincerely, or elſe to ſee to, as far as <hi>Paul</hi> and others could judge, then they were a Church;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94114:58"/>
there muſt be a congregation of people that do profeſſe the pure Religion, and make it appear (at leaſt to the judgement of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) that they are godly in Chriſt Jeſus; this is an inſeparable mark of a true Church, as we may ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 33. you ſhall ſee there that the Church is called a congregation of Saints, a Church of Saints; for ſaith he, <hi>as in all Churches of the Saints</hi>; that is all particular Churches, they are Churches of Saints; not as if every one of them were Saints before God, but they were either Saints before God or men; ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.22. <hi>I was unknown to the Churches of Judea, which were in Chriſt</hi>; mark it, all particular Churches, are Churches that are in Chriſt; the members of thoſe Churches are in Chriſt, either truly, or before men; now I ſay, this mark may periſh from any particular Church; there is no Church that is a Church of Saints, but may become a Church of Divels, and a Synagogue of Satan, all wicked, and diſſolute, and ungodly. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.2. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was weary of his life, he would count it a great bleſſing of God, if he would open a place to him to be apart, that he might not be among them, he was even tired, and his life was uncomfortable; they were ſo wicked and abominable, and ſo far off from being a Church of God, he did rather wiſh himſelf in a wilderneſſe then there; ſo it may be with any particular Church, if they look not to the word of God, and the Ordinances of God, and good order and Government, they may come to loſe this eſſential and inſeparable mark of a true Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Another mark (though I cannot call it inſeparable, becauſe it may be ſevered) is true diſcipline,<note place="margin">4. True Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> and the right uſe of the cenſures of the Church; when there is true diſcipline according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt in his Church, this is a mark of the Church of God. Now a Church of God may loſe this, and be ſtript ſtark naked of true diſcipline, to have no publique reproof, no excommunication of thoſe that are profane; nay, theſe cenſures may be perverted and corrupted, ſo as to uſe them againſt Chriſt, and not for Chriſt; to excommunicate, not drunkards, and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and prophane people, but thoſe that are ſincere and godly, and lead an honeſt and pure life; it was ſo with <hi>Judaea, John</hi> 9.22. <hi>Theſe words ſpake his parents, &amp;c.</hi> Here you ſee diſcipline was out of this Church, and ſo far out that it was quite perverted; and ſuch as ſhould be counted the only members of the Congregation, they threw them out; if any confeſſed Chriſt to be the Redeemer of the world, which was a neceſſary truth, they threw them out of the Church; ſo that we ſee the cenſures may be quite gone. Now 'tis true, this is not an inſeparable mark of the Church of God, it is not a ſign of the <hi>eſſe</hi> of the Church, but it is a ſign of the <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> the well being of a Church: A Church of God, 'tis true, may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcipline; as the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> the Spirit ſaith, it was a true Church, and commends this Church; yet (ſaith he) <hi>I have a few things againſt thee</hi>; what were thoſe? namely, that they wanted diſcipline, that they did not throw out wicked and rotten members, and ſuch as were er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous in doctrine and manners; this Church was guilty of ſuffering this; if they had thrown them out, God would never have charged them with it; the Church cannot hinder but there will be wicked and ungodly men, but as long as they throw them out of the congregation, not to have communion with them, the Church hath waſhed her hands; but it ſeems this Church had not waſhed her hands of this. So the Church of <hi>Thyati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Rev.</hi> 2.18. the Spirit of God calls it a true Church, yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. he tels them plainly, it was a grievous offence to God that they had not diſcipline in the Church; <hi>Notwithſtanding I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt that woman</hi> Jezabel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thou haſt ſuffered this, and let her alone, and doſt even countenance her, and art guilty of all her errours; for thou didſt not throw her out, and diſcard her from being an outward member
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94114:59"/>
of the Church; ſo that we ſee the Church may be without diſcipline in the being of it; yet I make this a mark of the Church of God, becauſe though a Church may be without this, yet it is mightily defaced, and wants its beauty: And again, it is a Church that cannot continue; for when they doe not reprove and rebuke offenders, and deal ſeverely with them direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they will infect the whole body, and it muſt needs weaken and decline, till at laſt it comes to nothing; therefore I make this a ſigne of a true Church. Thus we ſee there be four notes of a true Church, which it may have, and afterwards come to be no Church.</p>
                  <p>Now in the next place I will ſhew you there be ſeverall notes of a falſe Church;<note place="margin">Marks of a falſe Church.</note> and the Church that once had thoſe true notes, may have none but falſe notes.</p>
                  <p>As firſt Antiquity.<note place="margin">1. Antiquity.</note> You ſhall have ſome Churches, as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they brag of Antiquity, they have Antiquity for their prayers for the dead, and Purgatory, &amp; the like, and they ſhew 5, 6, or 700. years for theſe things; and none but a company of upſtart fellows, as <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Perkins,</hi> did ever condemn theſe things. This is a falſe mark; and a Church that hath this mark, may be a Synagogue of Satan, and not a Church of God: For, as a Divine ſaith, no Church can be ſound becauſe of Antiquity, unleſs it hath been from the beginning; as Chriſt, when the <hi>Jewes</hi> pleaded Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he ſaith, <hi>It was not ſo from the beginning.</hi> All Antiquity is nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be from the firſt beginning, when Gods Inſtitution and firſt orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring was; a lye will be a lye, notwithſtanding its Antiquity; and ſo an whore, the elder ſhe is, the impudenter ſhe is; and Errours and Hereſies in proceſs of time grow to be more infectious, they take deeper root. Now if they were once new, what if there were a thouſand yeares upon ſuch a Doctrine, and ſuch a manner of Adminiſtration of the Sacrament, what is this to the purpoſe, if there were a time when this was a novelty and a new device? as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>The Myſtery of iniquity work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Therefore no marvel it is grown ancient, no wonder it is come to be gray-headed; this is nothing, we are not to pick our Religion by yeares, but by Scripture; let a thing be never ſo old, if we cannot prove it by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, this is nothing; if the Church have no other mark to plead that they are the Church of God, but Antiquity, that is a poor plea; as <hi>Paul</hi> thought before his converſion, I am of the Church; <hi>He was exceeding zealous for the traditions of his Fathers,</hi> Gal. 1.14. This is a poor thing; Religion may be a vain Religion for all this. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. If any people come to be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Chriſt, Chriſt comes to redeem them from ſuch Religion as this; the drunkard may ſhew Antiquity for his drunkenneſs, and the adulterer may ſhew Antiquity for his uncleanneſs, &amp;c. But he is a true Chriſtian that can ſhew the Scripture for his title; and that is a true Church that maintaines for matters of Faith, and walks for matters of manners, according to the Scriptures. Now if a Church hath no better mark then Antiquity, it is a falſe Church.</p>
                  <p>Another mark of a falſe Church is univerſality;<note place="margin">2 Univerſality</note> when they have no other mark to ſhew, but that the moſt are of their ſide, they can ſhew the greateſt bulk; if you go and count, there is moſt of their number a great deal; this is a ſure mark of a falſe Church; yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes uſe of this mark; for they confute our marks of a true Church, and will have multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to be their mark; and by this we may ſee they are Antichriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.12. ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. <hi>All that dwell upon the earth, whoſe names were not written in the book of the Lamb, worſhipped the beaſt</hi>; the reprobate are the greateſt part of the world; now here he ſaith, all that dwell upon the earth almoſt ſhall worſhip the Beaſt; if this were the mark of a true Church, Chriſt had miſcounted himſelf when he counted his flock a little flock. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94114:59"/>
                     <hi>Fear not little flock, &amp;c.</hi> And again, he ſaith, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtraight gate, &amp;c.</hi> He deſcribes a true Church by the fewneſs, and not by the univerſality of it; therefore what a madneſs is this to make univerſality a note of a true Church?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Succeſſion of Paſtors.</note> Another is ſucceſſion of Paſtors from the Apoſtles times to this very day; this they make a mark of a true Church; O ſay they we can ſhew ſucceſſion down from <hi>Peter</hi> here at <hi>Rome,</hi> even to this day: The Proteſtants are not able to ſhew this; this is a poor mark; <hi>Cai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Unity.</note> They make that to be a mark of the true Church; and this is a falſe mark too; others ſay they, have not unity among them, but we have unity; thus you may as well prove the Divels in Hell to be a Church, for there is unity; as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If Satan be divided againſt Satan, how can his Kingdom ſtand?</hi> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 4.27. you may ſee what an unity was there, they were all of one knot and one mind; there was a marvellous great unity among them all to condemn Chriſt; the Church muſt be proved to be a true Church, before unity can be brought to be any ſign of it; for the more unity is in a wicked way, the more helliſh is the conſpiracy.</p>

Here you ſee the Church of <hi>Sardis had but a name to live, and was dead</hi>; there was nothing but remainders in her, and they were ready to die and come to nothing. But what ſpeak I of the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi>? Where are all the famous Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Aſta,</hi> of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira? &amp;c.</hi> what is become of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Churches? are they not turned into a wilderneſs, and to worſhip <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> and Idols, and are even grown as bad as Heathens? But what need I ſpeak of theſe? Look upon the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal people of God; no Church like that; <hi>Iſrael is my firſt borne</hi>; there was never any Church under the Goſpel that was his onely Church; but <hi>Judaea</hi> was his onely one, his pleaſant Plant; nay they were the Fathers of Jeſus Chriſt according to the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. yet notwithſtanding that Church was cut off. When the holy City proved a Harlot; when theſe people grew to be weary of God and his Ordinances, and grew to be looſe, and would not be ruled by God and his Word, the Lord gave them a Bill of Divorcement, and ſent them away; therefore let us be warned by them; it is a fearfull thing when God for Idolatry ſhall caſt off Churches, and yet we not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but live under ſecurity and hardneſs of heart, and take not warning by it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.8. God ſaith, <hi>Yet her treacherous ſiſter Judah feared not, but played the harlot.</hi> When God caſt off the ten Tribes, <hi>Judah</hi> ſaw this, and heard of this, and could not chuſe but underſtand this, and yet ſhe did not fear for all this: So when this Pariſh, or any other Pariſh ſhall hear of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pariſh that is unchurched and unminiſtred, and God hath taken away his preſence from among them, and there ſhall be no ſigne of his gracious preſence any more, the Goſpel is gone from ſuch a place, and we hear of it, and yet doe not fear, but are as ſecure as ever, as unfruitful under the means as ever, and doe not ſtir up our ſelves to be more obedient to God and his Ordinances, but goe on to play the harlot, and goe a whoring from God from day to day; nay we are even ready to promiſe our ſelves peace for all this; this is a fearful thing. Mark what the Lord ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. He ſpeaks there of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>: So when God hath poured out his plagues and puniſhments upon other Pariſhes, and other places, and hath taken away his Ark, and the glory is departed from them, and they are left in the ſhadow of death, and we ſee it, and yet tremble not at it, God calls upon us from day to day to amend our lives, that we might finde mercy with him; God tells us, as he hath done to other Pariſhes in the Kingdome, ſo he will doe to us; the Lord will lay us deſolate and waſte as other parts of the land are; and certainly the Lords wrath and vengeance is hard at our heels if we doe not ſpeedily repent; who knows how ſoon God may deprive us of his Word and Ordinances? <hi>For I have not found thy works perfect before God.</hi>

                  <p>If we take theſe words in ſunder, they containe theſe five Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the covenant of grace requires works.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That theſe works ſhould be perfect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:94114:61"/>Thirdly, That they ſhould not onely be perect in the ſight of men, for that is nothing; but perfect in the ſight of God, before God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the Lord Jeſus ſearcheth whither they be ſo or no.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Upon due ſearch he finds it out many times, not onely in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, but in particular Churches, as we ſee here in the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> that their works are not ſo.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, That the ſecond Covenant requires works,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 1. The ſecond Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires works.</note> we ſee here that the Lord Jeſus looks for works in the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> that were in covenant with him; 'tis true, there is this difference between the two Covenants; the firſt covenant requires works as the condition of it; <hi>He that doth them, ſhall live in them,</hi> Gal. 3.12. <hi>The doers of the Law ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> Rom. 2.13. Therefore it is called the covenant of works, and that in two ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In that works are the condition of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that it is left unto man; God gives onely a power not to ſin, if ſo be that man will; but he doth not give the will. Now the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond covenant is not a covenant of works; the condition of it is not works, but the condition of it is faith; <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> Rom. 1.17. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called a covenant of grace, and that in two reſpects oppoſite to the former; not onely in regard that theſe works are done by another, and ſo nothing is required of the party juſtified, but onely faith for his juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but alſo becauſe though the covenant of grace require works, yet God doth not expect a man ſhould doe any thing of himſelf, but it is by grace; we are ſaved by grace through faith, and not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God. I ſay the ſecond covenant is a covenant of grace, and yet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires works.</p>
                  <p>And works are here neceſſary. Firſt by neceſſity of preſence; for though faith be the condition, yet it is ſuch a faith as hath neceſſarily good works together preſent with it; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Faith if it have not works is dead,</hi> Jam. 2.17. Good works they are inſeparably joyned together with true faith; for as the body without the ſpirit is dead, ſo faith without works is dead alſo; not as though works were the eſſential forme of true faith; but the nature of faith, if it be true, is ſuch as doth neceſſarily cauſe good works to accompany with it.</p>
                  <p>They are neceſſary by neceſſity of inſeparable effects; good works are not onely preſent together with faith, but they are ſo preſent, as that they doe flow from faith. God hath required ſuch a faith in the covenant of grace, as doth produce good works; they are not onely inſeparable from faith, but thus inſeparable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that true faith muſt needs produce them; <hi>He that hath this hope, purifies himſelfe as he is pure,</hi> 1 John 3.3. That is, He that hath this faith, he ſets down faith by the effect hope, and ſets it down by another effect, it muſt needs purifie, it makes that man purifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as Chriſt is pure. So Chriſt having exhorted them to believe, having raiſed up their minds to believe the things that are above, <hi>Lay up your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 6.20. in the next <hi>verſe</hi> he ſhews this will have the effect of all manner of good works; <hi>For where your treaſure is, there will your hearts be alſo</hi>; it will draw up your hearts, and make you heavenly-minded, and make you ſeek the things that are above; where your treaſure is, there will your hearts be alſo. So likewiſe we may ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. thorow the whole chapter, what abundance of effects are ſet down of true ſaving faith: <hi>By faith</hi> Abel <hi>offered ſacrifice to God. By faith</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God, obeyed God, and did the things that God commanded,</hi> verſe 7. And ſo <hi>by faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was called, yielded to God.</hi> So <hi>by faith believers wrought righteouſneſs, and did wonderfull things, ſubdued Kingdomes, &amp;c.</hi> They were able to work wonderful effects; ſo that when a man hath not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94114:61"/>
works, when he doth not obey God through the power of faith, he hath not faith it ſelf</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Good works are neceſſary by neceſſity of ſigns; they are not only to be in a Believer as effects, but as proofs of his faith; for a man muſt juſtifie his faith by his works; they are ſignes and proofs whereby he may know whether his faith be true, and of the right ſtamp or no; for if a mans faith be a lively faith, a faith that doth juſtifie, though in the act of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation it be alone, yet in exiſtency it is not alone, but it hath good works together with it, as ſigns and marks of the ſame; as 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6. <hi>If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lye, and doe not the truth.</hi> Hereby we may know that we are deceived; we may think we have faith, and ſo fellowſhip together with him; yet if we walk in darkneſſe, we may know we lye; for this could not be if we had fellow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hip with God. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that ſaith I know him, and keepeth not his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, is a lyar.</hi> If a man ſhould once think that he knows God with the knowledge of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet keeps not the commandements of God, by this very thing he may know that he is a lyar. <hi>Hereby ſhall all men know ye are my diſciples, if ye love one another,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; and as it is a ſign to others, ſo it is a ſign to a mans own ſelf; <hi>Hereby we know that we are paſſed from death to life, if we love the Brethren.</hi> He ſets down one good work in ſtead of all other; if we bring forth the works of new obedience, and if our hearts be purged of God, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we bring forth the fruits of holineſs, this is a ſigne we have faith; for faith makes a man to chooſe God for his God, and raiſes a man up to ſee him to be the chiefeſt good of all and to ſee all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in him, and a ſupply of all the good we need in him, and ſo it makes a man to love God, and by love to doe the works of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Good works are neceſſary alſo by neceſſity of commandement, not onely to be effects and ſignes of faith, but they are alſo ſuch things as are commanded of God; God hath commanded good works, <hi>that we ſhould walk in all holineſs of converſation, to be holy as he is holy, that we ſhould be holy in our carriages and behaviour,</hi> Tit. 3.8. The ſame God that commands us to believe, commands us to maintain good works, as we may ſee there; we ſee that Miniſters are to urge people, and maintaine it againſt all gainſayers, that there is a neceſſity of good works, and that the Lord will have us to go on in them; for faith through the Object of it, as it juſtifies, is the promiſe of God in Chriſt for forgiveneſs of ſins; yet faith in it ſelfe looks upon the whole word of God, and looks whatſoever it ſeeth joyned together by that, it joynes together of it ſelf; as the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Commandements are bound together by an inviolable knot, ſo faith joynes them together; it cannot take the promiſes of God, but it muſt take the commandements of God alſo; faith looks upon God, and as it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to be gracious, whereby it comes to have faith to rely upon him, ſo alſo it ſeeth him to be holy, a God that is ſevere againſt ſin, and hateth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs; ſo that it is neceſſary that works be together with faith, for the commandement and nature of God require it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They are neceſſary alſo by neceſſity of end; for God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained his people to this end, <hi>that they ſhould bring forth good works.</hi> Eph. 2.10. <hi>We are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt to good works, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> We are created in Chriſt Jeſus, not onely that we ſhould be ſaved, but that we ſhould bring forth good works. Now good works are neceſſary by neceſſity of end in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt to this end, To glorifie God in the world; <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 5.16. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Having our converſation honeſt amongſt the Gentiles, that whereas they ſpeak againſt you
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94114:62"/>
as evil doers, &amp;c.</hi> For when a Chriſtian that profeſſeth he believes in God and Jeſus Chriſt, is plentiful in all manner of good works, this ſtops the mouth of all gainſayers: You know Piety and Religion is hated in the world, the Goſpel finds oppoſition among men. Now when thoſe that are Profeſſors are looſe and licentious in their lives, this opens their mouths againſt the truth; but when our lives and converſations hold forth Jeſus Chriſt, as we take up the profeſſion of his holy name, ſo they are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his will, they are juſt, and holy, and righteous, and good; this makes men think in their conſcience this is of God; this ſtops their mouths that they cannot rail at the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are neceſſary to doe good to others, and convert others, as the Apoſtle inſtanceth in women that believe, if they be zealous of good works, if they be chaſt, and humble, and meek, and diſcreet; by this means they may be inſtruments to convert their husbands that believe not, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. The Lord looks that his people, all that believe in him, ſhould be fruitful in good works, that they may winne and gaine others to the faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another end is to purifie our ſelves; for it is vertue that muſt throw out vice; we are all borne by nature filthy and unclean, and full of noyſome luſts, and the way to expel theſe is by the contrary vertues, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Seeing you have purified your ſoules by obeying the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Another end is to qualifie us for Heaven; we cannot be qualified for the Kingdome of heaven unleſs we be holy and godly in Chriſt Jeſus, except we have our converſations honeſt as becometh Saints; for though it be faith that entitles a man to the Kingdome of Heaven, and gives a man right to the Kingdome of God; yet holineſſe and conformity to the minde of God, and the image of God, is that which doth fit and qualifie a man for to enter into the Kindome of God; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, you can in no wiſe enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Though it be true, we are ſaved by grace, and ſo good works have no cauſality, no proper effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in our ſalvation; yet notwithſtanding they are a cauſe <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> without them there can be no ſalvation; we cannot enter into Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, except we be humble, and meek, and lowly; except we fear God, and be according to his minde in all things in ſome meaſure, we cannot enter into his Kingdom. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> A man cannot be admitted to the Beatifical Viſion of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be pure in heart; and he cannot enjoy the Kingdome of grace nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here unleſs he be pure in heart, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 13. It is impoſſible we ſhould enter into Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by having actual poſſeſſion of it, except we be holy and fitted for it, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. It is impoſſible that drunkards, and unclean perſons ſhould have ſociety with the bleſſed Trinity, with the eternal God, with the Spirit of holineſſe, to dwell with them for evermore; we muſt be made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, To proportion our Reward; for though we are ſaved only by grace, yet God doth proportion our reward, according to the multitude, and zeal, and fervency of our good works; for Gods Covenant is a remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating Covenant; for mercy doth not conſiſt only in the pardoning of a man, but alſo in the ſanctifying of a man, and the inclining of a mans heart to new obedience, that there may be remuneration; for though God doth not reward people for their works, yet according to their works he doth. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. <hi>He that ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap ſparingly, &amp;c.</hi> Though a man be a Believer, and a godly man, if he be ſparing in his godlineſs, he ſhall fare
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94114:62"/>
accordingly, and if he be abundant in the work of the Lord, he ſhall reap abundantly; for as there are differences and degrees of torments to the wicked, ſo there be degrees in the Kingdom of God, and in glory, and the Lord doth reward his people according to their works.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Good works are neceſſary by neceſſity of thankfulneſs; it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we having received the forgiveneſs of our ſins, and God being pleaſed to be our God, and to deliver us from the wrath to come, and the power of Satan, that we ſhould be thankful for theſe mercies; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.19. <hi>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, and be thankeful, Col.</hi> 1.15. When <hi>David</hi> had conſidered what the Lord had done for his ſoul, ſaith he, <hi>what ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> as ſoon as ever God hath been good to a man to open his eyes, to let him ſee his damned eſtate and condition, and to let him have hope, and comfort, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in him, concerning deliverance from it, and beſtowing upon him his heavenly Kingdom and glory, it cannot be but the ſoul muſt be thankful; <hi>what ſhall I do unto the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> you know there is nothing that we can do back again for theſe benefits, except we will praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him, by living unto him and not unto our ſelves; therefore when the Pſalmiſt had reckoned up the benefits of God to <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 105.46. he concludes that they may keep his ſtatutes and obſerve his Laws.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Here we ſee how horribly the Papiſts wrong us when they ſay we <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> do not teach people good works, and therefore nickname us, and call us Solifidians, whereas we maintain a neceſſity of them, and as great a neceſſity of them as they; only we beat down the merit of them, that no man may think to be ſaved by works; as a reverend Divine Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> ſaid, we teach people holineſs and righteouſneſs, and good works, as if there were no way to be ſaved but by good works; and again, we teach that there muſt be as much hanging upon the grace of God, as if we could ſhew no more to be ſaved then the vileſt drunkard or adulterer; all our righteouſneſs is as a menſtruous cloth, and it is Gods mercy that any of us have an heart to do good; you ſee how the world runs after their hearts luſts, and every man is of this diſpoſition; and it is Gods grace and mercy to incline any mans heart to walk in that way that tends to his heavenly Kingdom: and if God ſhould not be infinitely gracious to pardon us for our beſt doings, they would riſe up in judgement againſt us; God might condemn us for all our prayert and performances.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This teacheth Miniſters how to preach to people, to call upon <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> them that they have an operative faith, not only to believe, but to have a faith that may be fruitful, and make their lives not to barren in obedience; and to be abundant in the works of the Lord and to ſerve him, and fear him, and glorifie him in the world; as the Apoſtle having ſhewed how Chriſt gave himſelf for us, to purchaſe to himſelf a people zealous of good works, ſaith he, <hi>theſe things ſpeak, Tit.</hi> 2.14, 15. We muſt ſpeak theſe things, and rebuke our hearers with all authority; rebuke evil workers, and tell them they turn the grace of Chriſt into wantonneſs, they trample the blood of the Covenant under their feet, and kick at the ſpirit of grace, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue the meaning of the Covenant of God in Chriſt, and rend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off that they cannot enter into life; <hi>for no man without holineſs ſhall ſee God</hi>: Miniſters ſhould tell people plainly, and affirm conſtantly, that unleſs they bring forth good fruit they ſhall be caſt into the fire; and that without holineſs they cannot have licenſe and diſpenſation to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; for God is an holy God, and our faith is an holy faith, and the promiſes are made to none but thoſe that lead an holy and a godly life; we muſt preach theſe things, and reprove with all Authority, and let people know that are looſe Chriſtians, and Hell-hounds, that if they do

not depart from iniquity, they ſhall ſee God as a Judge to condemn them for evermore.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive </seg>1</label> Firſt, They are for ſigns, to ſhew us what eſtate and condition we are in; we may know what eſtate and condition we are in by our carriage and converſation; whither it be earthly or heavenly, holy or prophane, ſo is our condition either happy or damned.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are ſigns of a mans election, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. this is a ſign and a badge, and a token whereby we may know that we are veſſels of honour, if we be ſanctified and made meet for our maſters uſe, and furniſhed and prepared for every good work; if we do not deny all ungodly luſts, and live righteouſly and ſoberly in this preſent world, we have rather badges and tokens of reprobation then election; we cannot ſay that God hath appointed us to attain ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, but have rather marks of hell and deſtruction upon us; and what is the reaſon that men that profeſs Chriſt, do ſo much queſtion their election? no wonder when we are ſo ſcanty in our holineſs and obedience to God, and ſo backward to do good; there is no nickling of Gods everlaſting favour breaking out, whereas if we were plentiful in good works, it would break forth as the Sun out of a cloud.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are ſigns of effectual calling, <hi>Jude</hi> 1. if a man be called of God, he is ſanctified alſo and kept in an holy courſe; preſerved in Chriſt. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>you are an holy Nation, a peculiar people, to ſhew forth the vertues
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94114:63"/>
of him that hath called you,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. ſo that we may be ſure that we yet abide in darkneſs, and are under the power of ſin and Satan; if we have not given over our ſinful courſes, and conformed our ſelves to the Goſpel of God, we were never called according to Gods purpoſe, but lie under the wrath of Heaven to this day; it is holineſs and righteouſneſs that is a ſign of our effectuall calling.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They are ſigns of juſtification alſo; as the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>but you are waſhed, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. you ſee if we be juſtified, we are alſo ſanctified; ſo 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, &amp;c.</hi> We have not one drop of the blood of Chriſt ſprinkled upon our ſouls by Gods eternal ſpirit through faith, unleſs we walk in the light, and bring forth the works of the light.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They are ſigns of adoption, <hi>John</hi> 8.39. <hi>If you were</hi> Abrahams <hi>children, you would bring forth the works of</hi> Abraham; ſo if we were Gods children, we would do the works of God, the will of God: The Apoſtle having ſpoken of the adoption of Saints, <hi>behold what love the Father hath ſhewed to us, &amp;c.</hi> preſently he tells us that holineſs and righteouſneſs follows from hence; <hi>he that hath this hope purifieth himſelf, as he is pure.</hi> So <hi>Rom</hi> 8.14. <hi>As many are led by the ſpirit of God, are the ſons of God</hi>; this is an infallible ſign, if we be the ſons of God, we are led by the ſpirit of God; ſo that we have no mark that we are the children of God, but rather of the Divel, unleſſe we walk in pureneſſe of converſation from day to day.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They are the marks of our love to God, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>if you love me, keep my commandements,</hi> John 14.15. we love not God except we keep his commandments; as ever you would be able to ſay in truth you love me, keep my commandments; look that you yield not to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, look that you renounce the Divel and all his works; I will conclude you love me not at all, if you keep not my commandments; and he that loves not Chriſt, let him be Anathema Maranatha, ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider this, that the reaſon why we cannot pray better is <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive </seg>2</label> becauſe we are no more abundant in good works; not only becauſe we want faith, but becauſe we want good works; for certainly this is a great help to prayer, a great ſupport to the ſoul, a great encouragement to go to the Throne of grace, and a great ſign that God means to hear a man when God hath given him an heart to fear him, and love him, and make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his wayes; as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.22. <hi>Whatſoever we aske we receive of him, becauſe we keep his commandments, and do the things pleaſing in his ſight:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, when we go to God, and intreat him to be merciful to us, and intreat ſuch and ſuch favours that we ſtand in need of; <hi>we know that we ſhall receive them, becauſe we keep his commandments.</hi> Theſe are admirable ſupports to hold up the hands to the Throne of grace, and to make us importunate in prayer, and confident, becauſe we know God hath poured forth his gracious good will and pleaſure into our hearts, and hath given us a mark he loves us, and beares us good will indeed. Why can we pray no better, our hands are weake and our knees feeble; there is no power in our ſupplications to the Almighty, the ſpirit of grace is departed from us; why the ſpirit of holineſs is gone; there is the reaſon of it, when people are looſe and do not mortifie their luſts, when they are not abundant in following God, in fearing God, and ſerving God, and obeying the commandments of God, they cannot have confidence at the Throne of grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider this would be a great chearing and rejoycing in the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive </seg>3</label> evil day; whatſoever afflictions come upon us in this world, if we can
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94114:64"/>
carry letters teſtimonial in our own conſcience, that we do ſerve God with a pure conſcience in this world; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. God knows what evil may befal us before we are a little older, what temptations may await us, what diſtreſſes and calamities may fall upon us; happy are we if we have the teſtimony of a good conſcience, that we walk in the wayes of God, and fear him, and love thoſe things that are beloved of God; if we love his children, his Ordinances, his glory, and are tender of it; a good conſcience tender of the commandments of God and his wayes, is the beſt comfort a man can have in the world, ſetting aſide his faith in God; and this is an evidence of his faith too; how can we tell what may be? may be the beſt of us may come to <hi>Davids</hi> paſs; you know how he was put to it once in the time of his miſery and affliction he was fain to look if he could ſee an honeſt life and converſation, whither he had pleaſed God: ſaith he, <hi>I communed with my ſpirit, and made diligent ſearch, Pſal.</hi> 77.6. How have I pleaſed God, and followed God? what manner of life have I led? he ranſacked all his life and converſation, and would be glad to ſee he had done the things pleaſing to God; it would be more comfort then if all the Angels in heaven had ſpoken comfort; ſo temptations or afflictions may be upon us, that we would be glad to ſee ſigns and tokens of Gods favour in ſanctifying our hearts, and making us to be obedient to his will, and tremble at his word; and if we cannot ſee theſe things, woe unto us, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.19. <hi>charge them that be rich in the world, that they be not high-minded, &amp;c.</hi> So we do not know what times may come, we had need lay a good foundation for comfort againſt the time to come, and charge rich men that they be rich in good works; charge all Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all that deſire to ſtad in the evil day, to be rich in good works, and abound in them, and lay up in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Conſider that your want of obedience and good works is the cauſe of all Gods temporal judgements, why God doth ſtop the bottles of Heaven, and turns the Earth into duſt, and parcheth our Corn; we ſee God hath begun the plague among us in the principal place of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; wherefore is all this? ſee what the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.3. <hi>therefore have the ſhowers been withholden, becauſe you have been wicked; thou haſt an whores forehead, and refuſeſt to be aſhamed</hi>; thy careleſſeneſs and barrenneſs under the means of grace, thy impenitency and hardneſs of heart, theſe have cauſed the ſhowers to be withholden, and have made God to deny the former and latter rain.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point is this,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctrine.</hi> The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace requires per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect works.</note> As the Covenant of grace requires works, ſo it requires perfect works; he tells the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> that he looks for works, and perfect works, but cannot find them; ſo that the ſecond Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires perfect works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Objection.</note>But you will ſay, how can that be? <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf that was as forward a man, and had as perfect works as any man, yet he confeſſeth he was not perfect, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. ſo likewiſe here we know but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not yet come; in the world to come it may come. <hi>Heb</hi> 12. there we read of the ſpirits of juſt and perfect men; then men are made perfect, but they are not perfect in this life.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 'tis true, therefore there is a double perfection. Firſt, A perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of degrees, to be perfectly perfect, and ſo no man can be perfect by any perfection inherent; indeed the Covenant of works requires this perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but the Covenant of grace doth not; indeed when we come to glory, there ſhall be this perfection, but not in this life; in this life the Lord only ſubdues our ſins, but caſts them not into the bottom of the Sea til the life to come; therefore this perfection cannot be looked for upon earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:94114:64"/>Therefore ſecondly, There is another perfection, and that is a perfection by way of ſincerity and uprightneſſe. <hi>Job.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Job was a perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man.</hi> Now this perfection differs from the other five wayes; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection God requires in the Goſpel from that in the Law.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Law ſtands upon performances, as well as the will and deſire:<note place="margin">The difference between Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and a man is not perfect, unleſſe he perform all as well as deſire to doe it; But now the perfection of the Goſpel is without theſe performances, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that man labours for as many performances as he can, but it may be onely by deſires, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Paul</hi> was perfect by Evangelical Perfection, he was upright before God, yet he could not reach performances; no, he had a will to be good, he did unfeignedly deſire to be godly, and ſerve God in every thing unfeignedly, endeavouring after godly courſes, yet could not attain to that which he did deſire. So it was with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and all the good people of God, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.11. <hi>O Lord, I beſeech thee let thine ear be attentive to the prayers of thy ſervants who deſire to fear thy name.</hi> He could hardly ſay that he did perform it, but he did deſire it; he could hardly ſay he did love, and obey God, and doe his will, but this he would ſay, he did deſire to doe it, and unfeignedly deſire it; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.21. <hi>He that followeth after righteouſneſſe and mercy, findeth life.</hi> He doth not ſay, he that reacheth it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cannot reach it may be, but he that followeth after it ſhall have life; it is a ſign that he hath the life of juſtification, and that he ſhall have the life of glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The perfection of the Law it ſtands upon quantities as well as upon qualities &amp; truth; it is not ſatisfied though a man be never ſo truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and religious, unleſs man hath quantities, and is ſo much holy: But now the perfection of the Goſpel, indeed it will have as much quantity as a man can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet it will ſtand with truth; though a man hath not that quantity of humiliation and ſelf-denial, and power againſt ſin, yet if he have it in truth, he is Evangelically perfect in ſome meaſure, he is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and upright before God; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of his Father, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.6. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Father had great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth.</hi> He doth not ſay he walked before thee in legal perfection, he was perfectly righteous; but he was truly righteous, he was humble in truth, and godly in truth, and zealous in truth; he had none of all theſe things to the utmoſt, yet he walked before thee in truth. So <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Fear the Lord, and ſerve him in ſincerity and truth.</hi> He doth not ſay, ſerve him as if you ſhould doe every thing he commands; but doe it in truth and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now ſincerity is, when there is no commandement but a man ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to doe it; there is no ſin but he labours to avoid it, and there is no right manner, but he ſets himſelf to doe it in the right manner to his power; this is the perfection of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The perfection of the Law ſtands upon full meaſure; whether a man have power or no, that is nothing to the purpoſe; the law will have all holineſs and righteouſneſs, whether a man hath power or no: But now the perfection of the Goſpel by way of ſincerity, it looks at what meaſure God hath given and beſtowed, and no more but what God hath given and enabled a man to doe; as you may ſee the Lord doth not require the gain of ten talents, when he gave but five, nor the gain of five when he gave but two; the widows two mites were accepted, and taken for a good and ſincere gift, becauſe ſhe gave all that ſhe had, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.4. as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be firſt a willing minde, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that a man hath not.</hi> The law will have perfection whether a man hath power or no, or elſe it will damn a man; but in the Goſpel a man may ſay as <hi>Peter</hi> to the lame man, <hi>Silver and gold have I none, but ſuch as I have, that give I thee.</hi> Lord, ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,

and ſuch parts and gifts have I not, but ſuch as I have, that give I thee; according to that meaſure of knowledge I have, according to that grace I have, I will give it thee: If a man can ſay thus, he is accepted, not according to that he hath not, but according to that he hath; as it was in the law of <hi>Moſes, Levit.</hi> 5.6, 7. <hi>A treſpaſſe-offering ſhould be a lamb or a kid; but if a man were not able to give that, then two turtle doves, or two young pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons; if he be not able to give that, let him give two or three handfuls of fine flowre,</hi> Levit. 5.11. So <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.20. <hi>Let him give according as he can get, he ſhall be accepted according to that.</hi> This is the perfection of the Goſpel; according to the help and aſſiſtance God gives a man, and according to the means God afford<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a man, it ſhall be accepted.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The perfection of the law admits of no failings; if a man fails, no matter though it be out of infirmity, the law condemns him, the law requires perfection without failings; but the perfection of the Goſpel, by way of ſincerity admits of failings; as the beſt gold hath his allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo it is with a true Chriſtian; he may be ſincere and upright, though he hath a thouſand failings; as it is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.5. <hi>He did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord in all things, but onely in the matter of</hi> Uriah. That indeed would not ſtand with ſincerity, his ſincerity was quite in a ſwoun then: that could not ſtand with ſincerity; if he had gone on to ſin in that faſhion, he could not have been ſincere; but in all other things he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord. You will ſay he had a thouſand failings, yet ſaith the Text, they all ſtood with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; he numbred the people, and God was mightily angry with him, and you know how unjuſt he was in the matter of <hi>Zibah</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth</hi>; you know how he told a lye to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and was the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the death of the Prieſts of the Lord; you know how he counterfeited himſelf mad, and he had horrible diſorders in his family, and had loſt the power of controul over his children; were not theſe horrible failings? and what a company of Wives and Concubines had he? yet all theſe ſtood with ſincerity, becauſe they were either done out of ignorance, or want of due conſideration ſometimes, or through humane frailty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, or through violence of temptation, contrary to his conſtant courſe, and intendment and purpoſe; they might all ſtand with ſincerity and an upright heart according to the perfection of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The perfection of the Law makes nothing of repentance; if you break the commandements of God, if you ſhed tears of blood, and repent your heart out, what cares the law? the law will have perfect obedience, or elſe to hell you ſhall. But now in the perfection of the Goſpel, repentance is a great matter; nay, if a man be never ſo vile and wretched, if yet he humble himſelfe before God, and be unfeignedly ſorry for ſinning againſt God, this is a great matter; this man is an upright man, that is unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly humbled and abaſed before God; <hi>The ſacrifice of God is a broken ſpirit, a broken and contrite heart thou ſhalt not deſpiſe.</hi> This is the voyce of the Goſpel. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins, and do that which is lawful and right,</hi> he ſhall ſurely live he ſhall not die. As it is <hi>Job</hi> 23.27, 28. <hi>He looked upon men, and if any ſaid I have ſinned, he will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his ſoule from going down into the pit.</hi> In the Goſpel a man is an upright man, if he come before the throne of grace with ſhame and confuſion of face for all his ſins, with unfeigned ſorrow that he hath broken Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; if he hath never ſo many failings, if he ſet himſelfe to pleaſe God, and when he fails, he repents, and humbles himſelf before God, this man hath the perfection of the Goſpel. Thus we ſee the meaning of the words, <hi>Perfect before God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The point of Doctrine is this,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Every man ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> That every man is to labour to be perfect,

that is the thing that God will require, and enquire after at the laſt day, whether we be upright. You ſee this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 7, 8. and ſo likewiſe in other places of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Reaſon is from the nature of God, with whom we have to doe,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> he is upright; therefore it concerns us to labour to be like him; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is an upright God, and there is no unrighteouſneſs in him, his wayes are perfect, and his judgments are truth; therefore if a man be not perfect, he cannot be like him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Be perfect as your heavenly Father is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> we know his ſpirit is the ſpirit of truth, himſelfe is the God of truth, his Son is the way, the truth, and the life, he is the faithful witneſs; and as God is upright, ſo he looks that his ſervants ſhould ſhew what Maſter they ſerve, that they may make it appear that their Maſter is an upright Maſter, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 92. <hi>ult.</hi> to ſhew forth that the Lord is upright; This is our duty; God is upright, and Chriſt is upright; and therefore we ſhould follow his ſteps, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God hath commanded us to be ſincere; though he remit from the firſt Covenant of abſolute and perfect righteouſneſs and holineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, ye he will have his people truly fearing him, and hating ſin, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal in obedience, that they ſhall be from the bottome of their hearts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of him; therefore this ſtung <hi>David</hi> to the heart when he committed ſin: O thought he, <hi>Thou deſireſt truth in the inward parts,</hi> Pſal. 51.6. As who ſhould ſay, thou lookeſt into the heart, thou requireſt truth of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; O what a falſe heart have I had in this buſineſſe! God hath many worſhippers in this world, ſuch as they are; but God cares for none, but ſuch as deale faithfully in his Covenant; as Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 4.24.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God knows our hearts; therefore though we ſerve him, and do duties to him; though we call upon his name, hear his Word, come to his Table, obſerve his Sabbaths, keep his Ordinances; yet if we doe not doe theſe things in truth, his eyes are ever upon our boſomes, he caſts his eyes upon the ſecrets of men; if our hearts be rotten, and proud, and vaine, and looſe, and filthy; if our hearts be not of a right frame, all is nothing; if there be any way of wickedneſſe in us, if there be any ſecret ſins, or curſed corruptions that we favour our ſelves in; if there be any falſe way we ſecre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly haunt, the Lord ſhall ſearch it out, for the knowes the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of our hearts; therefore it becomes us to be upright; as he ſaith of <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 5.3. <hi>I know Ephraim, he is not hid from us.</hi> So if we preach never ſo zealouſly, and doe not according to our preaching, the Lord knows us; ſo if we hear never ſo zealouſly, and doe not practice what we hear, he knows it; therefore it concerns us to be upright.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the Lord will let down the Covenant no lower. Now God hath been pleaſed to moderate the firſt Covenant, which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to keep, and hath brought it down to the Covenant of faith, to believe, and to be ſincere in all our wayes; this God requires, and will let it down no lower. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.8. the Lord ſaith there, <hi>Surely they are my people, children that will not lye; and ſo he was their Saviour.</hi> So he requires his people ſhould be children that ſhould not lye, and be baſe-hearted, and deal deceitfully and crookedly in his Covenant; he was their Saviour, ſo they would be children that would not lye. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.24. <hi>Grace be with all them that love Chriſt in ſincerity.</hi> There is no man is under the Covenant of grace, unleſſe he be ſincere in all the will of God in Jeſus Chriſt: There are two things the Covenant of grace gives; the one is the forgiveneſſe of ſins; the other is a ſincere heart; if a man hath not theſe two, he is yet in his ſins; as we may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Examples of all the Saints in all Ages; all the people of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94114:66"/>
God that ever were upright, to begin with <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6.9. The text ſaith, <hi>he was a juſt and perfect man in his generation.</hi> You know it was in a corrupt time, all the Earth had corrupted their wayes; no queſtion a man that was religious in thoſe dayes, he could not chuſe but be ſcorned and derided; but what cared he? he would be a juſt man, and was perfect in his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though it were a devilliſh generation, yet he was an upright man, and would not doe as the world did, but he would draw near to God, and walk with him from day to day. So it is ſaid of <hi>Job, Job.</hi> 1.2. <hi>That he was an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and perfect man</hi>; though <hi>Job</hi> lived in a blind corner out of the Church, and ſetting aſide 304, generally the whole Countrey were Heathens and Pagans, and he was as an Owl in the Deſart; yet he would not doe as the world did, but keep himſelf to God. So <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6. Zachary <hi>and</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth <hi>were both righteous before God, &amp;c.</hi> You know the times were then very bad, and all the devotion that went for currant, was nothing but to be zealous of humane inventions and traditions, and worſhipping God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the imaginations of men; this was the holineſs of the world, yet the Text ſaith this man and his wife would be righteous before God, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the Ordinances of God blameleſs; not in the Ordinances of the Scribes and Phariſees, but they were righteous before God, and walked in all the Ordinances of God blameleſs.</p>

Many fathers we have among us, but a faithful father who ſhall finde, that doth diſcharge his duty towards his children? ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Maſters we may finde; but who carries himſelf towards his ſervants as he ought to doe? ſo we have many in place of Authority, that might ſtand for God, and hinder ſin, and doe ſome good in their places; but a faithful man who ſhall finde, but here one, and there one, rare birds, and they are the offſcouring of the world, and are hated; and mocked, and perſecuted? ſo we have a great many that have gotten a great deal of light, God hath awakened their conſciences, and made them ſee their miſerable condition; but a faithful man that doth diſcharge a good conſcience in that place wherein he is, that carries himſelf uprightly under the means of grace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Word, under the preaching of it, under Gods Ordinances, ſuch a man where ſhall we finde? as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 12.1. <hi>Help Lord, &amp;c.</hi> He had occaſion, through the perſecution of <hi>Saul,</hi> to travel thorough the moſt of the Towns of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all were ſo looſe and licentious, and carnall, and worldly, and ſerving the times, and pleaſing and humouring the Court; he ſaw the Countrey ſo empty of goodneſs, that he prayeth <hi>Help Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and as the Lord ſaith: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.21. <hi>How is the faithful City become an Harlot? &amp;c.</hi> So we may ſay, How is the faithful City become an harlot? a faithful Town, that hath had the Word ſincerely taught, that hath had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

I doe not ſpeak of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> but of the Church of God; the faithful are diminiſhed from among the ſons of men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe <hi>2.</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> This may ſerve to humble the beſt of all Gods children, it may ſerve to aſhame us before God, to think what a deal of corruption is in our hearts; if <hi>David</hi> might complain of himſelf, how much more may we? <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou doſt require truth in the inward parts,</hi> Pſal. 51.6. As who ſhould ſay, Lord how far am I from it? who would ever have thought that <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſhould ſo play faſt and looſe, that ever he ſhould ſo abaſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> his faithful ſervant, that ever he ſhould ſo abuſe <hi>Bathſheba</hi> that good woman, and bring her to ſin? If <hi>David</hi> himſelf may thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; how much more may we complain and loath our ſelves for the deal of rottenneſs that is in our hearts! O what windings and fetches are there! <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf ſaith, I can hardly tell when to believe my own heart; ſo I ſay, what a company of windings, and turnings, and tricks, and ſtarting-holes are there in the hearts of Gods people? ſometimes we are ready to think we have the good we have not; and what evaſions have we to put off any good duty, if we have not a minde to doe it? what put offs, what tricks to ſlip our neck out of the collar if we doe not like it? what a company of deceits are in the heart? So what a company of ſlights to doe evil? ſuch a company of blindings, and beſottings, and carnal reaſons; and fooliſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as if we did well in doing it, whereas it is but the falſeneſs of our hearts? As Mr. <hi>Hearn</hi> ſaith, It is better for a man to be delivered up to the Devil, then to his own heart. We read of a man delivered up to Satan, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, and yet we read that that man was brought home again; but we never read of any man brought home that was delivered up to the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his own heart; therefore if God hath made us ſee the falſeneſſe of our own hearts, and made us humble our ſelves before him for it, and made us to endeavour more and more after ſincerity; what a mercy of God is this? but the people of God have cauſe to complain of the falſeneſs of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Is it ſo that we muſt be upright, then let this ſerve to exhort us that we would be upright more and more; for this is that which the Lord doth look for and eſpecially look for: What though we ſhould do things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good for the matter; yet if we do them not with an upright heart, all is nothing, though the children of <hi>Judah</hi> faſted, and that for 70 years together, four times in a year they ſought the Lord extraordinarily; yet becauſe they did not ſeek him thoroughly, he did not count it, ſincerely done, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.4, 5. As who ſhould ſay, <hi>You did not faſt unto me.</hi> Doubtleſs they themſelves thought they were very religious; what not only to doe the duties of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but to doe extraordinary duties, no queſtion they thought this was very much; yet every one were caſt off, becauſe their hearts were not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before him. <hi>Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ziah,</hi> the Text ſaith, <hi>did thoſe things that were good in the eyes of the Lord</hi>; yet the Text makes this exception againſt him, <hi>that it was not with an upright heart,</hi> 2 Chron. 25.2.</p>
                  <p>Conſider firſt, That God delights only in an upright heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.20. <hi>They that are of a froward heart are an abomination to the Lord; but thoſe that are upright in their wayes are his delight.</hi> Upright Prayer, and upright hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word, and upright Preaching of it, upright walking in a mans Family, and upright carriage in a mans converſation, when a man carries
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94114:67"/>
himſelf uprightly in all his wayes, this man is a delight to God, as he ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. <hi>I can look over heaven and earth, but at him will I look that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth at my Word.</hi> The prayer of the upright is his delight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. When a man can make faithful pleas to the throne of grace for mercy, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleas that God would pardon him, faithful pleas that God would enable him, and accept him, and he doth not make theſe pleas falſly, but his own heart can ſay, there is no ſin, but he ſets himſelfe againſt it, and there is no commandement but he ſets himſelf to obey it; but the ſacrifice of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is an abomination to him, he cannot abide it; let them pray a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand prayers, God abhors their prayers, if they have not upright hearts. So 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.17. ſee what <hi>David</hi> ſaith; as who ſhould ſay, <hi>Lord, thou haſt pleaſure in uprightneſs</hi>; and then certainly thou haſt ſome pleaſure in me; <hi>for with an upright heart, and in the ſincerity of my ſoule have I ſought thee.</hi> Now on the contrary, if a man be not upright before God, if a man have a looſe converſation, and he be not ſincere, the Lord abhors that man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider that this is the totall ſumme of all that God requires in the Covenant of grace, that they ſhould be upright and faithful in his Covenant; as when he made his Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.1. he ſaith, <hi>Walk before me, and be upright.</hi> This is that God requires, <hi>and he would be an Almighty God unto him, and bleſs him, and do him good to all generations,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24. It is the ſaying of <hi>Samuel</hi> to the people, <hi>Only fear the Lord, and walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with an upright heart.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, this is the onely thing, and God requires no more; if God had required more, he might lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have done it; if he had required the fulfilling of the Law to the utmoſt rigour, he might have done it; but this is the onely thing that God doth ſtand upon, that we ſhould be upright before him; he doth not look that we ſhould be Angels upon earth, but that we ſhould be ſincere, and not goe a whoring from him wittingly and willingly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider, The leaſt faith, the leaſt grace and goodneſs, if it be with uprightneſs, is better then all the goodly performances of the whole world; God liked more of the poor womans two mites, then of all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance that the Scribes and Phariſees caſt into the Treaſury; <hi>And he that gives a cup of cold water to a Prophet, in the name of a Prophet, ſhall not loſe his reward</hi>: Therefore you ſhall ſee many poore beggarly things, over thoſe things that other men have done, have been accepted; whereas the building of Hoſpitals and Colledges have been rejected; though a man have but a little knowledge, as many of the Martyrs hardly knew how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sacraments there were; yet having uprightneſs, died at ſtake; ſo if a man have but a little faith with ſincerity, it ſhall paſs, when a thouſand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous fools ſhall goe to hell.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider, God will wink at manifold and grievous faults, ſo there be ſincerity and uprightneſs. <hi>Aſa</hi> his faults were horrible faults, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.14. yet his heart was perfect: What a company of faults had he? what an horrible failing was this that he ſhould caſt the very Prophet of God into priſon that reproved him? Now God anſwers, he had his failings, and horrible ones; yet he was a good man, for his heart was upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. <hi>Aſa</hi> was not himſelfe in that buſineſſe; <hi>Aſa</hi> was not <hi>Aſa</hi> then; his heart was upright with the Lord. So good <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> a man that was grievouſly beſmeared with corruptions and infirmities, and thoſe no ſmall ones; how fearfully did he marry his daughters into a moſt devilliſh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as if he had no fear of God before his eyes? he married them to the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and another time he helped the enemies of the Lord, and loved them that hated the Lord; I know not how he was hooked in to joyn with <hi>Ahab,</hi> and goe up to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi>; and when he had done this, and had humbled himſelfe for this, he did it again, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.7. And the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94114:67"/>
he wrought was not thorough, as it ought to have been; yet ſaith the Text, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19.3. <hi>There are good things in thee</hi>; becauſe he was upright, the Lord was pleaſed to accept him; nay, I will tell you more, look upon the people at the Paſſeover in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> what a company of people came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to keep the Paſſeover, and came horribly unprepared? the Text ſaith, they were not prepared according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was a grievous thing; yet the Text ſaith, the Lord heard the prayers of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> for them, becauſe they prepared their hearts to ſeeke the Lord; they did endeavour to grieve and be aſhamed for their failings and want of preparation; now on the other ſide, what goodly men doth God reject, not being upright and ſincere? as <hi>Jehu,</hi> what a glorious King was he? I warrant all the good people of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> bleſſed God that ever he fate upon the Throne; what to root out <hi>Baal,</hi> and to deſtroy all the Idolatrous Prieſts, and to be zealous in it? <hi>come and ſee my zeal for the Lord</hi>; theſe were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things; yet the Lord doth diſcharge him, and would have none of him, becauſe he was not upright: Look upon the Scribes and Phariſees, the noneſuches, and mirrours of their times; that was a Proverbe in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that if but two men in the world ſhould go to Heaven, the one ſhould be a Scribe, and the other Phariſee; they were thought to be the holieſt men in the world; yet when the Lord ſaw this was not with an upright heart, he denounceth woe upon woe againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider, That if we be upright, it will help us to profit by all Gods Ordinances; take the preaching of the word; <hi>Micah</hi> 2.7. the Prophet brings in the Lord ſpeaking thus, that the word ſhall do ſuch people good; is there any man in the world that walks uprightly, that my word doth not do good unto, that it doth not comfort his heart, and quicken his ſoul to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? is it not a light unto his feet, and a Lanthorne to his paths; ſo that an upright man, when he comes to the Ordinances of God, he ſhall be the better for it; when he goes to prayer, he ſhall be the better for it; when he comes to the Sacrament, he ſhall be the better for it; all the Ordinances of God ſhall doe him good; whereas if a man have a falſe heart, the word hardens him, prayer deads him; if he come to the Sacrament, it is not for the better, but for the worſe; if he be reproved for his ſins, if he have not a ſincere heart, he is ſo much the worſe, it will do him no good, it will make his heart riſe up againſt thoſe that reprove him, and hardens his heart ſo much the more.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Conſider that if we be upright, what a deal of comfort this will be to our hearts; there is no comfort in the world comparable to the comfort of one that hath walked uprightly; as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when he had received the ſentence of death, what did comfort him? did all his wealth, and greatneſs and renown comfort him? no, <hi>but remember Lord how I have walked before thee with an upright heart</hi>; marke what he ſaith, he doth not ſay, Remember Lord how I have reformed the Church, and purged the Temple, and thrown out all the abominations in the Land, and purified the Paſſeover, and ſet the Ordinances of God in his houſe in due order's no, none of all theſe comforted his heart, but looke what he did he did with an upright heart; as who ſhould ſay, I might have done all theſe things, but if it had not been with an upright heart, it had been nothing; that which I did I did from my heart, with a fear of thy command; I ſought thee in it, and no by-ends; all my care was to approve my ſelfe before thee; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow Lord, remember this; remember the infinite goodneſſe and promiſes that thou haſt made to thoſe that are upright before thee. Nay, if thou haſt an upright heart, whatſoever troubles come upon the earth, or upon thine own ſoul, if thou beeſt caſt into priſon, or made to flie from one Country to another, I tell thee, in the midſt of all thy afflictions and troubles, if thou
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94114:68"/>
haſt an upright heart, thou ſhalt have peace and comfort, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. in the midſt of darkneſs, in the midſt of afflictions there is ſome light, ſome cranney, ſome hold, ſome comfort for the righteous; on the other ſide, if a man be not upright, what a woeful caſe is this man in; nay, though a man be upright, yet if he doe not apprehend himſelfe to be ſo, what a lamentable caſe is he in? he can have no comfort; all the skilful Phyſitians in <hi>Gilead</hi> can hardly faſten comfort upon that man; tell him of all his refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and prayers, and good duties he hath performed; O ſaith he, all this is but hypocriſie, I am ſo dead and dull, God hath not all my heart; tell him of his good deſires and purpoſes, and endeavours, he is affraid he is not right; tell him of Gods promiſes to pardon him, he ſaith, I am not ſincere, I am not upright.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If we be upright, we ſhall be bleſſed our ſelves, and not only our ſelves but our very poſterity ſhall be bleſſed; as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.2 <hi>His ſeed ſhall be mighty upon the earth</hi>; he ſpeakes of the upright, not onely himſelfe ſhall be bleſſed, but he layeth up a bleſſing for the generation that ſhall come out of his loins; ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.7. <hi>his very children are bleſſed after him</hi>; if thou ſet thy ſelfe to ſerve God uprightly with all thy heart though thou canſt not leave thy children any great outward matters, yet thou ſhalt leave them a bleſſing from Heaven; thy children ſhall fare the better for it; if we would know what ſhall become of our children, and would faine provide for them, let us be upright, and that is the way to lay up a bleſſing in ſtore for our children; now on the other ſide, if a man be not upright, he is ſo farre from treaſuring up mercy for his children, that he rather treaſures up wrath both for them and his own ſoul; nay, though a man hath been never ſuch a convert to outward appearance, never ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reformed, that all the Country admires at it; as it was the caſe of <hi>Simon M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Signes of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs.</note>Therefore firſt, Conſider, A ſincere man is univerſal in regard of all the commandements of God, he doth ſet himſelf in all his wayes, to obey God in all his ſtatutes; as we may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>6. This is an upright man, that hath reſpect to all Gods commandements; but a falſe-hearted man, may be he will do ſomething, he will pick and chooſe, and take what he likes of the commandments of God; ſome things he will doe, others he will not doe; he cannot be gotten to ſtoop to all Gods holy will, he will never yield to that; may be he will not commit adultery, but then he will drinke horribly; may be he will not ſwear, but then he will lye; if he be good in one thing, he will not be good in another; if he be diligent in his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular calling, he will be negligent in his general calling; he will not be holy and ſtrict, and one that doth walk in Gods holy Laws; a true upright man doth not deal with the commandements of God as the ſwine doth with the peaſe-cods, that will ſqueeze them, and then leave the reſt; but an upright man digeſts all the commandments of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, An upright man, he is univerſal in all graces, he is a man of all graces; for why is God ſaid to be the God of all grace? but in reſpect
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94114:68"/>
that his people have all graces in them, and he is the Author of all; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>therefore as you abound in every grace, &amp;c.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, if you be ſincere, for ſo it is in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> &amp;c. you do not ſhew your ſelves to be ſincere in your love to God and his Church, unleſs you abound in this grace and that grace, and all the graces of Gods holy ſpirit; ſo that a man muſt have all graces that is upright; there muſt be none wanting; he muſt have the whole image of God, he muſt have the whole new cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he muſt be a new creature, he muſt be endued with all the cluſter of graces, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.9. And as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. you may ſee there how all graces are concatenated and linked together, that if a man have one he muſt have all; ſuppoſe a man ſhould have faith, if he ſhould not adde to his faith vertue, what would his faith do him good? he is never the nearer, his faith cannot ſave him, he muſt adde to it vertue; and when a man hath faith, if he have not knowledge, what is zeal without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? the Apoſtle preacheth the doctrine of reprobation againſt the Jews for their zeal, when they had not knowledge; a man cannot be really ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, unleſs he hath knowledge, and doth it with wiſedom and diſcretion; now if a man had faith, and all other vertues, and were not temperate, he were a very beaſt; and if a man had all theſe, and had not patience, a man cannot poſſeſs his ſoul; though a man hath faith, yet without patience he cannot inherit the promiſes; ſo that you ſee an upright man is one that hath all graces; ſo that a man that hath not all the graces of Gods ſpirit, if he want one, he hath never a one of them; and thus it is with every man that is not right, though he may have admirable qualities and endowments of Gods bleſſed ſpirit, yet if he have not all, he is not upright; but now an upright man hath all the graces of Gods ſpirit; 'tis true, ſome of Gods children are more eminent in one grace, and ſome in another, but every child of God hath all the graces of Gods ſpirit; if a man want one, he cannot have another.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, An upright man is univerſal in regard of place, he is not onely good among good company, but good alſo among bad company; he is good out of the Church, as well as in the Church; and good at home, as well as in the ſtreets, among ſuch and ſuch; he is good abroad, as well as in his own Town; as you may ſee, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16.8. <hi>I have alwayes ſet God before m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ne eyes</hi>; an upright man whereſoever he is, he ſets God before his eyes, that he may not provoke him, nor offend him; <hi>The upright dwell in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Pſalm</hi> 140.13. you wil ſay, may be they goe an hundred miles off, but whereſoever they go they dwell in his preſence, and this makes him good in all places, now a rotten-hearted man, may be he will be good in the Church, but leaves his Religion at the Church doore; may be he will be good abroad, but he will neglect his own family; or if he be honeſt and well ordered while he is in his own Pariſh, yet let him go abroad a far off into another Town where no body knows him, may be there he will flie out; you ſhall ſee many a profeſſor, that joyns himſelf to the people of God at home, and will be drunk abroad; theſe are falſe and unſound hearts, that are not good in all places; if they be godly openly, they are not ſo ſecretly; thus it is with wicked and ungodly men, if they come among good people, they will not for ſhame drinke nor ſwill nor ſwear, nor ſpeake againſt goodneſs; but if they be among wicked people, they will ſide with them, and may be gird at the Saints of God, and give them back blows; juſt as it is with water, put it into a Tub, it will have the ſhape of a Tub, put it into a Beaker, it will have the ſhape of a Beaker; it ſtill faſhions it ſelf according to the veſſel into which it is put; but an upright man is like a ſolid thing that keeps its own figure, he is the ſame in all places.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, An upright man is univerſal in regard of time, he is good at
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94114:69"/>
all times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.3. <hi>Bleſſed is he that keeps judgement and righteouſneſs at all times</hi>; not as though a childe of God may not fall fearfully many times, but it is againſt the abſolute bent of his heart, and care and ſtudy of his ſoul; a Divine ſets it out by a ſpring between a couple of hills, it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes run, it will either run thorough thoſe lets that ſtop it, or elſe it will run over thoſe lets; it cannot ceaſe running if it be a living ſpring; ſo a godly ſincere heart is good at all times; now an unſound Chriſtian, that never had the true grace of life in his heart, he will not be good at all times, he will be good by fits and turns; when he is ſmitten at a Sermon, when he is under the rod, under a croſs, then he will fall ſoul with his ſins, and when conſcience is up, then he will be good; as a Windmill goeth as long as the wind fills the ſailes; but if the wind be down, the griſt may lie long enough till the wind blow again; but a true Chriſtian is like a good boate-man, if the wind blow he may go the better, but if the wind be down he will goe too, nay, he will labour ſo much the more; he will go though it be againſt wind and tide; ſo it is with an upright man, he is good at all times, not only when he is well, but alſo when he is ſick; he is good in proſperity, and good in adverſity; good when his conſcience is up, and good when his conſcience is not ſo ſtirring; though he wants ſome helps, and drives ſo much the more heavily, yet he ſtrives and will be good; but an ungodly heart, may be he may be good ſometimes, but it will not hold; as it is ſaid of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperour, when he was ſick, then he would be good and godly, and thought of repentance, and ſent for a Confeſſor, and would repent, and asked him Have I not repented? yes ſaith he, if it hold; but a wicked mans repentance will not hold; let God but pluck out the arrow, he will return to his old byas again, and he is never the nearer, nay, may be he is worſe then he was before.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, An upright man is univerſal in regard of parts; as Chriſt ſpeaks of his Spouſe, <hi>Thou art all fair my love, Cant.</hi> 4.7. She was all fair in all parts, and there was no ſpot in her; he doth not deny but there was failings and weakneſſes, but no ſuch ſoul ſpots as upon wicked men; ſo a godly man is all fair; his underſtanding that is teachable, and made to ſavour of the truth, and capable to be guided and informed by the ſpirit of God; you know there is rebellion in the underſtandings of men, carnal reaſons, and ſtrong holds, and haughty and proud principles of reaſoning; if they are convinced of a ſin, they will not leave it, they have reaſonings for that ſin; and if they have never ſuch convictions for a duty, there is rebellion in the underſtanding to put off this; but an upright heart, his underſtanding is good in ſome meaſure, he is unfeignedly willing to be inſtructed of God; whatſoever courſe he takes, tell him out of the word of God that it is not good, though his life depends upon it, it ſhall goe, he dares not ſtand out againſt God; but a wicked heart hath not a teachable underſtanding, it is ſtill under its ſtubbornneſs and ſtoutneſs, and reaſoning againſt God; and things he doth not like, he will not ſee; when there is any ſin he would not leave, or any duty he would not doe, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. he ſhuts his eyes, and will not ſee. What wicked man that lives under the Goſpel of God, but may ſee his courſes are naught, but he will not ſee it? how many ſins do ungodly men keep? there is light enough, and reaſon enough againſt their ſinnes, but they have ſturdy mindes, and will not be convinced of it.</p>
                  <p>Again, An upright man his heart is converted and made godly, his will is made pliable to be led by God, and guided by Gods bleſſed ſpirit; the ſtone is taken out of it; there may be much hardneſs, but the ſtone is gone, the heart of ſtone is gone, and he hath an heart of fleſh given unto him, to be ſenſible of God, and ſenſible of his word, and ſenſible of the light that ſhines in his face;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94114:69"/>
and his heart being converted, he is moved by an inward principle, and ſo moves the more willingly, and the more freely; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>He hath a willing heart.</hi> But now a carnal heart, and a heart that is not turned to God, the ſtone is not taken out, a man rebels to this day; if he be moved to goodneſſe, it is not by an inward principle, but by edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or goodneſſe of nature; or by the ſtings of conſcience that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power his heart; or by reaſon of a great light that breaks in and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awes his heart: Therefore a naughty heart, be he never ſo good and fair-carriaged, may be his conſcience ſometimes makes him forbear more then he would, and makes him doe more good then he would; but a godly heart is willing to doe what good he can, nay he would doe more good then he can doe, nay he never can doe ſo much as he would, he is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of all his works; look what he doth, he doth it with a willing heart.</p>
                  <p>Again. A godly heart is good in his memory, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.16. <hi>I will never forget thy precepts.</hi> His memory is turned to good things, and made to remember good things; he hideth the word of God in his heart, that he may not ſin againſt him: But a carnal heart forgets to be good, and zealous, and pleaſe God, and obey God; his memory is not waſhed and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in any meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Again, A good man is good in his thoughts; he doth not onely purge the outſide of the platter, but the inſide alſo; he labours to have his thoughts ſet upon things above; he labours that vain thoughts may not lodge in him; nay his main care is within doors, in his own boſome, to have his thoughts upright towards God.</p>
                  <p>So again, he is good in his affections, he doth hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, he doth deſire the things that are moſt excellent he doth delight in God and his preſence; he mourns for his ſins, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ourns that he can mourn no more; he hath all his affections in ſome meaſure rightly ſeated and qualified; he is good all over, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>The Good of peace ſanctifie you throughout.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, This is ſincerity, and I pray God give it you, that you may not deceive your own ſouls, but that your whole ſpirit and body, and ſoule, and whole man may be true in the eyes of the Lord: But now a carnal heart is not thus; though he be like a whited Sepulchre, he doth ſeem outwardly to be a good man, and a man cannot check him; if a man ſhould ſay, ſuch a one is rotten, he ſhould be thought to be cenſorious and uncharitable; yet in his inward parts he is naught; if a man be not upright, he doth not look to his thoughts, but can let them be vaine and unfruitfull, and can let his affections run at randome; he is not affected with God, he doth not mourn for his ſins, he doth not delight in good things, his affections are not ſet upon things that are above.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, An upright man is univerſal in regard of caſes and conditions, if he be under any kinde of temptation whatſoever, as we may ſee, <hi>James</hi> 1.12. It is nothing for a man to be godly, and meek, and patient, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, when he is not tempted; the Devil himſelfe is good when he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we ſay: This is godlineſſe and uprightneſſe, when a man reſiſts tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, when a man doth watch and pray, and is careful that he may not enter into temptations; when a man is careful of all the objects, and beginnings, and occaſions of ſin; when a man fights againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the fleſh, and warres againſt the ſuggeſtions of Satan, and puts on all the armour of God, to withſtand the fiery darts of the Devil; though he be tempted to be proud, and wrathful, and impatient, yet he will not; 'tis true, now and then he may be overcome againſt his principles, and care, and labour, but that is as a dagger to his heart. This is his courſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94114:70"/>
and practiſe to fight againſt temptati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns; nay take him in the deſperateſt caſes, yet a godly man is ſincere; take him when he is moſt afraid that he is not ſincere, when he cries out, how daſtardly am I for God? how dead in good duties? how full of unbelief? what a vile heart have I? how fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and untoward? take him in theſe deſperate liſts, he is not without ſincerity; and in this caſe he doth one of theſe two things; either he walks according to the meaſure of grace given unto him, or elſe according to the condition wherein he is; 'tis true, the conditions Gods people are in, are ſometimes better, and ſometimes worſe; ſometimes horrible diſtempers are up, and ſometimes they are down; but when they are never ſo up, he doth as a man in that caſe may doe; as a man when he is bound hand and foot, what can he doe? if he rowle himſelfe upon the ground, that is all he can doe; and this he will doe, as you may ſee what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.40. It ſeems he felt himſelf marvellouſly dead, and dull, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inobedient, and he could not get hold of Gods commandements to doe them as he ought; yet he rowls himſelfe, and thruſts himſelfe forward to doe them; he longed for Gods commandements, he longed for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace to aſſiſt him and quicken his heart. Now a naughty heart is not good in all caſes; nay there are but a few caſes wherein he is good at all.</p>
                  <p>Again, Take an upright man in the loweſt ebb, he doth queſtion his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and he cannot quiet himſelfe, becauſe he thinks he hath it not; but this is certain, a man that hath moſt ſincerity, doth moſt ſuſpect the want of it; that man is moſt eager, and moſt queſtions himſelfe; as <hi>David,</hi> was not he an upright man? yet no man did ſuſpect himſelfe more, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.80. as who ſhould ſay, Lord I am afraid I ſhall be aſhamed in the end, I am afraid my heart is not ſound towards thee; and directly ſometimes, I am horribly afraid I ſhall be confounded in the end: Now good Lord let me be found in thy ſtatutes, that I may not be confounded. So it was with Chriſts Diſciples, when he ſaid one of them ſhould betray him; though eleven of his Diſciples were privy to themſelves that they had not the leaſt thought to betray him, yet eleven of the Diſciples did ſuſpect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I may be the man that he means; though they were privy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the preſent they had no ſuch thought, nay it was againſt the love and principles they had in them; they did love him, and fear him, and believe in him to be the Saviour of the world, and they durſt not doe it, yet they ſuſpected themſelves, <hi>Maſter, is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi>? As who ſhould ſay, I have a ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Seventhly, an upright man is univerſal in regard of relations. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him with good people, and the Saints of God. O how he loves them! <hi>he honours them that fear the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 15.4. Though they be never ſo poor and vile, yet he honours them that fear the Lord; as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaith, he would not have ſpoken, but onely for <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi>; ſo an upright man he honours the Saints of God. <hi>All my delight is in the Saints,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 16. Pſal. 119.63. Nay an upright man is faithful with the Saints; as it is ſaid of good <hi>Judah, ſhe was faithful with the Saints,</hi> Hoſ. 11.12. So an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man is faithful with the Saints, his heart cloſeth with them, they are his boſome friends, and the beloved of his ſoule: But one that is not ſound, though he take himſelf to be a Chriſtian, and one of Gods ſervants, yet he cares not for the people of God; may be he cares for thoſe that ſeem to be religious; but if a man be religious indeed, he cares not for him, he is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94114:70"/>
too nice and preciſe for him, and he is falſe to the Saints, and will ſhew them ſome ſlippery trick in the end.</p>
                  <p>Now again, Conſider an upright man with the wicked; he carries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ightly towards them, he will not be acquainted with them, nor all one with them, leſt he ſhould countenance their wicked wayes; as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſpeaks, <hi>He deſpiſeth them that are wicked,</hi> Pſal. 15.4. Let a vile man be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo brave, and excellent, and noble, and high in preferment; yet if he be a wicked man, in the eyes of a godly man he is deſpiſed; I doe not mean for his perſon; he gives him the honour due to his place, as he ought to doe, a childe to his Father, a ſervant to his Maſter, &amp;c. as <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 22.1. Though they perſecuted him, he gave them their due; but he abhors their courſes and practiſes, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A wicked man is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the juſt.</hi> Now an unſound heart, though he joyn himſelfe to the people of God, yet he cannot cloſe with the Saints of God, but abhors them, and counts them vile.</p>
                  <p>Again, Conſider an upright man with his friends; he is true to them, eſpecially to their ſouls. Conſider him with his enemies; he doth not yield them railing for railing, he dares not hate them that hate him, but <hi>bleſſeth them that curſe him, and prayes for them that deſpitefully uſe him.</hi> Conſider him in his Family; he ſets himſelfe to walk uprightly in the midſt of his houſe; if he be a Maſter, he labours to be a ſervant to Chriſt; and if he be a ſervant, he labours to be the Lords Freeman, and to be a profitable ſervant to his Maſter; if he hath Superiours, he gives them the reverence due unto them; and if he deal with inferiours, he makes himſelfe equall with thoſe of low degree. Thus an upright man is good in all rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, An upright man is good in all the manners and circumſtances of his actions; he is careful to doe, not onely for matter what God commands him, but for the manner as God commands him; though he doth what God commands, yet if he doth not find the love of God ſetting him a work, he is not contented; he muſt doe it in a right manner, conſtantly, duely, faithfully, and to a right end, to the glory of God; he is not content to pray and hear, but he muſt pray and hear in a right manner, or elſe he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Now if thou haſt theſe ſigns and tokens of an upright heart, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, thou mayſt take all the comforts ſpoken of before concerning an upright heart, and mayſt take all the promiſes of God to thy ſelf that are made to an upright heart; may be men may call thee hypocrite, and ſay all manner of evil of thee; but either they are ſuch as doe not know thee, or if they doe, they are ſome vile wretches, they have not the fear of God before their eyes; may be the Devil will accuſe thee, and caſt in all accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations againſt thee before God; but what of all that? God himſelfe ſaid <hi>Job</hi> was an upright man, and yet the Devil accuſed him for an hypocrite; therefore care not for the Devils accuſations; may be thine own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may accuſe thee; but if thou labour to humble thy ſelf for thy failings, and ſtir up the gift of God that is in thee, if thou unfeignedly deſire and endeavour to pleaſe God, and ſerve him, no matter though thy conſcience accuſe thee. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I cannot be my own Judge, but God ſhall judge me.</hi> 'Tis true, conſcience is a judge, but it is ſubordinate, and muſt be guided and ruled by the Word of God; as the clock is the judge of the day, but it muſt be ruled by the Sun; <hi>Davids</hi> conſcience was his judge, <hi>I have cleanſed my hands in vain,</hi> but the clock lyed; ſo thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may lye, and accuſe thee falſly, and ſpeak things againſt thee that are not ſo; but if thy conſcience hath things againſt thee indeed and in truth, that thou art guilty of ſuch and ſuch ſins and failings, yet it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low but thou mayſt be ſincere; therefore believe not conſcience, when thou
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94114:71"/>
haſt the Word of God on thy ſide; nay, may be God himſelfe will ſeem to accuſe thee, and to be thine enemy, and diſcountenance thee, and will not own thee for one of his children; when thou commeſt before him, he will ſeem to daſh thee under his feet, and give thee no countenance, but look upon thee as an enemy; yet be not diſmayed, if thou haſt theſe things in thee in any meaſure; the Lord doth this, that he may doe thee good in thy latter end; he doth it that he may humble thee, and try thee, whether thou wilt live by faith or by ſenſe, and whether thou dareſt truſt him; but if thou haſt not theſe ſigns of uprightneſs, thou art in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and bond of iniquity, and thou canſt have no true comfort to thine own ſoul.</p>
                  <p>The next point is, That as we muſt be perfect, ſo we muſt be perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctrine.</hi> We muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before God.</note> 
                     <hi>I have not found thy works perfect before God.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, I lookt thou ſhouldſt be perfect before him, and I have not found it ſo. Well then for the meaning of the word <hi>perfect before God</hi>; that is, ſo as God may approve and allow of them. Now a mans works may be perfect ſo as God may approve of them two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, So as God may approve of them in his ſtrict Juſtice; and ſo no mans works can be perfect. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>Enter not into judgement, &amp;c.</hi> No man living can be juſtified before God. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>By the deeds of the Law ſhall no man be juſtified before him.</hi> This therefore is not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To be perfect before God, ſo as God ſhall approve of us in his mercy in Jeſus Chriſt for his owne faithful people; as it is ſaid of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Luke</hi> 1.5. This is the meaning of the place.</p>
                  <p>Now if you would know what it is to be perfect before God, it is this in one word: when a man is for matter and for manner right in the eyes of God; not only right in the eyes of men, to be approved of men, but right in the eyes of God, to be approved of God; for matter, when a man doth thoſe things that God commands him; and for manner, when he doth them as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him, out of faith in God, and love to God, and fear of God; when a man doth it with all his heart, ſoule, and ſtrength, when a man doth it conſtantly, and frequently, and livelily in ſome meaſure, this is to be upright before God; you may ſee both theſe ſet down in one verſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.25. Here is the matter, <hi>If ye obſerve to doe his commandements</hi>; and then here is the manner, <hi>right in the eyes of the Lord as he hath commanded.</hi> If we doe thus, then we are upright before God. Now if either of theſe be wanting, we are not upright before God; if we doe not for matter what God hath commanded; if we lye, or ſwear, or be covetous, or proud, or worldly, theſe things are of the Devil, and not of God; we doe the things of the Devil, and not the things of God.</p>
                  <p>Again, If a man ſhould bow the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> and doe the inventions of men, this is not to be unright before God; but if we doe the things that God doth not bid us, God will ſay as he did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9. If we doe for the matter the things that God hath commanded, yet if the manner be wanting, if we doe them not as God hath commanded, if we doe them not with faith, and love to God, with conſcience, and fervency, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, all is nothing; as it is ſaid of <hi>Amaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94114:71"/>
but if it be not ſo indeed, thou haſt a falſe heart; if thou haſt carnal ends, if thou loveſt the world more then God, and thou loveſt thy luſts more then him, if it be ſo, woe unto thee; God will have thee upright before him. As God ſaith to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Walke before me, and he upright</hi>; As who ſhould ſay, <hi>Abraham,</hi> if there be any way of wickedneſs in thee, thou art not for me; look thou be perfect before me; if thou doſt acknowledge that I am God Almighty, and I am able to help thee, and ſuccour thee in all eſtates, then be upright before me; when a man ſins, it is for ſomething he ſins; now, what is there that is good but we may have it in God? God is Almighty, and therefore he would have us upright before him; and if we be not upright, he is Almighty and can cruſh us and deſtroy us for ever; ſo that we ſhould not only be upright before men, but before God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the Law is ſo, ſo is the Goſpel; if a man hath not faith in Chriſt Jeſus, that man is no true Chriſtian; howſoever he may hope to be ſaved by Chriſt, yet if he be not upright before God in all his wayes and commandements in ſome meaſure, in ſtudying and endeavouring to keep himſelf unſpotted of the world in all things, he hath not faith, he doth not believe in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.9, 10. as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will walke before the Lor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God hath ſworne an oath, that whomſoever he delivers from ſin, from Satan, from Hell, from the wrath to come, they ſhall be holy and righteous before him. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.73. God will not be forſworne; if thou doſt hope to be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, and prayeſt, and howleſt, and crieſt in thy afflictions from the bottom of thy heart, with all thy eagerneſs to be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, God hath ſworne an oath thou ſhalt not be ſaved by him, unleſs thou wilt walk in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the dayes of thy life, and be conformable to his will in all things; ſo that you ſee the Goſpel requires it, that we ſhould be thus.</p>
                  <p>Again, This is the end of the redemption of the world by Chriſt, that they ſhould not only be upright, but upright before God; as <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians, chap.</hi> 1. <hi>To preſent you holy and unblameable in his ſight</hi>; not only to preſent you holy and unblameable before men; for if a man in his outward carriage be civil, and honeſt and faire, this is to be holy and unblamable before men; but if a man be holy and unblamable before God, he muſt have a pure conſcience, and his ends muſt be right; this is the end why Chriſt redeemed his people, to purchaſe to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
                  <p>And as it is in the end of redemption, ſo it is the end of election; whomſoever God doth elect to eternal life, he doth elect to this end, not only to be holy before men, but before God. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. he hath choſen us to be holy before him, not only to be holy before men (though thoſe that are not holy before men, cannot be holy before God) but it is not enough for us to be holy before men, but before the piercing eye of the all-ſeeing God; that he may ſee who knoweth our hearts, that we do unfeignedly deſire to ſerve his name, and walk before him in the ſhunning of all ſin, and in the practicing of all good things; ſo that we have not an
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94114:72"/>
argument of our election, unleſſe we be upright before him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the Lord will ſearch us out; certainly though we be upright before men, if we be not upright before God he will ſearch us out; it is not our profeſſion ſhall bear us out, if we have an unbelieving heart, to depart from the living God; if we have a minde to live in any one ſin, and to allow ourſelves in any one wicked way, God will finde us out. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.8. he ſpeaks there of <hi>Abraham</hi>; what a comfort was it to <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart that God found his heart upright before him? God will ſearch us, and put us upon the trial, and bring ſomething or other, that if we be not upright, though we be affected, and pray, and be Proteſtants, and ſeem to be godly, and ſeem to hold our godlineſs and uprightneſs, yet if we be not ſound at the core, God will have ſomething or other that ſhall diſcover us, and it ſhall appear what we are; nay, God doth of purpoſe bring in here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, that thoſe that are approved may be manifeſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is God only that doth eſteem of the worth of things; holineſſe is nothing, but that which is holineſs in Gods eſteem; and Religion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which is Religion in Gods eſteem; Religion is a divine thing, and no man hath the judgement of it but God; it is God only that hath invented Religion, and framed it to us, and it is he only that can tell the worth of it, and approve of it; and unleſs we fear his name, and hate all ſin, and be upright before him, all is nothing. As the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. concerning meekneſs in women, in the eſteem of God it is of high price; may be a beautiful woman, of rare parts and great gifts, this woman is of high eſteem with ſome men; but a woman of an humble and meek ſpirit, ſhe is a mockery in the eyes of the world, but in Gods ſight it is of great price: ſo for a man to be outwardly Religious, this man is very devout and religious in the fight of men, but it is the broken heart, and the contrite ſpirit, one that is holy inwardly as well as outwardly, that is upright as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. all our care and labour is that we may be accepted of him; it is no matter what the world ſay of a religious man, and a devout man; all our care is to be accepted of him, that he may account us upright, for we muſt appear before him.</p>

                  <p>Again, This may ſerve to condemn carnal Proteſtants, who give God now and then the hearing of a Sermon, and frequent the Sacrament, and do the outward things of Religion, but never come to worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth; let me tell you all this Religion is nothing at all; ſuppoſe a man comes to Church only, and lives in his luſts, what then? <hi>Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired this at your hands to tread in my courts? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Doctrine.</hi> God will ſearch whither we be perfect.</note> that the Lord will ſearch whither thoſe that ſeem to be upright be ſo or no; finding preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſearching; <hi>I have not found thy works perfect.</hi> Now for the meaning of this ſearching, we muſt know that Gods ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and mans ſearching do much differ, and they differ in five reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Mans ſearching may be without finding; though a man ſearch all that ever he can, yet may be he cannot finde out the matter how it ſtands; <hi>Laban</hi> ſearched in <hi>Jacobs</hi> tent, and <hi>Leabs</hi> tent, and the two maids tent, and in <hi>Rachels</hi> tent for his images, and when he had done all he could not tell where they were; but now when God ſearcheth men, he is ſure to find men out; <hi>O Lord thou ſearcheſt me out,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 139.1. This is the reaſon why men that are ſligh and ſubtil, they care not much though they be ſifted by men, eſpecially if there be none to witneſs againſt them; you ſhall have them ſwear and ſwagger they were never guilty of ſuch a thing, becauſe they are confident it ſhall never come to light; but if God ſearcheth, he will be ſure to find.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Mans ſearching hath ever ignorance foregoing, though after ſearch may be he comes to know, yet before ſearching he knows not; <hi>Job,</hi> 29.16. <hi>the caſe I knew not, I ſearched out</hi>; he ſearched becauſe he knew not; but God as after ſearching he is ſure to know and find out, ſo he knows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all ſearching; as the Church ſaith, if we be falſe in thy covenant, ſhall not God finde us out? <hi>for thou knoweſt the very thoughts of the heart and the reins,</hi> Pſal. 44.21. you ſee God ſearcheth becauſe he doth know, man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Mans ſearching is properly ſo called; but when ſearching is ſpoken of God, it is after the manner of men; God doth rather act a kind of ſearching, then ſearch indeed; as he doth act a comming down, whereas properly he doth not come down, for he is everywhere; and ſo he acts a kinde of ignorance, as if he knew not, and yet he knows all things; as he ſpeaks to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 18.21. <hi>I will goe down now</hi>; there is an horrible noyſe, what horrible ſinners theſe <hi>Sodomites</hi> be; <hi>I will go down now, and ſee whither it be altogether according to the cry that is come up unto me; if not, I will know:</hi> He ſpeaks after the manner of men; he need not come down, for he is preſent everywhere, and cannot move from one place to another; and whereas he ſaith, <hi>if not, I will know</hi>; theſe things are improperly ſpoken after the manner of men.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is mans duty to ſearch if he know not any particular paſſage of his life, whither it be warrantable or no; ſo Magiſtrates ought to ſearch matters before they determine ſentence, otherwiſe they may judge unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgement; now God ſearcheth not as though he had any need of ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but to tell us our duty, to give us a good example; this phraſe is given to him, to ſhew us what we ſhould do; as when there was an horrible attempt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94114:73"/>
in the old world among the Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> they would build a Tower whoſe top ſhould reach up unto Heaven. Now the Text ſaith, <hi>The Lord came down to ſee the Tower and the City that was built</hi>; not as if he came down, ſo as taking this phraſe unto himſelfe; but to ſhew what our duty, and Magiſtrates duty is; to ſearch before they paſs ſentence, and to ſee whether reports given out be true or no.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Mans ſearching is for himſelfe, that things may appear to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but when God ſearcheth, it is not that it may appear unto him, but to the world, that it may be manifeſt abroad, that a mans ſelfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; may ſee it; it is ſpoken onely in regard of the nature of the thing; ſome things are manifeſt, and ſome ſecret. Now God is ſaid to ſearch, when he makes other things that in their own nature are hidden to men, when God brings them abroad, and unveils them, and unmasks them, and openly reveals them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Judge not before the time, till the Lord comes, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs.</hi> He ſearcheth them not for himſelfe, but to make them manifeſt; he ſaw them before, but they were not manifeſt abroad; they were under the hatches, no body could tell whether they were ſo or no Now God is ſaid to ſearch to bring them abroad.</p>
                  <p>Now God is ſaid to ſearch five manner of wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By his own Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. So ſaith <hi>David, Whither ſhall I fly from thy Spirit? if I goe up into heaven, thou art there, &amp;c.</hi> If thou ſhouldſt goe into the Alehouſe, or any bad place, God is there a ſpectator; though the Devil onely, and ſuch as are his Imps, are there keeping company with thee, yet God is there beholding thee; though we ſhould dig never ſo deep, God can trace us, and finde us out; though we ſhould be never ſo cloſely and cleverly wicked, God can dive into us what we are; <hi>Come in thou wife of Jeroboam,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>why diſſembleſt thou thy ſelfe to be another?</hi> The Spirit of God revealed it. When <hi>Geheſai</hi> wiped his lips, <hi>O thy ſervant went no whither; Did not my ſpirit goe with thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eliſha, when the man returned?</hi> He ſhewes how the Spirit of God, which he calls his ſpirit, becauſe it dwelt in him, did reveal his wretchedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the Lord ſearcheth by his own Spirit, ſo alſo by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man; as for example, by the ſpirit of the Magiſtrate, he doth ſearch out ſly offenders; when <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſaid, <hi>The King doth ſcatter the wicked,</hi> Prov. 20.27. in the next words he anſwers an Objection, How ſhall he finde out whether ſuch a man be wicked or no? A man may be brought before a Magiſtrate, and yet have all the hands in the Pariſh for his good behaviour: Now how ſhall the Magiſtrate finde it out? ſaith he, <hi>The ſpirit of man is the candle of the Lord</hi>; that is, as <hi>Tremelius</hi> expounds it, the Lord helps the Magiſtrate to finde out theſe fellows, though they be never ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and how doth he help him? by the Magiſtrates own wit and wiſedome; it is the candle of the Lord, the Lord gives him light to ſift things, and bring things to light; and though wicked and ungodly men hang together, though they ſwear and combine themſelves hand in hand together, yet if a Magiſtrate be an able man, and gifted of the Lord, the Lord hath ſet a candle in that mans minde, to light him how to diſcover them: As when the two Harlots came before <hi>Solomon,</hi> the ſpirit of <hi>Solomon</hi> was the candle of the Lord that lighted him to diſcover which was the mother of the childe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God doth ſearch a man by the conſcience in a man himſelfe; ſometimes you ſhall have a childe of God much afraid that he is not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and calls all into queſtion; anon the Lord diſcovers he is ſincere, and reveals he is upright; how doth he doe it? by his own conſcience; as the caſe was <hi>Davids</hi>; one time he concluded all was naught, and he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94114:74"/>
of God in him, and God was gone quite away, and had ſhut up his mercy for evermore; at laſt God revealed <hi>David</hi> to himſelfe, and that by his own conſcience; <hi>My own ſpirit ſearched,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6. and then he ſaw that it was but his infirmity; his own ſpirit and conſcience, the Lord ſtirred it up to make diligent ſearch, and <hi>David</hi> perceived himſelfe to be as he was; ſo on the contrary a wicked man may ſeem to have good hopes to be godly, and to have an honeſt &amp; ſincere heart, and be a good Chriſtian, and he profeſſeth himſelfe to be ſo; and if any one ſhould charge him with the contrary, he would ſay they were uncharitable. Now this is a ſecret. Now the Lord ſearcheth him out by his own conſcience; thus it was with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>; he thought he did well in not letting the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> goe, nay he thought <hi>Moſes</hi> was unreaſonable to demand ſuch a thing; what, to let ſix hundred thouſand of his ſervants to goe out of his Kingdome at once! there was no equity he ſhould let them goe. Now the Lord diſcovered this was nothing but the wretchedneſſe of his own heart, and made his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cry out, <hi>The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</hi> Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he call for it at my hands, and rightly doth he puniſh me for not doing of it, and I am a wicked man, and have done it out of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of my heart.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Lord ſearcheth men out by his Word; he doth thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover men to be what they are, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>The Word of God is quick and powerful, ſharper then a two-edged ſword, &amp;c.</hi> and is a ſearcher and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the thoughts and intentions of the hearts; the Word of God doth ſearch and diſcover men; though they be never ſo ſecretly covered, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Word of the Lord finds them out; as you may ſee it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>; it made her give over all her wrangling and diſputing the caſe with Chriſt; it made her cry out at the laſt, <hi>O come and ſee a man that hath told me all that ever I have done,</hi> John 4.29. So the Apoſtle when he would exhort the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to expound the word in a known tongue, he gives this reaſon; O ſaith he, if you doe thus, it will diſcover people; if a man ſhould come in, he will be judged by you, and the thoughts of his heart will be made manifeſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24. The Word of God is a divine thing, and it is a plain ſign that it is the word of an all-ſearching God; for it can meet with mens thoughts, and mens ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. When King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> ſaid, <hi>What ſhall be done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour?</hi> what man living could tell what <hi>Haman</hi> thought at that time? yet the Word of God revealed the thought of his heart, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 6.6. When <hi>David</hi> was dancing before the Ark, and <hi>Michal</hi> looked out at the window, what man could tell what ſhe thought in her heart? yet the Word of God ſets it down, <hi>She deſpiſed him in her heart,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.16. When <hi>Foelix</hi> was talking privately with St. <hi>Paul</hi> friendly and kindly, what man or Angel could imagine what <hi>Foelix</hi> thought at that time? yet the Word of the Lord layes it open, <hi>He thought to have a bribe</hi>: You will ſay, who could tell that 'tis true? men know not peoples hearts; yet many times the Word meets with them, inſomuch that they are ready to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, who told the Miniſter of me? certainly he hath ſome blab, how ſhould he come to know this, and ſpeak of this in the Pulpit? the Word of God meets with them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Lord ſearcheth men by his providence; though men carry it out never ſo handſomely and fairly, and can goe in the dark, and under the hatches for a long time; yet the providence of God will have a time to finde them out, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 12.22. <hi>He diſcovereth the deep things out of darkneſs, &amp;c.</hi> That is, he doth it many times by his providence, he reveals things that are otherwiſe ſecret and unknown, and lie hid, yet he brings them out; men may blear the world, and deceive their own ſoules,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94114:74"/>
but the providence of God in the end will ſearch out all ſecret things, and make them as manifeſt as things done on the houſe top; it is a ſtrange thing to ſee how many, that have boyled in their hearts againſt the Saints and Miniſters of God, and they have carried it out ſlyly and fairly, yet God hath diſcovered their malice and ſpight, and their venemous ſpeeches, and the envy they have borne againſt the people of God: What ſtrange things hath the Lord diſcovered? when men have concluded no eye ſhould ſee it, I hope no body ſhall know it; yet the providence of God comes to finde it out either firſt or laſt. Now the providence of God diſcovers mens works that are in ſecret divers wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By letting his people to ſuſpect men; 'tis true, we ought not to give way to an humour of ſuſpition, for it is directly againſt charity; for charity thinketh no ill; therefore we ſhould take heed of ſuſpition without juſt cauſe of ſuſpition; for hereby we may wrong perſons, as the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, though <hi>Paul</hi> was a true Convert, yet they ſuſpected he was not, and ſo wronged him: It is a dangerous thing to ſuſpect any man without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ground; yet many times the providence of God doth diſcover men by this meanes, as you may ſee an example in thoſe falſe-hearted ones <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. they would come and build with <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhua</hi>; they made as if they did intend the promotion of the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Now <hi>verſe</hi> 3. they ſuſpected them. Now when they ſaw that they were ſhy of them, they diſplayed themſelves, and laid themſelves open, and turned to the contrary ſide, and did them all the miſchiefe they could.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by letting of good people to injure and wrong them; this is very true, that the children of God ſhould wrong no body, eſpecially none that are Chriſtians, that we may have any hope they are godly; if a child of God ſhould wrong any man in the leaſt degree, he is guilty of all the miſchief that ſhall follow after; therefore we ſhould be marvellous careful that we wrong no man in thought, word, or deed; but yet it will be ſo long as we dwell here in the fleſh; wrongs will be committed by good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſometimes againſt their wills, ſometimes by corruptions riſing in their hearts contrary to their minds and principles they goe upon. Now when theſe wrongs fall upon thoſe that are not ſound, this diſcovers them; for their venom and madneſſe falls not onely upon them, but upon all Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; theſe are your Profeſſors, and preciſe fellows! nay let but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God be indiſcreet, this by the providence of God doth divers times diſcover men; as <hi>Saul</hi> a great hypocrite, indeed he had many admirable things in him, he had admirable Government; and though he were not a man that truly loved holineſſe, yet he did abundance of good things, and he hoped he was right. Now the Lord diſcovered him by this, by letting him have ſome indiſcretion ſhewed towards him; as the women in the Song, <hi>Saul hath ſlain his thouſands, and David his ten thouſands</hi>; it was indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly ſpoken of them; though it were true, they ought not to have made ſuch a Song of it; though no queſtion the women meant well in what they did, and were honeſt and well-minded people; yet through their indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Saul</hi> ſtomachs <hi>David,</hi> and grows to be a perſecutor; <hi>From this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be eyed David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By guiding of his Miniſters to home-preaching; this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers people what they are; if they be godly and upright, when the word of God meets with any corruption of theirs, then it ſhews they are of God; for then they fall down before God, and acknowledge their ſin, and repent of it, and part with it, and loath it, and cry to Heaven for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of it, and labour to have it rooted out of their ſoules and conſciences, and ſo they are diſcovered to be ſound; but when this meets with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94114:75"/>
heart, and comes to diſplay his ſecret luſts, and vile courſes, not being able to ſtoop to this, it ſhewes what it is; as when Chriſt preached ſomething ſharply, <hi>John</hi> 6.55<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 60. O ſay they, <hi>It is hard hard ſaying, who can bear it? And from that time many of his Diſciples forſook him.</hi> It fares with Gods Church in this caſe, as with <hi>Iſhboſheth; Abner</hi> ſeemed to be his dear friend, and ſtuck cloſe to him; yet when <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> told him of his faults,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.8.</note> of his whoredome, and lying with his Fathers Concubines, then he was mad, and was not able to brook him; preſently he falls off from <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> becauſe of this away he goes, and turns his enemy: So it fares with the Saints of God, many ſeem to be their dear friends, and keep cloſe to them, and joyn with them; but when they are dealt withal about things amiſſe in them, they diſcover what they are, they do not like ſuch men, they care not how little they come in their company, they fall off, and ſo are made manifeſt what they are.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By their own luſts and corruptions; for you ſhall have men many times hear the Word, and being wrought upon in their conſciences by the Word, or by Gods judgements, that ſtartles them, they give over their ſins upon this, and reform, and will have good orders in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and take up good duties; and not having a ſound, but a falſe heart, a covetous heart, in the end this worldlineſſe, or any other luſt that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified, the Lord doth uſe it as an inſtrument to diſcover that all theſe Reformations of theirs were never ſound; in the end they come to count this a burden, and ſuch a burden as they are not able to bear, and ſo grow to be ſomething weary of their ſtrict courſes, and give over by degrees not to be ſo careful in their Families to pray morning and evening, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times omit it, and not to be ſo forward for God and goodneſſe; and at the laſt they come to ſhew plainly that there was never any ſoundneſſe in them; thus the Lord doth many times lead them forth among evil doers, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 125.5. and ſo ſuch as have kept company among good doers, are diſcovered to be evil doers, thus <hi>Demas</hi> was diſcovered; for a time he followed St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but having a worldly heart, the Lord diſcovered him by it in the end, it made him weary of <hi>Pauls</hi> company, and he fell to embrace this preſent world, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, By the times, by perſecutions that ariſe againſt the Church of God; and this knocks off all that were but meer hangbyes; it knocks them off from the good courſe they ſeemed to follow before, and they follow the contrary; as Chriſt notes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>They that received the ſeed into ſtony ground, when perſecution aroſe, they f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll off.</hi> When perſecution and trouble did ariſe, they were offended; this diſcovered them; as if there be any rift or unſound place in the houſe, a ſharp tempeſt will diſcover it, and ſhew where is a flaw in the building; ſo if there be a flaw in a mans faith or profeſſion; if a man be not right towards God, the times will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons of this are,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1.</note> Firſt, becauſe it is Gods Prerogative thus to doe, becauſe the perfection of mens works; though men may give a gueſſe at it, yet it is a ſecret. Now it is Gods Prerogative Royal to reveale ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, &amp;c. The heart is deceitfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, who can know it?</hi> 'Tis true, but <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, and try the reins.</hi> So you ſee God takes it to himſelfe as his own Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Royal, to ſearch men out what they are: And indeed the Lord ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Scripture is deſcribed by this very thing, the ſearching of the heart. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27. <hi>He that ſearcheth the heart.</hi> Who is that? The Apoſtle doth not tell us who it is, but you may gueſſe who it is by the Epithite he gives him. So that God, I ſay, is known by this, and will be known by this, by ſearching mens hearts, and diſcovering what men are, and aym
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94114:75"/>
at, and intend; what men hate, and what they love; what things they doe, and how they doe them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As this is Gods Prerogative Royal, ſo of all things in the world he will bring that which is ſecret out, whether men be ſincere or no. Men make a ſhew, O they are baptized, and come to Church, and take paines in their places and callings; and what can you alledge againſt me? Now of all things in the world, God will diſcover this, if men be not as they ſeem to be; if men have malice in their hearts, and pride; if they ſeek the world, and be ambitious, and ſeek to pleaſe men, and make as if they would pleaſe God; if they be falſe-hearted, God will diſcover this; he will diſcover all things, but ſpecially Hypocriſie; if any will be Adulterers, and will not be known to be ſuch; if any will be proud, or ſcoffers of Religion, and will not be known to be ſuch, God will bring this to light; as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>If you ſecretly accept perſons, God will ſurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove you,</hi> Job 13.10. God will bring all the world, and all their doings to light; but of all things, if men have ſecret haunts, and back-doors to doe evill; if men have devices and colours to put off their actions, if men can dawb up wretched and filthy caſes as if they were good; if men will goe about in this faſhion to dawb with untempered morter, ſuch ſins and ſinners as theſe, God will lay before him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.8. As who ſhould ſay, thou layeſt all our ſins before us; but if we have any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins, thou layeſt them upon a rock in the open Sun, the Lord eſpecially ayms at them; there be many perſons in the world, that are godly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and yet are covered by the ſcoffs and reproaches of the world, as if they had no good, nor did any good; and there are others again that are boulſtered up in the world, as if they were good men, and better then thoſe that keep ſuch a pudder. Now the Lord, as he will bring every thing abroad, ſo ſpecially this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe it is for the glory of God to ſearch men out; as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith of a King, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.2. <hi>It is the glory of a King to ſearch out a matter</hi>; as when the two Harlots were brought before <hi>Solomon</hi> concerning the child whoſe it was, there was no way in the world to know it, there was nothing but their own aſſeverations; the one ſaid it was hers, and the other ſaid it was hers; the one affirmed, the other denied it before the King; now we ſhall ſee what a glory it was to <hi>Solomon</hi> to ſearch out who was the mother of the child; the Text ſaith, <hi>all</hi> Iſrael <hi>feared King</hi> Solomon <hi>becauſe of this thing,</hi> 1 Kings 3.28. They trembled before him, they ſaw he could ſearch out ſecrets and hidden things, therefore they durſt not do wickedneſs in ſecret for fear he ſhould finde them out; ſo it is the glory of God to ſearch out ſecret matters and bring them on the ſtage; if a man be upright, and this man is ſpawl'd and ſpit upon, and born down in the world, if the Lord ſhould not ſearch it out, what a diſhonour would it be to God? and if a man ſhould goe for a good Chriſtian, and is not, and God ſhould not finde them out, what a diſhonour would it be to him? it is the glory of God to ſearch out ſecret matters.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is for the truth of God; he hath ſaid he will ſearch every one out, as you may ſee <hi>Job</hi> 34.22. So he hath ſaid, <hi>He that hideth his ſins ſhall not proſper,</hi> Prov. 28.13. So he hath ſaid, <hi>He that walketh uprightly walketh ſurely, but he that perverteth his wayes ſhall be known.</hi> If God hath ſaid thus, certainly it concerns his truth to ſee it made good; and therefore he muſt ſearch them out.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This is for the Juſtice of God, that God ſhould ſearch out every one what he is, and what his works be, how ſhould God judge the world elſe? therefore when God ſaid he would judge <hi>Judah,</hi> and puniſh them becauſe they had forgotten him; he gives this as the reaſon of it; <hi>Therefore</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:94114:76"/>
ſaith he, <hi>I will diſcover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy ſhame may appear.</hi> So when God means to glorifie his Saints, and beſtow the Kingdome of Heaven upon them, therefore he will diſcover their honeſty, and lay open their godly courſes, and reward them for all the taunts and vile reproaches of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Uſe may ſerve to reprove moſt men generally; we do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that God will ſearch us; what a company of pleas are there to doe evil? what a company of put offs to doe good duties? If men can but find any ſtarting hole, glad are they; and if they can but finde any ſilly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, then they are made, then a man can never get them to doe that which is good. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was loth to goe to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> what abundance of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences had he to put it off? <hi>O,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am unworthy, who am I that I ſhould goe before Pharaoh</hi>? and another time, <hi>I am not eloquent.</hi> He made as if it had been his modeſty, he was not fit for the office; he did not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he was to deal with God, that could ſearch him out; <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>goe before Pharaoh, for they are dead that ſought thy life.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I know thy thoughts, thou haſt killed a man in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thou art afraid that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will kill thee; but that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is dead, therefore goe. So when a man is unwilling to doe a duty, he will have a thouſand excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; bid men have prayers in their Family, they will ſay they are not book-learned, and cannot pray; and how prove you it to be a duty? any thing God bids them doe, they are willing to doe; if you ſhew them but a place of Scripture for it, they make this the reaſon; but this is hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, the reaſon is, they care not for God, nor for the Family; they care not whether they be ſaved or damned; they care not that the fear of God may be in their children and ſervants, they care not for this; but they will not believe this is the cauſe. Again, bid another be diligent in his Office, alas what ſhall a man doe? I ſhall doe no good, he is a peaceable man, and he ſeeth all the Pariſh bandy themſelves together; if he ſaw there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope of doing good, he would doe it; as if he had a very good heart to doe what God would have him, in the end God diſcovers his hypocriſie, it was becauſe he cared not for God, he did not hate ſin, he had no zeal to Gods glory, he is a lover of men more then God, he loves his owne eaſe more then holineſſe, or piety, or good order; therefore let us know what a dangerous thing it is for a man to dally and double with God, when we doe not conſider that God will ſearch our hearts; the Lord knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art loth to have ſuch a thing to be a duty, or whether thou doſt ſecretly deſire it may not be impoſed upon thee; the Lord knows it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe not put off God in this faſhion, for God will ſearch thee out; it is but a folly for us not to conſider that God will ſearch us out; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.18. <hi>He that covereth hatred with lying lips, is a foole</hi>; that is, if a man doe bear ſecret malice againſt a man, doe not love a man, and is not in ſincere charity with him, may be the man covers it with lying lips, O 'tis not for this reaſon and that reaſon, God forbid I ſhould hate him, whereas indeed he doth not love him; ſaith <hi>Solomon, this man is a foole</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, God will finde him, and diſcover him; therefore what a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is it not to lay this to heart.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Uſe is to bid us take heed how we hide our ſins from others, or from our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From others, you ſhall have children, ſo they can hide their faults from their parents, that is all they care for; and ſo ſervants, if they can but hide their faults from their Maſters and Miſtreſſes, they care not how bad they be, or how falſe; ſo it is with many, you ſhall have many a man his own boſome knows what an hard heart he hath, what a dead heart, how careleſſe he is of God, how that he hath no delight in good duties;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94114:76"/>
yet if he can but cover it from the Saints, that when he comes to pray before them, he may carry it off ſomething handſomely, this is all he cares for, or look after; what an horrible thing is this, that people ſhould have no more conſideration that God will ſearch us out? we had as good that all the world ſhould know it, as that God ſhould know it; if we do iniquity, and be careleſſe of his commandements; if we do evil, though never ſo ſecretly, it were better all the world ſhould know it then God; now God will ſearch it out. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.21. Therefore we ſhould ever take heed that we may not have this humour in us, to venture to do evil, ſo we can hide it from men; for what though no man knows it? yet we ſhall finde that God knows it, and will bring it to light one day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We ſhould take heed how we hide our ſins from our ſelves; this is fearful, and in ſome ſenſe a great deal more fearful then the other; for many times when a man hides his ſins from others, he knows them himſelfe; but when a man hath a deceitful heart, that he hides them from his own eyes, how can he repent? a man cannot repent without the ſight of his ſins; yet, as a Divine ſaith, men deſire to hide their ſins from God, and from others, but moſt of all from themſelves: Now what a madneſs is this, though a man do hide his ſins from himſelf, he cannot hide them from God, God will ſearch it out; though a man hath never ſo many colours for his ſins, he will not believe it is a ſin; alas poor creature, God will finde thee out; as a pluraliſt, he will think it lawful to have two livings, but what doſt thou get by hiding it from thy ſelfe, God will finde it out; ſo for jeſting, they think it is lawful to do it; <hi>Eliſha</hi> jeſted; and did not <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> account it a vertue? and the like; I deny not but men may have jeſting if it be convenient, but when men are exceſſive in this, and have no meetings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jeſting, and will ſtand for it, God will find them out; ſo men that will not believe that a man ſhould be ſo ſtrict and preciſe, God forbid that none ſhould be ſaved but ſuch; thus they hide it from themſelves; but when they have done all they cannot hide it from God; but God will diſcover them at the laſt day, may be in this world: ſo a man that was never converted, nor never had faith, he thinks he is converted and hath faith, and is religious, and a good Chriſtian. Thus he hides his woful and vile eſtate from his own eyes; but canſt thou hide it from God? aſſure thy ſelfe God will ſearch thee out.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This may be for comfort to good people. Firſt, It may be a comfort againſt others that ſhall judge them. Secondly, againſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Againſt others that judge them; may be others are harſh towards them, and think all manner of evil of them, and may be ſpeak it too. Now this is a great comfort, that God will ſearch them out; as they be true and upright, and as they doe from the bottome of their hearts ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to pleaſe God, ſo they ſhall not be judged by mens conceits, but by the Lord; this is that which comforted <hi>Paul</hi> againſt the cenſures of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>I count it a ſmall matter to be judged by you, 'tis the Lord that judgeth me.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, I ſhall not ſtand or fall at your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence what you think of me; no, the Lord judgeth me; this is a great comfort. So this comforted <hi>Peter</hi> when Chriſt put that triple query to him, <hi>Simon thou ſon of Jonah, loveſt thou me</hi>? As who ſhould ſay, thou ſayſt thou loveſt me, but how can I think it? haſt thou not denied me thrice? therefore I ask thee thrice doſt thou love me; what ſaith he now? <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> This was his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that God that ſearcheth the heart knew it was his weakneſſe, and he loved him unfeignedly; as who ſhould ſay, men may judge me to be a wretch and an Apoſtate, and that I love my life and my liberty more then thee; they may juſtly judge thus; but thou knoweſt how I have grieved for it, and have been aſhamed of it, and it hath been as a

                  <p>Again, Let us be able to ſtand out againſt afflictions and perſecutions; theſe ſearch men: as it is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he was laid in priſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not yield to his Miſtris, the Text ſaith. <hi>The word of the Lord tryed him,</hi> Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if we be not able to doe this, we ſhall be diſcovered not to be good.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Let us be able to ſtand out againſt judgement, for then God ſearcheth people moſt of all; there may be ſomething left after all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſearchings; a man hath ſtood out perſecutions, and yet hath turned Apoſtate; but when the pan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, A wicked man may be called,<note place="margin">How a wicked man may be called.</note> not only with an outward call of the Miniſter, and with an inward call of the Spirit, but with ſome efficacy it may go a great way, ſo far forth as to make a man come in ſome kinde, as it was with the man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12. <hi>He was called together with the reſt to come to the wedding and he came, but he came without a wedding garment,</hi> now none of theſe callings are meant here, for in this ſence, <hi>many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> Mat. 22.14.

               <p>Firſt, It is a call according to Gods own purpoſe,<note place="margin">A calling to Gods purpoſes.</note> when God calls a man, and hath a purpoſe to make a man come in deed, and to come home, this is the calling here ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>We know that all things worke together for the beſt to Gods children that are called according to his purpoſe,</hi> as God calls them, ſo he doth purpoſe to make them come to himſelf, and make them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of everlaſting mercy; God hath no ſuch purpoſe when he calls the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, he hath a purpoſe indeed to do them good, if it be not through their own default; but yet notwithſtanding he hath no ſuch purpoſe, and abſolute intention to do them good, he hath no ſuch purpoſe to bring them to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and carry them quite through in the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">How one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling differs from another.</note> This is a ſecret in Gods own boſome, and that is another diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, wherein this calling differs from the other; it is ſuch a calling wherein God puts forth his power, and the greatneſs of his power too; God called the light and it came, God called the Heavens and they came, when as they were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Gods call is an effectual call.</note>Thirdly, It is a continual call, it is not a call and ſo away, a call for a year and ſo an end, but it is a continual call; he never leaves calling of him, till he comes home to him, as 1 <hi>Theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now I will prove the Doctrine by divers particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe, a man then may be able to look back upon all his life,<note place="margin">Then a man may reflect on his life paſt.</note> even from his cradle to this day; even before his call, and ſee Gods love to him as <hi>Paul,</hi> though he could not ſee it before, yet when God had effectually called him, he is able to look back upon all his former time and ſpace he had lived, even from his mothers womb, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15 <hi>Who hath ſeperated me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from my mothers wombe, and called me by his grace,</hi> and ſo it was with <hi>David, I have been caſt upon thee,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>even from my mothers belly,</hi> Pſal. 22.9, 10. it is not likely, that <hi>David</hi> was converted then, but when God had effectually called him, then he was able to go back all along, even to his very infancy, and trace Gods goodneſs towards him in this and that, even to his very bringing him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This intereſts a man in all the promiſes of God,<note place="margin">This intereſt a man in the promiſes.</note> 2 <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, It doth ſweeten all Gods promiſes to a man?<note place="margin">It ſweetens the promiſes to a man.</note> what is the reaſon we can hear ſuch admirable things out of the Word, and yet they affect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally, for the moſt part no more then a dry chip, though they hear of the promiſes of God, what promiſes he hath made to his people, to their Prayers, to their hearing of the Word, to their receiving of the Sacrament; what promiſes he hath made in adverſity, and proſperity, in ſickneſs, and in health, in life, and death, when they ſin through frailty, what promiſes they have to help them up againe when they are to do any thing, what promiſes to aſſiſt them, and go along with them, when they are called to any employment, what promiſes to ſuſtaine them, and bear them out; I ſay though all theſe things be delivered to people, things that were ſweeter to <hi>David, then the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the hony combe,</hi> Pſal. 119.103. Yet generally, people are not affected with theſe things; the reaſon is, becauſe they are not able to ſay, that God hath effectually called them, therefore when they heare ſuch things, the heart cannot lay hold upon them, they think with <hi>Francis Spera, I have no part in theſe things,</hi> they think 'tis true, they are ſo to Gods people, but they think there is little comfort, little ſweetneſs in them, becauſe they cannot ſay, that they are effectually called of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If a man be effectually called, this helps a man to pray, <hi>Pſa;l.</hi> 119.94. <hi>I am thine ſave me,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> was able to ſay, <hi>thou haſt called me to be one of thine,</hi> then he was able to pray to God, <hi>Lord ſave me, Lord help me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It helps him to pray.</note> 
                  <hi>I am thine, thou art my God</hi>; when he was able to ſay, that he had intereſt and propriety in God; this did exceedingly help him, and encourage him with boldneſs in prayer; but when a man queſtions his effectual calling, every petition a man puts up, it is choaked, a man cannot pray to God, but he is beaten off, there is no ſtrength in ſuch a prayer, as ſoon as ever <hi>Paul</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94114:80"/>
ſaith God to <hi>Ananias, behold now he prayes,</hi> Act. 9.11 <hi>Paul</hi> had prayed a thouſand times before, no man in <hi>Judea</hi> prayed more then he, but God took no notice of his prayers; but when God had effectually called him by his grace, now the Lord took notice of his prayers, and obſerved them, and heard them, and regarded them, and inclined his ear to them, <hi>behold now he prayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Knowledge of our effectual calling, a help to good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>Fifthly, This is a great encouragement to all goodneſs in outward things, it is a great encouragement to a man to take them in hand, when he ſeeth he hath a calling thereunto; <hi>Gideon</hi> was very earneſt with the Angel, that he might ſee he had a calling to that he was to go about, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.11. So it is in this divine calling, it is a great encouragement, when a man can ſee that he is called; true it is, that every man is called, but I ſpeak not of the general calling, but of the effectual call, when a man can ſee that he is effectually called of God; this helps a man in all good actions, then a man may go to God, as to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he may go to the Sacrament as the ſeale of his righteouſneſs and faith; then a man may take Gods name into his mouth, God challengeth the wicked for doing of it without his call, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. <hi>What haſt thou to do, to take my name into thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt to be reformed</hi>? now a man may take up the profeſſion of religion, and hold forth the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Timothy, fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life</hi>; now marke the encouragement, <hi>whereunto thou art alſo called,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.12.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It is an excellent ground of a godly life, when a man can ſay he is effectually called of God,<note place="margin">A foundation of godlineſſe.</note> that man hath laid a good foundation to be a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, he hath laid it low, he hath built it upon ſuch a ground, that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſhaken, nor removed; he that builds upon this foundation, ſhall never be removed. What is the reaſon why ſo many thouſands undertake to be godly, and are never able to carry it through; others go about it, and through the mercy of God are carried through ſtitch with it? the reaſon is, becauſe thoſe that are effectually called of God, they have a good foundation, they go upon the right ground, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorting Chriſtians to holineſs, and ſanctity, and righteouſneſs of converſation, <hi>be ye holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi>; he doth preſently lay down the ground, whereupon he exhorts them, <hi>whereunto you are called,</hi> ſaith he, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith he, <hi>ye are a choſen generation, a royal Prieſthood, an holy nation, &amp;c. that you ſhould ſhew forth the prayſes of him that hath called you out of the darkneſs, into his marvellous light.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A help againſt falling.</note>In the laſt place, this is the beſt means to help a man up againe; ſuppoſe a man have fallen, as the beſt of all Gods Saints and Children may fall, and fall fowlly; but when a man is effectually called of God, this doth help a man up againe, as it was with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.14. <hi>Deliver me from blood-guiltineſs, O God of my ſalvation,</hi> &amp;c. he being able to ſay, that the Lord was the God of his Salvation, this made him to get up againe; as who ſhould ſay, Lord I have committed murther, I am guilty of innocent blood, yet Lord thou haſt called me by thy grace, to be a God unto me, thou art the God of my ſalvation; I beſeech thee purge me from my filthineſs, and cleanſe me from my ſins: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there be thouſands, when they have committed murther, it breaks their necks, they never get up againe, they are never able to finde repentance, and a broken heart, and to obtaine favour of the Lord, that the ſin be not laid to their charge; but <hi>David,</hi> though he had ſuch a heavy fall, and though it burſt his bones, and put him to much grief, yet he got up againe, becauſe God had effectually called him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note>The firſt reaſon of the point is this, becauſe effectual calling is an evident argument of a mans election unto life, it is that which flows from election to life,<note place="margin">It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinated, thoſe hath he called,</hi> &amp;c. as who ſhould ſay, them, and none but them, this is the loweſt linke of that golden

chaine, if a man can but once finde that he is effectually called of God, he hath a part of that chaine, whereof one end is eternal predeſtination to life, and the other is eternal glory; now he knows that all the whole chaine of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, from firſt to laſt, from eternity to eternity; all belongs to him, when he finds himſelf to be effectually called.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This effectual calling, is a ſure and certaine pledge,<note place="margin">It's a ſure pledge.</note> that a man ſhall have all Gods acts of mercy, when God effectually calls a man, he doth this for him, not only as that particular mercy, but as a pledge of all after mercies, as it was with the delivering of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> he did not this onely as a parcicular mercy, but as a pledge of future mercies for time to come; therefore whenſoever the Lord would aſſure the people that he would ſhew them mercy, and do them good; many times this is ſet down, <hi>I have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it,</hi> Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 81.10. Nay, when they pleaded for mercy, they pleaded this as a pledge, that God would ſhew them mercy, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>Now theſe are thy ſervants, which thou haſt redeemed by thy great power, we beſeech thee let thine ear be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to our ſupplication.</hi> So it is with effectual calling, it is an evident pledge, and ſure token, that God will ſhew a man all his other mercies, when a man is once effectually called, though he hath all yet to do, all the whole buſineſs; yet to wade through, it may be he hath abundance of eſtates and conditions to fall into before he dye: why? now he hath the whole compaſſe of Gods mercy to carry him along in it, God hath given him a pledge of it, and he may ſay to God, Lord thou haſt effectually called me by thy grace, I beſeech thee to juſtifie me, I beſeech thee to ſanctifie me and help me by thy grace to pray, and to go on through the ſeveral paſſages of this life, to bear afflictions, to humble me in proſperity, and to ſtand upon my guard, in ſickneſs, Lord ſuſtaine me, and in troubles and afflictions Lord give me patience; thou haſt called me, and I have the pledge, therefore I beſeech thee do this for me, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is faithful, who hath called you to the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, when God called you to the fellowſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, he did not this as a particular mercy to you onely, but as a ſure pledge that he would ſhew you all other mercies; and aſſure your ſelves, he will be faithful, and make good all theſe mercies to you; go on with faith and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and courage, for God will be faithful as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. marke how he pleads, that God would be pleaſed to give them grace; the God of all grace that hath called you, he make you perfect, eſtabliſh, and ſettle you; he that hath called you ſettle you, he that hath given you a pledge, he that hath vouchſafed you a pawne, he will make it good, he will ſtrengthen you, and enable you, and carry you through, from the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end.</p>

good eſtate, if it were not diſcernable who are in a good and bad eſtate, as we ſee we are called to avoid the one, and follow hard after the other, therefore it is a thing that may be attained to; nay it is not onely a thing that may be attained unto, but the children of God are wont to know it, as <hi>Paul</hi> here to <hi>Timothy, he hath called us</hi>; we are able to ſpeak it, our conſciences choake us not in ſpeaking of it; nay the doubtfulleſt man that ever was, was <hi>Heman, Pſal.</hi> 88.1. <hi>O Lord God of my ſalvation, I have cryed night and day unto thee?</hi> as who ſhould ſay, I am very much bewildered, and much to ſeek, and loſt in doubts and fears, marvelouſly oppreſſed and overwhelmed; yet this I can ſay, thou art my God, the God of my ſalvation; thou haſt effectually called me to pertake of thy mercy, and I have relation to that thou haſt given me union with thee, <hi>thou art the God of my ſalvation</hi>; and ſo it was with <hi>David,</hi> when he was at his worſt, <hi>hath God forgotten to be gracious? will he caſt off for ever, &amp;c?</hi> Pſal 77. though he had named all their grievous paſſages, of feare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire as a man would think, yet at the ſelf ſame time, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>I have conſidered the dayes of old,</hi> he was able to lay hold upon this certainty, I have been called, ſuch a time the Lord was gracious and merciful unto me, I have believed, I have taſted of Gods goodneſs, and pertake of his mercy, and known the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of my ſinnes, he looked unto the dayes of old, he could not deny it, though he were now miſerably put to it, he could not deny this, but in the dayes of old, God had been his God, and he his ſervant: and ſo <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he was dejected, and caſt down, and ſeemed to be in the belly of hell, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am caſt out of thy ſight,</hi> as if he had been caſt off, and quite at a loſſe, yet at the ſelfe ſame time, (ſaith he) <hi>I will look towards thy holy Temple,</hi> Jon. 2.4. as who ſhould ſay, I cannot deny, but thou haſt effectually called me; I have looked to thy Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heretofore, I have looked to Chriſt, and reſted upon thee for eternal life, and for mercy, and thou art my refuge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will look againe to thee.

               <p>I will prove this by reaſon, that a man that is quite to ſeek; that a man that is not able to ſpeak with any certainty, he hath not a jot of faith in this point to believe that he is the Lords, for that man walks in darkneſs, our Saviour makes it a brand of a man <hi>that walks in darkneſs, that knoweth not whether he goeth,</hi> Joh. 12.35. <hi>He that walks in darkneſs knoweth not whether he goeth,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to heaven or to hell, whither he goes right or wrong, to Chriſt or not; it is a ſhroad ſigne, that that man is in a bad eſtate; that God never yet took him out of the world, to the fellowſhip of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſpirit makes known the things of God.</note>The firſt reaſon is, becauſe it is the office of the Spirit to make known to a man, the things given him of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. now ſaith he, <hi>we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit,</hi> not of the world, but the <hi>Spirit of God, that we might know the things, that are freely given to us of God,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, as God hath given us ſuch and ſuch things: So we have the Spirit of God, that can tell us the things that God hath freely given us, when God hath given a man effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al calling, it is a free gift, and then it is the Spirits office to let a man know it, and the Spirit will do his office; nay, when God effectually calls a man by his Spirit; the Spirit ſaith to a man, as the diſciples of Chriſt ſaid to the man that was brought to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.40. <hi>Be of good cheare; he calls thee,</hi> ſo when God effectually calls a man, the Spirit ſaith, <hi>ariſe, be of good cheare, the Lord calls thee</hi>; the Lord of heaven and earth, gives thee a gracious call to come to his heavenly Kingdome, to believe in his name, and to reſt upon him for Salvation, and for every needful thing, <hi>for this life, and the life to come:</hi> the Spirit whereby a man is called, doth ſpeak <hi>internum verbum,</hi> (as Divines

               <p>Secondly, Becauſe a man that is effectually called of God, he is commad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to make his calling and election ſure;<note place="margin">How to make our calling and election ſure.</note> as we may ſee, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. as who ſhould ſay, you may make it ſure; 'tis true, in legal precepts, this doth not follow; that if ſo be God bid a man to do it, therefore it is poſſible to do it; for the law commands things, not poſſible to be done, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the fleſh, but this is an evangelical precept; now when a man is effectually called of God, and is commanded to make his calling ſure, he may do it, the thing is poſſible and it may be performed, and it is a mans own fault if he do it not; if a man that is effectually called of God, do not know it, it is his own fault, and negligence, and careleſneſs; when God bids his people that are called, make their calling ſure, it implyeth, they may do it; the Lord laies no impoſſibility upon his own ſervants, that he hath called to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and glory, but together with his precepts, he ſheweth them, where grace is, and the throne of grace is open for them; and they have an intereſt in God that quickens the dead, and have an open highway to the throne of grace to have any thing that they are required to do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the knowledge of our effectual calling,<note place="margin">Of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling.</note> is the ground of thankſgiving for it God requires, that they that are effectually called to have ſuch mercies, ſhould be thankful to God for it? now how can a man be thankful for that which he is ignorant of, whether he have it or no? that is but a mockery, as carnal people in their thanks, will put in things they know not, we returne unto thee O Lord, all poſſible praiſe and thanks, for election, vocation, juſtification, &amp;c. Carnal people put theſe things into their graces, bleſſing God for theſe things; now if a man come to them, do you know that you are elected, and called, and juſtified, and have a true ground and hope of glory? nay, that we cannot tell ſay they, this is a fooliſh thankſgiving, this is to make a mock of God, and to lie before him; the Lord will have no ſuch thanks, but ſing praiſes with underſtanding, as the Scripture ſpeaks, he will have real, and reaſonable ſervice; now unleſſe a man know this, he cannot be thankful to God aright. The Apoſtle willing the <hi>Corinths</hi> to be thankful for their calling, the poore <hi>Corinths</hi> that were deſpiſed, and ignoble and mean, and of the lower rank of all the Town, he wiſheth them to glory in Gods goodneſs, and in nothing of their own; how doth he urge it? you know your calling, not many wiſe men after the fleſh, <hi>not many noble, &amp;c.</hi> but <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, &amp;c..</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26. you ſee it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there are that God hath called among you, and you ſee what manner of perſons they are, it is palpable, and you cannot deny it, therefore I would not have you glory in your ſelves, but in God, ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>giving thanks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the Father</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that hath made us meete to be partakers of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Saints, who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son</hi>; the Lord expects thanks for this effectual calling, when God hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated us into the Kingdome of his dear Son; that is, when he hath effectually called us, we ſhould give thanks to God for it; now how can we give thanks to God for it, when we are uncertain and ignorant of it? ſurely the Spirit of Chriſt, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt loveth the glory of God, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94114:82"/>
that God ſhould have praiſe from his people for every mercy; therefore without doubt they may come to know it, becauſe otherwiſe God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that of them, which they are not able to performe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe this is the very end of the word of God, it is one of the ends why the word of God is written to us:<note place="margin">Why the word of God is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to us.</note> indeed there are other ends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids this, it is to convert, to ſtrengthen, to direct, to comfort, to counſel, it is to build up, and to pull down; the end of the word is to pull, and hew ſome down to be caſt into the fire; but one end is to acquaint the people of God with the mercies of God, and with graces, and mercies, and kindneſſes, he hath laid up for them in Jeſus Chriſt, and how they are called to theſe things; this is one end of the word, that they may know theſe things that God hath vouchſafed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you, that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, &amp;c.</hi> I have written to you that do believe, to you that are effectually called, that you may know that you have eternal life; you have it, but I would faine have you know that you have it: Now the Word is a ſure Word that will not faile us.</p>
               <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">The ſoul hath the power of reflection.</note> Becauſe the ſoul of a man, it hath the power of reflection in it, and it is able to reflect upon it ſelf, and know what it ſelf doth, and what it ſelf hath; the ſoul of a man is a reflective being, and reflects upon its own boſom, whereby it is privy to what it thinks, and what it ſaith, and what paſſages there be therein, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>What man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>knoweth the things of a man, but the ſpirit of a man</hi>? the ſpirit of a man that is in him, knows the things that be in a man, it is privy to its own affaires, as it is with wickedneſs, ſo it is with good actions and thoughts: now for wicked courſes, we ſee that the conſcience is privy to what ſins and corruptions are in a man, as <hi>Solomon</hi> told <hi>Shimei, thou knoweſt all the wickedneſs which thy heart is privy to, that thou didſt to</hi> David <hi>my Father</hi>; thou knoweſt it, thy heart is privy to it, thou canſt reflect upon thine own boſome, and canſt tell what wretched ſpeeches thou didſt ſpeak, thou art able to utter them in order, as thou art privy to it, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7 22. oftentimes thine own heart knoweth, that thou thy ſelf likewiſe haſt curſed others; he ſpeaks of one that hath curſed, thy own heart knows that thou haſt done it ſaith he; ſo it is in good actions, and things that are in a man, a mans heart is privy to it; if a man obey the call of God, how can a man do it but he muſt know that he is effectually called? If a man do mourn for his ſins, and grieve for his iniquities, the heart knows its own bitterneſs, it is able to reflect upon what it ſelf doth; ſo if a man do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire grace, and hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, and pant after the living God, he is able to ſay I do this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1. <hi>As the hart pants after the rivers of water, ſo doth my ſoul pant after thee O God</hi>; his own heart ſhall be able to reflect upon it, if thou humble thy ſoul, and ſet thy ſelf to prayer, and approve thy ſelf to God from day to day, look into thy boſom, and there thou mayſt ſee it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obj.</note>But it may be objected then, <hi>how is it that thoſe that are effectually called, are very doubtful, and have many queſtions, and are uncertaine whether they are called or no</hi>? if it be ſo; how come theſe doubts, and troubles, and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are in the minds of good people that are effectually called of God, and we find by experience that they were effectually called?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>I anſwer, firſt we muſt know, that though the knowledge of a mans calling may be had, yet it is had by degrees, it is a gradual knowledge; a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know it all at firſt daſh, God doth not manifeſt his favour and love all at once to his people; and when he gives it, he doth not preſently tell a man what he gives him, though there be wayes for him to know it, and find it out; yet the Lord doth not open himſelf to his people all at the firſt; nay, he doth not ſo to his own Son Chriſt Jeſus, in reſpect of his humanity, as he grew in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94114:82"/>
ſtature and wiſdom, ſo he grew in favour with God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52. The divine nature manifeſted it ſelf more and more to his humane; ſo God doth manifeſt his favour and love, and openeth himſelf to his people more and more; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they grow in goodneſs, they grow in this knowledge; as they are more and more pure in heart, the more do they ſee God, and Gods goodneſs to them, and what God hath done for them; this knowledge, though it be to be had, yet it is to be had by degrees, and the people of God have it not all in one degree, ſome have it in a higher degree; and ſome in a lower; but every man hath ſome of this knowledge that he is called of God; it is impoſſible that a man ſhould be effectually called, and be wholly, and totally ignorant of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As this knowledge is gradual, ſo it is experimental;<note place="margin">The knowledge of effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</note> a man knows that he is called by experience, chiefly and mainly; as when a man knows by experience, that he comes to God and draws near to God, and that he doth abſtract himſelf from the world, and worldly wayes and practiſes, and layes aſide more and more the carnal wayes of men, and doth approach nearer and nearer unto the things of God in Chriſt: if a man hath experience of theſe things, he comes now to ſay God hath effectually called me, and hath been pleaſed to do me good; when he finds this by experience, that theſe things are wrought in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he can conclude this: at the firſt he was like a man in a viſion, he could hardly believe that God had effectually called him; as it was with <hi>Peter,</hi> when the Angel delivered him out of priſon, he was as one that had ſeen a viſion, he had not thought it had been a real thing, he could not tell what to make of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.11. but when he came to himſelf, <hi>now ſaith he I know of a ſurety that the Lord hath ſent his Angel, and delivered me out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> At firſt, he could not tell what to make of it, but afterwards, when he ſaw he was in the ſtreets, and that the iron gate opened to him of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; now ſaith he, <hi>I know of a ſurety, that the Lord hath ſent his Angel, and delivered me.</hi> So it is with the people of God; at firſt, when they hear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the Father, they know not what to make of this call at the firſt; but afterwards, when they come to ſee this luſt, and that luſt fall off; and theſe and theſe heavenly works in their ſouls; they now know of a ſurety that God hath ſent his Spirit into their ſouls, and delivered them from ſins, and Satan, and hell, and damnation, &amp;c. At firſt they were like dreamers, they were not able to ſay, whether they were called or no; as the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were delivered out of captivity, they could hardly believe it at firſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.1. <hi>When the Lord turned away the captivity of Zion, we were as thoſe that dreamed,</hi> we could hardly perſwade our ſelves, that God had delivered us out of captivity, with ſuch a mercy, ſo great a favour, ſo unlikely, ſo improb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it could never enter into their hearts almoſt; we were like thoſe that dreamed; but when they ſaw they were in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and were helped, and aſſiſted, and heard the Gentiles talke of it, and all the people runne up and down when they ſaw it was ſo, and had experience of it, then they ſaw God had done it indeed, and did believe it; ſo when a man is firſt effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to come out of his ſins, the Lord knocks off his bolts, and plucks him out of the jaile of hell, and ſets him as it were in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he is at firſt as a man that dreams, he can hardly believe it is ſo, as it was with <hi>David,</hi> when God called him to be King, he could hardly believe it, it could hardly enter into his heart, that he ſhould be King over <hi>Iſrael</hi>; eſpecially being dayly perſecute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Saul,</hi> and calamities heaping up themſelves againſt him; he could not conclude it; but when the Lord had ſet him in his Kingdome, and given him victory over his enemies, <hi>now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I know that the Lord ſaveth his anointed,</hi> now he could ſpeak it, and found it by experience, that the Lord had made him his anointed, and ſaved and delivered him from all his enemies; before he was ready to deny it, and ſay <hi>Samuel</hi> was a lyar, he had anointed him to be

King, <hi>but I ſaid in my haſt all men are lyars,</hi> but when he had experience of it, <hi>now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I know that the Lord hath ſaved his anointed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, As the knowledge of effectual calling is gradual and experimental, ſo likewiſe, it is very ſpiritual,<note place="margin">The knowledge of effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſpiritual.</note> it is a marvellous ſpiritual work, and therefore no marvel though it be ſomething inſenſible; indeed there be things in it, which are very ſencible and conſpicuous as may be, a reprobate may be gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at a Sermon, he may have his eyes broad open to ſee his ſins and iniquities, and may be wonderfully wrought upon, and may have the ſencible work of vocation, by the very Spirit of God; but the very ſpecificalneſs of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this effectual calling doth differ from all other callings; this is a marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Spiritual thing, and therefore no wonder that it is inſencible ſometimes, and many of the people of God, feare they have it not; theſe things may be done in the ſoul of a man, and a man not know it, and yet it may ſeem ſtrange, that the eyes of the blind ſhould be opened, and the feet of the lame ſhould walk, and the dead ſhould be raiſed, and the devils ſhould be caſt out! it is ſtrange I ſay, that theſe things ſhould be done in a mans ſoul, and yet the man in whoſe ſoul they are done, ſhould be ignorant of them; it is a ſtrange thing, but the works of the Spirit are wonderful ſecret, the actions of the Spirit are very inviſible; when a man humbles himſelf, and prayes, and mournes, theſe are ſencible, he knows what they are; many talke of hunger, and thirſt, and reformation, &amp;c. But to ſee the ſaving, ſanctifying, gracious work of God in theſe things, that is a marvelous hard thing to find this, and it is very ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.5. <hi>As thou knoweſt not the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones grow in the womb of a woman that is with child; even ſo thou knoweſt not the works of God, who maketh all!</hi> if it be ſo in natural things, that we know not how the bones of the child grow in the womb, much leſſe theſe things of the Spirit, ſo our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou knoweſt not whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth; even ſo is every one that is borne of the Spirit</hi>; that is, every one that is effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God; for regeneration is a part of this effectual calling; to be effectually called of God, it is the blowing of the wind, a man knows not whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nor whither it goeth; there is a world of ignorance about the wind, ſo there is about the workings of Gods holy and heavenly Spirit; when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was a working of regeneration in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> his heart was at the ſame time, ſaying, <hi>how can theſe things be?</hi> Chriſt was working theſe things in his heart, and the very ſame time when he was queſtioning, <hi>how can theſe things be?</hi> So <hi>Gideon,</hi> at the very ſame time when God ſaid unto him, <hi>the Lord is with thee; thou mighty man of valour,</hi> Judg. 6.14, 15. <hi>Gideon</hi> was doubting that the Lord was not with him, and that he had no might nor ſtrength, as our Saviour ſaid of the ſeed that was ſown in the ground, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.26. As if a man ſhould caſt ſeed into the ground, and ſleep night and day, and the ſeed ſpringeth up and grows, he knows not how: ſo ſaith he is the Kingdome of God, and as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>ſo it ſhall be at the laſt day, when Chriſt ſhall ſay come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you, for I was hungry, and ye fed me,</hi> &amp;c. But marke at the very ſame time, the righteous that did all this, and our Sauiour Chriſt did witneſs to their faces that they had done it, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall anſwer, <hi>when ſaw we thee hungry and fed thee?</hi> &amp;c. They hardly knew they had done theſe things, the actions themſelves they could not but know of, they knew they had fed and cloathed the poore children of God, but that they did it to Chriſt, for Chriſts ſake, they could hardly ſee this; when did we ſee thee thus and thus, and did ſo and ſo? that they looked at Chriſt in this, they had hardly ſo good eyes, hardly ſo good a heart: ſo I might inſtance in more, I ſay the works of God, they are marvelous ſpiritual, and of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubtil ſubſtance; they may be wrought in the ſoul of a man, and yet a man may be ſomething doubting, and queſtioning whether they be wrought in him
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94114:83"/>
yea, or no; nay, a man may be afraid they are not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another reaſon is,<note place="margin">The knowledge of a mans cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hindred for a time.</note> becauſe the knowledge of a mans effectual calling may be very much hindered for a time, pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ly in regard of loathneſs of heart to leave ſome luſt, though a mans heart may be ſubdued, and humbled for the maine; yet there may be a great deal of holding back; though a man cannot ſtand out in ſin as the wicked do yet there may be a great deal of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, and unmortifiedneſs in the children of God, and conſcience may ſee it; now when conſcience ſeeth it, conſcience will hide effectual calling from a man, and object; how can you ſay you are effectually called, when you are ſo borne down with ſuch a luſt, and hanker ſo much after it? <hi>now if our own hearts condemn us, God is greater then our hearts, and ſhall condemn us? much more</hi>; it is a pitiful thing, when a mans own heart ſhall condemn him, and his own conſcience ſhall be queſtioning whether he be right or no: ſometimes it falls out thus, even thoſe that are called; yet in regard of unmortifiedneſs, there is ſuch a deale of matter that the conſcience hath to object, that a man cannot believe indeed, and ſoundly, that he is effectually called: for at firſt, when Chriſt comes into the ſoul before it hath gotten the maſtery and victory, the Spirit doth work exceedingly in the dark, as when it works poverty of ſpirit, ſorrow for ſin, endeavour to leave all ſin, hatred and deteſtation of a mans own waye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; loathing of a mans own ſelf, ſhame, confuſion before Gods footſtoole; there is ſuch a ſmoak in the ſoul, where the Spirit doth theſe, that a man cannot ſee them; as if a man be working in a ſmoaky houſe, though he work excellent things, a man can hardly perceive what he doth; ſo there is ſuch a deal of ſmoak in the heart, ſuch a deal of corruption ſtirring, that it hides the ſight of the work of God from a man, yet the work of God goeth along; as ſuppoſe two armies in a field, and the battel be doubtful, the guns fly off, and the ſwords clatter, and the duſt ariſeth, and there is ſuch a confuſion, that neither themſelves nor others, know which way the battel will go, but ſometimes ſome fall on one ſide, and ſometimes ſome on the other ſide; and if a man ſhould ſtand on an hill, and ſee this battle, he cannot tell on which ſide it will be; ſometimes he thinks it will be on this ſide, and by and by, it is turned on the other ſide; and ſo while it is doubtful, it cannot be determined and concluded on which ſide the victory will fall. So it is with the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fleſh and the ſpirit, the war is very doubtful before the odds begin, for there is a great deal of evenneſs at firſt; nay, the Spirit ſeems to be the weaker ſide, and the fleſh to be the ſtronger, and there are many falls and foiles given to the ſoul, and the fleſh is too ſtrong; afterwards, it begins to be ſomething equal, and the battel to be poyzed; now while the battel is ſo doubtful, a man cannot tell on which ſide the victory will be, whether on the ſpirits ſide, or on the fleſhes ſide; whether on graces ſide, or on ſinnes ſide; but when the warfare is accompliſhed (I do not mean perfectly, for that will never be in this life) a man may then ſee on which ſide the victory will go; a man may ſee ten thouſand corruptions lie dead, with their throats cut, and the Spirit ſtanding triumphing and conquering more and more, we may now ſee which way the victory will go; the Spirit reigns, and grace reigns, and humility reigns, and heavenly mindedneſs reigns, and all the graces of Gods Spirit have dominion over the whole man.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon, why the knowledge of effectual calling is hindered,<note place="margin">The knowledge of our effectual calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be hindered by ignorance.</note> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ignorance; a child is a man, though he doth not know it, ſo it is with a man that is a new beginner in Religion, he is a new man, though he doth not know it, he hath that in him, that let him have but time, let him but grow, he will quickly be able to look upon it, and be able to ſee what it is; ſo it is with the people of God, they are at firſt very ignorant what God hath given them, as the Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Eph. 1.17 that God would let them be no longer children, but that God would open the eyes of their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94114:84"/>
that they might know what the hope of their calling was, that he would let them know what he had given them; they hardly knew what they had at the firſt, they had an effectual calling from God, and they had a thouſand hopes; they might hope to be ſtrengthened againſt corruptions, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in ſix troubles, and in ſeaven; they might hope when they died, to be tranſlated into the Kingdome of immortallity and glory for evermore: they had this hope, <hi>now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Lord of heaven and earth, open the eyes of your underſtanding, that you may ſee the hope of your calling, and the exceeding riches of thoſe things that God hath beſtowed upon you.</hi>

               <p>A Miniſter though he preach the wayes of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and the promiſes of the Goſpel and eternal life; yet if he preach it not in a right ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">A Miniſter ought to preach the word of God in a right manner.</note> if he carry it not as he ought to do, <hi>rightly dividing the word of life,</hi> he may do a world of miſchief, if a man preach hell and damnation, (indeed if a man be going on in his ſinnes, and be hardened in his wicked courſes, we are to preach hell and damnation to him) but if a man preach hell and damnation to a man that is ſencible of his ſins, and is of a tender conſcience, and ready to think too hardly of his ſinnes; it is as if a man ſhould take a beetle to kill a fly upon a mans forehead, to lay a heavy load upon thoſe that are not able to beare it. Miniſters may do a great deal of hurt, by preaching the law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinguiſhing, and all exceptions being ſhewed, when he hath not a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart towards thoſe whom God hath wounded, and doth not alwayes put in that that may do them good; when a Miniſter knows what it is, and hath gone through the pikes himſelf, he can the better ſtay up the ſouls of thoſe that are dejected, and yet belong to Chriſt; therefore <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>give me the way of thy ſalvation, and then I ſhall teach ſinners the way unto thee,</hi> Pſal, 51.12, 13. as who ſhould ſay, if I do not know what belongs to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Spirit, if I have not waded through theſe things, and know not how they are given, and how they are taken, I ſhall never teach ſinners the way unto thee, I ſhall never carry my ſelf aright in that way; he that is a Surgeon, had not need to have a hard hand: ſo thoſe that have a tender heart, and thoſe that are truely broken for their ſins, and are of a contrite ſpirit, a man had need deale gently with them, according to the eſtate and condition wherein they are: Miniſters many times are too blame, in not preaching Chriſt aright, as they ought to do, and ſo may be a hinderance to the comfort of their people.</p>
               <p>What a woeful thing is it when a man is not able to ſay thus, what labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths, and meanders is ſuch a ſoul in, and what heart aches, and terrible fears, and terrours, and afrightments, and quakings, and miſgivings are they ſubject unto? they muſt needs be in a miſerable, and pitiful caſe, for whether can they go? what can they hang upon to get comfort? and this is the caſe and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moſt of thoſe that are amongſt us, even of the beſt ſort, though many of them have ſome good things in them; yet who almoſt comes to know that he is effectually called of God? theſe are declining times, and languiſhing dayes, and people are marvelouſly ſcattered for want of care and diligence, and watchfulneſs, and paines-taking in the wayes of God; there is a woeful deale of unſetling, and want of groundedneſs in a good eſtate, people are very much off, and all to pieces; and that you may ſee what a woeful thing this is, do but conſider theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth accuſe.</note> Your conſciences cannot but accuſe you, you cannot ſay Chriſt bare your ſins, you know not whether you are in him or no; you know Chriſt bare the ſins of his people, but whether he bare your ſins or no that you cannot tell; all your ſins and iniquities lie upon your conſciences ſtill, though you have been bewailing your ſins and confeſſing of them, and craving forgiveneſs of them; yet all your actual ſins they ſtill ly upon your conſciences: what your conſciences could accuſe you of formerly, they accuſe you of ſtill, ſuch by-thoughts, ſuch wandring prayers, ſuch unprofitable hearing, <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a good ſaying, that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, whereof I am chief</hi>; you cannot ſay ſo, though you can ſay that of ſinners you are the chief; yet that you have obtained mercy, your conſciences will not let
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94114:85"/>
you ſay it, you queſtion whether you ever had any mercy, or any hold of the mercy of God; therefore you muſt be like a dry leafe driven to and fro, or a reed ſhaken with the wind, and as weak as water, you are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable: what a miſerable thing is this, that all a mans corruptions and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould lie upon a man, notwithſtanding all his prayers, and asking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and many tears and ſighs, that they ſhould yet lie upon him, as they do until a man knows that he is effectually called of God; all the guiltineſs lieth upon his ſoul, he cannot ſay he hath obtained mercy of God, he is without God, and without Chriſt, and is yet in his ſins for ought he knows.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As your conſciences muſt needs accuſe you,<note place="margin">No joy in Jeſus Chriſt without knowledge of our intereſt in him, &amp;c.</note> ſo likewiſe you can have no joy in Jeſus Chriſt, nor any of his promiſes, nor any of the gracious things in his Covenant, becauſe you know not whether they belong to you or no; when a man knows not a thing, he cannot have any joy in any thing, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth,</hi> a man cannot boaſt of that he knows not, can a man boaſt of to morrow? O I ſhall have a fine day to morrow, when he knows not whether he ſhall have a morrow or no; he may be dead by to morrow, or his houſe may be burnt over his head to morrow, he cannot rejoyce in it: So when a man knows not whether he be effectually called of God or no, what joy can he have? what joy can he have in Chriſt or his ordinances, when his conſcience knocks him off, and his ſoul ſtands in doubt whether theſe things belong to him or no? he may catch at theſe, as <hi>Joſephs</hi> Miſtres catcht hold on him, but he left his garment and fled away: ſo they catch at the promiſes, and theſe things, but they fly away from them, and leave them as a ſhadow, and they are as much to ſeek as before: and it will be thus as long as a man doth not go on to make his effectual calling ſure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">We cannot tell what to make of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, without this knowledge.</note> Thou canſt not tell what to make of Gods mercies and bleſſings to thee; God hath given thee many bleſſings, life and health, and means, and maintenance, and ſweetly provided for thee from thy cradle to this day, and hath recovered thee out of many ſickneſſes and afflictions, and hath given thee the means of grace, and thou haſt heard Sermon upon Sermon, and haſt had the acquaintance of his children, and haſt dwelt in the land of uprightneſs, and ſeen the Saints of God, and the examples of Gods Saints, and thou haſt had the motions of Gods Spirit from day to day, and many good things God hath vouchſafed: but while a man is queſtioning and doubting, whether he be effectually called or no, he cannot tell what to make of theſe things; whether he ſhould call them mercies or no, whether they be in wrath or no, to fat him up againſt the day of wrath, <hi>to whom much is given, of him much is required.</hi> It is ſaid of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> when the Angel ſaluted her graciouſly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, the text ſaith, <hi>ſhe was much troubled, wondring what manner of ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this ſhould be,</hi> Luk. 1.29. So when the Lord ſends abundance of ſweet mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the ſoul is troubled what mercies theſe ſhould be; are theſe mercies that come from Chriſt, and flow from Gods goodneſs, as pledges of his grace and favour or no? he is troubled, and cannot tell what to make of them, what are theſe mercies: and he is afraid he had been better to have been without them, and better he had never known them; it is a miſerable thing when a man is uncertaine of his effectual calling; for uncertaine of that, uncertaine of all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thou doſt not know what to do in time of affliction, when affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction comes, (as thou canſt not but expect it every day) yet when it comes,<note place="margin">We know not how to beare our ſelves in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> how wilt thou bear it? how wilt thou be able to ſuffer for Chriſt, and to go to priſon for Chriſts ſake; when thou doſt queſtion whether the truth ever made thee free? if thou wert able to ſpeak of God as thy Father, and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for thee, this would caſt out fears, <hi>feare not little flock, it is your

Fathers pleaſure to give you a Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12.37. but when a man queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whether God be his Father or no? queſtions whether he hath given him a Kingdom or no? yea whether any ſuch thing belongs to him? nay he thinks he is a wretch, and he ſhould wrong God, if he ſhould lay hold on ſuch things; this expoſeth a man to fears; what is the reaſon that many fall away in time of perſecution? it is becauſe they want hold of God, as <hi>Demas,</hi> what is the reaſon he could not beare <hi>Pauls</hi> afflictions, but fell away and embraced the world? it was becauſe he wanted <hi>Pauls</hi> hold: a man muſt have hold ſome where, if not on God, ſome where elſe: this is the reaſon why many break their necks, and when perſecution comes, they are troubled, and put by, and make ſhipwrack of a good conſcience, and forbear to go on in that way which they ought to go on in, and to yield to thoſe things which they know they ought not to yield to. When a man knows he is effectually called of God, this will make a man ſuffer for God, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of the ſufferings of the Saints, <hi>hereunto ſaith he were you called,</hi> knowing that Chriſt ſuffered for you; when a man is able to ſay, Chriſt ſuffered for me, and God hath effectually called me to his heavenly Kingdom, to pertake of Chriſt and his benefits, and ſufferings; now this will beare a man out, this man is able to endure the loſſe of liberty, of means, maintenance, or any thing for the Goſpels ſake; but before, what ſhall a man do in afflictions? as long as a man doth not know that he is effectually called, he doth expoſe himſelf to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and breaknecks, and who knows what may be?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Thou canſt not pray with any courage, thy prayers are but lith and lanke and weak as water;<note place="margin">We cannot pray without this knowledge.</note> thou canſt not come boldly to the throne or grace, thou art afraid thou art none of Gods, and none of Chriſts; afraid that thou haſt not received the Spirit of God, that thou mayſt be the child of God, and art afraid that thy prayers are not accepted of God, but he turnes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, thou canſt never have boldneſs, (unleſs it be the boldneſs of impudence) but never the boldneſs of confidence, <hi>how ſhall a man call upon him, on whom he hath not believed?</hi> a man without faith cannot pleaſe God, he cannot pray to God: <hi>O my Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Manoah,</hi> &amp;c. Judg. 13.8. if he had not prayed with faith, knowing that God was his God, his prayer had not had ſucceſſe; but this made him pray with the more boldneſs and ſtrength; when the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> had done praying, and God would not hear them; marke what <hi>Eliah</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am thy ſervant, Lord heare me,</hi> 1 King. 18.36. as who ſhould ſay, here be people praying, they pray they know not what, and to they know not whom; they are none of thine, <hi>but I am thy ſervant heare me Lord,</hi> he comes and acts a better part, and he will be heard before he goes, and finde accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before he departs; when a man can ſay, <hi>Lord I am thy ſervant,</hi> I am one whom thou haſt redeemed, and effectually called, heare me Lord, this man prayes indeed, he prayes to ſome purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Thou canſt not ſweetly go on in the waies of God; all the duties of Religion will be a burthen to thy ſoul,<note place="margin">We cannot go on in the waies of God wiahout this knowledge.</note> and thou wilt be weary of them, which would be light and pleaſant, if thou didſt know thy effectual calling of God: but now they will be burthenſome; and thou wilt think the Sabbath comes too often, and good duties come too often about; they come ſo faſt, that thou haſt no heart or minde to them, for want of that which ſhould ſweeten the wayes of God to a man; the knowing of God, and what he goeth about, and the knowing of him he hath to deale withal, without this a man can never go on, nay it is a wonder that thou haſt not broken thy neck before this day, that thou haſt not turned back to folly, and revolted cleane to the wayes of ſinne, that thou haſt not turned back to be a drunkard and profane perſon againe: it is a wonder that thou prayeſt in thy family, that thou haſt not given over all holy duties, and reaſſumed the works of the fleſh, and caſt off all the courſes of a godly life; it is a wonderful mercy of God, that thou
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94114:86"/>
haſt not apoſtatized Take a man that knows he is effectually called, it is a wonder to ſee that man fall; I marvel ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> that ye are ſoone removed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. A man may wonder what ayleth that man, that knows he hath an effectual call of God, and falls; that man is beſides himſelf, he is not his own man certainly; if he turne back to folly, when he knows God, to turne from his Commandements, to yeild to the luſts of the fleſh, and grow careleſſe and negligent; it is a wonder that ſuch a man ſhould be removed back, but he that never knew of any ſuch things; he hath no knowledge of Gods goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; it is a wounder that he doth not quite fall off, for the knowledge of a mans effectual calling is that which doth preſerve a man, <hi>Jude</hi> 1. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Jude a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, to them that are preſerved in Chriſt and called</hi>; when a man hath an effectual call, he hath that which ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him; therefore when a man comes to know it, what a ſweet thing is this, to be preſerved of God; to be kept and carried through, when Gods people know not this, they are ſubject to falls, and returning back without the Lords wounderful mercy.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, What difference is there between thee, and a very wretch,<note place="margin">We differ not from wretches without this knowledge.</note> as long as thou knoweſt not that thou art effectually called of God? what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thee, and one that is in darkneſs, and under the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in thy own ſence and feeling? when <hi>David</hi> was but afraid of falling into this paſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.1. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be not ſilent, leaſt I be like them that go down into the pit</hi>; he was afraid of falling into that eſtate of doubting of Gods love, and the aſſurance of his love and favour, leaſt he ſhould <hi>be like unto thoſe that go down into the pit:</hi> ſo may I ſay of thoſe that are unſetled in their minds, and do not know whether they have any good at all wrought in their hearts; what difference do you ſee between your ſelves, and thoſe that are wicked and abominable? you can hardly pitch upon any thing, wherein you differ from a wicked man, as <hi>Throgmorton</hi> ſaid, <hi>brother what will you ſay, if I dye a reprobate?</hi> ſo ſuch ſpeeches may come out of thy mouth; what will you ſay, if I dye a reprobate? as <hi>David</hi> when he had committed thoſe two foule ſins, and had blurred his evidences, and could not ſee Gods goodneſs and mercy towards him; he was faine to begin the world again, <hi>create in me O Lord, a cleane heart</hi> &amp;c. as though he were to begin from the very ground againe, as if he had loſt all, and had nothing in him; what a miſerable thing is this?</p>
               <p>Eightly, Thou art of all men moſt miſerable,<note place="margin">We are of all men moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable without it.</note> if thou knoweſt not thy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling; for other men, though they have no comfort in heaven, yet they have comfort in the world; but as for thee, thou haſt neither comfort above nor here below; the wicked of the earth, they care not for thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou profeſſeſt religion; and thy conſcience that miſtruſts, that God cares as little for thee, becauſe thou art not right; and ſo thou art as a meteor hanging in the ayre, caſt out from men and God, conſcience will not let thee cloſe with God, nor cloſe with the wicked; not with God, becauſe thou doubteſt whether thou art his, or no; not with the wicked, becauſe thou art ſtrongly convicted, that their courſes are damnable: now what comfort canſt thou have? when a man cannot tell whether to go, this is the caſe of a man, that knows not whether he be effectually called of God or no.</p>
               <p>Nay laſtly, Let me tell thee this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thou be totally uncertaine,<note place="margin">We were never effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led if we totally want it.</note> thou wert never effectually called of God to this very day, but ſtill remaineſt under the guilt of thy ſins, and the wrath of God, and the curſe of the law, and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ungodly men: for if a man be called he preſently comes to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, choſen and faithful, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. it is faith that makes up the effectual call, for this call differs from the other; in that this call makes a man come to God by faith; ſo that a man is a believer, if he be effectually called; now if a man be a believer, there is ſome knowledge in faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24. <hi>Surely ſhall

grounded, and ſee God better; when a man comes to them and tells them, you are hypocritical and ſecure, and you neglect duties in your families, and you muſt give over this and that: thoſe that are effectually called of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, will love thoſe that are moſt ſound, and moſt rip them up as it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was converted; at firſt the Diſciples queſtioned him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.26. they would not believe that he was a convert; did <hi>Paul</hi> now ſtomack them, and ſhew himſelf offended? no, <hi>Paul</hi> did go on to manifeſt the truth of his grace more and more, till at laſt it did manifeſt it ſelf: ſo thoſe that are effectually called, they love thoſe moſt that are godly, and queſtion moſt their ſincerity, and it humbles them; and they love a life to be in ſuch company, and they cannot abide thoſe that dawbe them up with untempered morter; but an hypocrite though his own conſcience queſtions it, and he is as one in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and in darkneſs, that knows not whither he goeth, yet he cannot abide another ſhould beare him down ſo.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The uncertainty of the people of God breaks their hearts,<note place="margin">The uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it breaks the heart.</note> and pulls them down before God, it burſts their hearts, and tears, and rends them, that they are not able to endure; they muſt have the favour of God, and the light of this countenance, and know where they are, and the things given them of God; and they count themſelves to have done nothing till they come to this, as <hi>David</hi> was in this caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.5. he was in a miſerable caſe, as if he were quite loſt: what did this make him do? <hi>I went to God and mourned in my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and cryed unto him,</hi> as you may ſee in the beginning of the Pſalm, it made him mourne before God, till the light of his countenance ſhined upon his ſoul; but a wretched heart that hopes he is called, though his conſcience doubts of it, this breaks not his heart, nor awakens him, but his vaine hopes build him up, and ſo he is kept off from being right as he ought to be.</p>
               <p>Againe, thoſe that are effectually called, though they be uncertaine,<note place="margin">Faith ſupplies this uncertainty</note> yet they believe they ſhall be certaine, and they follow hard after God, till he give them aſſurance, and they build upon it, that they ſhall have it one day, and this builds them up: as it was with Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi> a reverend Divine, in all his Sermons for the moſt part, he would in one paſſage or other move his people to get aſſurance, in the end he ſickened himſelf, and called for all the good people in his pariſh, and told them, you know what Doctrine I have delivered to you; and amongſt the reſt, this was one that I frequently beate upon, that you would labour to be aſſured; now I muſt tell you that I never had aſſurance to my ſelfe, but I did ever look for it; and now by the mercy of God I have it, and as I preached this doctrine to you when I was living, ſo now I ſay unto you being a dying man, labour to get aſſurance; ſo that he did verily believe that he ſhould have it in the end, though as yet he had it not, and this ſtayed his ſoul to go on in all his wayes: as <hi>David,</hi> when he was caſt down, and had much ado to keep his hold, and had no aſſurance at that time; <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul? why art thou diſquieted within me, hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my countenance and my God,</hi> Pſal. 42.11. though he were caſt down and dejected, this was his ſtay, <hi>I ſhall yet praiſe him,</hi> &amp;c. he did verily believe he ſhould rejoyce in his holy name, and overcome thoſe diſtreſſes, and have the Lords mercy ſealed to his ſoule, and have his mouth filled with his praiſes, <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul?</hi> I ſhall yet rejoyce in his holy name, I ſhall yet ſhew forth his prayſes, I ſhall yet be able to apply his promiſes, and be able to ſay he is my God and my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>Againe, the children of God, that are effectually called, though they doubt never ſo much, yet their faith is of a contrary nature to their doubting,<note place="margin">Faith contrary to doubting.</note> and excludes doubting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. If you believe and have faith, and doubt not, ſaith the text; not as though faith cannot have doubtings ſtand with it, but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94114:88"/>
faith is of that nature, as excludes, and expells doubtings, and fights againſt it, as fire againſt water, and ſuch a man fights againſt doubtings, as he would fight againſt temptations; to murther &amp; adultery; he knows that infidelity is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all ſinne, and therefore faith fights againſt doubting, and goeth to the throne of grace to be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">A child of God may doubt of his condition.</note> Though a child of God doubt of his condition; yet this is certaine, that Chriſt is the power of God to that man, though he know not whether he be effectually called by Chriſt, yet Chriſt is the power of God to his ſoul, as 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 1.24. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them which are called Chriſt is the power of God, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> He is powerful to his ſoul, for the humbling, awakening, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenning of him, for ſtrengthening of him againſt ſinne, for the making him hold out in the waies of God: he is of power to him in all his ordinances, in prayer, in hearing the Word, and in all his wayes: But it is not ſo with others that queſtion the effectual calling, Chriſt is not the power of God to them, Chriſt is of no effect to them, he may be of ſome effect, for enlightnings, and ſtirrings, and outward reformation; but to bring them to goodneſs, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs indeed, and to hatred againſt ſinne, Chriſt is not the power of God to thoſe perſons, but <hi>he is fooliſhneſs to them.</hi>

               <p>Now the next thing that I will ſhew you, is a point that hath been a little touched; but I will paſſe over what hath been ſpoken, and will ſpeak more at large of it: I deſire to ſpeak more particularly, and punctually of this ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling.</p>
               <p>And the firſt point we will take out of it is this; that effectual calling is the firſt gathering of men unto Chriſt,<note place="margin">Effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the firſt gathering of men unto Chriſt.</note> the firſt making of men to come to Chriſt, the firſt putting of a man into the eſtate of grace, it is the very portall to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the very entry into eternal life; it is the firſt bringing of a man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to have fellowſhip with him: ſo it is called in Scripture, the gathering of the elect home, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.8. <hi>I will gather</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>the out caſts of Iſrael</hi>: he propheſieth there of the effectual calling of the Gentiles; and God ſaith here, this is the firſt thing that I will do, <hi>I will gather them to my people,</hi> I will make them come home to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is ſet forth unto us by our Saviour Chriſt in two principal parables, one of the Net. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.47, 48. againe, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Net,</hi> &amp;c. So that here ſpeaking of the effectual calling of people, this is ſaid to be the firſt act of God in it; namely, the gathering of them for the Kingdom of heaven by the preaching of the Word, and this net is the Goſpel that is preached; the ſea is this world, the fiſhes are men, and the good and bad are elect, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; (not as though the elect were good before they are effectually called, but they are called good, becauſe of Gods deſignation and decree to make them good; and he looks upon them as ſuch as ſhall be good, and ſuch as he hath purpoſed to make good in his time) Now the Goſpel doth draw out of the world Gods elect (by a general call, it calls both elect and reprobate) but effectual calling, is the gathering of good fiſhes, that in the end of the world ſhall be put into veſſels by themſelves, ſo that effectual calling, the firſt act of it, is the gathering of men to God; the other parable is, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.4, 5. <hi>What man having loſt an hundred ſheep,</hi> &amp;c. all the loſt ſheep of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of Gods election that are in their loſt eſtate, as well as other people, before God takes them in hand; here you ſee the firſt act God doth towards them, before which they were altogether loſt, and are now found againe; is the fetching of them home, the taking of them upon Chriſt his ſhoulders, and bringing them home unto him: I ſay, effectual calling, it is Gods firſt making of a man to come to Chriſt, you may ſee it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>To whom coming as to a living ſtone, ye alſo are built up,</hi> &amp;c. he alludes unto their firſt effectual calling, when God did firſt deale with them, he made them to come to him to be put into this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the children of God after that they are effectually called, are ſaid to be in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94114:88"/>
this building, but this firſt act of God, is the putting of them into this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the bringing of them to be laid into this excellent edifice, for there is no ſuch building in the world, <hi>is it a building, whoſe foundation is Chriſt,</hi> and all the Saints of God are built upon it; it is the moſt admirable building in the world: now effectual calling brings a man, and layes him into this building; before a man is effectually called he is as a ſtray ſheep, as a ſheep ſcattered abroad, and roaming and ranging up and down the waies of ſin, and of death, whom the devil hath pounded as a ſtray, he is departed from God, and is roaming up and down in the world; he is in a loſt eſtate, till God come with this effectual calling and bring him home, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. <hi>For ye were as ſheep going aſtray, but are now returned to your ſhepheard</hi>; that is, ever ſince your ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling you are come home to God, that was your returning time; before you were as chickens ſubject to the kite, till this hen gathered you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her wings, and made you ſafe: ſo againe, it is called the drawing of a man unto Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man cometh to me, except the Father draweth him</hi>; that is except the Father effectually call him, he cannot come unto me; now this bare and naked calling cannot do it without drawing, therefore it is here called drawing of a man, before which a man was altogether out of Chriſt: therefore this is the firſt act God performes upon a man, to draw him to Chriſt; the man is as unwilling to come to Chriſt naturally, as any elſe; his luſts draw him another way, and he is as heavy as a milſtone, and his heart is lumpiſh to the things of God, till the father draws him, and pulls his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thoughts, and minde to come home unto Chriſt; this is the firſt act God doth; and againe, it is called the bringing of a man to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16. <hi>other ſheep alſo have I, ſaith Chriſt, which I muſt bring unto this fold,</hi> he ſpeaks here how that he means to call the Gentiles, (all the elect of God among them) now becauſe they cannot come, they have no ſtrength of their own to come; therefore he ſaith, he muſt bring them unto him.</p>
               <p>Againe, there muſt be application of Chriſt unto a man; now effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the firſt ſtep to the application of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to a man;<note place="margin">There muſt be applying of Chriſt to a man.</note> we know the Lord Jeſus is the Redeemer of the world, he hath taken away the ſinnes of the world, ſatisfied the wrath of God, wrought righteouſneſs for Gods elect, he hath overcome death, and ſinne, and Satan, and hath expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for us, and wrought an everlaſting ſalvation by his own death and paſſion, in the daies of his fleſh, Chriſt hath done this, now except this be applied to a man, what is a man the nearer? now the firſt ſtep of the application of the redemption of Chriſt is wrought by this effectual calling of a man unto him: then the Lord begins to make a man have union with Jeſus Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man was like a branch out of the vine, a dead branch that could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he could not repent, or ſerve God, or pleaſe God, or do any thing, he was eſtranged in minde and heart, and will: but when God doth effectually call a man, he doth firſt work this application of Chriſt, that a man may have union with him, and effectual calling is the firſt putting of a man into the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of grace; the firſt eſtating of a man into eternal life, it is the firſt ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing of a man into the Son of God, it is the putting on of Chriſt; the Saints of God, after they are called weare Chriſt, and walke in Chriſt: but at a mans firſt effectual calling, there is the putting of him on: it is the firſt notice that a man hath of ſalvation, the firſt tydings that comes to the ſoul of eternal redemption by Jeſus Chriſt; people heare it with their outward ears before, but never do they come to heare this in their ſouls and ſpirits till now; this is the firſt notice and inkling of it; when God doth effectually call them, then he begins this work, as <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. which Word is come unto you (ſpeaking of the Goſpel) it is come unto you, and bringeth forth fruit, ſince the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth; that is, ſince the day you were effectually called, then was the firſt time of hearing this bleſſed Goſpel; your
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94114:89"/>
ears were deaf till then, your hearts were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes till then; but when you were effectually called, then was the firſt knowing of the grace of God in truth; therefore it is called in Scripture, the firſt beginning of God to do a man good: it is the firſt beginning of all the goodneſs of God towards a man, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. being confident in this, <hi>that he which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it till the day of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; that is, he that did effectually call you, as he did begin a good work in you, and did begin to put forth his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal good will and pleaſure in you, and powred forth the beginning of his mercy, and grace and favour into your ſouls; now he that hath done this, will never leave it, till he hath brought it to perfection. So againe, it is called the firſt building of a man for heaven, this is done in effectual calling, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.14. <hi>Simeon</hi> hath declared how God at the firſt did viſit the Gentiles (ſaith the text) to take out of them a people for his name; that is, the Word had effectually called the Gentiles, and this <hi>ver.</hi> 16. is called the firſt building of the Gentiles, and the firſt plucking of them out of the other people of the world, to be a people of God. This is the firſt day of a child of Gods conſecration, it is called the forming of Chriſt in a mans heart, when a man comes to be formed in the womb of the Church, before he was a <hi>non ens,</hi> he had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world, he was but a natural man; but this new workmanſhip never came into the world till now, when a man is effectually called. So againe, it is called a mans firſt entring into Chriſt, enter in at the ſtraight-gate, as who ſhould ſay, obey the call of God, come in; a mans effectual calling, is a mans firſt entring into the eſtate of grace (I ſpeak the more largely of it, becauſe I would have you underſtand the Scripture that ſpeaks of it in theſe phraſes) I ſay, effectual calling is the firſt ſtep to the application of Jeſus Chriſt, the firſt ſtep of putting a man into the eſtate of grace, the firſt bringing of a man to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon of this is,<note place="margin">Before effectual calling no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt</note> becauſe, before effectual calling, a man was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, and had no intereſt in Chriſt, no communion or fellowſhip with Chriſt, he was altogether dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, a curſed creature, a damned creature, in the eſtate of ſinne and condemnation; whatever parts or gifts he had, all were no better then may be in a reprobate, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. before that time <hi>you were without Chriſt, aliens and ſtrangers from the commonwealth of Iſrael</hi>; may be you were civil, but you had no union with Chriſt; though you were conſtant hearers of the Word (which is a laudable thing) yet you had no union with Chriſt; may be you were decked with admirable qualities and jewels, as the Prophet ſhews; a man may be decked with golden vertues, and afterwards turne to droſſe; a man may have admirable things in him, before he hath this; but there was nothing of God in a man, nothing of Chriſt in a man, no ſaving operation of Gods Spirit at all in a man, no union with Chriſt: this is the firſt paſſage of a man from death to life, from nature to grace, from the devil to God, <hi>we are paſſed from death to life</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) this is an alluſion to a mans effectual calling, afterwards a man brings forth the fruits of life, and is alive to God; but when a man is firſt effectually called, there is his paſſage from death to life, he was a dead man before. Now this effectual calling therefore is the firſt work that is wrought in a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the firſt paſſage of a man from death to life; it is a tranſition from ſinne, hell, and damnation, to be in Chriſt; therefore marke how <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, when he had a hope that his hearers were effectually called, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.40. <hi>Save your ſelves</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from this untoward generation</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, this is your firſt parting from the world, the firſt ſhaking of hands, and bidding them farewell, if you be effectually called as you ſeem to be, <hi>come out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and ſave your ſelves from this untoward generation,</hi> this is the firſt burſting of the bonds between you and ſin; the firſt breaking of the league between you and carnal company; now <hi>ſave your ſelves from this untoward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:94114:89"/>
and make it appeare that you are called, this the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.13. that before he was called he had nothing in him at all; you have heard ſaith he, how in times paſt beyond meaſure I perſecuted the Church, &amp;c. I confeſſe I had goodly things in me, and I profitted in the jewiſh Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove many my equals in my own nation, being more qealous for the traditions of my fathers; I was marvellous ſtrict and forward, and for the letter of the law; I was marvellous zealous and blameleſſe: there were excellent good things in me; but I had nothing of Chriſt all this whyle, but when it pleaſed God, <hi>who ſeperated me from my mothers womb, and called me by his grace,</hi> &amp;c. as who ſhould ſay, now here was the firſt dawning of that bleſſed light in my heart, now begun that to appeare when God called me by his grace, and firſt revealed his Son in me, then was the deed done, and never till then: ſo alſo he ſhews that he was a curſed creature living in iniquity; it may be himſelf, and his companions, took him to be as good a man as any was in all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but ſee how he caſts his own water, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. <hi>We our ſelves alſo, were ſometimes foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, ſerving divers luſts,</hi> &amp;c. but after that the kindneſs and love of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, &amp;c. from thence he began to be in the eſtate of grace, when God called him out of that bad eſtate, when God made a breach between him, and his old courſes; when he made the firſt rent, and diviſion, and revoke, then grace began to appeare, from that time forward I was in Chriſt: thus you ſee that effectual calling is the firſt work of God in a mans ſoul, it is the firſt bringing of a man to Chriſt, and the firſt making of a man to put him on.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe before effectual calling, all was within God;<note place="margin">Effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling declared in the heart.</note> what God would do with this or that man; may be he meant to ſave him, may be he meant to dam him, may be he meant to open his eyes, may be he meant to let him go on, and live and dye in blindneſs, may be he meant to turne his heart, may be he meant to let him go on with the world; all was within his own boſom, there was no inkling, that ever this man ſhould have grace, and etern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al life, nor man, nor Angel, nor himſelf, could perceive any ſuch thing: a man might have vaine hopes, and falſe conceits; but no inkling from heaven, but he was as faire to be a reprobate, as the devils in hell? but when God effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally calls a man, then he begins to declare what he intends to this or that man, he begins to open his breſt, and ſhew what purpoſe he had in himſelf from all eternity, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.9. <hi>having made known unto us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of his will, which he purpoſed in himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. it was all in himſelf before, ſhut up in his own ſecret and privy boſom, but when God did effectually call us ſaith he, then did he make known unto us the myſtery of his will; it was a myſtery locked up, it was a ſecret thing that ever he had a purpoſe to bring us to ſuch things, to let us ſee ſuch mercies; now here was the breaking open of this ſeale, now it began to ſhew it ſelf, now the Lord declared what purpoſe he had in himſelf, now he makes it appeare, that <hi>we are his elect and choſen, and his beloved ones,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Romans, to all that are at Rome, beloved of God called to be Saints,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 1.7. you will ſay, how do you know we are beloved ones? If you be called to be Saints, I dare be bold to ſay, you are beloved of God, God hath made it to appeare that he loves you: I could not ſpeak thus before, you were as vile drunkards and profane perſons, as any were in <hi>Rome</hi>; but now I dare be bold to ſay, you are <hi>beloved of God</hi>; nay more, <hi>grace and peace be to you from God the Father, and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> you are called to be Saints, and if you are once called, then it doth appeare you are the beloved of God; it is Gods golden ſcepter, no man could tell whom the King would call to him, no man could tell, this or that man ſhould be called rather then another, till he held out his golden ſcepter, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 4.11. So it is with God; when God doth hold out this golden ſcepter to a man, now a man hath an inkling that the Lord hath choſen him, and will be good to him,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94114:90"/>
and hear him, and help him in all his wayes and pardon him, and do every good thing for him, as <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.13. (I uſe it onely as a ſimilitude) our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt was there in the mount, and the people were below in the vally, now ſaith the Text, <hi>he called unto him, whom he would,</hi> and they came unto him; he was in the mount, and all his Diſciples were in the vally; now no man could tell, who ſhould be an Apoſtle: <hi>Andrew</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>come up</hi>; now he was one who ſhould be next no man could tell, <hi>Peter come up,</hi> then they knew he was one too, &amp;c. Therefore this calling was the firſt intimation of Chriſts purpoſe to them, it was ſecret in his own boſom, whom he would make Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles before; but when he called them, it came forth, <hi>Andrew</hi> ſees he is the man, and <hi>Peter</hi> ſees he is the man, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">All works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the work of effectual calling.</note> Becauſe all other works, follow this work of effectual calling; there be abundance of works that God doth work upon his people, that he hath choſen to his Kingdom and glory; he doth juſtifie them, and pardon their ſins, and ſanctifie and cleanſe them from iniquity, makes them grow in grace, hears their prayers, makes them depend upon him in all their needs and neceſſities, he makes them deny themſelves, and works the grace of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more and more, and a trade of godlineſſe, and a courſe of holineſs and piety; now not one of theſe works are, till a man is called, <hi>all things work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the beſt to thoſe that are called,</hi> Rom. 8.28. this is a leading work, now all works come in; now the word works, and prayer works, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament works, and afflictions work, and ſinne works, when a man is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called; this is the great wheele of motion, now <hi>all things work together for the good of him that is called according to Gods purpoſe</hi>: this is the firſt ground work, the firſt breaking of the ice, the firſt ſetting of a man forth towards heaven; therefore we ſhall ſee when the Apoſtle is to write to any man or Churches, commonly before ever he bids them do this or that, the firſt thing he ſpeaks to them about, is this; he tells them they are <hi>effectually called,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. afterwards he bids them <hi>yield their members, as weapons to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and adviſeth them to walk in the Spirit, and give up their bodies and ſouls, as a living ſacrifice to God; <hi>not to be conformed to the world, but to be transformed in the ſpirit of their minds, and to walk in love, and redeeme the time</hi>; and abundance of other works he ſets them about: but firſt of all he names their effectual calling; as who ſhould ſay, I take it for granted that you are called; it is a folly for me to bid you do this or that, if you were not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, elſe I ſhould alwaies be beating, what damned and miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures you are; ſhall I bid you pray, and profeſſe Religion, and you not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, you can never do this: therefore this is the firſt thing, <hi>you are called of God.</hi> So when he writes to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2. <hi>called to be Saints,</hi> it is the fore front of all his Epiſtles; as who ſhould ſay, I ſhall ſpeak abundance of things to you, but you are called of God; therefore he bids them do this and that, and the other, all works come after this effectual calling, as it is in other particular callings; ſuppoſe a man be called to be an Apoſtle, all the acts and performances that an Apoſtle doth, they come after he is called, elſe they are not the acts of an Apoſtle, but a medler; therefore in all the Apoſtles writings, when he doth the acts of an Apoſtle, to exhort them, and rebuke them in the Lord, he ſhews his calling, <hi>Paul called to be an Apoſtle</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, do not judge amiſs of me; you may think, what have I to do with you? we have a Miniſter already, what have you to do in <hi>Corinth?</hi> meddle with your own places where you live; miſtake me not, I am called to be an Apoſtle; ſo that his calling to be an Apoſtle, is before all other actions; firſt he is called, and then exhorts, inſtructs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, &amp;c.</p>

51, 52. it is the prophecy of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> though he ſpake he knew not what, yet he ſpake right, as the place doth imply, <hi>it is expedient, ſaith he, that one man ſhould dye for the people, and gather together the children of God that were ſcattered</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, this is the firſt act that the Lord Jeſus doth upon thoſe that are his, they were ſcatterred till then; and now when he comes effectually to call them, he puts his firſt act upon them, and gathered them to himſelf; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is called a drawing unto God, <hi>Joh</hi> 12.32. <hi>When I am lifted up, I will draw all men unto me</hi>; that is, when he was lifted up upon the croſſe, he would call the Gentiles, all his elect people unto him; he doth not ſpeak of all men, but he ſpeaks of the elect, he will draw all them to him, he will call them home. So againe, it is called in Scripture, <hi>the entring of a man into Chriſt,</hi> as a Scholar that is admitted into a Colledge, his name is firſt entred; ſo effectual calling is a mans firſt entring into the Schoole of Chriſt, into the family of Chriſt; when a man is firſt entred into that bleſſed ſociety, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.9. <hi>I am the doore, if any man will enter by me, he ſhall be ſaved, and go in and out, and finde paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Againe it is called a mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. <hi>untill the fulneſs of the Gentiles is come in,</hi> that is, until the elect Gentiles be effectually called; now becauſe he would expreſſe what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling is, he calls it the coming of a man in; he was without before, as other dogs were, that had no part in the tree of life, no intereſt in the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purchaſed, as far off as thoſe that were reprobates; but now is his coming in: and ſo I might inſtance in other names.</p>

So when God doth effectually call a man, he doth give him this call once for all, he gives him faith once for all, and grace once for all; but you
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94114:92"/>
will ſay when God gives grace he reneweth it every day, and affoards new helps, and new aſſiſtances; 'tis true, and without this, no man can ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſupply from God continually, the very elect could not perſevere unto the end; but yet God gives them no new graces, he gives them more of the ſame love to God, and more of the ſame faith, and more of the ſame deſires, and endeavours after goodneſs; but the thing is never to do againe, as Chriſt ſaith to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him ſhall never thirſt</hi>; when Chriſt brings a man to this well; and gives him the firſt draught, he ſhall never thirſt more, he ſhall never have it to do againe; God doth it once for all? that is, that man that is once effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, is never uncalled, if he hath once faith given him, he is never totally deprived of it, it is once delivered to him, for all times afterwards: now this ſhews us, that it concerns us nearly to be aſſured of this, when a man hath done a thing, that can be but once done, it muſt ſtand for all; and the thing is good and neceſſary, would he not be ſure of it? ſuch a thing is effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">All the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, meet in a mans effectual calling</note> Becauſe all the promiſes meet here, as all the ſtreams meet where the fountaine opens its ſelf, ſo all the promiſes of God meet in a mans effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al calling; when God effectually calls a man, he ſaith, take my Son, come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, caſt thy ſelf upon me; and be ruled by me, he doth this effectually, and ſaith thus to him; thou ſhalt have my Son, and with him all things, pardon of thy ſins, the peace of a good conſcience; I will give thee power againſt all thy luſts, the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt thee; I will keep thee here in this world <hi>through faith unto ſalvation, take my yoak upon thee, and learne of me,</hi> and thou ſhalt have all theſe things, and therefore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.9. <hi>Bleſſed is he that is called to the ſupper of the Lamb,</hi> theſe are the true ſayings of God, as who ſhould ſay, though you may queſtion it, and doubt it, and call it into controverſy, I tell you it is true; theſe are the true ſayings of God, and you may build your ſelf upon it, you are bleſſed if you be once effectually called of God, all the promiſes of God belong unto you, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>the promiſes belong to you, and to your children, to as many as God ſhall call</hi>; all that are called of God, all the promiſes of God belong unto them; as ſoon as ever Chriſt hath effectually called a man, he opens his liver-veine, and lets out all his heart blood upon him, all belongs to that man, it is like the firſt joyning of hands between man and wife, <hi>with all my goods I thee endow:</hi> when God firſt takes a man out of the world, to live unto him, and ſeek his Kingdom, and labour to pleaſe him, and from this time forward to believe in his name, with all his goods he him endows, he gives him title to eternal life, to all the helps and furtherances, that ever he ſhall need for this life or eternal life, he ſhall have all: now what a needful thing is it, when all the promiſes meet here, as at a fountaine head; here is the ſpring let forth, how needful is it I ſay, that a man ſhould labour that he be effectually called of God; we ſhould look for it eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and pray to God to have it, and ſtrive to have it appeare unto us, that our calling is ſound: here is the very in-let of all the comforts of the holy Ghoſt, and all the hope that the ſoul can have, here is all the ſatisfaction and content of the ſoul of man; they are beſtowed upon a man, when he is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, there is a way ſet open unto him, that he may have the ſame.</p>

               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the only means to go forward</note> This is the only way to go forward; a man cannot go forward, there is no proceeding unleſſe the beginning be well done, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>leaving the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, taking it for granted, that you are effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God, that the principals of Religion are laid in your ſouls, let us go on unto perfection, let us wax better and better, and pray to God that we may encreaſe in grace, let us walk in holy and ſincere obedience to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, let us labour and ſtrive to out-ſtrip our ſelves, and amend our ſelves from day to day; if we have laid the foundation well, if that be firſt well laid, a man may go on to perfection, a man cannot otherwiſe go on well; nay, the further a man goeth on, the more miſchief he pulls upon his ſoul.</p>

firſt parents ſaw they were naked, and then came forth the promiſe of the ſeed of the woman: ſo firſt God convinceth a man of ſinne, and then of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>Joh</hi> 10.8. firſt he convinceth a man of his ſins, and then ſhews him where righteouſneſs is to be had, how he may have righteouſneſs, and peace of conſcience, and be juſtified before God.</p>
                  <p>Now for the opening of the point, I will ſhew you three things: firſt, that it is thus, God doth firſt prepare a man, before he calls him effectually. Secondly, the reaſons why the Lord doth thus: and Thirdly, the uſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Proofe 1. from texts full of terror.</note> That it is true, the Lord doth prepare a man, before he doth effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally call him, either more or leſſe; there muſt be a work of the law one way or other, and to prove this: firſt, wherefore elſe are thoſe many texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, full of terrours, of ſharp arrows, and fierce pellets againſt ſinners? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are theſe but to terrifie a man, and pull a man down? and that we that are Miniſters of God, ſhould fling them againſt ſinners, and the Lord looks that men ſhould tremble, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6, 8. The Lord ſaith there, <hi>ſhall a trumpet be blown in a City, and people not be afraid?</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>When the Lyon roars, who will not feare</hi>? all thoſe terrible texts of Scripture, they are the roaring of the Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> againſt all that go on in ſinne; now who would not tremble ſaith the Prophet? 'tis true many wicked and ungodly men do not tremble a jot almoſt; but ſome ſhall tremble, God looks upon ſome, and they ſhall tremble at his Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 From the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits office.</note> Becauſe this is the office of the Spirit of God, to be a Spirit of bondage, before he be the Spirit of adoption; he was ſo to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he was the Spirit of bondage in their hearts, before he was the Spirit of adoption, to make them cry Abba Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>You have not received againe the Spirit of bondage to feare,</hi> you did receive it once, but you have not received it againe; but now you have received, <hi>the Spirit of adoption, whereby you cry, Abba Father.</hi> Now to deny this doctrine, is to deny the maine office of the Spirit, which is dangerous, for every man naturally is a bedlam: now how are bedlams tamed? they are beaten and whipt, and kept under till they come to themſelves: ſo the Lord deals with a man as with a bedlam; he comes with the Spirit of bondage, flinging in ſlaviſh terrours and fears, and what a miſerable creature he is, this ſin and the other ſinne, and the wrath of God is come out againſt him; the Spirit takes a man down from day to day, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermines him and breaks his ſtomack; and then afterwards, when he hath wrought that work, he comes to be the Spirit of adoption, to teach him to cry Abba Father.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 Becauſe the Goſpel follows the law.</note> Becauſe the Goſpels turne is not come, till the Law hath done his part; this was the method that Chriſt was anointed to obſerve in his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he would firſt have a man bruiſed and broken, and captivated, and blind, and poore, and in miſery, and then he preacheth the Goſpel to him, as you may ſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.19. The Spirit of the Lord hath anointed me to this order, ſaith he; it is an excellent place for this purpoſe, to ſtop the mouthes of thoſe that hope there is an eaſier way; he will preach the Goſpel, and liberty, and comfort, and enlargement; but he will have a broken heart firſt, and a tender Spirit firſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4 From Chriſts deſign in coming.</note> You may ſee an expreſſe place of our Saviour Chriſt, that he came to ſave that which was loſt: firſt a man ſhall be in a loſt eſtate, and he ſhall be in a wilderneſs, and he ſhall have his ſinnes diſcovered, and his miſery, and then the Lord comes to thoſe that he hath a minde to do good unto, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12, 13. ſaith he, <hi>They that are whole need not the Phyſitian, but they that are ſick,</hi> he means to deale with a man as a Phyſitian, a man muſt be ſick before he comes to him, the Phyſitian gives Phyſick to none till they be ſick: now till a man is ſick of his ſinnes, till they are the diſeaſes of his ſoul, till he is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94114:94"/>
in torments and miſery, the Lord Jeſus ſaith, he will not be his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5 From Gods working with believers after groſſe ſins.</note> Becauſe God doth ſee it fitting, to deale thus with his converted ones when they fall into ſome foule ſinne, and groſſe iniquity, the Lord is pleaſed to go this way to work, even towards his own converted ones; when they ſinne, not onely through invincible infirmities, and through tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but when they grow ſtubborn, when they fall into ſome horrible iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Lord doth uſe to go even legally to work with them, though they lie under grace; therefore much more towards thoſe that never yet were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace, that never had any free Spirit, that never had any part of an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, that were never yet wrought to be led by the faire means of grace; if God work ſo with thoſe that he hath given in ſome meaſure his grace, and given in ſome meaſure a portion of his free Spirit unto; if when they ſinne, and ſinne foully, it is not all the promiſe of the Goſpel, all the covenant of Grace, that will raiſe them up againe, and make them walk before God with holineſs, and zeale, and fervency; then much more will he deale thus with thoſe that never had any grace at all: Thus <hi>David</hi> cryeth out, thy fears have got hold upon me, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.4. his ſinnes were as an heavy burthen unto him, too heavy for him to beare; he did not onely ſet his ſinnes before him, they were not onely the objects before his eyes; ſo they are to a man that walks in the comforts of the Spirit; they are before his eyes, every man that walks in obedience, he hath his ſinnes before him at times to humble him, and keep him low, and make him ſtill hang upon Chriſt, and depend upon him, and eſteem Chriſt precious to you that believe Chriſt is precious, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.5. But now he ſets them before them, not only as objects, but layeth them as loads upon their backs, that their ſins ſhall not only be ſeen, but felt by them: now this is a legal work, when any part of a mans ſinnes and miſery lyes upon his ſoul and conſcience; 'tis true, God never ſhews ſinne to the utmoſt to his people, he never layeth all the load; if God ſhould ſtirre up all the ſtink of uncleanneſs that is in his people; if God ſhould diſcover to them all the ugly looks of their ſinnes, they were not able to beare it: As a good man ſaid, when I ſee my ſelf, ſaith he, it is an intollerable horror to me, it makes my very fleſh to ſhiver and my ſoul to quake, to think what I am in my ſelf. Nay, if God ſhould lay all the burden of ſinne upon the ſoul, the children of God their Spirits would faile, they were not able to ſubſiſt under it; but thus farre the Lord reveals their ſinnes, and layeth load upon them, to break their hearts, and rend the kall of their ſpirits, to tame, and pull them to him, to bring them under, and to make them beare his yoake.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">6 From Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture examples.</note> Becauſe, whereſoever the Scripture doth ſpeak at large, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly of any mans converſation; we do not read of any converſation, but it was after this manner, by revealing their miſery in themſelves, and charging their ſinnes upon their ſouls: Thus the Lord dealt with <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> he did mightily afflict him, he opened his eyes by outward afflictions, and then charged his miſery upon his ſoul: Thus the Lord dealt with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as with an untamed heifer, and then he cryed out, <hi>Convert me O Lord, and I ſhall be converted,</hi> Jer. 31.18. And thus the Lord dealt with the woman in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that waſhed his feet with her tears; you muſt think it was not ordinary ſorrow, that could make her tears trickle down in ſuch plentiful manner as to waſh his feet, thus it was with her before ſhe had the pardon of her ſinnes; and thus it was with <hi>Peters</hi> hearers; he told them, that they were the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of the Lord Jeſus, and then they were pricked in the hearts; before he did preach the Goſpel, and bid them repent evangelically: Thus did <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt deale; firſt, he comes with the axe and hews at them, and layes at the root of the tree, and then he tells them of Chriſt, <hi>there comes one after me, that is more worthy then I,</hi> &amp;c. Firſt, he did lay about him to detect their miſery,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94114:94"/>
and reveale to their wretched eſtate, and then at the laſt he preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and poured in oyle: So it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> the Lord made it appeare that he fought againſt heaven, and perſecuted the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and he laid him flat upon his face; nay, he ſmote him with blindneſs, and ſent him crying and roaring, and made him glad to go to their houſes, whom before he had perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and ſcorned; and afterwards he told him that he was a choſen veſſel: ſo the Lord dealt with the jaylor, he rent, and tore him, and burſt him in peices, as if all the devils in hell were about him; and afterwards he ſaith, <hi>Believe in the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>I anſwer, This is a poore Argument, that becauſe the Scripture doth not ſay, this work of the Law did not go before, therefore it did not go before: a man cannot make ſuch an inference, becauſe the Scripture doth not repeate it; it is ſufficient that the Scripture hath related it in other places, how the Lord brings his people home, and what method he uſeth in doing them good: firſt, he uſeth the work of the Law, and then of the Goſpel; the Lord ſets it down in other places, and therefore though he omits it here; it doth not follow there was no ſuch thing in <hi>Lidia</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and I will prove there was in both places, that there was a preparatory work in <hi>Lida,</hi> is plaine by two Arguments, for the Scripture ſheweth, that before this evangelical work came, ſhe was a worſhipper of God before, noting there was ſomething went before this opening of her heart; there was a work of the Law before, for this was the firſt work of the Goſpel, when God opened her heart: another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in the 13 <hi>ver.</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>Lidia</hi> before ſhe heard this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, reſorted to <hi>Paul</hi> to the Rivers ſide to pray; therefore it is a plaine ſign that ſhe was wrought upon by a preparatory work, before <hi>Paul</hi> converted her, and wrought upon her by the Goſpel: And then for <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his friends, for <hi>Cornelius</hi> himſelf; it is a plaine caſe, that he was wrought upon before the Holy Ghoſt fell upon him; for in the beginning of the Chapter, it is ſaid he was a devout man, one that called upon God, and ſet times apart, extraordinarily to ſeek God, before the Holy Ghoſt fell upon him, and no queſtion it was ſo with his kinsfolks; for whom did he call to meet with <hi>Peter</hi> at this Sermon, but thoſe that he had been converſant with? therefore it is likely, they were wrought upon before as well as <hi>Cornelius,</hi> otherwiſe he would have had little hope to get them thither: well then, the firſt thing we have proved that God doth thus prepare his people legally, before he doth effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally call them.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond thing: why God thus?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. To declare Gods juſtice.</note> and the firſt Reaſon is, becauſe God will declare and ſhew forth his juſtice; for as God did ſhew forth his juſtice in the Redemption of his people; ſo he will alſo in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Redemption, ſhew ſome part of his juſtice; in the Redemption of the World he poured forth the full viols of it, he required full ſatisfaction of the Lord Jeſus, now he will not let juſtice be utterly ſwallowed up of mercy when he comes to apply this, but juſtice ſhall ſhew his face, and they ſhall come to ſee what Chriſt hath done for them; and miſeries he hath waded through for a man, he ſhall ſee that God is a juſt and righteous God, that hates ſinne, and abhors iniquity: what a conſuming fire he is againſt them that diſobey him; the Lord makes his juſtice appeare in the application of Redemption: you ſee how he takes up his people upon Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the curſes of the Law, and makes his own people to ſay Amen, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94114:95"/>
to them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. Here he delivers the curſes, and makes procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his juſtice; and ſaith he, I will have all the people ſay Amen; he will have all lye a bleeding under this curſe; and marke what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in the firſt verſe of the next Chapter, <hi>it ſhall come to paſſe, if thou wilt hearken to the voyce of the Lord, he will ſet thee up above all nations</hi>; here comes in a fine Sunſhiny day afterwards; the Lord will have his people ſee his juſtice, and what it is to be delivered from ſinne; the Lord will make them ſee that he is a juſt and righteous God, and that there is no ſinning againſt him, there is no living in his ſight, no entring into his Kingdom without righteouſneſs; I muſt be a new creature, elſe I ſhall be conſumed; he chargeth theſe things upon the ſoul, and that ſoundly too; becauſe now he will lay down the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a godly life, the ſoul ſhall have need of this point as long as he lives, to remember that God is a righteous God; he hath found him to be a juſt God againſt ſinne, though he be a gracious and merciful God to them that truly repent, and ſet themſelves to obey his Name: yet the ſoul ſeeth there is no living in ſinne, no following after a mans own luſts, and the ſoul never loſeth this; for though the ſoul many times, through temptations may be carried away, yet he ſhall never be under that former blindneſs he was in; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ignorant of God; never think ſo meanly and ignominiouſly of God as he did in his unregeneracy; he ſtill knows that God is a ſevere God and there is no expecting of mercy at his hands, without holineſſe and righteouſnes; if God ſhould ſmother up the work all at firſt, juſtice would not be ſeen: as we ſee it is among men; ſuppoſe a baſe fellow hath wronged a noble man, may be the noble man means to pardon him; but yet he will have him ſmart for it, and feele and know what it is to diſpleaſe and wrong, and impeach ſuch a great man as he. So if the Lord ſhould ſmother up the buſineſs preſently, as ſoon as ever he ſends the word to a man preſently convert a man and pardon him, and give him true and ſaving faith, juſtice would not be ſeen; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord firſt tramples upon a mans neck, and ſhews him his filthineſs, and caſts him out of the Camp; as the Lord ſaid concerning <hi>Mirian,</hi> ſhe is unclean, carry her out of the Camp; ſo the Lord flings a perſon forth like a curſed damned creature, as if he would take him by the heeles, and fling him down to hell, and never look upon him, and then he takes him in; thus the Lord tells his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.21. <hi>There is none but me, a juſt God and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>: firſt, he makes them ſee that he is a juſt God, and then he makes them ſee that he is their Saviour and Redeemer; and notwithſtanding his juſtice and ſeverity againſt ſinne and iniquity, yet he will give his grace and mercy to them that repent, and humble themſelves under his hand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">1. To ſweeten mercy.</note> The Lord doth this, becauſe he would ſweeten his mercy to the ſoul, as you may ſee how he dealt with the Prophets widow; he let her credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors arreſt her firſt, and ſeize upon her two ſons for bondmen, and then he wrought a wonder for her, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.1. now this mercy was ſweet, and came in due ſeaſon, <hi>I was in miſery, and the Lord helped me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, it came in a time when I had need of it: The Lord deales, as it is reported King <hi>James</hi> did at the beginning of his reign, when ſome of his Nobles had been offenders, he let the law proceed againſt them, till they were brought to the ſcaffold, and their heads laid upon the block, and then ſent a pardon, and now a pardon was acceptable indeed. So the Lord deales with his people, he lets the law looſe upon the ſoul, yea, and the devil too, many times, and he rends them, and teares them as a Lyon, and lets them look when they ſhall periſh, and layes their heads upon the block, and then ſends hope of a pardon, and forgiveneſs of ſinnes: what a ſweet ſtaying of <hi>Abrahams</hi> hand was that, when the knife was juſt ready to be ſtuck in <hi>Iſaacks</hi> throat? ſo when the knife of Juſtice is ready to be ſtuck into a mans throat, and he is ready to periſh for ever; now mercy will be ſweet mercy, now it will be mercy indeed,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94114:95"/>
                     <hi>This is the time of love, ſaith God,</hi> Ezek. 16.8. When God had laid his people a bleeding in their goare blood, now he paſſeth by, and ſaith, <hi>This is a time of love</hi>; he laid them in their blood and filthineſſe, he laid them vile and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in themſelves, and now ſaith he is the time of love. Now the mountaines drop with ſweet wine, as the Prophet ſpeaks, what is the reaſon that people do not taſte any ſweetneſſe in the Goſpel, and Sacraments, and Ordinances of Chriſt? Alas, they were never ſenſible of their ſinnes, therefore the Lord doth thus to make his mercy ſweet to his people, that they may prize it, and eſteeme it, and make good account of it from day to day.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. That he may bring men home to Chriſt.</note> the Lord doth this, that he may fetch his people home to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for before they will not come to God, they will not come at him, as the Prophet ſpeaks, but when they are in the Margent of Hell ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and have no hope to hold to, nothing to truſt to, they are quite and cleane at a loſs, and know not whither to go; now this makes them come home: as it is ſaid of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> he ſent once to <hi>Joab,</hi> but he would not come to him, yea, twice and he would not come; but when he ſet his Barley field on fire, then he came. So the Lord ſets his peoples hearts on fire, he fires their conſciences, and their very bowols, and makes their ſoules ake within them, for want of mercy, and grace, and favour, for want of power againſt their ſinnes, for want of Gods helping and aſſiſting of them from day to day, and this makes them glad to come home to him. You know how long it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the woman in the Goſpel would come to Chriſt, ſhe was ſick twelve years and had ſpent all her living upon the Phyſicians and could have no help, now ſhe came to Chriſt when ſhe was quite ſpent, and her patience was come to the utmoſt, ſhe was a dead woman if ſhe came not to Chriſt, all the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans could not help her, now ſhe comes home to Chriſt; As it was with <hi>Agur</hi> when he ſaw his brutiſhneſſe, this drave him to <hi>Ithiel</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>cal,</hi> Prov. 30.1, 2. that is, to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as it is with a Coney when ſhe is perſued by a Dogge, then ſhe runnes to her burrough; When <hi>Naomi</hi> was bereft of Husband, Children, Meanes, and Maintenance, and heares there is plenty in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhe returns preſently; ſhe might have gone long before, but ſhe wanted a ſcourge and whip to ſend her home, but when ſhe had loſt all, and was ready to ſink, and heard good tidings from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> now ſhe makes ſpeed thither preſently: as the Lord ſpeaks, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6. <hi>I will hedge her wayes with thornes;</hi> how doth the Lord make the poore Church here come home to him, that was her husband and beloved, from whom ſhe was gone a whoring? God takes this courſe, he <hi>hedgeth her wayes with thornes,</hi> ſhe would have reſts, and friends, and comforts, and ſomething to hang upon, but God knocks her off from all, and now ſhe will returne to her husband again; ſo the Lord to make his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtoop to his yoake, he ſhews them their miſery, and worries them, and wearies them, that they can hold out no longer, and then down go their bucklers, and now, ſpeak Lord, thy ſervants hear, now they are willing to hear him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. To wean men from ſin.</note> God doth it that he may weane his people from ſinne, and take off their hearts from their own wayes: for a man is marvellous eager of ſinne by nature, and will not let it go, and will not part with it by no meanes, his heart is ſet upon his luſts, and he will have them, though he hath hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with them; when the Lord calls upon them to walk in his wayes, they ſay they will not walk therein, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16. People will not be diligent in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and hold cloſe to God, they will not be ſtrict in their wayes as the preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Goſpel teacheth them, now the Lord breaks in upon them in this faſhion, and makes them willing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As a man deales with a young horſe or colt, when a man would tame a colt that is luſty, and head-ſtrong, and violent, he carries him out, may be, and makes him apprehend in his fancy, that he will ride him againſt ſtone-walls, and carries him, may be, into Quagmires, and Muds,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94114:96"/>
and rotten Fennes, and there he makes him go, and ſpurs him, and beats him, and raines him, and ſnafles him, and thus he breakes his ſtomack, and at laſt he will beare the ſaddle, and carry a man quietly; ſo the Lord Jeſus doth with a poor creature, he caſts off the bonds of Chriſt, and though the truth begins to work upon his conſcience, he throwes out the arrow againe, and heales him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with vaine healings; now the Lord breakes a mans heart, and opens a peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole into hell, as though he would throw him in quick thither, and ſhews him his miſery to the life, and to the quick, and ſo makes them come off; as the Lord dealt with <hi>Moſes</hi> when he would make him circumciſe his ſonne, he was loath to diſpleaſe his wife, ſhe was againſt it, being a <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> woman, and he was loath to have her ill-will, and therefore deferred it, now what courſe took God with him, the Lord met him, and would have ſlaine him; the Lord made as though he were his enemy, and would ſlay him; and now he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do it; ſo the Lord deals with a ſtubborne ſoul if it belongs to him, he will overcome his heart, and make him let fall his ſinnes, he will make as though he would ſlay him, he will make him a weary of keeping his luſts, before he hath done with him: The Lord deales in this caſe as he dealt with the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins, they would not ſend home the Arke, what courſe did he take to make them ſend it home, and ſend it home in pomp, and great reſpect: God did fling down Dagon which was their chief Idoll, and the Lord ſmote them with <hi>Emerods.</hi> And now they think with themſelves, let us ſend home the Arke of the Lord, and how ſhall we ſend it home?

                  <p>Firſt, the offering of Chriſt and his merits,<note place="margin">1. Offering of Chriſt</note> the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive propounding of Chriſt and his benefits; when Chriſt comes and offers himſelf to a man in the Goſpel, <hi>he came to his own,</hi> John 1.11. <hi>but his own received him not,</hi> he came and offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them, <hi>I am the way, the truth and the light,</hi> I am the Meſſias, and the Saviour of the world, and I have eternal life, and here I am, take me, and all with me; this is the firſt thing in Effectual Calling, the objective propounding of Chriſt to a man.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is the receiving of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2. The recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt.</note> not only the offering of Chriſt to a man, for ſo he offers himſelf to thoſe that are not of God, even to all, but in Effectual Calling, as there is an offer on Gods ſide, ſo there is a reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on Gods ſide; <hi>as many as received him, &amp;c.</hi> John 1.12. <hi>they received him,</hi> theſe two now make up Effectual Calling, the offering of Chriſt and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of him, when Chriſt calls a man to him, and he anſwers to his call; thus you ſee the parts of Effectual Calling.</p>
                  <p>Firſt to ſpeak of the firſt, the objective propounding of Chriſt and all the things of Chriſt to a man, and this hath two degrees like the morning light that hath two parts, the dawning of the day, and the Sunnes ariſing;<note place="margin">Two parts or degrees of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Chriſt. 1. General.</note> ſo there are two parts in this objective propounding of Chriſt to the ſoul; the firſt is that general propounding of him to every creature; now the ſoul thinks what to every creature, then it is propounded to me as well as to any body elſe; but the effectualneſs of this call is, that it breeds the ſeeds of grace in a man, it breeds ſaving deſires, and ſaving longings, and ſaving, and kindly mournings for the want of this ſweet good; when it ſees ſuch an excellent good, and a poſſibility of it, and that it is propounded to every creature, then the ſoule thinks I may be one as well as any body elſe, and ſo the ſoul longs after it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is the perſonal propounding of this to thoſe that have theſe ſeeds of Grace; the firſt was general, to one as well as to another,<note place="margin">2. Perſonal.</note> but now this is to this mans perſon rather then to any body elſe; and now the ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to think ſeriouſly this propoſition is to me, this tender is to me; I hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and thirſt, and long, and therefore this belongs to me, and the effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this call is to make the ſoul come to Chriſt, and caſt himſelfe upon him by faith, theſe are the parts of propounding of Chriſt, and both theſe are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; the firſt is the external part of it by the Word,<note place="margin">2. Both, 1. External. 2. Internal.</note> the other the internal part of it by the Spirit. Now we are to ſpeak of the firſt of theſe, how the Word works this general call, and for this I have choſen this text; <hi>Whereunto he hath called you by our Goſpel, &amp;c.</hi> For the coherence of theſe words in the former verſes, the Apoſtle had told the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> of a woful falling away that ſhould he among all viſible Churches in the whole world almoſt, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94114:98"/>
there ſhould be a general defection, unleſſe of Gods Elect, and they ſhould have fearful declinings, and he ſheweth that the power of the Devil and his inſtruments ſhould be the cauſe of this falling away, he ſhould come with ſtrong deluſions, and then the juſt cauſe why God doth ſuffer the Devil and his imps to bring this about, <hi>that all they might be damned that had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe</hi>; the Lord would have them damned, and this made the Lord ſuffer the Devil to work Apoſtacy, and declining to them. Now this is a fearful thing, and therefore in the next place he comes to comfort the <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> for they for their part, the godly amongſt them need not to be diſmayed for fear of falling away, as if they ſhould not hold out, but he would have them encouraged that they ſhall ſtand out for ever, and he comforts them by two Arguments: Firſt, by Gods predeſtination of them to life from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, God hath choſen you to Salvation from the beginning; and then he laies down the meanes God had appointed for the attaining this ſalvation, and that was through Sanctification in the Spirit, as who ſhould ſay, 'tis true, there ſhall be ſuch a falling away, but you that are godly need not be deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, for God hath choſen you from all eternity, and therefore will ſanctifie you, and keep you through his mighty power unto ſalvation, that you ſhall not fall away. The ſecond Argument is their Effectual Calling, that is in the text, <hi>Whereunto he hath called you by our Goſpel, &amp;c.</hi> as who ſhould ſay, the Lord hath given you a pledge that you ſhall never fall away finally, for it is plaine that God hath choſen you, and he hath given a pledge of his Election, for he hath called you, therefore be of good cheare. Well then in the words of the text you may conſider theſe four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Effectual Calling, <hi>he called you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the meanes whereby he hath wrought this in you, namely, <hi>the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the tearme whereunto he called them, noted in this word <hi>hereunto,</hi> which if you look into the former verſe was <hi>unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, what this ſalvation is, it is a moſt admirable incomparable thing, no tongue is able to ſpeak it; Oh ſaith he, <hi>It is to the attaining of the glory of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the very ſame glory that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to, you have part and communion therein. Now three of theſe points I lay aſide, the point that ſerves our turn is the ſecond, <hi>he called you by our Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                        </gap>s that by which God calls men home.</note>That the thing that calls Gods people home, it is the General tender of grace, indifferently to any man without exception, whoſoever will have it, that is, the Goſpel. When Chriſt ſhould call <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> after he had convinced him of his blindneſſe, and curſed eſtate; and made him ſee he was a fool in all the things of God; now he gives him a call, and how doth he call him? it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this general tender, <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſſe, ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life</hi>: As who ſhould ſay, I bring an indifferent doctrine, I propound it to all creatures, and thou maiſt have a part in it as well as any other; <hi>Whoſoever believes ſhall not periſh,</hi> if thou haſt a heart to believe and come unto me, thou ſhalt not periſh, but have ſalvation. So when our Saviour ſent his Diſciples to call his Elect throughout the world, mark what directions he gave them, he calls people with a general call, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will, let him take of the water life</hi>; whoſoever hath a mind to be ſaved, to know God, and have Communion with him, and be united to him; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath a minde to theſe things, tell him I am for him, he proclaimes it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole world, tell every creature in the whole world, <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized ſhall be ſaved;</hi> here is no exception put in, but preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every creature; tell every creature what I have done for the ſins of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94114:98"/>
world; and how I have opened the Kingdome to whomſoever will enter; thus God calls his people, his Miniſters go up and down and tell them they may have pardon, and grace, and righteouſneſſe for nothing, come and buy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, though you cannot give a farthing token for it, but be poor, and miſerable, and curſed creatures; Come, here it is, wine, and milk, and bread, and all without money, you ſhall have it for taking and carrying away, ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.7. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely;</hi> it is a <hi>quicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae vult,</hi> there is none exempted, if any man will he may be ſaved, if he have a will, a minde, a heart to it, he may have ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Now here be three things I would ſhew unto you; firſt, what this general tender is, whereby God effectually calls his people. Secondly, why it is by a general tender. Thirdly, the uſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. What is this general tender of Chriſt.</note> what is this general tender of Chriſt and grace to every creature that hath a minde to it? and it is this, that Chriſt is the only alſufficient meanes to make a man happy; that whereas he is out with his Maker, he alone can ſet him in again; though he be under a thouſand miſeries in this life, and under a thouſand eternal miſeries in the life to come; there is in Chriſt an alſufficiency to make a man happy, God is the fountaine of all goodneſſe, and till his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is opened in Chrſt Jeſus, this is that ſame general thing, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 1.23, 24. <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified unto thoſe that are called the power and wiſdome of God</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, this is the thing we go up and down e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where preaching, that Chriſt was crucified for the ſinnes of the world, and hath power to ſave any man that comes to him; it was the wiſdome of God, he found out this meanes; it was an impoſſibility in the wiſdome of men and Angels, how man ſhould be ſaved, the Wiſdome of God hath found out the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be the meanes, and he is the power of God to ſave any man that believes, and whereſoever we come we preach this Doctrine. So again you may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24, 25. <hi>This man hath an unchangable Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, for he is able to ſave to the utmoſt all thoſe that come unto him, &amp;c.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, he is a publick Saviour, he is not onely able to ſave theſe and theſe, but all that come unto him, he is able to ſave them to the utmoſt; whoſoever you are, though you be never ſo wretched, and reprobate to every good work, though never ſo foule, and all the nitre in the world cannot cleanſe you, never ſo ſtubborne and all the meanes and Ordinances you have enjoyed have not tamed you: why, yet here is a Saviour for you, he is able to ſave you to the utmoſt, though you be never ſo out with God; and though God be never ſo much diſpleaſed with your ſinful courſes, and all the Angels and all the world cannot take away Gods wrath from you, yet he is able to ſave you to the utmoſt if you will come unto him; This is the tender of the Goſpel delivered to every man. Now in the next place I will ſhew you the reaſons why God calls people home by a general tender in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion</p>

This is that which grounded Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> this generall offer, <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a faithful ſaying, worthy to be received of all men, that Chriſt died for ſinners, whereof I am chief,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. As who ſhould ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here is the thing, this is that which comforts me, and ſtaies my ſoul; I ſee that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, and I ſee it is a faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and worthy of all men to be received, all men whoſoever have a heart may receive it, and I am ſure then he came to ſave me, and this is my hold, I have no other hold but this. But now if a man were called by any other call but this, a man could have no ground for his calling; if the Scripture ſhould ſay they only are called that are elected, he would have no ground for his call.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. This is the beſt anſwer to Satan.</note> becauſe this is the beſt anſwer to Satan, many times a man will be put to heavy ſtraits, and will have much ado to anſwer Satan; ſometimes a man will be under uncertainty, ſometimes under want of feeling and ſenſe, ſometimes under horror of conſcience; and a mans ſins may come to a mans view, and feares may ſtep up in the ſoul; then Satan comes, how look you to be ſaved? you are a wretch, you have a ſtiffe faith indeed! What believe, and no ſenſe and feeling? ſuch a horrible wretch, and ſuch a guilty conſcience, and you believe? What have you to ſhew? Is any one promiſe in the Bible to ſuch a one as you that are ſo foul and filthy, and cannot pray, nor do any thing? you ſee God caſts you off, where is any promiſe for you to hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Yes, I can believe for all this, becauſe the Goſpel is not tendered to ſenſe, and feeling, and ſuch and ſuch things, but to every one that would have Chriſt, and I would have Chriſt, and ſo much the more eager is my heart to have him, the more I am troubled and caſt down, the more I would have Chriſt and grace; here is my hold, this is the thing, the ſure Word of Faith, it is called <hi>the Word of Faith,</hi> Rom. 10.8. Now you know the Word of God is true, whether a man believe or no; and now when faith comes in, it layes hold upon that general Word; the thing is true, ſo that if any man comes and believes, though I never found it before, I believed it, yet now I may hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and there is nothing in the world will put off Satan more then this, he will ſay, you have Chriſt; how can you have him? you are proud, aye but I would be humbled; you are dead, 'tis true, but that is my grief and mourning; I would be quickened, and therefore would have Chriſt that I may be ſo, and ſo; here he hangs upon the general tender of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Becauſe this is that which is true before all acts of man.</note> becauſe this is that ſame ſimple Scripture that is ſimply true in it ſelf before all acts in man; a man cannot be effectually called by any truth, but that which is true in it ſelf before all acts in man; now what truth can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually call a man before any act of grace in man, but only the general ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Goſpel? theſe are the truths that are ſimply true in themſelves. Before any thing is done upon man, it may be true that God hath elected me, but it is not a Scripture truth before ſomething be done in me, the Scripture doth not ſay ſimply in it ſelf that I am elected before ſome grace be put forth in me; if I have grace put forth already in me, then I may ſay, that God did ſpecially intend it to me, and did elect me in Chriſt before all worlds; but now theſe truths cannot call a man, becauſe before effectual calling nothing is done in a man, therefore thoſe truths that ſuppoſe any thing in a man, cannot be calling truths; the firſt truths that a man is effectually called unto, a man hath no more to ſhew for it, then any man elſe in the world; therefore it muſt be meerly the truths of the Goſpel in themſelves, what Chriſt did, and ſo forth.</p>
                  <p>As for example, theſe be the calling truths, <hi>Behold, the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> Joh. 1.29. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have eternal life,</hi> John 3.16. and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94114:99"/>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.11. <hi>The Sonne of man came to ſave that which is loſt;</hi> but theſe truths concerning this mans election, that God doth love him, and hear him, and accept of him; theſe are not Scripture truths in themſelves, but when a man is called then they come in; now a man may ſee that he is elected, and accepted of God; but theſe truths can never effectually call a man, becauſe effectual calling is the firſt thing that is done in a man, and this work finds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in a man more then in any other, and therefore it muſt needs be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tender.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, becauſe this is only that which every man is bound to believe,<note place="margin">4. This only that which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is bound to beleeve.</note> it is that only which a man is called unto; God when he doth effectually call his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth call them to do nothing, but that which is every mans duty to do; he calls them to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is one mans duy as well as another; as Chriſt when he went to preach every where up and down, ſaith he, Repent and believe the Goſpel; as who ſhould ſay, it is every one of your duties to repent, and believe the Goſpel, it is the very ſame truth, that believed, ſaveth Gods people, and not believed, damneth the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, as <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that beleeves ſhall be ſaved, and he that beleeves not ſhall be damned</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, both is the ſame truth that is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this man that is ſaved, and that man that is damned, therefore they muſt be the general truths of the Goſpel; particular truths do not bind every man to believe, it is not every mans duty to believe that he is elected, that he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Son Chriſt for him, rather then any other; God binds not every man to beleeve this, but he binds every man to believe that God is the eternal good of a man, and this is to be had by coming unto Chriſt; when a man can believe this, and caſt himſelf upon it, this is true and ſaving faith, when this draws a man to God, and pulls him out of his ſins, and this is the reaſon that the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is the Commandment of God, that ye beleeve in his Son Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; ſo that you ſee this is clear, that it is the general tender of the Goſpel that cals Gods people home to God: whatſoever a man be, an old ſinner, a young ſinner, a groſſe ſinner, be he what he will, if his heart ſtoop that he would have Chriſt, and all Chriſt, he ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But you may ſay, faith is onely of Gods Elect; how then can Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters tender ſuch a proffer as this, whereas Chriſt is only given to the Elect?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, it is true, that the Elect, when all comes to all, they only get it, yet it is ſeriouſly tendred to all; we had never heard of Election and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, but only becauſe of this, becauſe that when the Goſpel is preached, we ſee that ſome receive it, and ſome receive it not; now thus you come to ſee election and reprobation, for when a man comes to receive the call, we ſee that that man is elected, becauſe no man takes Chriſt but by grace, every man would ſtand out and refuſe Chriſt; but when we ſee a man takes Chriſt, then we ſee he is elected; and when we ſee another man doth not take Chriſt, we ſee then that man is left to himſelf, and hath a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart, and reprobate minde, and God lets him have it ſtill; as he will have his ſins, ſo God lets him have them ſtill; yet notwithſtanding this is very true, that Chriſt is propounded to all, and this the reaſon why our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> the meaning is, many are called, but few there are that do anſwer this call, there are few that have grace to do it; the moſt part of the world will rather have their luſts then Chriſt, and therefore there are but few, becauſe God hath choſen but few.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why the tender of the Goſpel muſt be delivered without any reſtraint to election; is,<note place="margin">The tender of the Goſpel muſt be without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Otherwiſe the elect would have no ground for their faith.</note> becauſe if there were not ſuch a proffer without exception to any that will have Chriſt, then the Elect ſhould have no ground for their faith;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94114:100"/>
a man cannot ſee he is elected till after he hath faith; no man hath faith and repentance at his firſt effectual call; now how ſhall a man have any ground for his faith when the Goſpel is propounded onely to the Elect? every man will be at a ſtand, I know not whether I be elected or no; I am as fair for hell, as any for ought I know; I have ſins to damn me, but no election, as far as I know; you preach Sermons all your life time, I can beleeve none, becauſe you preach only to the Elect; ſo the children of God can have no ground for their faith, becauſe there is no particular place of Scripture that bindes a man to beleeve his election, therefore it muſt be a general proffer of the Goſpel propounded to every man; <hi>John</hi> 6.35. there ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He that will come unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt off;</hi> there you ſee it is general, any man that will come to Chriſt, whether Elect of God no matter, Miniſters ſhould not ſtand demurring and queſtioning, I know not whether theſe be Elect or no, do you deliver the Goſpel, and afterwards it will appear who are elected, and who not, by their receiving or not receiving the Goſpel, leave you that to me; preach you how men may be happy, and what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate they are in, but if they will come out of their ſinnes they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the pardon of them; tell them, that whoſoever comes to me ſhall in no wiſe be caſt out, be they what the will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Becauſe in reference to men, calling is before election.</note> becauſe though election be firſt in Gods order, he doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a man before he calls him, yet with the Elect, with Gods own people it is clean contrary; firſt, they muſt be effectually called before they can have any inkling of their election in the point of knowing of it, therefore 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>give all diligence to make your calling and election ſure;</hi> firſt, make your calling ſure, elſe you can have no inkling of your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; now when this is ſure, you may be ſure of your election; before the point of effectual calling there muſt be no talking of election, either in the Miniſter that preacheth, or people that hear; this election is a thing in Gods own boſom, which comes after the receiving or rejecting the Goſpel, the one will reveal election, the other reprobation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Becauſe there is a difference between men and devils.</note> becauſe there is a difference between men and devils, there is no poſſibility for devils, though they would never ſo faine, to be ſaved, for Chriſt <hi>took not upon him the nature of Angels,</hi> Heb. 2.16. he did not meddle with them, therefore now we cannot ſay to them, if ye beleeve, you ſhall be ſaved, becauſe there is poſſibility for them, though they would never ſo faine; but there is a poſſibility for all men to be ſaved, if they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there is ſufficiency of merits in Chriſt, and it was intended to the ſonnes of men, to as many as would have it, though indeed all men would have none of him, if they were left to themſelves; yet notwithſtanding the Goſpel is offered to all, every man might have him, but that he will not have him.</p>
                  <p>But there be two Objections againſt this doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe this ſeems to be the contrary to the doctrine of many godly and religious Divines heretofore, who ſeem to ſay, that the Goſpel is only for the Elects ſake; it is the doctrine of many Divines, if I knew who were elected, and who were not, I would not deliver it to them; this is a dangerous doctrine, yet the ground of the doctrine is true, that the Goſpel is properly beſtowed upon the Elect, <hi>To us a child is born, to us a child is given;</hi> that is, to the Elect, but yet this is not contradictory to that which I now deliver; I deny not that Chriſt is given intentionally to Gods Elect upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, yet he is tendred to others to, and intended too, upon that condition; God cannot mock people, and make as though they might have eternal life, and cannot have it though never ſo faine; it is not ſo, but God deales ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with people, for every man ſhall have Chriſt that hath a true and ſincere heart; now it is true, this heart is only given of God, becauſe otherwiſe a man
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94114:100"/>
is ſtubborn and ſtiff-necked, and will not give over his ſins, and deny himſelf, but will rather have his own courſes then Chriſt, though he may have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life by him, yet the propoſition of the Goſpel is general to every man that will believe, and will have Chriſt; and this is neceſſary, and this is the very ſelf-ſame doctrine that all Divines have preached heretofore, only it is delivered otherwiſe, and the reaſon why there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of delivering it thus, is, becauſe this is the form of preaching ſet down in the Scripture, and this is the way to fiſh out Gods Elect, and the beſt way to ſettle their mindes, and eſtabliſh their conſciences, and this is the beſt way to feel and groap in Congregations who are of God: Wilt thou have Chriſt and eternal life, and be delivered from thy ſinnes? thou mayeſt then have the pardon of thy ſinnes, and the favour of God; now if a man be of God he will hear us, if he be not, he will not hear us; this is the way Scripture ſets down, as you may ſee, <hi>John</hi> 1.11. <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not</hi>; Chriſt came and offered himſelf to his own, he calls all his own people, the very reprobates are his own in reſpect of the offer, but in reſpect of receiving it; ſo the Elect onely are his own, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>To as many as received him, he gave power to be the Sonnes of God.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. The <hi>Eunuch</hi> would faine have Chriſt by baptiſme; what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me but I may be baptized? let me enter into Covenant with Chriſt; what ſhould let me? Mark what <hi>Philip</hi> ſaith, <hi>if thou beleeveſt, thou mayeſt,</hi> could he tell whether he were Elect or no? no, but he feels him with the general tender of the Goſpel; what lets me? he ſaith, nothing lets thee if thou canſt beleeve, he could not tell whether he were elected or no; but ſaith he, if thou canſt beleeve with all thy heart, thou mayeſt have Chriſt and all the benefits of the Covenant of grace, if thou haſt a heart and minde unto it, thou mayeſt have it, and after he profeſſed he had, he baptized him. So <hi>Paul</hi> dealt with the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30, 31. when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw the Jaylor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſtab himſelf; how could he tell whether he were elected or no? yea, when he cried out, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> he might ſpeak out of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and conſcience: how did <hi>Paul</hi> know that he was elected? but he feels him with the general tender, beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (ſaith he) and thou mayeſt be ſaved, whatſoever thou art; he doth not ſtand upon his election, but beleeve in Chriſt and his Goſpel, and believe eternal life is in him, and reſt upon him for it, let this be a means to pull thee out of thy ſins, and to ſeek after righteouſneſſe and communion with him; if thou haſt faith thou ſhalt be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> The ſecond Objection is this, that this doctrine ſeems to favour our adverſaries, our adverſaries ſay, that Chriſt died for one as well as for another; and the Goſpel is to be propounded to one as well as to another; and it is as much for one as for another; now if we ſay ſo too, we ſhake hands with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, Firſt there is a great deal of difference between that which the <hi>Pelagians</hi> ſpeak concerning this thing, they ſay that Chriſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his death no more to one then to another; no more to <hi>Abraham</hi> then <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; no more to <hi>Peter</hi> then <hi>Judas</hi>; look what minde God bare to one <hi>à parte ante,</hi> he bare as good a minde towards the other; now this we perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily deny, and it is an horrible blaſpheming of the grace of God towards his people, for he will have one rather then another, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>as many as was ordained to eternal life beleeved</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, as many as God had choſen, they took Chriſt and none elſe, God did intend Chriſt to them eſpecially, more then to the reſt, he gave them a heart, and let the reſt go on in the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they ſay, that Chriſt came to bring nothing but a poſſibility of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94114:101"/>
ſalvation into the world; now that any man is ſaved, is through the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a mans will, that one man will be ſaved, another will not; this man will beleeve in Chriſt, another will not; This we peremptorily deny too, for this is to blaſpheme the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to ſay ſo; for 'tis true, Chriſt hath wrought a poſſibility for others, they might have been ſaved, but would not; the rebellion of their hearts damned them, their unbelief ſent them to hell; but yet he firſt brought an actuality of Salvation for ſome, for he had his name for this; <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes</hi>; nay, the Father and he did indent one with another, that he dying upon the croſſe ſhould ſee his ſeed, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they ſay that Chriſt might have died and none have been ſaved, which is an horrible impiety for a man once to ſpeak, whereas certainly Chriſts death could never have been fruſtrated; if Chriſt did die for his people, he will ſave them, the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt them, he will gather up all that do belong to his election.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the adverſaries ſay, that as there is a generality in the offer, ſo there is an univerſality in the grace; now this we deny too, that there is an univerſal grace, God gives more mercy to his own people then to others, <hi>to you it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, &amp;c.) <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.10, 11. ſo <hi>to you it is given,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>not only to beleeve in him, but to die for him,</hi> Phil. 1.29. ſo that God gives more grace to his people then to others, he gives onely common grace to the wicked; 'tis true, God is not wanting to the wicked, God will ever be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand with them, and they ſhall have more then they make uſe of; now wicked men the Lord leaves them without excuſe, for they ſtick not at an impoſſibility, but at a will, they will not come in that they might be ſaved; they will not do that which God hath put into the power of their hands to do; God gives them knowledge, and they will not practiſe it; God ſhews them their ſinnes, and they will not leave their ſins; may be God makes them leave their ſinnes, and then they return to them againe; it may be God makes them that they never return to their ſins again, but then they take up onely a kinde of forme, and there they ſtick and go no further, thus they ſtick at the will, they will not have the Goſpel upon Chriſts termes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt uſe of the point is this,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. For the comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Beleevers.</note> it is a great comfort and encouragement to the faith of all Gods people; what an excellent and ſure word is this, when they ſhall finde that they have ſuch an excellent warrant to lay hold upon Chriſt, when he is ſo publickly tendred in the Scripture; there is a common ſalvation in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. Chriſt hath made it to be common for any man that will have it upon the tearms thereof, it is as common as <hi>Adam</hi> was, <hi>As in Adam all died, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. not as though all men ſimply ſhall be made alive, for all men poſſibly are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, as all men poſſibly are not dead in <hi>Adam,</hi> for there might be millions of men after the world is ended, but only thoſe that are in the loynes of <hi>Adam</hi>; all men that came out of the loyns of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall die, ſo all they that ever are in the loyns of Chriſt (as all they are) that will have him, they ſhall be made alive; it is as general as <hi>Adam,</hi> as many as were in the loyns of <hi>Adam,</hi> and lived and died ſo, ſhall die; ſo all that are in the loyns of Chriſt, and have a will to come to Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved, for it is the will that carrieth all the ſoul; when a man will do or ſuffer any thing for Chriſt, whatſoever ſin Chriſt will have him leave, he will leave it, whatſoever duty Chriſt will have him take up, he will aſſume it, he will break through all hindrances, and uſe all means, he will have it; the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is for every one that will have it, I will have it ſaith the ſoul, therefore it belongs to me; the Goſpel of ſalvation is tendred to every one that hath a minde to it; I have a mind to it upon the Goſpels tearms, and therefore it belongs to me.</p>

                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:94114:101"/>The ſecond uſe is of confutation,<note place="margin">

them, that they may have acquittance from all damnation, that they may be happy for ever; certainly they will receive my Sonne gladly, they will take him and receive him in all reaſon, one would think it were ſo; but we ſee it is otherwiſe, they will not take up Chriſt and abandon their own courſes, they will be vaine, they will be company keepers, they will be worldly, and will neglect the beſt things; they will have their pleaſures, and they will have their fopperies and fooleries, they will not have Chriſt; there be many things in Chriſt, that every man would have, the very devils in hell would have it, namely, to be redeemed from hell; to have ſome peace in their conſciences, but the Regiment of Chriſt, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Chriſt to have all Chriſt, this they will not; this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is no comfort to ſtubborne ſinners, but hell and damnation is the portion of all that refuſe him, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 34.16.

Firſt, the Lord brings his Law to a man, and layeth him dead in Law, utterly undone, paſt all hope of recovery in himſelf; he is a loſt creature, a miſerable wretched creature, having no hold to ſtay upon, but a fearful looking for of vengeance; he ſeeth nothing but wrath: now when God hath a minde to call a man home at the hearing of the Goſpel of peace, the Lord lets in a little hope into the ſoul, whereby he doth draw the ſoul to ſeek out unto him, and makes it look out with hope of ſalvation; the ſoul ſeeth now that there is mercy in Chriſt, and grace in Chriſt, and eternal life in Chriſt; and he ſeeth this is generally and freely tendred to all that will have it; and out of theſe two branches of general faith ſpirings this hope: now thinks the ſoul, I may have it as well as another, the dole is free, the mercy is free, and why may not I be ſaved? why may not I finde mercy and forgiveneſs, and be ingraffed into the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? before this the ſoul was groaping for hope, if it could have told where to have had it, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. they were there groaping where to have it, <hi>Men and brethren,</hi> ſay they, <hi>what ſhall we do?</hi> they do not ſay there is nothing to be done, there is no hope, but what ſhall we do? as who ſhould ſay, there is ſomething to be done, ſome courſe to be taken, you that are Miniſters of God, is there no way whereby we may be pardoned? whereby we may be ſaved? whereby we may have a new heart, and the favour of God, and be delivered from the wrath to come? but when the Goſpel comes they ſee now a poſſibility, and this breeds this hope, ſo that this is the next point.</p>
                  <p>That when God doth effectually call a ſoul by his Goſpel, at the hearing of this gracious tender of eternal life and grace in Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">

he did firſt put in hope into their ſouls, he made them priſoners of hope; there was firſt a pouring of hope into their ſouls, and then he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the priſon doors: So the Lord makes his people priſoners of hope, that though they be in the captivity of ſinne and Satan, yet they are priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of hope; and the Lord gives ſome hope, that the priſon doores ſhall be opened, and this we have here in the text; for though the Apoſtle means here by hope, the things hoped for; yet we call it hope, becauſe as ſoone as ever they dawn in the ſoul, they breed hope, if they be the ſervants of God; ſo that this Goſpel breeds hope in a mans boſom. Now here be five things I would ſhew unto you; Firſt, what this hope is. Secondly, how it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with that hope that follows juſtifying faith. Thirdly, how it diſagrees with it. Fourthly, the Reaſons of the point. And fifthly, the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. What is this hope?</note>For the firſt, what this hope is, and it is an hope that ariſeth out of the faith of poſſibility, when the Lord lets in a poſſibility of faith, and makes the ſoul believe that his ſinnes may be forgiven, and he may attaine ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life; and he may come to be a Saint, and one of Gods dear and faithful children; he lets in ſuch a poſſibility into the heart, and this hope flows out of this faith of poſſibility; and this faith of poſſibility is another-geſſe thing then people take it for; every drunkard will ſay he beleeves that it is poſſible to be ſaved, and to finde mercy with God; but you will finde it is a greater matter then ſo; it is ſpoken as a great commendation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he did beleeve that God was able to raiſe up his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Heb. 11.19. ſo our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaking to the blinde man, asks him this queſtion, do you believe that I am able to do this for you? <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.23. it was a great matter for him to believe that he was able to do this for him. <hi>Sarah,</hi> though an excellent woman for faith otherwiſe, yet ſhe ſtuck mightily here, and thought it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for her to have a childe; nay, <hi>Moſes</hi> as faithful a man as he was, he could not believe that all the people could be fed in the wilderneſſe; it is a greater matter then you think for, for every ſinful wretch thinks it is an eaſie matter to believe that Chriſt died for ſinners, and that they may be ſaved; it is an eaſie matter for the faith of preſumption, but if a mans eyes be opened, and his conſcience awakened, and he comes to have a ſight of his ſins; now <hi>Cain</hi> will ſay, his ſinnes are greater then can be forgiven; and <hi>Judas</hi> is not able to flie unto Chriſt to believe a poſſibility of pardon, but goes and hangs himſelf, and deſpairs totally of the buſineſſe; this faith of poſſibility, it comes within the compaſſe of a definition of faith, it is the evidence of things not ſeen, it is far above our nature, and fleſh &amp; blood cannot reveal it; that there is ſalvation in Chriſt, and that there is ſuch a thing as a pardon to be had at Gods hands, let a man have his underſtanding enlightned to ſee what a wretch he is, and how fearfully he hath provoked Gods wrath againſt him, and it is not in his power to beleeve that there is a poſſibility for him to finde mercy, or any hope of pardon, it cannot be attained to without the work of God; a weak ſhelfe is able to hold, when a man lays but a book upon it, but if a man lay a great weight upon a weak ſhelf, it will break under it; ſo it is with the faith of men, when there is no weight laid upon it, the burthen of the Lord is not laid upon them; then they may think it is an eaſie matter to have ſalvation and their ſinnes pardoned; but if this weight ſhould be laid upon them, their faith would burſt, unleſſe the Lord ſhould be pleaſed to put in a better faith then this; it is not in a mans power to look beyond the power of juſtice, for a man to beleeve that there is mercy in God contrary to the ſentence of his own Law, and contrary to the ſenſe and feeling of a mans own ſoul; and therefore when the Lord is pleaſed effectually to call a man, though he lay a bleeding bleeding before in the ſight and ſenſe of his miſery, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a door of hope to the ſoul, he lets in a light of poſſibility, that he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94114:104"/>
may yet come to be quickened, and be a new creature, and obtaine mercy at the hands of the Lord; as the Lord dealt with his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. there ſaith the text, <hi>I will give them the valley of Achor for the door of hope</hi>; ſo when the Lord doth caſt a man into the valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> of ſtoning and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then he opens a door of hope that he may look in, and ſee at a crevis ſome hope for him to ſpeed; though yet I have an hard heart, yet ſuch a thing may be, if I come to Chriſt; I ſee God may afford mercy to whom he will, and hath propounded it to every man that will have it, therefore I may have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; the Lord begins to ſtir and move the heart, and now the ſoul begins to have a door of hope; you ſee then what this hope is, it is ſuch a thing as flowes from the faith of poſſibility, I do not ſay that it is a juſtifying faith, but it is the forerunner of it, to make way for it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is; how this hope agrees with that which proceeds from a juſtifying faith?<note place="margin">2. How it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with that which followes juſtifying faith.</note> I anſwer, it agrees in five things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, both are of God,<note place="margin">1. Both are of God.</note> all the hope a creature hath, if it be a true hope, it is of God, therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the God of all hope, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 15.13. <hi>God is the God of all hope</hi>; I do not ſay that all hope abſolutely is of God, for the vaine hope of wicked men is of the Devil, and is not of God; but I ſpeak of a true hope and courage that the ſoul gets to ſeek God in his wayes, and fear him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are both wrought by the Goſpel,<note place="margin">2. Both are wrought by the Goſpel.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>All things were written for our learning</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope</hi>; Thus it is with a believer though he hath nothing in preſent poſſeſſion, though he be perſecuted, and afflicted, and forſaken in the world, though he hath never ſo many miſeries here below; yet when he looks into the Scriptures, and ſees what promiſes God hath made, he comes to have ſome hope; it is thus with a man that is not yet a believer, but is in the way to be a believer, the Lord works with him this way, though he ſee himſelf a miſerable and wretched ſinner, and undone man, caſt off, and there is no hope in himſelf; yet when he looks into the Scriptures, and ſees what a gracious tender of mercy there is to any man that will have mercy, it is not the wretchedneſſe of a mans heart that caſts him off, but the not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, and receiving of him that damnes him; for the fountaine of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is open for every one that will receive Chriſt; thus the Scripture gives hope.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, both ſet a man on work;<note place="margin">3. Both ſet a man on work.</note> as ſuppoſe a man hath an hope that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from juſtifying faith, as he believes in Chriſt, ſo this ſets him a work, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>He that hath this hope purifies himſelf as Chriſt is pure</hi>; it makes him labour to be humble and meek, and to be made partaker of the Spirit of Grace; it makes him labour after the things that are above, and to be fitted and diſpoſed to every good work, and to purge himſelf, and cleanſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience more and more; and ſo a man that hath not this juſtifying faith, but hath only this branch of effectual calling begun in him; he that hath this hope I now ſpeak of, it ſets him a work to ſeek after Chriſt, and to labour hard for the enjoying of him, and to ſeek him in all his Ordinances in his manner, though he cannot pray and performe duties as others do, yet he will do it in that manner he is able.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, both are the anchor of the ſoul;<note place="margin">4.

                  <p>The firſt is, that this hope I now ſpeak of, it ariſeth out of the ſeeds of grace, the other out of grace it ſelf;<note place="margin">1 This ariſeth out of the ſeeds of grace, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of grace it ſelf.</note> there are the ſeeds of grace which are ſomething of grace in the ſoul, before grace it ſelf comes; and though we have not any place of Scripture to ſhew this, yet there are abundance of places that aime at, and include this. As it may be referred to the woeings of Chriſt, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. when the excellency and neceſſity of Chriſt woes the ſoul, and the poſſibility of having Chriſt, theſe things allure a man; here is this work, when the ſoul begins to be a neuter, before the ſoul believes, yet there is a kinde of bending of faith, as the man in the Goſpel, when Chriſt asked him, if he believed in the Son of God; he ſaith, Lord what is he that I may believe? as who ſhould ſay, I am ready to believe if I could, I am ready to reſigne my ſelf to believe, do but ſhew me how I may believe?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this may be referred to the forming of Chriſt in the heart, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. before the babe is organized, there is ſeed, ſo there is a ſeed of God in the ſoul, and he that hath this ſeed cannot ſin, becauſe he is borne of God; as there is a ſeed of generation, ſo of regeneration; as the prodigal before he came home to his Father, he ſaith with himſelf, <hi>I will go home to my Father, and ſay, Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 15.16. What made him do this? they are nothing elſe but the effects of the ſeeds of grace; So the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.13. that cried out, <hi>Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> what were theſe but the expreſſions of the ſeeds of grace that were in him? the next newes we heare, he did believe; now the Lord ſowes ſeeds of grace in the ſoul, and theſe break forth into hope, and deſires, and waitings for grace, theſe are the ſeeds of grace, and from thence comes this hope, but the other hope comes from grace it ſelf, it is true, that theſe ſeeds of grace are grace in themſelves, they are the work of grace for grace, but they are not gracefully and compleatly wrought in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. They come from ſeveral ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions.</note>They come from ſeveral apprehenſions, the hope we now ſpeak of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends nothing but a poſſibility of pardon, that he may be pardoned, and have power over his ſins, he may attaine to be a new creature, and to be one of the redeemed of the Lord; and this is that which ſends him after God, and makes him trace him up and down, till the Lord doth it for him, but the other apprehends that he hath it already, or elſe reſts upon God for it, and hopes undoubtedly for the accompliſhment of it; this hope I now ſpeak of was in the King of <hi>Niniveh, Who knows but the Lord may repent, and turne from his fierce anger that we periſh not?</hi> I cannot tell, but there is hope it may be, and who knows but God will do it? And this hope made him humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſeek to God, and there was a publike kinde of reformation outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So it is here, the Lord lets in ſome hope; who knows but the Lord will yet ſhew mercy? and it is not only an imaginary hope, ſuch a hope as vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94114:106"/>
and leaves a man in the lurch, but this hope doth ſtir up a mans ſoul, and provoke a man to look out to God for that mercy, whereof he ſees a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of attaining.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the reaſons of the point, why the Lord doth work this hope in the ſoul, and the firſt is this; Leſt a man ſhould lie all along in deſpaire,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. To prevent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire.</note> when the Lord ſhews a man his ſins and his miſery in regard thereof, if the Lord ſhould not put in this hope, a man would altogether deſpaire; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible a man ſhould be able to ſtand, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can beare?</hi> So, when the Lord chargeth a mans ſins and iniquities upon his conſcience, and aggravates all his ſinfulneſſe, a man would ſink under this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and never be able to hold up his head, were it not for this hope, as we uſe to ſay; were it not for hope, the heart would break; ſo this is the reaſon why God puts in this hope, he doth it to ſtay the ſoul, that it may not ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand of God. <hi>I will revive the heart of the contrite ones, I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with them for ever,</hi> Iſa. 57.16, 17. <hi>Leſt their ſpirits faile before me</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, if I ſhould let my wrath into their ſouls, and ſhould not put in this hope and reviving into their hearts, their very ſpirits would faile before me, and ſink under me, they would be at their wits end, and be utterly overwhelmed; therefore God puts in this that he may help their ſoules; if God ſhould ſhew a man his ſins as they are in his ire, and ſhew him all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his nature, and his filthineſſe from the womb, till now, and reckon with him for this in his ſoul, and conſcience, and let him ſee what a curſed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he is, his ſpirit would faile before Almighty God, and the ſtouteſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under Heaven were not able to ſtand under it, but would rather take an haltar and hang himſelf then undergo it; now, when the Lord deales with a man, he puts in this ſupporting hope to ſtay him up, otherwiſe the ſoul were not able to hold.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. That a man may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> if the Lord ſhould not put in this hope it would utterly diſable a man from looking after Heaven; when a man conceives no hope, this breaks the neck of all his endeavours, a man will not toile for nothing, and lay out his ſtrength and all that is in him, when he conceives he hath no hope at all; <hi>He that plowes, plowes in hope, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 9.10. therefore when a man can hardly ſee any hope, this doth ever vale a man, it makes a man rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire; it makes a man do as commonly people do when they ſee they muſt go to hell, they fill their ſouls with pleaſures and delights, there is little hope for them to come into the ſtrict way, that they will ever be able to beare it, that they may have mercy like thoſe wretches, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. <hi>There is no hope, &amp;c. there is no hope, we have loved our own luſts, and after them we will go</hi>; When people have not hope to get through, this makes them deſperate, they care not what they do, and they grow careleſſe and negligent, many a man hath ſaid ſo, I was of the minde once to be preciſe, but the further I pried into it, the worſe I was; and theſe Preachers will make a man mad; when people finde humiliation ſo hard a thing, they think they are not able to wade through and ſo leave it, when they have no hope to go on, they grow remiſs, and looſe, and careleſſe in this kinde, it makes a man deſperate when this hope is gone; therefore when the Lord hath a minde to do good to a man and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him to go on in the wayes of holineſſe, he puts ſome hope into the ſoul; and when a man ſees ſome hope, then he will pray and faſt, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf, the Lord lets in this hope, and ſo prepares a man for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe he will not do all at once,<note place="margin">3. Becauſe God will not do all at once.</note> but work upon a man by degrees, the Lord could put faith into the ſoul at firſt, but the Lord will firſt make a man a probationer of faith, the Lord will firſt have the ſeed ſowen, and then quicken in the ground, and then have a blade, and then an eare, and then har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</p>

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94114:107"/>Again,<note place="margin">4. That he may be ſought to for every mercy.</note> the Lord will ſo do it, that he may be ſought to for every mercy; and therefore firſt the Lord gives a man natural parts, that he may come to Church and hear the Word, and then the Lord knocks him down that he may be abaſed; and then he ſhatters him all to pieces, that he may look out for hope; and then when he hath gotten hope, the Lord makes him ſeek out for faith; and when he hath gotten faith, to ſeek out for other graces; and when he hath them, to ſeek for the accompliſhment of them; the Lord will be ſought to for every thing, and it is fit we ſhould ſeek to him; though the parent doth not engender the reaſonable ſoul in the babe, but God doth create it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, yet none of us do count marriage ſuperfluous; ſo though God doth give this grace of faith only, yet we are not to account the uſing of means in vain, the Lord doth not power in humane wit into ſtocks and ſtones, but into a body fitted and ordered for a reaſonable ſoul; ſo it is in reſpect of faith and grace, the creature ſhall be firſt ordered and fitted for grace; there muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and a foregoing work; it is his manner of working, he will ſo work as he will ſtill be ſought unto of all his people, though they have not faith, if they have hope, they ſhall ſeek to him for faith; as it is with a Scholar, if he will be a Scholar or Fellow of a Colledge, he muſt ſit for it; ſo the Lord will have a man ſit for it, he will have a man ſit at the pool of grace, and ſeek to him for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall have it.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. To ſhew the graciouſnes of God.</note>This ſhews us the graciouſneſs of our good God, that when he takes us to do for our ſins, <hi>He remembers us when we are in our low eſtate, for his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for ever,</hi> Pſal. 136.53. when we are at the brink of hell, at the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of deſtruction, and in the belly of damnation, when we know not which way to turne our ſelves; <hi>then he remember us, for his mercy endures for ever</hi>; thus the Lord deals with his people for their good, as he opens the caſement, that his juſtice may look out upon us, ſo he ſets his mercy in the window that we may ſee it through the glaſſe, that we may not be overwhelmed, this is the goodneſs of God, and were it not for this, no man ſhould be able to abide his look, nor bear his diſpleaſure when he breakes out upon a man, this is the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs of our gracious God, to deal thus favourably with his people; therefore you that have gotten this hope, know, that the Lord might have held you down to this day, and he had juſtly ſerved you if he had done ſo; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoever of you are in the briars do not repine and grumble, becauſe you are not refreſhed as others are; if you have but the leaſt cranny of hope to hang upon, make much of it, it is more then God owes you; how eaſily might the Lord teare the ſoul all in pieces, when he comes to deal with a man, when he ſhews a man his ſins and abominations? he might make them as heavy as rocks and mountaines unto him, and break him all to powder, it were juſt if he did ſo; now when the Lord puts in this hope, what a wonderful mercy is this? When God told <hi>Hezekiah, Behold thou ſhalt die,</hi> he preſently bade him take a lump of Figgs and healed the diſeaſe; ſo what a mercy is this, that God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt die,</hi> thou art a damned creature, and bids him preſently take a plaiſter, and ſo recovers him.</p>

Comfort for believers.</note>For comfort to all thoſe that are the Lords, though it be a poor faith, a poor hope that flowes from poſſibility only, yet I tell you that even believers may have need ſometimes to have reſort unto it, for how often hath the Devil been let looſe upon poor ſouls, even thoſe that are of God? as ſometimes he doth tempt them to preſumption, that ſo they may neglect their watch over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo it is his practice to drive us from one extreame to another, and hurry us to deſpair, and urge upon us that we have no faith, we have no grace, and are as ſure to be damned as if we were in hell already, <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 31.22.) ſeems to be out of all hope to be ſaved, as if he were utterly undone, the ſervants of light many of them have found this too too true; how fearfully they have been perplexed and galled in minde, ſeeking releaſe, but could finde none, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing

againſt themſelves bitter things, as if they had nothing of God in them, the devil dazling their eyes that they cannot ſee, and putting out of their minds all the ſweet paſſages of the Goſpel, and preaching nothing but the terrible paſſages of the Law, he that doubts is damned, and he that wavers is like a wave of the ſea, and he urgeth them with every vain thought, with every omiſſion, with every failing, and every ſin they have committed; it is ſtrange to ſee how ſome of Gods own people have reaſoned againſt themſelves, as if all the devils logick were in them, and all mercy were gone; thus the devil ſometimes deals with Gods people, that they cannot tell where to hold; they can ſee nothing to give any comfort or ſtay, they are ready to let go all and give over all hope; now what an excellent thing is this, if a man have this hope, that he may be never driven from God, that there is eternal life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe in him, and all theſe things are attainable, I tell you, it is a great help to a man when he can ſay with the Church, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Who can tell whether the Lord will turn, and leave a bleſſing behind him?</hi> a man that hath but this hope in him, it will never let him go off from God, and be quite overcome by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; ſo that though it be but a poor thing, yet it is worth a Kings ranſome in time of trouble.</p>
                  <p>To ſhew unto us how God doth work this hope,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Informe how God works this hope.</note> and he works it, firſt, by rooting out of the heart all vaine hopes,<note place="margin">1. By rooting out all vain hopes.</note> and bringing in a better hope, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. The Law made nothing perfect; when God brought in Chriſt, he brought in a better hope; when God brings Chriſt to the ſoul, he brings a better hope into the ſoul; the ſoul before had a vaine hope, he prayed and came to Church, and was civil and well brought up, and had many good gifts, and many terrours and affrightments, all theſe are nothing but legal works; a man can never have hope in this; but when God brings in a better hope, he throws out all the other, he ſhoots his Law like a great Ordnance into the ſoul, and ſtrikes him dead, and makes him ſee there is no hope, all his vaine hopes are nothing, and ſtill the ſoul will be gathering falſe hopes, and returning to them, but the Lord throws them out ſtill, and puts in a better hope.</p>
                  <p>By ſetting a look upon the Goſpel,<note place="margin">2. By ſetting a look upon the Goſpel.</note> as the Goſpel tenders this to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to one as well as to another, ſo the Lord puts a particular look upon the Goſpel, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to the lame man, look upon me, and this made him expect to receive an alms from him, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.4, 5. So the Lord makes a man look upon the Goſpel to minde the Goſpel, and regard and take notice of it, what it ſaith, for people let theſe things ſlip, but when God works this hope in the ſoul, he makes a man to mind the Goſpel, and makes as if it looked at him, and ſo he comes to have ſound hope in the Goſpel, as a beggar when a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man puts his hand into his purſe, though he ſees nothing, yet he thinks he will give him ſomething; ſo the Lord puts his hand into his purſe, as it were, he lays his hand upon mercy, and lets the ſoul ſee him tendring of mercy, and this makes him hope he ſhall have mercy, he caſts a look upon him, and ſo affects and draws the ſoul, and he finds the Lord moving the ſoul, and inclining the heart, and weaning the ſoul from the world, and quickning him to ſeek after the things that are above.</p>
                  <p>By removing of all impoſſibilities that lie upon the ſoul,<note place="margin">3.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94114:109"/>
before this hope I now ſpeak of; the ſoul hath ſomething wherby it ſeeth a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, and the Lord ſhews him a way of recovery, and ſets up a ſtandard to guide him in the way, and takes away all impediments that hinder him in the way; and now the ſoul ſeeth it is poſſible to attain unto theſe things.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E come now to the ſecond degree of effectual calling, and that is a perſonal call of this or that man by a particular word, when the Lord doth particularize his promiſes, and tenders them to this or that man; come unto me and here is free grace and mercy for thee; come and believe, and reſt upon me for it: when the Lord doth ſpeak a particular word to the ſoul, as you may ſee, <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.1. <hi>I have called thee by name, thou art mine</hi>; when God effectually calls a man, he calls him by name, he calls him with a particular word; come unto me, here is pardon; rely upon me and thou ſhalt have it, here is peace of conſcience; rely upon me and thou ſhalt attain to it; thou art an undone creature in thy ſelf, here is mercy for thee, not only when there is a general word propounded to the ſoul, but when the Lord joynes with the word, and follows it to the ſoul and conſcience; come to me man, when God calls a man by name; ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chriſt ſaw him ſitting at the receipt of cuſtom, and ſaid unto him, <hi>follow me,</hi> he called him in particular, and directed a particular word to his heart, and bid him follow him and depend upon him for all good: ſo it was with <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when Chriſt looked up and ſaw him in the fig-tree, he ſaid <hi>Come down Zacheus</hi>; he directed a particular word to him; this is the thing; now I do not meane the outward word onely in the Scripture, either preached or read; But ſecondly, when it is inwardly ſpoken by God himſelf to the ſoule, and ſet on, when God bids a man believe and come unto him, this is the thing, and this we have heard in the Text, <hi>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cometh unto me</hi>; for the coherence of theſe words, you muſt know, that in the former verſes our Saviour Chriſt had told them, that he was <hi>the bread that came down from heaven,</hi> inviting them to come unto him, <hi>ver.</hi> 41, 42. and you may ſee what effect this wrought in their hearts, how they murmured at him, they were ſo far from yeilding to his call, that they fell a murmuring at him; And ſecondly, ſee how they alledge reaſons for their murmuring, <hi>v.</hi> 42. <hi>Is not this Jeſus the Sonne of Joſeph, &amp;c.</hi> as who ſhould ſay, if he came from the earth, how did he come from heaven? therefore you may ſee what anſwer Chriſt makes, <hi>v.</hi> 43. Firſt, he reproves them, and ſaid, <hi>murmur not among your ſelves</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, this is no murmuring matter, it is a mourning and lamenting matter; you ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile your condition, and turne your murmuring into mourning; Again he bids them not wonder at it, <hi>v.</hi> 44. <hi>For no man cometh unto me, except the Father draweth him,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, it is no news to me that you ſtumble at my words, and will not hear what I ſay, for <hi>none can come to me except my Father draw him</hi>; you care not for me, but murmur againſt me, and your hearts are ſtout againſt the Lord; you cannot attain unto it, for <hi>no man, &amp;c.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſhews that ſome would come to him for all this, though ſome would

not, yet ſome would, even all his Elect, therefore he quotes this ſaying out of the Prophets, <hi>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me</hi>; the word ſhall not only come to the outward eare, but they ſhall be taught of God, and then they will come home to me; and then concludes with the words of the Text, <hi>Every man that hath heard, &amp;c.</hi> as who ſhould ſay, though you will not, yet I am ſure, every man that hath heard my Father ſpeak to his heart, that hath heard him preaching from heaven in his boſome, that man will come to me, ſo that God can call thoſe things which are not, as if they were; though a man be never ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious and averſe from Chriſt, yet when he ſpeaks a particular word to the ſoul, it comes.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, what particular place of Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Thomas,</hi> or <hi>James,</hi> or ſuch a one is a childe of wrath by nature, is here any Scripture ſaith ſo of him?

                  <p>Again, what place of Scripture ſaith that <hi>Robert</hi> or <hi>John</hi> muſt love God, and is bound to love God, is there any ſuch place of Scripture? no, why will you ſay then, that you are bound to love God and obey him, if there be no ſuch place of Scripture? yes, for this particular is in the general, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lard thy God, &amp;c.</hi> That Commandment is delivered to all men in the whole world: So, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no murther, thou ſhalt not commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, &amp;c.</hi> this Commandment lies upon the whole world; therefore if thou beeſt a man, though thou canſt not finde thy name ſet down, that the Lord ſpeaks to thee, yet thy particular is in thoſe generals; ſo though it cannot be ſhewn in all the Scripture that ſuch a particular man ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, yet when the Scripture ſaith, that all men ſhall riſe againe, as <hi>John</hi> 5.28. <hi>Marvel not, for the houre ſhall come that all fleſh that is in the grave ſhall come forth</hi>; if all that are dead ſhall riſe again, then every man ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, though his name be not named in Scripture; ſo it is hear, we read in Scripture that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 7.37. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink,</hi> now the Lord includes a particular in it, and brings it to the ſoul, thou thirſteſt, thou wouldeſt faine have Chriſt, here are the promiſes, here is all mercy in my Sonne, believe in him, come and receive him, take him, and thou ſhalt have them; ſo if Chriſt ſaith, <hi>whoſoever beleeves ſhall be ſaved,</hi> then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> might ſafely conclude a particular word to the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, <hi>beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved, Acts</hi> 16.31. ſo that you ſee here is a particular word, though not particular directly, yet equivalent to a particular, namely a particular in the general, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth ſpeak this to the ſoul, and makes the ſoul hear it, <hi>Every man therefore that hath heard it, &amp;c.</hi>

thou art ſubject unto, lay hold upon me, and reſt upon me for the delivering thee from them; the Lord when he calls a man effectually, he ſpeaks it, not onely the Miniſter and the Word ſpeaks it, but the Lord ſpeaks it; and ſo the ſoul hearing of the Father comes to Chriſt; thus you may ſee the Lord holds the free promiſes of the Goſpel before the ſoul, and bids a man relie upon them; as <hi>Peter dealt with his contrite hearers,</hi> the Spirit of the Lord going along with his word, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>believe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for the promiſe belongs to you and to your children, &amp;c.</hi> as who ſhould ſay, when God calls a man effectually, he holds forth his promiſes, and propounds them to the ſoul, beleeve this promiſe, and reſt upon me for it; thus the Lord doth call a man home, he ſends his promiſe before him, he ſets up hope before him, he ſends the gracious invitation of the Goſpel before him, and bids him relie upon it; thus God dealt with his Elect <hi>Corinths,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.9. <hi>God is faithful</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>by whom ye are called to the fellowſhip of his Sonne Jeſus Christ,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, when God called you, he ſpake to every one of you in particular; come and be fellow heirs with my Son; come and have every good thing with my Sonne; come and be a ſonne with him; come and be an heir of grace with him, and have title to eternal life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, God calls you, ſaith he, to beleeve that he is faithful: So I might inſtance in many more, though there be never ſo many in the Congregation, yet the Lord doth not ſpeak to them all; they do not all hear his voice; they all hear the Miniſter, but that makes them not to come, that doth not the deed, but when the Lord calls a man, he comes, he joyns with the Word, and ſpeaks to this or that man, and takes him alone, and whiſpers him in the ear, and tells him where mercy is, and bids him rely upon him, and though ſenſe and feeling be againſt him, though all fears and objections be againſt him, he bids him believe and be of good cheere, he ſhall have all theſe mercies if he will believe in him, as he ſaith <hi>Eſay</hi> 51.20. <hi>Look unto Abraham your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for I called him alone and bleſſed him</hi>; mark it, the Lord took him alone, and ſpake to his heart, between him and himſelf; ſo when the Lord ſpeaks to a ſoul, and calls him by his grace, he calls him alone, and takes him alone, though all the Congregation hears the ſame Sermon, yet he takes him alone, and ſpeaks to his heart, and bids him beleeve in him, for I will never faile thee, it is a ſure foundation, he may build upon it for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe no man could come unto Chriſt elſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.

See what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that the hour ſhall come, when the dead ſhall heare the voice of the Sonne of God</hi>; here comes an Almighty voice, that ſpeaks to the raiſing of a man out of the death of ſinne to the life of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and faith, and he ſhews that there is a voice of Chriſt that ſpeaks to the ſoul, that though the ſoul be dead, yet it ſhall heare and live; ſo <hi>Epheſians</hi> 5.14. and were it not for this call no man could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>

it, and made him look upon it as a thing tendred and propounded to him, and ſo made him relie upon it; if it were not for this call of God, who were able to beleeve? for without this call, the ſoul when it ſeeth its dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and deadneſſe, and untowardneſſe, and unworthineſſe, it would go away, it would ſay, I cannot look to the promiſe, I cannot do this and that; and I have no faith; and what have I to do with the promiſe; therefore the Lord when he effectually calls a man, he lets in the ſight of his promiſes, he holds forth his free and gracious promiſes; ſo that now the ſoul can ſay, the Lord calls me by his grace, and though I be never ſo wretched and my heart be ſtark naught, though I be as reprobate to every good word and work, as the vileſt in the world; yet here is a free offer, and I will relie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, it is tendred unto me, otherwiſe why ſhould God propound it ſo freely? why ſhould he hold it forth ſo indifferently? why ſhould he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it with the blood of his own Son? why ſhould there be the Sacraments and ſo many Seals to eſtabliſh the truth of it? and why doth he propound it ſo freely to me? when he looks upon the promiſe, the promiſe makes him believe the freeneſſe of it, the univerſality of it, the indifferency of it to as many as will have it; the Lord puts power into the promiſe to affect the heart, &amp; fire the heart, there is ſo much truth and goodneſs in the promiſe as is able to make the ſoul beleeve when God ſpeaks it to the heart, it is ſuch a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and ſuch a free promiſe, and ſo Yea and Amen in Chriſt Jeſus to all that do but reſt upon it; the Lord holds the promiſe before a mans eyes, and ſaith here is a promiſe for thee, beleeve, here is mercy, here is favour, here is pardon, here is peace, here is Chriſt, here is ſtrength, here is wiſdome; thou art a fool, here is wiſdome for thee to direct thee; thou art weak, here is ſtrength for thee to enable thee; do but rely upon me, and thou ſhalt have it; the ſoul doth not firſt believe the promiſe, and then take it; but the Lord firſt propounds the promiſe to the ſoul, and makes the ſoul look up to God in his promiſe, I am a vile ſinner, but with the Lord there is mercy, and I have a curſed ſpirit within me; but with the Lord there is power to ſubdue it: the truth of the promiſe and the power of God going with it, makes the ſoul beleeve it, and this is the reaſon when God would renew the faith of his people, he gives them as it were a new call, and holds the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe afreſh before them, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am God alſufficient, walk before me and be upright,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, <hi>Abraham,</hi> go not away from me, go not any where elſe, thou mayeſt have any thing in me, I am God Almighty, beleeve in me, keep by me; go not from me, but walk before me all the dayes of thy life, and I will be a God unto thee, and in bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. the people of God are called <hi>the children of promiſe,</hi> becauſe the promiſe breeds them, and converts them, and is the ground of all unto them, they are the very children of the promiſe; now here be three things I would ſhew unto you. Firſt, why this act is attributed to the Father, the Father ſpeaks to the ſoul, the ſoul hears it and ſo comes. Secondly, what ſpeech this is, which the ſoul hears and ſo comes to God by faith. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how a man may know whither he hath heard this voice or no.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Why is this act attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Father?</note> why this act is attributed to the Father, <hi>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> the Father ſpeaks, and the ſoul hears from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; Firſt,<note place="margin">1.

in light that is unaproachable, <hi>no man can come to the Father but by me.</hi> Mat. 11.27. <hi>All things are delivered to me of my Father, &amp;c.</hi> you ſee here, that is not the meaning of it, Chriſt is a ſufficient Doctor, he is the great Prophet of his Church, and is able to inſtruct his people, therefore that is not the meaning of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, not as though we ſhould ſet up a conceited diſtinction of works in the Trinity,<note place="margin">2. Not as though we ſhould ſet up a conceited di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of works in the Trinity.</note> as though a man ſhould ſay, now a man is under the work of the Father, and then under the work of the Sonne, and then under the work of the holy Ghoſt (as ſome imagine,) ſometimes the ſoul is under the work of the Father, as when the ſoul doth not beleeve the Father draws it and pulls it; and when it beleeves, then it is under the work of the Sonne, and he works upon the conſcience, and juſtifies, and ſanctifies it; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it is under the work of the holy Ghoſt, when it is ſealed with the Spirit of promiſe, theſe things are true, yet this is not the meaning, neither doth our Saviour Chriſt intend any ſuch conſtruction, neither have we any warrant for any ſuch diſtinction of works; for as this act of drawing is here given to the Father, ſo <hi>John</hi> 11. it is given to the Sonne; <hi>When I am lifted up I will draw all men unto me,</hi> and as we ſay the ſoul hears the Father, ſo it heares the Son alſo, <hi>John</hi> 5.25. ſo that theſe are but conceits, and as the ſeal is given to the Spirit, ſo it is given to the Father and the Son ſometimes, therefore to ſay that the ſoul is now under the work of the Father, and now under the work of the Sonne, and now under the work of the holy Ghoſt, theſe things are not warrantable in Scripture; but the meaning is this, our Saviour meeting with the ſtubbornneſſe of the Jews that would not believe, but murmured and repined at his doctrine; he puts in this, <hi>no man cometh unto me, except the Father draweth him,</hi> he means their utter inability of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him by nature, unleſſe it be given them from above; if he had ſpoken of it againe, may be would have ſaid no man cometh unto me, except the Spirit draweth him; you muſt know that all the acts of the bleſſed Trinity are indevidable; 'tis true, the Father, as he is firſt in order of ſubſiſtance, ſo he is firſt in order of operation and working, but look what one works all work, one act flows from them all, as it is ſaid, <hi>you are waſhed in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Spirit had a hand in the ſame work, they all do the ſame work; for any further meaning of this, I know not any warrant.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is,<note place="margin">2. What is this voice?</note> what this voice is that the Father doth ſpeak to the ſoul, and ſo the ſoul is made to come to Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Not diſtinct from the word preached.</note> you muſt not conceive that here is any voice diſtinct from the Word, it is but imaginary and notional, when men dream of any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations beſides the Word; it is not a proper, but a metaphorical ſpeech, and it conſiſts in two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in opening a mans ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in removing a mans lameneſſe and inability.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in opening a mans ſenſes,<note place="margin">Conſiſts, 1. In the opening a a mans ſenſes.</note> in opening a mans underſtanding, a mans underſtanding is quite blinded, and cannot ſee the things of God; and though a man literally know all the Scripture, yet notwithſtanding there is a veile upon his eyes, and he doth not ſee the excellency and glory of it; now when the Spirit of God comes and anoints a mans eyes, and takes away the ſcales that they fall off from his eyes, the man now begins with open face to ſee the glory of God, and the glorious Goſpel of God; the natural man ſaw the Goſpel to be a glorious thing, yet the God of this world blinded his eyes that he could not ſee it in this glorious manner; now when the Spirit of the Father comes to call a man effectually, he doth anoint a mans eyes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 35.5. <hi>The eyes of the blinde ſhall ſee,</hi> he makes a man to ſee the wonders of Gods Law, to ſee his gracious promiſes in Jeſus Chriſt, the freeneſſe of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94114:112"/>
them, the indifferency of them, that they are propounded to every man that hath an heart to them, and hungers and thirſts after them; ſo that the Lord doth as it were ſay to the ſoul, here are the promiſes, here you ſee them, beleeve in me, this is the ſpeech of the Father, theſe are the promiſes, this is the happineſſe, if you will embrace it, you may be happy for ever; now the world, and profits, and pleaſures are not ſuch a thing, you may be damned for all them, therefore come unto me and you ſhall have eternal happineſſe; thus the Spirit of the Father ſheweth the ſoul the glory of the wayes of Jeſus Chriſt, and the glory of the promiſes, here they are, beleeve, that is the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he opens the ſenſe of hearing, for as the minde of a man is ſtark blinde, and cannot ſee the things of God; ſo the heart of a man is ſtark dead, and cannot hearken to God; a man hath no ears by nature to hear God ſpeak to him, till the Lord comes and opens his ears, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Eſay</hi> 35.5. <hi>The ears of the deaf ſhall hear</hi>; when the Lord comes to open the ears of the deaf, now the ſoul begins to hear, before it was like the deafe adder, that could not hear the voice of the charmer, charme he never ſo wiſely; though he heard never ſo many Sermons, he yet heard none, his hearing was to no purpoſe, <hi>in hearing he heard, but perceived not</hi>; but when the Lord comes and takes away the uncircumciſion of the eare; the ſoul now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to heare and hearken to him; now the ſtone begins to vaniſh out of the heart, and fleſh and feeling comes in the place thereof; the ſoul is ready to ſay as <hi>Samuel, Speak Lord, thy ſervant heareth</hi>; now the ſoul begins to hear a Sermon, to hear a counſel, to hear a threatning, when the Lord begins to open the ear, this is another thing whereby the ſoul is able to hear what the Lord ſaith.</p>
                  <p>Again,<note place="margin">2. In taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a mans lameneſs.</note> this voice conſiſts in taking away a mans lamneſſe, for as a man was perverted, and this was taken away by opening the ear, yet now a man is lame, and cannot come to Chriſt, therefore the Lord takes away his lameneſſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 35.5. <hi>The feet of the lame ſhall walk</hi>; Firſt, he makes the ſoul walk, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards run, and at laſt to flie as an Eagle; Firſt, it walks, you ſhall walk in my ſtatutes, and afterwards runnes and flies as an Eagle, thus you ſee what this voice is.</p>
                  <p>Now there be two reaſons why it is called a voice.<note place="margin">Called a voice, 1. Becauſe it is joyned to the word.</note> Firſt, becauſe it is a thing joyned with the Word, becauſe it is all one together with the Word, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> he doth not mean their onely outward hearing, for faith will not come by outward hearing, but he means the hearing of the outward ear, and this hearing of the Father ſpeaking to the heart, and ſo faith comes</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Becauſe it hath a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a voice.</note> becauſe it hath a ſimilitude of a voice, the ſoul doth as it were hear a voice ſpeaking to it, not as though the acts you heard of even now can diſtinctly be known, he doth them not vocally, he doth not open the eyes, and open the ear vocally, but as the blind man ſaid, <hi>One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I ſee</hi>; but how he came to ſee, that he could not tell; ſo when the Spirit comes and ſpeaks to his heart, a man can tell no more the way of the Spirit then he can tell how the wind blows, or the faſhioning of the bones in the womb; what man can expreſſe the manner of Gods ſecret work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? could the Apoſtles ſee the breath of Chriſt breathed upon them, when he ſaid, <hi>receive ye the holy Ghoſt?</hi> no, they could not; the acts of the Spirit upon the ſoul cannot be diſcerned, but as the blind man ſaid, <hi>once I was blinde, but now I ſee,</hi> ſo a man may ſay, whereas I was deaf, now I can hear the voice of God; and happy is the man that can ſay this, but the things cannot be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but at the ſame time, when the Lord works theſe acts; the ſoul doth as it were hear a ſpeech, mentally and ſpiritualy in the ſoul, <hi>Eſay</hi> 30 22. <hi>Thou ſhalt hear a voice behind thee, ſaying, this is the way, walk in it,</hi> ſo the Lord ſpeaks to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94114:112"/>
the ſoul, this is the way, and this is the promiſe, and this is the Goſpel of peace, and this is the mercy that I offer unto thee, beleeve it, the Lord makes the ſoule as it were heare a voice, the Lord ſpeakes, and the ſoul hears, it is done after ſuch a manner, ſo effectually, as if the Lord did ſpeak to the heart; <hi>I will allure her into the Wilderneſſe,</hi> the Lord doth as it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice a man, thus and thus it ſhall be with thee if thou wilt follow me, it is done after ſuch a manner, therefore it is called a voice.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may we know whether that ſoul hath heard this voice.</note> how we may know whether the ſoul hath heard this voice or no?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; firſt, there is a power goeth along with the Word,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is a power goes along with this Word.</note> when this voice of the Father goeth with it; there is a power put into the promiſes, not only the Miniſter ſpeaks them, or the bare letter of the word utters them, but when the Spirit ſpeaks with them, there is a power goeth along with them, as <hi>John</hi> 6.44. there is a power to draw the heart; when the Lord calls a man, when he ſpeaks to a man, he puts a power into the promiſe, that it draws the heart of a man, the truth, the goodneſs, the excellency, freeneſſe, attainableneſs of it, the Lord puts a power into theſe things to draw the heart, ſo that that man is drawn to look after heaven, and come to God from day to day, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and incomparable worth of theſe things, having the power of God in them, woeth the heart, and enticeth it, and draws it, and hales it to come to God, and weaneth it from the world, and he lets them go more and more, not ſeeing ſuch worth in them to draw his minde away more and more; hence the Goſpel is call'd the <hi>power of God to ſalvation,</hi> Rom. 16.6. when God calls a man by the Goſpel, he puts a power into all the promiſes, to draw a man home, to pull a man effectually and powerfully unto him, he is enamoured of them, and muſt have them, and will have them, and caſts himſelf upon God, for the having of them, when any ſoul obeyeth the call of God, what is the reaſon that it obeyeth it? it feels a power in the Word, in the promiſes of God, when he hears it preached, as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Our Goſpel came not unto you in Word onely, but in power</hi>; the Lord calling of theſe good, <hi>Theſ. By his grace,</hi> there was a power went along with the Word, and made them receive the Word, and that drew their hearts to take it, though by nature they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from it, though by nature they were ſtubborn, and rebellious, and would not ſubmit to the Goſpel, yet when the Lord puts this power into the promiſe to overwoe the ſoul more then luſts and ſinnes, and things of the world could do; more then the inclinations of the ſoul could do, it came with a ſtronger power then all theſe to the ſoul, and this made the ſoul hear this voice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he that hears this voice, hears more then a man, or any creature;<note place="margin">2. This voice makes one hear more then any creature can ſpeak.</note> ſay unto him beleeve, ſaying unto him, come unto Chriſt, caſt thy ſelfe upon God, here is mercy, here is a promiſe; here is peace that thou needeſt, when he doth not onely hear the Miniſter ſay it, all the Congregation hears him ſpeak it, and no man ſtirs, but when a man hears more then a Miniſter ſay ſo, he feels ſuch a coming of the Word to him, that all the created powers in heaven and earth could never move him in that manner, then he heares the voice of the Spirit of God, for when God calls a man effectually; he makes the Goſpel a glaſſe for a man to ſee the glory of God thorow, as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. he means by the glaſſe there, the Goſpel; the Lord when he calls a man, he makes the Goſpel a glaſſe to him, that he may behold the glory of God, the infinite graciouſneſſe and lovelineſſe of God, the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, happineſſe, and bleſſedneſſe of God, and what an infinite fountaine of all goodneſſe he is in his own Son Jeſus Chriſt; he lets him ſee, not only the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; every man ſeeth the Goſpel, but every man hath not this glaſſe, it is not this glaſſe to him, to let him ſee the glory of God; when God turns a man he comes with this glorious light thorow the Goſpel to his ſoul, there is a great light ſhines from heaven about a man, as there did about Saint <hi>Paul</hi>;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94114:113"/>
the Goſpel it ſelf a light, and every man ſeeth this light, but there is darkneſs upon the minde ſtill for all that, but when God calls a man there is a great light comes into the ſoul, <hi>you are a choſen generation, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. mark, there is a marvellous deal of light the Lord lets into the ſoul, that the ſoul can now ſee how the devil, and ſin, and the world deluded him, and how the world, and all profits and pleaſures are a meer painted thing, and are meerly vexations of Spirit; now he ſees how to diſtinguiſh between things and things, there is a glorious and a marvellous light come in, he ſees the wiles of his own heart, and how he was beguiled before, and betwitched by the devil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he ſeeth all the folly and the Popery of his own heart; ſuch a deal of light comes in that it diſcovers all ſo far forth, as is neceſſary to bring him to God; now he ſees that his moaping and blundering upon his ſins, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of himſelf, it had a form of humility, but it was nothing but pride and ſtubbornneſſe of heart, and he would rather have him be without mercy, then have it upon Gods termes; he beholding the glory of God, ſeeth the wyles and deceits of his own ſoul, this light ſheweth him the glory of God, and propounds to him theſe things, and makes him beleeve them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this ſame voice of the Father, when the Father ſpeaks to a man, it is the irrefragable propounding of the promiſe to him,<note place="margin">3. It is the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the promiſe.</note> when the promiſes of the Goſpel are delivered in an irrefragable mannner, contrary to all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the heart of man, all the pleas that can be brought againſt it, it comes in an irrefragable manner, and holds itſelf before him, that he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not that he may not be tempted to the contrary, but he ſees that they are but temptations; O ſaith the ſoul, I ſee I am unwilling to do good duties, what of that? if thou wouldeſt be willing, the promiſe is free; may be, ſaith the ſoul, I am full of ſtubbornneſſe, and rebellion, and unprofitableneſs; what of that? that is nothing ſaith the promiſe, if thou come to me, I can heal thee of this ſtubbornneſſe, beleeve in me this is the way to be rid of thy ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to have a better heart, and more abilities, as long as it is a burthen to thee; beleeve in me, it comes in an irrefragable manner, ſo that the ſoul can ſay, I refuſed comfort all this while, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 77. comfort was propounded to me, but I would not have it, I was ſullen and peeviſh, and put it off, and withſtood my own comforts, now the ſoul ſeeth its putting off of Gods mercie, and the forſaking its own mercies, and the gracious proffers ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to it, I ſay when the Spirit ſpeaks this voice to the ſoul, it ſpeaks in a marvellous great and convincing manner, it ſpeaks in a prevailing manner, it ſpeaks over and above all, it ſpeaks in a raviſhing manner, it makes the ſoule ſee a cornucopia of all good, an abundant treaſury of all mercy in the ways of God, and in the promiſes of the Goſpel, it makes a man ſee that whatſoever the heart can wiſh and deſire that is good, it is there to be had, and no where elſe to be attained, it ſpeaks in an uncontroulable manner to the ſoul, that the ſoul can ſtand out no longer, but muſt come off.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have finiſhed the firſt part of Effectual Calling, and now we come to the ſecond; Namely, the anſwer to this Call; for this is the difference between effectual calling, and that which is not effectual; the one makes a man come, and the other doth not; now this coming is by faith, and this we have here in the text, <hi>He that cometh unto me, &amp;c.</hi> Now before I come to handle this point, I muſt premiſe ſomething concerning faith; Namely, that it is not only a bare aſſent of the minde that all good things are in Chriſt, but it is a confidence for the having of all the good things that are in him, it is not only the firſt act of faith: Namely, an aſſent to the truths of the Goſpel, that God hath put all treaſures of eternal life in his Son; this I will not ſpeak of, becauſe all, both Papiſts and Proteſtants agree in this, that faith is an aſſent of the minde, this is a controverſie on neither ſide, therefore I will omit it. But it is the ſecond part or act of faith, which is the believing that in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he ſhall have eternal life; which is an act of the heart, and this is that which I will ſtand upon, it is a confidence in God and Chriſt for all good things, when a man doth not only believe that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are yea and amen in Chriſt, but when a man doth fiducially and confidencially bear himſelf, and reſt upon Chriſt for all theſe things, he comes to Chriſt for all good he looks for, this I will prove to be an act of a juſtifying faith, and that I may not be miſtaken, I will diſtinguiſh;</p>
                  <p>There is a confidence in the power of God,<note place="margin">2. Confidence, in natural man.</note> a natural man may believe the power of God, and yet not have a juſtifying faith, all that had miraculous faith did believe the power of God,<note place="margin">1. In the power of God.</note> but the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. <hi>If I had all faith,</hi> that is all miraculous faith, even to the removing of mountaines without charity it were nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is an unrooted confidence of the will,<note place="margin">2. Unrooted in the will.</note> which may be in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man; as a natural man may believe that Chriſt is the only <hi>hope of Glory, the only way, the Truth and the Life,</hi> the only one, for whoſe ſake he ſhall be accepted; as he may aſſent to this ſo he may have a kinde of unrooted confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in theſe things, which may procure a great deal of peace to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; this is that which Divines call a temporary faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>for a time they do believe, &amp;c.</hi> A natural man may not only believe Chriſt, but believe in Chriſt in ſome ſenſe truly he cannot, but in an unrooted manner, there may be ſuch an act put forth, though it be not rooted in the heart, this you may ſee, <hi>John</hi> 2.23, 24. <hi>Many believed on Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>yet he would not commit himſelf unto them</hi>; he would not truſt them with mercy, and grace, and favour; he would not truſt them in regard of his own body and ſafety, they were not right for all that; and yet they did not only believe Chriſt, but in ſome ſenſe, and in an unrooted manner they believed on Chriſt; therefore there is not only a firme aſſent to the truth which may be in a natural man, but alſo ſome kind of confidence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:94114:114"/>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> there is a preſumptuous confidence in God and Chriſt for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the workers of iniquity may have; they may not only believe the general truths of the Goſpel, but have ſome kind of confidence in Chriſt, though not ſo good as the former, for that reformes a man, and makes him follow Chriſt till perſecution come, and may be in perſecution too, till he be weary; but this is not ſo good, you ſhall have a drunkard, a prophane perſon, he hath confidence in Chriſt that God heares his prayers, accepts his duties, and will provide for him, our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaks of ſuch, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. He tells us of many that ſhall be confident in him, how they have done wonderful works in his Name, and eate and drank in his preſence, and have heard him preach in their ſtreets, and yet are but workers of iniquity; I do not mean this neither, theſe are but falſe confidences.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two godly confidences,<note place="margin">2. Confidence in the godly.</note> gracious ones ſuch as are only in Gods Elect, and not in all Gods Elect neither; but only in ſuch as are effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and yet come not within this definition of faith:<note place="margin">1. Special per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Gods love.</note> The firſt is that full ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial perſwaſion of the heart; a man may have true juſtifying faith though he never attaine to this, for juſtifying faith is a confidence in Chriſt for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; now this ſpecial and full perſwaſion of the heart, is not only an affiance in Chriſt for juſtification, it doth not only apprehend Chriſt for juſtification, but it apprehends juſtification it ſelf; now this muſt needs be after juſtifying, a man muſt needs be juſtified before he can confidently apprehend juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he muſt firſt be juſtified before he can ſay he is juſtified, the object muſt be before the act. Thus it goeth, juſtifying faith muſt needs be before juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and juſtification muſt be before the ſenſe and feeling of juſtification; before a man can feel and apprehend he is juſtified; the cauſe goeth before the effect in order of nature, for a man is juſtified by faith; Now if a man know he is juſtified, then the thing muſt be true before he knows it is ſo; now here they differ, that faith is a confident apprehending of Chriſt for juſtification, and this full ſpecial perſwaſion of the heart is not only a confident apprehending of Chriſt for juſtification, but an apprehending of juſtification it ſelf: Now true juſtifying faith may be without this, <hi>Job.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Though he kill me yet I will truſt in him</hi>; That is, ſuppoſe that I were at an utter loſſe, that I knew not whether God will ſlay me; yet ſlay me, or not ſlay me; periſh, or not periſh; <hi>I will truſt in him</hi>; Imagine God deliver me up, and will none of me; yet <hi>though he kill me, I will truſt in him</hi>; I do not ſay I am at this loſſe that he will kill me, bleſſed be God I am not in this caſe; but if I were at this loſſe, that he would kill me for ought I knew, yet I would truſt in him, ſo that we ſee this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence may be without this full perſwaſion of heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. A conſtant expectation.</note>Secondly, there is another good confidence that comes not within this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of faith, and that is a conſtant expectation, and this is the daughter of faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. This confidence whereby the ſoul hopes in God, differs from the confidence of faith, for this confidence is an effect of faith, it is by faith; Now theſe two differ thus, the confidence of hope is that which a man hath for the future having of thoſe things that for the preſent a man believes; now the confidence of faith is the confident apprehending of Chriſt for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth in Chriſt hath eternal life,</hi> he that believes in Chriſt hath a preſent poſſeſſion of that he believes in Chriſt for, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life is his for the preſent,<note place="margin">Confidence in Chriſt for life and ſalvation is true juſtifying faith.</note> he hath preſent juſtification and acceptance with God, and hath a title to all good and all the mercies of the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to prove this, that this confidence is a true juſtifying faith; and the Arguments to prove it are theſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. From the ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of faith in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> and the firſt is taken from the ſeveral expreſſions of faith in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.22. it is called a truſting, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not in God; Why? <hi>They truſted not in his ſalvation</hi>; ſo that faith is a truſting in God,<note place="margin">1. Truſting</note> when a man hath confidence in God, and can fiducially leane
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94114:114"/>
upon God for all good things. As <hi>Alexander</hi> truſted his Phyſician, when his Phyſician gave him a Potion, before he took it, a friend of his wrote unto him, do not take the Potion, the man is ſet to poyſon you; if you take it you are a dead man; he read the letter, and then took the Potion, and then gave the letter to the Phyſician, and ſaid, I have truſted to your faithfulneſs, and caſt my ſelf upon you, if you have given me poyſon you have killed me; you ſee by the letter I have witneſs of it, but I truſt you, and ſuppoſe you have not done it. So faith is a truſting upon God, when the ſoul reſolves to follow God in all wayes, and when the world and the fleſh come in and object, if you be ſo ſtrict and follow theſe courſes, you will undo your ſelf, and be laughed at, and looſe your friends, your very living depends upon ſuch a courſe, and you will be a begger, and will never have any delight, you are given to pleaſure and laughter, but all theſe muſt be gone, farewell all carnal pleaſure; Well, but the ſoul now believes in God, God bids him come to him for comfort, for friends, for delight, for pleaſure, for the ſatisfaction of all his deſires, and he ſhall want no manner of good, he truſts upon this, and he will never leave God, never leave his wayes, this is rooted in him, and now he can go to God and ſay, the Devil told me I ſhould looſe my friends, and I ſhould never have comfort, never be able to live, my fleſh and my own heart ſaid ſo, but I have truſted thee, and if friends go, ſo, farewell friends; if means go, ſo, farewell them; I am told ſo, fleſh and blood ſay ſo, but I believe in thee is eternal life, and in thee is all peace, and happineſſe, and comfort, and this is that which drawes me to thee; and keeps me to thee, and I reſt upon thee for all good; thus you ſee that faith muſt be an affiance in God, becauſe it is a truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is called a relying upon God,<note place="margin">2. Relying on God.</note> as <hi>Aſa,</hi> when the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> and <hi>Lubims</hi> came againſt him, the Scriptures ſhewes that he believed in God, now mark how the Scripture expreſſeth his faith, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Becauſe thou didſt relie upon the Lord, therefore he delivered them into their hands</hi>; May be the world might tell him, what do you think to overcome theſe enemies, with ſtrictneſs and faſting, and praying.</p>
                  <p>You had more need make a league with the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and take ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe, but he relied upon God, and if he failed him, he failed him, he would relie upon him, and therefore faith muſt needs be an affiance in God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, faith is called a ſtaying upon God,<note place="margin">3. Staying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God.</note> when a man ſtayes himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. there faith is expreſſed by ſtaying a mans ſelf upon God, <hi>He that ſitteth in darkneſs and ſeeth no light, let him truſt in the Lord and ſtay himſelf upon his God.</hi> It is a ſimilitude taken from a ſtaffe, and old man that dares not truſt to his own legs, but thinks I ſhall fall and get ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, he takes a ſtaffe and ſtayes himſelf upon it, now is this all that he looks upon, that he conceives the ſtaffe is able to bear him? ſo a man that hath no ſtaffe knows that ſuch a ſtaffe is able to beare him that is not the thing, but this man doth not only believe the ſtaffe is able to beare him, but he commits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto it, and leanes upon it, and if he falls he is content, he laies the bulk of his body upon the ſtaffe, and dares leane upon it; ſo it is with faith, it is not only an aſſent to this, that God is wiſe and omnipotent, and gracious, and an hearer of prayers, and that he comforts them that mourne for ſinne, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies them that hunger for righteouſneſſe, he not only believes there is a Chriſt, and ſalvation in him, he not only aſſents to theſe things, but he ſtaies upon them, and commits himſelf to them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is expreſſed by a mans rolling himſelf upon God,<note place="margin">4. Rolling ones ſelf on God.</note> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. We tranſlate the words, <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord</hi>; but in the Originall, it ſignifieth to roll a mans way upon God, ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.8. He truſted God would deliver him, it is the ſame word is uſed here, he rolled himſelf upon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94114:115"/>
God; this is a ſimilitude taken from a Cart-wheele, that rolls it ſelf about the Axeltree, and ſtaies it ſelf upon it, and helps it ſelf in its motion, it could not move, but for that, and by vertue of that it moves to and fro. So this is true faith, not only when a man aſſents to the promiſes of God, but rolls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon God, moves his ſoul upon Chriſt, and commits himſelf unto Chriſt in all his wayes.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Adhering unto God.</note> faith is expreſſed by adherence and ſticking unto God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.31. <hi>I have ſtuck unto thy Commandements, Lord put me not unto confuſion</hi>; as who ſhould ſay; Lord, here I hang, here I hold, here I will ſtick faſt; I will ever fear thee, I will ever obey thee, here I hang, and hold, and will keep my hold; <hi>Lord put me not to confuſion</hi>; that is, Lord I hope thou wilt do as thou haſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; Lord let me not be confounded, let me not be ſcoffed at in the world; if I be put to ſhame I am confounded, doth this man now only believe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in general? No, but he relieth upon theſe promiſes, he dares go and take this Bear by the tooth, and dares venter upon thoſe harſh duties that are croſſe to a mans will, and ſeeme to have no good in them; What, becauſe he aſſents to the promiſes that they are true? No, but becauſe he is confident that the promiſes ſhall be performed. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.4. there ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites, You that did cleave to the Lord your God, you are all alive at this day</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, though your brethren went away from God, ſome to ſatisfie their luſts, as in the matter of quailes and fleſh-pots, and others to humour their fancies, as in the matter of the calf, and others to fulfill their filthy delights, as in the matter of <hi>Baal-Peor,</hi> your brethren went away from God as if they might have comfort, and delight, and good elſewhere, they went from God, but <hi>you cleave to God, and are all alive to this day</hi>; that is, as you did look for good in God you had it; your brethren looked for good elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and they are diſappointed, where are their profits and pleaſures? They went away from God and are dead, but you followed God, <hi>and are alive to this day.</hi> So 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.6. it is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah that he clave to God, &amp;c.</hi> that is, he did not only conceive that the chief good was in God, but he did ſtick to God in all his wayes, he did cleave to God and would not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">6. Beleeving on God.</note> a true juſtifying faith is expreſſed in Scripture by believing on God, or believing in God; a phraſe that is not uſed in any Greek Authour, but only in the Scripture, and thoſe that have been acquainted with the Scripture; now why doth God pick out a new phraſe, but to imply a new work? What, is it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aſſent to the truth? Then the old phraſe would have ſerved the turne, but when a man believes on God, or in God, this is the expreſſion of a juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. So <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Sonne, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. What do all theſe phraſes import, onely a naked conſent and belief, that all the things in the Goſpel are true? No, but when a man can believe on theſe things, when a man can ſubmit to all the Ordinances of God, and embrace Chriſt in all his wayes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all the good things ſpoken of in the Goſpel are to be had in him.</p>

From the offer of Chriſt.</note>I confeſſe ſometimes ſimple believing Chriſt, without on, or in, is put for a juſtifying faith, as <hi>Ro.</hi> 4.3. it is ſaid that, <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſnes</hi>; he doth not ſay he believed in God, but that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and if you look into <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. you ſhall find through the ſtory that he beleived in God; he did not only believe that God was good, but he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf to God in all his wayes, and did relie upon him; that God was Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and that made him walk before God in uprightneſſe, and that made him live a different life from all the reſt of the Countrey, this ſhews that it was a confidence and affiance in God, that was accounted to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. From the offer of Chriſt.</note> which is the giving of Chriſt to be a propitiation for ſin, and to be a Mediatour between God and man, to be the only means of eternal life; this is the offer of Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel, Chriſt is given to be a redeemer to them that do believe; now what can anſwer this giving? Can only an act of the mind anſwer this gift? 'Tis true indeed, he is the only Mediatour, the only Meſſias, <hi>the only way, the truth and the life</hi>; and he is freely offered and given in the Goſpel, I believe this and aſſent unto it; is this taking? No, this is only believing he may take him, therefore true faith muſt be a taking of Chriſt; that only anſwers to the giving of Chriſt; giving is a relative which anſwers to taking, a gift is no gift except it be taken; the nature of the gift returns back again to the giver if it be not taken; ſo it is here, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Sonne, that whoſoever believed in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life</hi>; He gave his only begotten Sonne; that hath a relation to taking of him, he gave him, that whoſoever believeth on him might not periſh; that is, God gave him that whoſoever takes him <hi>might not periſh but have eternal life</hi>; though a man offer himſelf to a woman, yet if the woman do not take him, he is not her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the match is made up by taking: ſo though Chriſt be given to the world in the Goſpel, yet Chriſt is not ours but by taking of him; when you take Chriſt, then you are in the number of thoſe that ſhall not periſh, but have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life; when you take Chriſt, that is, when you take him to be your chiefe good, when you take his promiſes to be your ſtay and propp, to be the the life and comfort of your hearts, when you take his Commandements to do them, when you take his ordinances to walk in them, when you take his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to have ſociety with them, when you take Chriſt, and all Chriſt, now you ſhall have everlaſting life, this is to take Chriſt, though the woman aſſent firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the man is a proper man, and a goodly man, and a godly man, and a rich man, this makes not up the match; but when ſhe takes him to be her husband, then ſhe hath intereſt in his perſon, and all that he hath; ſo when a man takes Chriſt, then he hath title to Chriſt and all the good things, that are in him.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid of the faithfull, that they did not only ſee the Promiſes afar off, but they did embrace them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. the word ſignifieth they hugged them, they kiſt them; many ſee the Promiſes afar off, but embrace them not; they embrace the things of this preſent world, they hugg them, but never take the promiſes of God home to there ſoules; true faith therefore is ſuch a faith as takes Chriſt, and then it followes, that it cannot be an act of the mind, but an act of the heart in relying and taking the thing to himſelf, to hang upon it; and live by it.</p>
                  <p>The third argument is this, Faith is an act of coming unto Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Becauſe faith is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt.</note> Chriſt you know is the righteouſneſſe of God, now when a man is come to it, he hath it; now what motion of coming is this? is it only a motion of the mind, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the mind, when a man ſeeth Chriſt afar off? I may ſee a goodly man, a goodly thing afarr of, my eye ſight may go to it, but if my whole man do not come to it, I am not come to it, this cannot be only the Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind, when the eye of a mans underſtanding diſcovers Chriſt, for this makes him the more foole and the more inexcuſable, if he comes not to him; no this motion of coming unto Chriſt, it is a ſpirituall motion of all the whole man, a mans minde goeth to Chriſt and a mans heart, and a mans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and all the ſtrength of a mans ſoule goeth to Chriſt, this is coming to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden</hi>; that is beleive in me; he puts it into that phraſe, this true faith makes the ſoul come to Chriſt, ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>to whome coming as</hi> to a chiefe corner ſtone: There are two tearmes in this coming to Chriſt, the one from whence a man comes, from all his owne wayes, from all his owne deſires, from all his owne ends and aimes,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94114:116"/>
and the other tearme is, to what a man comes, and that is to Chriſt, to his promiſes, to his Commandements, to live and dy with him, this is coming unto Chriſt, as you may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. there both theſe tearmes are ſet downe. <hi>to open their eyes</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>and to turne them from darkneſſe to light, that they might receive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes</hi>; It is this coming that receives forgiveneſſe, not only an act of the mind, when that goeth to Chirſt, but an act of the heart, when that goeth to Chriſt, when a man comes from darkneſſe to light, from pride to humility, from the world to God, when a man paſſeth from the one tearme to the other tearme, and ſo cometh to this righteouſneſſe of God in Jeſus Chriſt; now he is come to Chriſt, and now he ſhall receive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, ſo that you ſee faith is not only an aſſent of the mind, but an affiance of the heart, both theſe together make up this coming of the ſoule to Chriſt.</p>

I will make this appeare to you, you know God doth count it Idolatry for a man to believe in any creature, when a man believes in the Son of man, God forbids this, as an Idolatrous thing, for a man to believe and put his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and affiance in any creature, now what is the meaning of this? what, is this Idolatry, to aſſent to ſuch a creature? to believe that ſuch a man is his friend and tenders him, and is faithfull unto him, this is a truth about a friend, is this Idolatry? No, but when a man makes a friend his ſtaffe, a creature his ſtaffe, when a man makes riches his Idol, is this onely to aſſent that riches can do much in the world, can buy meate, and cloathes, and lands, and inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is it the knowing theſe things are ſo? No, but when a man makes riches his prop and ſtay, and believes in them, and that is the ſtay that he hath; It is not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94114:116"/>
the beleiving theſe things about riches, for ſo a man that believes only in God may know theſe things about riches and a friend, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Curſed is he that maketh fleſh his arme,</hi> he doth not ſay, curſed is he that apprehends that a man is his friend and willing to releive him; but curſed is he that maketh fleſh his arme, that leans upon this man, that truſts unto him, that is the thing; ſo what is the meaning that we muſt not truſt in Chariots and in horſes? doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mean that we may not aſſent and affirme theſe truths about them, that they are many, and ſtrong, and potent, that they are admirable horſes? is this it? No, but, <hi>woe be to them that go down to Egypt for help, and put their truſt in Chariots and Horſes,</hi> Iſa. 31.1. When a man rides a journey and makes his Horſe his ſtay; when a man goeth about a buſineſſe, and makes his purſe his prop; when a man walks from day to day, and the creature is the thing he hangs upon; he doth not ſee God, and draw near to God; he doth not ſet his heart upon God; he doth not relie upon him, to have God with him in his journey, and what he goeth about; No, he hath an Horſe with him, and means, and maintenance with him; and God ſhall have a prayer may be now and then, but he makes not God his arme, and this is idolatry; ſo our believing, it is not the believing the propoſitions about a thing, but when a man believes in the thing it ſelf, and makes the thing his ſtay, his buckler, his aide, his help and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the maine Argument is this; true juſtifying faith is a faith of union,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. Becauſe true faith is a faith of union.</note> it is ſuch a faith as unites a man to God and Chriſt, and in him to God; the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. <hi>We know that we are in him that is true</hi>; his meaning is, we are in him by faith, that is, we have ſuch a kinde of faith, whereby we do not only aſſent to him, that he is the Sonne of God, and all things are true that are ſpoken of him; but we are in him, we are in him that is true; that is, we are united to him, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Whoſoever is in Christ is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>; and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junia,</hi> they were in Chriſt before him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>7. So Chriſt is ſaid to be in them, <hi>Know ye not that Chriſt Jeſus is in you, except you be reprobates?</hi> it is the faith of union, <hi>He that hath the Sonne, hath life,</hi> 1 John 5.12. That is, he that believes in the Sonne of God; that is, ſo believes that he hath him, and is united to him, that man hath life, and none elſe; ſo that it is a faith of union that juſtifies a man; not as though faith of it ſelf doth this for its own worthineſſe, as though it were able to unite a man to Chriſt, it is only by vertue of Gods Ordinance that faith unites a man to Chriſt; God of his infinite mercy and goodneſſe hath appointed faith to be ſuch a thing, that upon putting forth of that act, he ſhall preſently have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Chriſt, and Communion with him; by grace are we ſaved through faith, ſaith the Apoſtle; we are ſaved through faith, but not for any worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, but by grace; this is the thing, the Lord hath appointed ſuch a kinde of faith ſhall juſtifie as ſhall unite a man to Jeſus Chriſt; Nay, if faith did not do this, faith could not juſtifie, and ſanctifie, and purifie, and intitle a man to Heaven, for it doth all theſe by vertue of union; firſt, it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites a man to Chriſt, and makes Chriſt one with him, and him one with Chriſt, and ſo he comes to have right and title to all the merits, and all the good things that come by Chriſt; ſo then, if thou haſt not this faith of union, though thou haſt all faiths beſides hiſtorical faith, temporary faith, and if it were poſſible miraculous faith; Nay, if thou hadſt ten thouſand thouſand faiths more, if it were poſſible; yet if thou haſt not ſuch a faith as to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, thou art in thy ſins, and art under the law, and under the curſe of the law, and under Gods juſtice; if thou ſhouldeſt pray never ſo much, and give thy body to be burned, yet if thou do not dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in thee; if thou be not one with Chriſt, and Chriſt one with thee, thou art no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but as ſounding Braſſe, and as a tinkling Cymball; though thou haſt been a profeſſor theſe twenty yeares together, and haſt been taken for a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Only a confeſſion of hiſtorica, faith: when a man believes that God is ſo and ſo, and confeſſeth him; No the Apoſtle expounds himſelf, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. as who ſhould ſay, it is ſuch a faith as wholly reſignes a man unto God, to be ruled and guided by him as well as ſaved by him; it is ſuch a faith as makes a man with minde, and heart, and will, and all that is in a man, to caſt himſelf upon Chriſt, ſo that all obedience, and all conformity to the Sonne of God will follow; he that hath this faith to keep his Commandements, dwelleth in God, and God in him. Now what kinde of faith can this be? can it be only the act of the minde whereby a man believes all the truths concerning Chriſt? doth this unite a man to Chriſt? It were blaſphemy to ſay ſo, for by this Argument, the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and a true believer, were no better then the union between a true believer and the Devil, becauſe a true believer believes all the truths and aſſents unto them that God hath ſpoken concerning the Devil, as well as concerning Chriſt, this doth not unite a man; there is a kinde of union in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the minde, but that union is only notional, and intentional, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal; as for example, when I think of an horſe, or a tree, there is an union of the tree with my minde, for the tree is in my minde in the notion of it, but this is a bare intentional and ſimple union; the maine union of all is in the heart, when the heart is united to a thing; an heavenly minded man, he may have an union of his underſtanding with the things of this world; he may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand carnal men, underſtand their courſes and wayes; and there is a notional, intentional union with theſe things in his underſtanding, but he is not truly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to thoſe courſes except his heart be ſet upon thoſe courſes, then he takes them up; ſo untill the heart is ſet upon Chriſt, a man is never heavenly, never godly, never a true Chriſtian, till he is thus united into Chriſt. Nay, I will tell you more, and I will prove it, and it is a thing to be conſidered, that were it poſſible; Suppoſe God ſhould reveal, (he might if he would) to any man, that he is elected before he is converted; Suppoſe this, I do not ſay God doth thus to any of his Elect; but ſuppoſe an Elect man that is yet unconverted, and yet out of Chriſt, he is a natural man, and yet an elected man; Suppoſe I ſay, God ſhould reveal to this man, thou art elected to eternal life, I have intended from all eternity to give my Son to thee, all his merits, and death, and paſſion; I have intended them to thee, and I have intended thou ſhalt have fellowſhip with him; God reveales this, and the man firmly aſſents to the authority of the ſpeaker, that he is elected to eternal life; doth this faith juſtifie a man? A man is in his ſins, yet for all this, though he knoweth, and God hath revealed ſuch a thing to him, that he hath intended Chriſt to him, (as long as he hath not revealed that he is in Chriſt) this doth not put him into Chriſt, this ſheweth him that he ſhall be in Chriſt; but this act of believing doth not put him into Chriſt; therefore the children of God that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and are believers, and can believe that God hath elected them, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally intended Chriſt to them, this act of their faith doth not juſtifie them, this only is an act to know that they are juſtified already, and converted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                  <p>I will ſhew you an excellent place for this, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For which cauſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I alſo ſuffer theſe things, for I know in whom I have believed, and that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that day.</hi> Mark here, I know in whom I have believed, there is the act of faith, I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him, he expounds himſelf there, he means I have commited my ſelf to him, all I have, all I am, this was the act of juſtification, and intitling him unto him; but now ſaith he, I know this, this is an act of aſſurance whereby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects

upon himſelf, that God was his God, and intended to ſave him; but this was not the thing that juſtified him: No, I believe on him, and committed my ſelf unto him; and I know this, this act is but the knowledge of a mans juſtifying faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not the thing it ſelf.</p>

The reaſon why the Papiſts ſay ſo, is this, becauſe they hold that a juſtifying faith is nothing elſe but a firme aſſent of the minde, to the general promiſes of the Goſpel, and in particular the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes in and through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſay, this is a true faith; now, when we ſay this may be a dead faith; 'tis true, ſay they, therefore a man is quickened and enlivened by charity and good works, ſo that this faith and good works will juſtifie a man, but this is Antichriſtian leaven; but I ſay that true juſtifying faith is not in the mind only, but in the heart alſo.</p>

But they are two ſeveral offices of one and the ſelf-ſame ſoul; the ſelf-ſame ſoul able to underſtand, is called the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and the ſelf-ſame ſoul able to will, is called the will; the ſelf-ſame ſoul is able to underſtand and will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſe that the underſtanding and the will were really different <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> one from another, yet I ſay, it is not properly to be ſaid that faith is either in the underſtanding or in the will, but it is properly in the ſoul of a man; the reaſon is, becauſe faith is an act of the new nature, a believer is born of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. and regeneration or the new nature is not in the underſtanding or will only, but the whole ſoul is regenerate, the very ſoul hath a new nature; I do not remember that <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeaks of regeneration, but only in this place, and he ſaith that regeneration is in the ſoul, and the ſoul is regenerated; not as though the ſubſtance of the ſoul were altered; but this new nature is as deeply rooted in the ſoul as the underſtanding and will it ſelf; as it is with the old nature in a man unconverted, this old nature moves the underſtanding to think of worldly things, and ſavour them, and moves the will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to love worldly things, and go after them; the old nature moves both minde and will to go this way; the old nature is the inclination of a man to the world, to the creature, to the things of this life; now, when the new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes in and a man is renewed, this new nature inclines the minde to minde Jeſus Chriſt, and inclines the will to affect Jeſus Chriſt, and moves all the ſoul to go that way, ſo that the very ſoul is renewed, and faith is as deeply rooted in the ſoul as any thing elſe; Nay, as low as the very faculties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſome ſence, for it reacheth ſo far forth as to move them after Chriſt; and this faith puts forth the mind to aſſent to the truths of the Goſpel, and puts forth the will to relie upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Scripture plainly ſeates faith in the heart as well as in the minde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10 <hi>With the heart a man believeth unto righteouſneſſe,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may a man ſay that the heart is put for the whole ſoul of a man, it is not put for the will, the text plainly ſhewes he meanes the will, becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94114:118"/>
puts the believing with the heart, to diſtinguiſh this faith from all other, to exclude hypocriſie and all counterfeit faith; for an hypocrite may confeſſe with his tongue, he may have braine faith, and notional faith, ſo much as to work upon the outward man; but <hi>with the heart a man believeth unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi>; if it be a ſincere cordial faith, as he notionally believes theſe truths, ſo his heart runnes after them and is ſet upon them, and this is unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſo when the Ennuch had asked <hi>Philip</hi> for baptiſme, I am a believer, and what lets but I may be baptized? ſaith he, <hi>if thou believeſt with all thine heart thou mayeſt</hi>; As who ſhould ſay, thou ſaieſt thou art a believer, but take heed, do not deceive thy ſoul; may be thou haſt an intellectual faith, but is it an heart faith? Nay, thou maieſt have ſome kinde of cordial faith, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary faith; but doeſt thou believe with all thine heart? Doeſt thou place all thine heart upon Chriſt? Doeſt thou place all thy ends and aimes upon Chriſt? Doeſt thou ſo reach thy ſelf forth to Chriſt, that in all things Chriſt have the preheminence? Doeſt thou wholly reſigne thy ſelf up unto Chriſt, minde, and heart, and all that is in thee? If thou believeſt with all thine heart I dare be bold to baptize thee, and ſeale thee up unto eternal life; ſo that the Scripture makes faith to be not only an aſſent of the mind, but an affiance of the heart in Chriſt.</p>

He doth not ſay, whoſoever believes he ſhall have eternal life, hath it, but whoſoever believes in me he ſhall have it, though he be afraid he ſhall not have it, yet if he believes in me he ſhall have it certainly, if with heart, and minde, and ſoul, and all, he reſigne up himſelf to me, to be guided and ruled
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94114:118"/>
by me in all his wayes, if he commits himſelf to me he ſhall have eternal life: may be he is afraid he ſhall not have it; a man hath that affiance in Chriſt, that is confident in Chriſt for ſalvation, and commits himſelf to Chriſt for all his comfort, and hope, and ſtay, and is fully reſolved by the Grace of God never to leave him, he is inwardly purpoſed never to forſake him, he will ever ſet himſelf to pleaſe him, he will ever follow his Commandements, and ever ſtrive againſt his corruptions; and whereas he may be tempted to be carried from him, he hath an inward principle in his ſoul for a rule which he goeth by, that he muſt pleaſe God, and not man; there is an inward rule rooted in his ſoul, that thus it is, and this man commits himſelf to Chriſt, for audience in his prayers, for acceptance in his duties, for the reſiſting of his corruptions, and for the ſalvation of his ſoul when he dieth, and for the comfortable reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his body at the laſt day; yet notwithſtanding this man would give a world to be aſſured of Gods favour, though he caſts himſelf upon God for it, and commits himſelf, and betruſts himſelf with Jeſus Chriſt; he doth ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him that he dares follow him in all his wayes, and he dares caſt himſelf upon him; whatſoever it will coſt me I will follow Chriſt; may be it may coſt me the ill will of my friends; may be of my husband; may be it may coſt me the ill will of all the Countrey; yet that way I will walk, though it coſt me fire and faggot; may be I ſhall be perſecuted and impriſoned, it is no matter, here is eternal life, and no where elſe; here I come for it, and here I truſt that Chriſt will give it to me, it is he only that can help me, he only that can give me audience in prayer, he only can bring me to acceptance in heaven; here I come to him for it, and caſt my ſelf upon him in all my wayes; yet may be this man would give a world for this favour; that he hath committed himſelf to Chriſt, for he would give all the world to the ſhirt upon his back that he had the ſenſe and feeling of it, many times between hope and deſpaire, he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſtaggers and knows not what to think, yet he will caſt himſelf upon Chriſt, and truſt to him; yet he hath much ado to believe certainly, there is a great deal of feares and doubtings in his faith; the reaſon is, when a man hath truſted in Chriſt, and lookes upon his faith, he ſhall finde may be ſuch ſtrength of worldly allurements, ſuch yieldings to the aſſents of the fleſh, and himſelf ſometimes foiled with a paultry and petty luſt; he ſhall finde ſuch a deal of deadneſſe, and ſo much untowardneſſe, and ſuch a company of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions marching before him, that he is afraid; 'tis true, I have caſt my ſelf upon Chriſt, but I doubt my faith is not of the right ſtamp; not as though a man can believe in hugger mugger, and a man knows not what he doth, for a man ſees it, and knows it, for the ſpirit of a man knows what is in him; ask the man? Sir, do you not do thus and thus? Yes, have you not theſe and theſe workings in you? he cannot deny it, do you not hate your ſelf for every ſinne you know, and do you not know your own ſinnes, and do you not grieve to ſee what a vile creature you are? do you not labour after more ſincerity in your wayes, and more quickning in good duties? He cannot deny but he hungers after theſe things, and do you not ſtill follow Chriſt, and cleave ſtill to Chriſt, and do you not ſtill labour to deny your ſelfe? He cannot but confeſſe it, why then you have faith; 'tis true, ſaith he, I go out of my ſelf, but it is I know not how, I am at this paſſe, if I periſh I periſh, here I ſtick, and here I wil adhere; but yet I fear I am not right; the Scripture ſaith true, faith doth thus and thus, and thus; but here I ſee ſuch a corruption ſo ſtrong, and ſuch a luſt ſo mighty; I ſay, true faith may be without ſenſe and feeling of it, there may be much feare and trembling in regard of aſſurance of ſalvation, though a man do truly and confidently caſt himſelf upon Chriſt; and I will prove this unto you by five Arguments.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94114:119"/>
lookes for; Now the object of a juſtifying faith is not the event, that it ſhall fall out thus with him, he commits this to God, he believes in the general that all that believe ſhall be ſaved; and that a reprobate may believe, but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that he ſhall be juſtified and ſaved, is the fruit of a juſtifying faith; when a man hath juſtifying faith, this is not the object of it, but he commits himſelf to Chriſt for juſtifycation and ſalvation, he truly believes the event ſhall be, that they which truly believe ſhall be juſtified and ſaved, and God will help their infimities, and pardon their weakneſſes; but now juſtifying faith apprehends not the event that comes afterwards, but faith commits it ſelf to Chriſt for the event, as I will ſhew you by a ſimilitude; a man reſolves to leane upon a ſtaffe, what is in this mans minde? is the object this, that he ſhall not ſlip nor fall? no, he findes by experience that he may fall for all his ſtaffe, but he caſts himſelf upon his ſtaffe, fall or not fall, and though he do fall, he will not fling away his ſtaffe; No, but he will look better to himſelfe afterwards, he knows the fault was not in his ſtaffe, but in his own managing of it, therefore he commits himſelf to his ſtaffe ſtill, and reſolves to leane up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; he is not ſure he ſhall not fall, but though he do fall, he will up again, and help himſelf with his ſtaffe in his going ſtill; he knows the ſtaffe is not in the fault, but himſelf; may be he doth not leane upon it, or he knows not the right way, but he is ſtill leaning upon his ſtaffe, and venturing upon his ſtaffe; ſo I ſay true ſaving faith doth not truly apprehend he is juſtified, as if a man could not be juſtified unleſſe he did believe it; this is the event, juſtifying faith is the committing himſelf to God for the event, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.23. <hi>By faith Abraham being called of God, went out of his owne Countrey, &amp;c.</hi> By faith he caſt himſelf upon God; did he believe now whether he ſhould go? He could not tell, he believed in the general, that God would not faile thoſe that truſted in him; but for his own particular he knew not whether he ſhould go, but he caſts himſelf upon God, whetherſoever God will have me to go, I will go; he commits himſelf to God at all adventures; this is true faith, and yet the event all this while may not be known, but a man may be much troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout aſſurance.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2. The event is conditional till a man believes.</note>Secondly, the event; that a man ſhall be juſtified, and ſanctified, and ſaved, is conditional until a man hath believed; Suppoſe a natural man, and yet an Elect man of God; what, muſt this man believe? muſt he beleeve that he ſhall be juſtified, and ſanctified, and ſaved? No, there is no ſuch thing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; take any natural man in the world, and look from the beginning of the Bible to the end, there is not one text that ſaith a natural man ſhall be ſaved; but juſtification and ſalvation are conditional till a man believes, but when a man hath beleeved, his juſtification, ſanctification, and ſalvation is certain; but he muſt beleeve before he can be ſaid to be juſtified; now, before a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves juſtification is upon condition, if a man beleeves he ſhall be juſtified and ſaved, ſo may <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Rom. 10.9. 'Tis true, this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if thou beleeve in the Son of God, if thou take up his croſſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, thou ſhalt be ſaved; this is but the condition, but when a man hath believed, he is juſtified, and ſhall be ſaved; it is abſolute now, but he believed firſt; therefore juſtifying faith doth not beleeve he ſhall be ſaved and juſtified, for he muſt have faith firſt; 'tis true, if a man have ſaving and juſtifying faith, there is the truth of the Word for it, that he ſhall be ſaved; therefore juſtifying faith muſt be the caſting off a mans ſelfe upon Chriſt for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        <hi>Argument,</hi> 3.</note>Thirdly, the event, that a man ſhall be juſtified, and ſanctified, and ſaved; this cannot be the thing, that a juſtifying faith in the act of juſtification muſt apprehend, becauſe then we could not ſay to every man, if thou beleeveſt thou ſhalt be ſaved, that muſt be the object of a juſtifying faith; that may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to any man, for elſe how ſhould we preach the Word? we ſhould expoſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94114:119"/>
our ſelves to cavils, and open the mouthes of blaſphemers, we muſt ſay then this is faith; you muſt believe you ſhall be ſaved, and that you are in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and then we could not bid every man believe if it were ſo; where the Goſpel comes we are to bid every man to believe, what, to believe that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be juſtified, and ſanctified, and ſaved? No, that were a lie, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands no man to believe a lie, but he commands every man to believe in Chriſt for juſtification, and for ſanctification, and for ſalvation; Now, there are two things that God requires of every man where the Goſpel comes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he requires that he beleeves the Word, which ſaith, <hi>that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in Chriſt ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he commands him to believe in Chriſt for ſalvation, and this is faith; the other comes in afterwards; I will make it plaine; the Lord ſaid to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz, Iſa.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Believe and thou ſhalt be eſtabliſhed,</hi> what muſt <hi>Ahaz</hi> here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? Doth God bid him believe that he ſhould be eſtabliſhed? No, for that was a lie, for when all came to all he was not eſtabliſhed; but he muſt beleeve God, and then he ſhould be eſtabliſhed; but he not believing in God, could not be eſtabliſhed; ſo God told <hi>Adam,</hi> if he believed, he ſhould live; did God now bid <hi>Adam</hi> beleeve he ſhould live for ever? No, for then it had been a lie; but be biddeth him believe, that if he obeyed his voice, he ſhould live for ever; he was not to believe that he ſhould live for ever; ſo God doth not command men to beleeve they ſhall he ſaved, but to believe in Chriſt for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the event is known another way,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent is known another way.</note> and not by a juſtifying faith; 'tis true, ſome men know the event that God intends to ſave them, and that they ſhall be glorified for evermore, but this is known by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing, and not by an act of faith; the act of faith is the committing of a mans ſelf to God for this thing. I will ſet it out by a ſimilitude, ſuppoſe I have a great buſineſſe to do at <hi>London,</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be put to death, and except I have a pardon got to morrow, I ſhall be executed; I cannot go my ſelf, for I am in hold; but I have a friend at <hi>London,</hi> and I truſt to him to go to the Court to procure me a pardon; in the mean time the buſineſſe goeth forward againſt me, and may be I am going to the place of execution; but ſtill I caſt my ſelf upon my friend that he will get me a pardon; now if my friend ſend me a letter, and ſend me a pardon under the Kings Seal, now I know I have a pardon, but my truſting my friend was nothing, but my caſting my ſelf upon him, and ſetling my ſelf upon him, I was confident in him; Now, when he ſends down a token, and a Seal under the Kings Majeſties hand, now I know the event, that I have gotten a pardon. So it is with a poore creature that is under condemnation, and the wrath of God is gone out againſt him, and the juſtice of God is threatned againſt him, which way ſoever he looks he can ſee nothing but hell and damnation, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath told him of a friend, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he can help him to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and he truſts to him, the Law may be proceeds againſt him, and fears, and terrours, and may be he is upon the ladder ready to be turned off; yet he hangs upon Chriſt, a pardon will come, he truſts upon Chriſt, he will not go to the world and to carnal company to pacifie his conſcience, a pardon will come, he caſts himſelf upon this; and yet he is not certaine it will come, he hath affiance in Chriſt that it will come; now, if it be ſo that whereas he believes in Chriſt for forgiveneſſe, ſo Chriſt ſends him a token, there is peace of conſcience for thee, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt for thee; and as he depends upon him for meanes and maintenance, ſo Chriſt ſaith, there is ſomething for thee to live upon, or patience to bear poverty; as he believes he ſhall be accepted of God, ſo here is a token, thy prayers are heard: Now he hath a token, now he may know it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.4. <hi>They truſted in God and they were delivered</hi>; that is, they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94114:120"/>
truſted in thee, and thou diddeſt ſend them a token; now they knew they were delivered; 'tis true, a man might know this though God ſhould ſend him no token, he might know that he is juſtified, and pardoned, and hath title to all the mercy in Chriſt; he might know it without this, but that for his own weakneſſe, and that by two things. Firſt, by looking into the Word, there he might find, that he which truſts in Chriſt, and commits himſelf to God, ſhall be ſaved; Another thing is, to reflect upon himſelf; there he ſhall find that he truly goeth out of himſelf, and caſts himſelf upon God; then here he may know it, he that believes in Chriſt ſhall be ſaved, but I find that I believe in Chriſt, therefore I ſhall be ſaved, but this is not the act of faith, but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 5 Not the truth, but ſtrength of faith aprehends the event.</note>Fifthly, it is not the truth of faith, but the ſtrength of faith that apprehends the event; let a man believe in Chriſt, and caſt himſelf upon him in all his ways, and follow him in all his Commandments, this is faith, be it never ſo weak, and this doth intitle to juſtification, and ſanctification, and ſalvation, though it be never ſo weak; yet while it is weak it cannot apprehend the event, it will be much afraid in regard of that; as ſuppoſe a man were learning to ſwimme, he beleeves that if he could but ſpread his armes and legges the water would beare him up; now when he begins to learne, he commits himſelf to the water, and ſpreads his armes and leggs, but this is with much feare and miſgiving, and he ſometimes ſets one leg on the ground, and he hath but little ſenſe and feeling of the waters bearing him, becauſe he commits not himſelf to the water; but the more and more he commits himſelf to the water, the more he finds the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bears him, and now he can fling away his bladders, and ſwimme over the river; he did believe before that the water would beare him, but when he did commit himſelf to the water he had a great deal of feare, and could not ſwim to any purpoſe, but when he had learned the art, then he committed himſelfe to the water, and then he could ſpread his armes, and leggs, and ſwimme; So when a man comes firſt to believe in Chriſt, he thinks I ſhould be the happieſt man in the world, I ſhould be in a better eſtate then Kings and Princes if I could believe; and withal it makes him to believe in Chriſt, and to deny himſelf, and caſt himſelf upon Chriſt, plucks up both his feet, and commits himſelf to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fling out himſelf upon Chriſt, ſink or ſwim; yet at the firſt this is very weak, and ſometimes he doth it, and ſometimes he doth it not; and ſometimes he is feelling for this, ſometimes for that; and ſomtimes he doth not pray well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and is not humble enough, this is nothing but truſting to himſelf; may be a pleaſure comes, he cannot deny it, he cannot commit himſelf to Chriſt, the weakneſs of this is the reaſon why he cannot apprehend the event, for a ſtrong confidence in Chriſt carries all along with it, it will reflect upon it ſelf, and gather all theſe things, and be aſſured he will not only have confidence in Chriſt, but alſo be confident for the having of thoſe good things he believes in him for.</p>

                  <p>The Apoſtle in this Chapter doth ſet out many commendations of faith to exhort the Hebrewes, and all Beleevers, and all perſons to the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, and to labour to have it grow in them, and to make much of it, as being a moſt excellent Grace of God; and he commends faith two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by the deſcription of it in the firſt verſe, <hi>Faith is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen</hi>; a Believer hopes for great matters, though he ſeeth not any of them; may be he is yet a poore miſerable contemptible creature in the eyes of the world, yet he hopes for great matters, he hopes for a glorious reſurrection, and for an excellent triumph over ſinne, and death, and hell; and to have his body and ſoul for ever in the Kingdome of Chriſt Jeſus; you will ſay he ſeeth none of theſe things, he hopes that God will bleſſe him in all his wayes, and be with him in ſickneſſe, and in health, in miſery and proſperity, and in all eſtates, and that he will do him good while he lives, and when he dyes he ſeeth none of theſe things? No, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of things not ſeen</hi>; though many think there is no ſubſtance in theſe things, yet faith doth deliver the ſubſtance of them unto him, and it is an evidence that he ſhall certainly have them, and it is as it were a Sacrament; therefore the Fathers call it the Sacrament of faith,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94114:121"/>
and the Sacrament of hopes, and the Sacrament of repentance, becauſe they are certaine and ſure tokens and pledges of thoſe things that a Chriſtian looks for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle commends faith by a long Catalogue of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, of Holy Fathers, and Patriarchs, and Prophets, and Judges, and Worthies from the beginning of the world, and he ſhewes there was no worth in them, but it did proceed from faith; and this he doth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, generally, in the ſecond verſe; <hi>By it the Elders obtained a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>; he ſpeaks of them all ingeneral, he calls them Elders, a reverend grave company, and he amplifies this by giving a general ground and reaſon why faith can build upon nothing as it were to ſee to, and yet is able to gather great matters, though it ſee little or nothing, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. You may ſee this (ſaith he) by Hiſtorical faith; <hi>For, through faith we underſtand that the worlds were made by the Word of God, ſo that things which are ſeen were not made of things which do appeare</hi>; though nothing was before a mans eyes, yet through this faith he might ſee an whole world out of nothing; ſo, though the world, and fleſh, and blood ſee nothing, yet he that believes in God he is able to raiſe a world out of nothing, he may look for theſe things at the hands of God, though for the preſent he ſees nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he doth divide theſe believers into foure ſeveral rankes.</p>

                  <p>In the fourth place, he reckons up all thoſe Heroes, from that time, to the time of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and Names <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Barach,</hi> and <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>Jephtah,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi>; and then he reckons them up only in generall, the Prophets, and Martyrs, and Confeſſors, under the perſecutions of curſed <hi>Antiochus.</hi> Now in all this Catalogue, he ſhewes the admirable effects of true juſtifying faith, what faith is able to do when a man is a true believer in God, what great matters he is able to archieve; it gives a man the teſtimony of a good conſcience, and makes him able to do the things acceptable to God; it makes a man believe things incredible to ſenſe and reaſon; it makes a man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all and follow God; it makes a man do or ſuffer any thing for Chriſt; it makes a man ſo precious, that the world is not worthy that he ſhould dwell among them, that there ſhould be any ſuch perſon in ſuch a baſe place as the world is; it is an excellent thing, and it is ſet out moſt admirably, what glorious things faith doth enable a man in the ſtrength of God to do; and his ſcope in all this is, to exhort them to abound in faith, and they that have it not, to uſe all meanes for the obtaining of it, and come by it, and lye at God, and to be trading in the meanes of Grace, and never be at quiet till they have it, and when they have it, to endeare it, and labour to abound in it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in it to their dying day; now among all this grave, and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and reverend ſociety of believers that he here reckons and ſummes

                        <hi>Doct.</hi> It is faith that makes a man obey the call of God.</note> that it is faith that makes a man obey the call of God, the command of God, whether it be the firſt call and command, for the coming out of ſinne, or all after commands whatſoever, it is faith that makes a man obey them; if a man have faith, though he had never ſo ſtubborne and perverſe an heart before, though he were never ſo ſet upon his luſts, and ſinfull courſes before, faith is that which will make a man lay it downe and diſavow it, and oppoſe himſelf againſt it, and he ſhall no longer live in it; as ſoone as ever faith comes into the ſoul it makes a man obey God, it brings a man home to God, to do his will and to walk according to his directions, and to be at his diſpoſe, and to commit, and commend, and reſigne himſelf wholly to God in all his wayes; this is the onely thing that heales a mans backſlidings, this is the onely thing that drawes a man home to God, this is the onely inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby a man is tyed to God himſelf, whereby a man doth fetch downe all the graces from above, ſo long as a man is ſtubborne and perverſe, and walks after the fleſh, and goeth on in any evil way; he hath no faith, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.32. <hi>For all this they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned yet ſtill, and believed not his wondrous works</hi>; that is, they were diſobedient, therefore certainly they had no faith, for if faith once looked into their hearts, it would have made them to diſcard their ſinnes, and it would have made them obedient to God, it would have pared them from the fleſh, and weaned them from their owne deſires, and would have made them to give up themſelves to God; therefore ſeeing they went on in their ſinnes, it is certaine, they did not believe, for faith only makes a man obey God, and whereſoever it is, a man obeyeth God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe faith ſeeth an indiſſolvable couple of attributes in God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1 Becauſe faith ſeeth Gods purity and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable attributes.</note> that cannot be ſeparated and ſevered; as it ſeeth his grace and mercy to draw him forward, ſo it ſeeth his purity, and juſtice, and holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, that it dares not but obey God, as it doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his grace and mercy to make him perfectly to truſt in God; ſo it ſeeth another thing in God, that God is of that nature that he muſt be ſerved, and worſhipped, and obeyed. Therefore you ſhall ſee <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> though the building of the Ark were an endleſſe work, and a coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and chargeable work in the eyes of men, it would coſt him many yeares to build, and he could not look after his calling, and after the world, but it would take him up for an hundred and twenty yeares, and ſet all the world a talking of him, and mocking at him for it; yet when God commanded him to do it, faith made him do it, and how did faith make him do it? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>By faith Noah being forewarned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved by feare, prepared an Ark</hi>; fear moved him, faith made him do it; but how did faith make him do it? It moved him with feare, and ſo made him do it; it made him ſee God was an holy and righteous God that would not be dallied withal, and this moved him with feare, and he durſt not but do it; whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94114:122"/>
it put him to, he durſt not omit it; faith makes a man that he dares not be bold with God, it takes away the impudency of the heart, and the venterouſneſſe of the ſoul; as long as a man doth not believe, he dares make bold with ſuch Commandements of God, as he likes not, he will omit them for all him; but when faith comes it reveales God to the ſoul, and ſhewes who he is, and what nature he is of, and that he is ſuch a one as will not be dallied with, but his Commandements muſt be done, and his will muſt be obeyed, or elſe woe to that man; it ſhewes to a man the infinite Majeſtie of God, and ſets it before a mans face, that he dares not go on in any thing contrary to Gods will, but obey God in whatſoever he commands him, and abſtaine from whatſoever God forbids, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We dare not make our ſelves of the number, or compare our ſelves with ſome that commend themſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.12. He knew God had forbidden it, and he durſt not but obey. So, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Dare any of you having a matter go to Law before unbeleevers?</hi> As who ſhould ſay, you are not beleevers if you do it; faith would ſhew you what God is, and what an inglorious, and what a bitter thing it is for you to do it, how dare you do it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Becauſe faith looks on Chriſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Saviour, but as a Lord.</note> Faith doth not onely look upon Chriſt as a Saviour, and a Redeemer, but alſo as a Lord and King, when Chriſt comes to a man, when faith comes into the ſoul: Chriſt is called our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as he is a Jeſus, ſo he is a Lord; and faith doth not only receive him as a Jeſus, but ſubmits to him as to a Sovereigne; Faith takes them both together, faith will not let a man live Lordleſſe, it knowes he muſt take Chriſt as a Lord as well as a Redeemer; as faith takes off the guilt of ſinne, ſo it puts the yoake of Chriſt on; <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 1.13. So I may ſay, <hi>is Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided?</hi> Can he be diſjoynted himſelfe from himſelfe? Can people mangle Chriſt in pieces, and divide him aſunder? May be thou wilt have him as a Jeſus, but thou wilt not have him as a Lord, then thou canſt not have him at all; as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>Be it known to all, that God hath made the ſame Jeſus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Chriſt</hi>; As he hath made him a Chriſt by anointing him to be a Saviour, to bring men from ſinne, and to bring them to Gods Kingdome, and ſave them from wrath; ſo he hath made him a Lord, he hath ſet him up as a King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Holy Hill of <hi>Zion</hi>; look as it was with <hi>Jephtah,</hi> when the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadites</hi> would have him to ſave them from the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> ſhall I be your head then, ſaith he? and he made them to ſweare before the Lord that they would make him their Head, or elſe he would not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; ſo if thou wilt have Chriſt to deliver thee out of the hands of thine enemies; ſinne is an enemy, and the Law is an enemy, and the Devill is an enemy, and the world, and thine own fleſh is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; if thou wilt have Chriſt to deliver thee from theſe enemies, ſhall he be thy Head? He hath ſworne an Oath, <hi>That we being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the hands of our enemies ſhould ſerve him in holineſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe all the dayes of our lives,</hi> Luke 1.73. He hath ſworne with an Oath, that that man whom he delivers from his enemies ſhall ſerve him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and ſhall not live as he lift, he ſhall not live Lawleſſe, he ſhall take Chriſts Lawes as well as his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; as well Chriſts Government as the imputation of his truth and righteouſneſſe, he ſhall take the one as well as the other; Now, it is an eaſie thing for a man to believe by a preſumptuous faith that Chriſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94114:122"/>
is a Jeſus, but here is the difficulty to take him as a Lord; <hi>No man can call Chriſt a Lord but by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. He doth not ſay no man can ſay Chriſt is a Jeſus, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and preſumption can make a man ſay ſo, and every man hopes, and beares himſelf upon this, that Chriſt is a Jeſus, but no man can truly confeſſe him to be a Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt; unleſſe the Holy Ghoſt enable him, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>David by the Spirit cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him Lord</hi>; he ſpeakes of himſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.43. It is a great matter to ſubmit to Chriſt as a Sovereigne, as well as to take Chriſt for a Saviour; now faith ſeeth both muſt be done, it muſt take Chriſt under both relations, as he muſt take him under the relation of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, ſo under the relation of a Lord as to be ſaved by him, ſo to be guided and ſwayed by him in all his wayes, and to be at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing in all his courſes; thus faith ſeeth Chriſt is propounded in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and thus Chriſt embraceth him, it cannot have him in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but it muſt alſo have him in the other, and ſo faith brings in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Becauſe faith gleweth the heart to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> Faith ſeeth another couple that cannot be diſjoynted and ſevered one from another, and that is this; as faith tyeth the heart to the promiſes, ſo it glueth the heart to the Commandements, theſe go together, and when faith reacheth forth the hand to the one, it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the hand to the other, they are tyed with bonds of adamant that cannot be ſevered, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 119.56. When faith will go to God in vertue of a promiſe to do this or that for him, he reacheth forth the hand to the Commandements too. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me</hi>; As who ſhould ſay, if you will look upon me as your God by faith, then look that you have no other gods but me, look that you honour me in all my wayes, and ſtoop to me, and obey my Word, as the Lord propounded the one, ſo he ſet before them the other, a man forgets that God is his God by faith, if he keeps not his Commandements, <hi>beware</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>leaſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Lord thy God in not keeping his Commandements</hi>; How can a man believe in God, when he forgets that which he ſhould believe? When a man forgets to be ſubject to God, and to give up himſelf in all his wayes? The Promiſes and Commandements are tyed together with bonds of adamant, and no man can pull them aſunder, as it is with ſinne and the threatnings, if a man go on in ſinne, he ſhall be ſure to have the threatnings light upon him, they are bound together by bonds of adamant and everlaſting coards; let a man do what he can, if he howle and roare to God to take away his plagues, to take away Hell fire and damnation; if he go on in ſinne, it will never be, they hang together in an everlaſting truth, <hi>The way of the wicked ſhall periſh</hi>; and if a man ſoweth iniquity he ſhall reap miſery, ſaith the Wiſeman, <hi>As a man ſoweth, ſo he ſhall reap, do not deceive your ſelves</hi>; We are marvelous apt to reaſon as <hi>Eve</hi> did, to put in perhaps, perhaps you ſhall dye; Nay, aſſuredly we ſhall dye if we go on in ſinne, and will not live that life which God hath ſet before us, the life of faith, the life of God, the life of Heaven, the life of true Holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; if we will not ſubmit to this, and give up our ſelves to be brought under it, we ſhall aſſuredly periſh, never did any man live and goe on in ſinne, but he dyed in perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Never any man lived a wicked and ungodly life, but had a wicked, wretched, and damned death; if a man do go on in ſinne he ſhall be ſure
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94114:123"/>
to have the threatnings of God light upon him, he cannot avoyde them; ſo it is on the other ſide, the Promiſes and the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments go together, and if a man do obſerve the Commandements of God by a true and lively faith, he ſhall aſſuredly have the promiſes; and if he reject the Commandements, or be unſound in the doing of them, he cannot have the Promiſes; if he have the one, he muſt have the other; he can never make a faithful Plea for Peace, for Pardon, for Heaven, or any thing that God hath promiſed, that bindes not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe over to God to do his will in every thing; Nay, the ſtrength of Faith puts forth it ſelfe in as ſtrong an act towards the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as towards the Promiſes, and if there be any difference, it is on the Promiſes ſide, for the Promiſes are more ſupernatural then the Commandements, for they were once written in the heart, therefore the Commandements are not ſo ſupernatural; a man was once acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them, but the Promiſes of Mercy, and Pardon, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption are more ſupernatural, and we ſee this in poore weak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers that go on and are enabled to make good conſcience of their wayes, and to be very carefull of ſinning againſt God, and walk in very good ſtrictneſſe, diligence, and circumſpection, and yet have much ado to apply the Promiſes, and appropriate them to themſelves. I ſay, broken-hearted people that are weak in faith, in regard of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall confidence, may yet notwithſtanding be very ſtrong in the doing of the Commandements of God; The reaſon is, becauſe obedience flows from a direct act of faith, and this bearing a man upon the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from a reflect act of faith, it flowes from a conſciouſneſſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; when a man is conſcious that he is ſincre; then, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can a man have confidence that the Promiſes are ſealed to him, this is a reflect act of faith; but it is a direct act that makes a man obey Gods Commandements, ſo that faith muſt needs work obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for if there be this bleſſed couple propounded to the ſoule in the Goſpel together with the Commandements, Faith looking on both takes one as well as the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4. Becauſe faith looks to a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for heaven as well as a title to heaven.</note>Fourthly, there is another cloſe couple that faith looks upon, and that is, as upon a Title to the Kingdome of Heaven, ſo alſo to a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the Kingdome of Heaven, and one is as needfull as the other, as things without which a man cannot enter into the Kingdome of God; Now, Faith as it helps a man to a title to Glory, ſo it helps a man more and more with fitneſſe, becauſe it ſeeth it cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; When <hi>David</hi> had committed his two fowle ſinnes of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and adultery, though he had not loſt his title to the Kingdome of Heaven, yet he could not enter into it, he could not have actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it; Why? Becauſe he was unfit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. Without holineſſe a man cannot ſee God, though a man hath all the titles in the world, though he be elected to it before all worlds, yet till he is made fit for it, he cannot enter into it, <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God</hi>; as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes, it is <hi>an inheritance holy and undefiled,</hi> and a man muſt be holy, before he can be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of it; <hi>Joſeph</hi> muſt ſhave himſelf before he come before <hi>Pharaoh. Ahaſuerus</hi> women muſt be prepared, and purified with ſpices and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and mirrhe, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 2.11. And then they came before the King, when they were prepared and adorned, and made ſweet and perfumed; So a man muſt firſt be prepared and fitted for the Kingdom of heaven, or elſe there is no admiſſion into it, heaven is too fine a place for adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94114:123"/>
and drunkards, &amp;c. As ſoone as ever the Angels of heaven, though glorious creatures, began to ſinne againſt God, God thruſt them out of heaven; they left their habitation, it was too fine for them: and do you think the Lord will admit the Devill into heaven againe in his members? what a thing is it when every drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, and profane perſon ſhall think himſelf meet company for the bleſſed trinity? it cannot be, God will never take ſuch foule loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome creatures into fellowſhip and Communion with him, they are too neare him already in the world, and therefore be will fling them out of his preſence into Hell; in Heaven is nothing but bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical viſion, viewing of God, and delighting in God, and not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thought but of God, and therefore no roome for thoſe that are empty of grace, and not fitted and prepared for it; now faith knowes this, and believes this, and therefore as it layeth hold on Chriſt for title, ſo it never leaves till it hath gotten fitneſſe from Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father who hath made us meet, &amp;c.</hi> God makes all meet for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that he brings thither, and till they are ſo they cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thither; if a man will go to heaven he muſt be <hi>a veſſel of honour,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.21. Therefore <hi>Faith purifies a mans heart,</hi> pares off a mans fleſh, weanes a man from the world, and knocks off a mans curſed corruptions more and more, and pulls downe a man before God, makes a man ſtoop to Gods Covenant, and to be holy and righteous as he is; it knows, unleſſe he be made fit for Gods Kingdome, he can never come there; we ſhould look to this, and it ſhould make us feare, and tremble, and look to our ſelves, for unleſſe we be fit for the Kingdome of Heaven we ſhall never have abode there, <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Except a man be borne againe, &amp;c.</hi> That is, except a man be made meet for the Kingdome of God he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come into it, Except he have Heavens frame and diſpoſition, and Heavens converſation, except his converſation be in Heaven here, he can never come there; and this is the reaſon we are ſo often called upon to be godly in Chriſt Jeſus, to walk in pureneſſe and holineſſe of living, becauſe <hi>no uncleane thing ſhall enter into the heavenly Jeruſalem</hi>; without are Dogges, the Lord counts them Doggs that ſhall never enjoy his preſence; this is another reaſon why Faith workes obedience, becauſe if he will have Title to the Kingdome of Heaven, he muſt look to be fitted for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, becauſe Faith is eminently all that a man is to do,<note place="margin">5. Becauſe faith is eminently all that a man is to do.</note> it is the whole work of a Chriſtian, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. <hi>This is the work of God, &amp;c.</hi> That is, this is eminently all the workes of God. But is there no work but this? Yes, there are many other works, but this is the work of God that ye believe, becauſe this is eminently all that God looks for, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.22. <hi>This is his Commandement, that ye believe, &amp;c.</hi> Is there no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement but this? is this all we muſt do, and no more?

over vaine company; and delight in all goodneſſe, make thee zealous and fervent, and teach thee how to pray and be thankfull to God; it will fill thy mouth with laughter, and thy tongue with joy, it will make thee do any thing if thou believe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. As who ſhould ſay, believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and this will make thee do all, there will be nothing left, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If thou believe, all things are poſſible</hi>; So I may ſay, if thou believe all things will be done, and thou wilt ſtick at nothing, be backward in nothing, but wilt be brought to obey God in every thing; it is like the turning of the Cock, if the Cock be turned, the water will flow forth; ſo if a mans heart be opened by faith, all the heart runnes to God; a Wind-mill, if the Sailes go, the ſtones and all go; ſo if faith be once working and operating, all the ſoul is turning it ſelf towards God, though never ſo Heavy, and Carnal, and Vaine, and Earthly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet now all is going in the wayes of God; As the Mother of Chriſt ſaid to the ſervants of the marriage, <hi>Whatſoever he bids you do,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 2.</note> 
                     <hi>do it</hi>; So faith ſaith thus to all the ſoul, look whatſoever Chriſt commands, look you do it, minde thoſe things he bids you minde, affect that he affects, retaine that he bids you remember; it is like <hi>Abner,</hi> that brought all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be the ſervants of <hi>David</hi>; ſo faith when it comes into the ſoul, it brings all the faculties of the ſoul of the whole man to be ſubject to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; thus you ſee that faith works obedience in a man.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Uſe is this, to anſwer a demand that will ariſe out of the hearts of people, when they heare that Faith makes a man to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How doth it make a man obey?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, by ſetting before a man the corruptions of his owne heart, and what woeful ſtubborneneſſe is in the ſame; it makes a man ſee thoſe innumerable corruptions in the ſoul, and how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have eaten into the ſoul; it makes a man ſee what a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome creature he is, and what a deal of rebellion there is in his will, and minde, and thoughts, and affections, and what oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there are againſt the doing of Gods Holy Will; he ſeeth that if he will obey God what little help he ſhall have from himſelf, from his own will, his own reaſon, his own parts, his own nature, though he had never ſo good a nature; Nay, how he ſhall be hindered, and hampered, and oppoſed by himſelf; faith lets him ſee this, and ſo pulls him down before God, to abhor himſelf in duſt and aſhes; it was thus in <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.24. <hi>O miſerable man, &amp;c.</hi> It made him finde this, that he could not do the good he would; thus faith empties a man of himſelf, and makes him to renounce himſelf; and makes him not to ſtand upon his own feeet, never to ſtand alone, never to go about any thing but with the help of Chriſt; it makes a man ſee what a damned will he hath, what a damned reaſon he hath, what a damned heart and diſpoſition he hath: O! ſaith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here is Wiſdome indeed, here is a diſpoſition indeed, I will never be ruled by this diſpoſition, and he looks upon himſelf as an undone creature if he followes his own deſires; here be deſires indeed, and thoughts indeed, and here is an horrible frame, and this makes him renounce himſelf: and thus faith works obedience in a man, by driving of him out of himſelf, and dividing a mans ſelf from himſelf, that he will not be led by his own thoughts, nor carried by his owne imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

it ſeeth Hell in all theſe, and that he can do nothing without Chriſt live in his heart by faith; without faith you can do nothing, ſaith Chriſt, and faith tells a man this; it makes him know what a wretched creature he is, and what a damned nature he carries about with him, and that he muſt not follow, and pleaſe, and give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to that at any time. Now, a natural man may ſee his inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of himſelf, and the vileneſſe of his nature, but conſcience only ſhewes him this; but becauſe he hath not faith, it doth not humble him, and put him down, but he will follow his own thoughts, and go after his own reaſon for all this, he hath not true and ſaving faith, to reveal theſe things in power to him, but when faith comes into the ſoul, it doth it to the purpoſe; it makes a man not to be a little affected with his ſinnes, but ſoundly affected, and makes him ſee that he is undone for ever if he go on in that courſe he was wont to do; and thus faith working in this faſhion delivers a man over to Chriſt, by taking a man off from that which was his Pilate and guide before, and making him to be guided by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Faith works obedience by carrying a man to God,<note place="margin">2. By carrying a man to God.</note> it makes a man ſeek to God how to obey; <hi>Teach me O Lord to do thy will,</hi> Pſal. 143.10. Faith carried him to God; ſo faith doth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is, it brings a man to God, that God would be pleaſed to ſtrengthen our apprehenſion, that ſo we may look upon his will, and to fortifie our underſtandings that we may conceive of all his wayes, with a Divine and heavenly underſtanding, and to fortifie our wills, that the feebleneſſe of them towards God may be removed, it crieth to God from day to day, that he may not do as he hath done, nor live as he hath done; faith whereſoever it is, drives the ſoul to God, and to lie at him from day to day, to guide him, and teach him, and inſtruct him, and ſhew him his wayes, and reveal unto him his Statutes; as <hi>David,</hi> Pſalme 119.35, 36 <hi>Incline my heart to thy Teſtimonies, and not to Covetouſneſſe</hi>; As who ſhould ſay, Lord, here is my heart, will, and whole man, I beſeech thee make me walk in thy wayes, I am very loath and untoward, I beſeech thee put ſome ſtrength into this will of mine; when I go to thy Word, let me heare it with trembling; when I go to prayer, let me go to it with an heavenly minde; encline my heart this way, and make it ſtand bent this way; 'tis true, when naturall men are convinced that all ſtrength is from God, they pray too, but this is not faith in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but faith makes the ſoul that it cannot be quiet, but it muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and ſtoop to him in all his wayes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Faith works obedience by making a man improve all the abilities that God hath given him already,<note place="margin">3. By making a man improve all his abilities.</note> and this is the beſt way to encreaſe them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.12. When a man hath grace, hath a Talent, and makes uſe of it, and hath it to ſome purpoſe, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it forth, that man ſhall encreaſe his Talent and abound, God will give him more; now as faith works obedience by ſhewing a man his own wretchedneſſe, that he muſt not yield to his own deſires, and be carried by his own vaine imaginations, that for his part would conclude ſuch a courſe is lawful; and why not? Though God ſaith the contrary, faith makes him conſider that, and ſo drives him to God, and ſo alſo it makes him go and improve thoſe gifts, and parts, and ſtrength that God hath given him already, that he may lay it forth,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94114:125"/>
and uſe it to the uttermoſt, as if a man be haunted and baited by any luſt, deadneſſe, ſecurity, coldneſſe in duty, or ſome other luſt; Now, Faith when it would make a man obedient to God, to cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie theſe luſts, it makes a man look out to ſee what power Gud hath given him, what abilities God hath lent, what helps and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances God hath reached out unto him, and he takes all to fight againſt that luſt; hath he underſtanding? that he employes to think of the evill of the ſinne, to conſider of the danger of the ſinne, how he may avoyde it, and what courſe he may take to overcome it; if God hath given him a memory, he layeth it forth to remember and recollect ſuch things as he hath heard, and hath been told of, he layeth all his Talents forth that ever he can to maſter that luſt, and ſo works obedience; as faith drives a man to God for help, ſo look what help God lends, and what Talent God puts into his hand, he layeth all forth for the working of obedience, he will not let any one lye idle, but will employ all to help him forward in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Faith doth work obedience, by making a man to relie upon Chriſt,<note place="margin">4. By making a man relie on Chriſt.</note> it doth look unto an union with Chriſt, it doth make a man to caſt himſelfe upon Chriſt for power againſt his ſinnes, it doth extract vigour from Chriſt againſt corruption, it doth diſtill and draw down graces from him, faith is the pipe whereby grace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from Chriſt to the ſoul, and faith opens the paſſages of this pipe that it may deſcend down to the heart from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; faith is a marvelous excellent thing, it doth extract efficacy, and validity, and power, from the life and death of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the crucifying of the fleſh, for the mortifying of the deeds of the body; and thus, it changeth the heart, and brings wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to every duty by doing thus. I ſay, faith goeth to Chriſt, and caſts it ſelf upon him for all things it wants, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all good courſes and wayes; Thus <hi>David</hi> got power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his carnal feare, when he was afraid of <hi>Saul</hi> on one ſide, and the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> on the other ſide; how doth he fence himſelf againſt this, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 56.4. <hi>I put my truſt in God, and therefore need not feare what man can do unto me</hi>; and ſo faith was able to root out his feares; So it was with the remnant of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Zeph. 3.13. <hi>They ſhall do no iniquity</hi>; you will ſay, how can that be? Can fleſh and blood do that? As long as a man is fleſh and blood he will be doing ſome iniquity or other; how ſhall a man be able to do no iniquity, and let no iniquity have dominion over him? it goeth before in the twelfe <hi>verſe, They truſt in God, They truſt in God, and ſo ſhall do no iniquity</hi>; When a man doth truſt in God, and hath faith to relie upon him, and diſtill down power and ſtrength from Chriſt, this will help him to do no iniquity, and help him to oppoſe himſelf againſt all his corruptions, and fight againſt the ſtrength of all his luſts, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.13. <hi>let us therefore caſt off the workes of darkneſſe.</hi> You will ſay this is very ſtrange, are we able to do this? can we tame our own hearts, or change our own minds? are we able to purge out theſe corruptions? is this poſſible? how ſhall a man do this? Why? <hi>put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (in the next words) go to him by a true and lively faith, and then you may be ſtrong in Chriſt, and able to do every good Duty, and ſubdue every ſinne, receiving ſtrength from Chriſt; when a man is to go through thornes and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, a man is not able to go through; but if he put on his Bootes
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94114:125"/>
and his Gloves, &amp;c. he may; ſo when a man goes on in his owne wayes he cannot avoide ſinne, pride, and covetouſneſſe, and vanity, how ſhall he avoide theſe things? 'tis true, he cannot avoide them if he go naked, but if he put on Chriſt he may; it is a ſimilitude taken from a garment, and that in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it muſt be fitted, and then it muſt be put on; ſo Chriſt firſt takes meaſure of all the infirmities, and frailties of his people, and communicates to them a ſutable grace; are they troubled with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, then he meaſures out patience to beare them? are they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, then he makes them able to ſtand for his Name? are they to pray, to deny themſelves, to fight againſt Satan, he meaſures them out a ſutable proportion of his grace and Spirit to him? and now when a man hath his Gloves, and all proviſion on, he may go about hedging, or ditching, or any buſineſſe; ſo when a man hath put on Chriſt, and is armed with grace and ſtrength from him, what is it but a man may do? In that very moment wherein a man caſts himſelf upon God in Chriſt, and doth lay hold upon Chriſt by a true and lively faith, this grace is made over to him the ſame moment, may be the grace of victory he muſt ſtay for a while, but there comes a grace of ſincerity from God that very moment that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in Chriſt, though may be there comes not that power from Chriſt he would have, yet that power, that he ſhall be ſincere, and will never let corruption make him a ſlave; he ſhall never walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, never be ſtubborne and worldly, never do as the wicked do, never depart from God as unbelievers uſe to do; he ſhall depend upon God, and waite upon him, and adhere, and cleave unto him, and continue a faithfull Souldier to Chriſt, fighting againſt ſinne and corruption to the death; a man ſhall have power from Chriſt to do this, if he have a true and a lively faith, <hi>By faith,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 11.5 <hi>Enoch walked with God</hi>; how is it poſſible? could he walk with God? what a ſtrange kinde of life is this? How averſe is the heart of man from it? People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide ſuch ſtrictneſſe to have commerce, and ſociety, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, to keep cloſe to God, and not go away from him, how could he do this? Why? <hi>By faith he walketh with God</hi>: So <hi>Abraham,</hi> God bade him leave his Countrey and all he had; you muſt think a thouſand things were objected to him; you muſt think he had abundance of reaſonings to and fro in his minde; I am in yeares, un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t for travell, and I ſhall now travell God knowes whither; and I am now where I was bred and brought up, and I have bear meanes, and maintenance, and friends, and know how to live; and for me to go into a ſtrange Countrey where I know no body, and I know not what may become of me; and for me to leave certainties for uncertainties, all the world will count me a foole; how did he do this? <hi>By faith he obeyed,</hi> ſaith the text, &amp;c. Faith helped him with power to look up unto God, and caſt himſelfe upon God, that helped him againſt all difficulties, that help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him againſt all the backwardneſſe and dulneſſe of his nature; he committed himſelf to God, and would do it, he packt up himſelf, never once ſtanding upon the matter, but away be goeth; <hi>By faith he obeyed, &amp;c.</hi> So, <hi>By faith Abel offered up a more acceptable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice then Cain,</hi> Hebrewes 11.4. How is that poſſible? Was he not made of the ſame mettall <hi>Cain</hi> was? was he not borne out of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94114:126"/>
ſame womb, digged out of the ſame pit? As apt and prone to ſerve God after an earthly manner as <hi>Cain</hi>? How was he able to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up a more acceptable ſacrifice? He had no better ſheep then <hi>Cain.</hi> Why? it was done by faith, he had faith in God, he renounced himſelf, and was divided from himſelfe; he was united to God by faith, and reſolved to hang upon him, and ſo leaned upon him for every thing he had promiſed, and ſo got acceptance with God. So <hi>Rahab, by faith entertained the ſpies,</hi> Hebrewes 11.31. It was a hard, piece of ſervice, a marvelous difficult piece of buſineſſe; you muſt think ſhe thus reaſoned with her ſelfe, ſhall I entertaine Traytors? Shall I betray my owne Countrey? The Town will ſee it, it will come to the Kings eare, and I ſhall become a Traytor to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and Prince, and a thouſand to one but I ſhall loſe my life if I ſuffer them to be here; but how did ſhe overcome this? <hi>By faith, by faith ſhe entertained the ſpies,</hi> for all it was ſo hard, for all death was at the doore, yet by faith ſhe was able to do it; What ſhall we ſay to <hi>Gideon, Baruch, &amp;c. Who by faith ſubdued Kingdomes, &amp;c.</hi> Hebrewes 11.37? <hi>Out of weak they were made ſtrong</hi>; How, did they work righteouſneſſe? They were as weak as others, but faith made them of weak, ſtrong, faith ſtrengthened their wills to that which was good; faith corroborated their reſolutions and purpoſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the pleaſing of God; and reſiſting corruptions faith made them ſtrongly reſolve that they would not be led by their owne wills, they believed in God, and ſo were able to do it. What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Hebrewes 11.24? This is a wonderful thing, that he ſhould refuſe to be called the ſonne of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> daughter; a meane man born, and yet refuſe to be called King <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Grand-childe! who would refuſe ſuch excellent hopes of honours and preferments? may be he might be King afterwards? Nay, when he was come to yeares to do it; if he had refuſed it when he was a childe, before he had come to yeares it had been no ſuch wonder, it might have been attributed to his childiſhneſſe; Nay, but he was come to yeares, and was a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and underſtanding man; what man would have done this? Indeed rare are ſuch perſons that are able to renounce themſelves in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, but you ſee what faith can do.</p>

                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> How doth faith fetch power from Chriſt</note>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Thus you ſee how faith doth work obedience, and now if you would know how faith doth fetch power from Chriſt to do theſe things.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, it is by two wayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As an inſtrument.</note>Firſt, Faith is an inſtrument whereby God doth by the acting and placing of it aright upon him, let out that power which is in Chriſt to a poore ſoul; that that power which is in Chriſt is to him, and that goodneſſe which is in Chriſt is to him, that he ſhall have grace for grace, an anſwerable grace, for every grace in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. <hi>The exceeding greatneſſe of his power, to us-ward that believe</hi>; When we believe the exceeding greatneſſe of his power is to us-ward, it is not only a power in God, but it is for us, and we may take that power and fetch it from God, and obtaine of him to put it forth. You know that Chriſt hath promiſed to take away the ſtony heart, &amp;c. He hath made ſuch promiſes as theſe, to pull down ſtrong holds, to overcome Satan and all the enemies of our ſoules, to poure out his Spirit upon his people, as water upon the thirſty ground; now as ſoone as ever faith comes into the ſoul it goeth to theſe promiſes, and takes hold of them, Lord here is ſuch a promiſe, Lord make me a new heart, make
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94114:126"/>
me obey this Commandment, and overcome ſuch a ſin, and all the power that is in God, it is to him-ward.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. In a moral way.</note> Faith doth fetch down power from Heaven in a moral man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by conſidering the exceeding greatneſſe of the recompence of reward, as its ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Hebrewes 1.25. I ſay, faith looks unto Chriſt, looks unto the favour of God, unto the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and Title to Gods Kingdome, it looks unto eternal life, unto thoſe admirable joyes that are at Gods right hand for evermore, which are promiſed to them that believe; it ſeeth theſe things, and this makes him able to deny any thing, to overcome any thing, to go about any thing; ſhall I have Heaven, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, a Kingdome; ſhall I be happy for ever? Shall I have all theſe things if I will pray and heare the Word? Obey God, and give over vaine company, and joyne to Gods people, and hate all manner of evil, if I will labour to croſſe my own thoughts and deſires and approve my ſelfe to God in all my wayes, ſhall I have all theſe things? this makes him able to do it; he looks to this, and ſo goeth about it, and when the fleſh ſhall object hardneſſe, and difficulty, and oppoſition, and loſſe of comfort, and loſſe of carnal eaſe and delight; faith goeth and ſets theſe admirable things againſt them, it ſets Heaven; and the Kingdome of Heaven, and Chriſt, and the joyes of Gods right hand againſt them, and this makes him do it; it ſets the will of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt his will, the favour of God againſt the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of men, the joyes of Heaven againſt carnal joyes, eternal happineſſe for evermore againſt the ſufferings here for a moment, weighs one in one ſcale and the other in the other, and ſo works with them.</p>
                  <p>Here we may ſee what little faith there is among people,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. See what little faith is in the world.</note> certainly there is but little faith, becauſe if there were much faith, there would be much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience given to God; we ſhould have admirable Townes, gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; we ſhould have never a drunkard, never a prophane perſon, but all Saints, and holy men, and women, every one would be thinking of God and his wayes, and heavenly minded; if there were much faith, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would have their lives changed, and their converſations altered; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>When the Sonne of man comes, ſhall he finde faith upon the Earth?</hi> So may I ſay, if the Sonne of man ſhould now come among us, ſhould he find faith among us? He ſhould find it very rare; for this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, there are not very many that profeſſe faith; drunkards, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt company of prophane perſons are ſuch as have not the face of holineſſe and faith; and amongſt this little number that profeſſe it, how few are there that have true faith indeed? You ſee none have true faith but thoſe that are obedient unto God; true faith doth bend the ſoul to God, it makes the ſoul ſpiritual, and holy, and humble, and cleane another man from that he was before, that he ſhall be reſigned over to God, to live at his diſpoſe; this is true faith, therefore faith is hardly to be found upon earth; it is a pitiful thing to ſee how little Gods will is regarded up and down; and though God be our Maker, and his hands have formed us, though we profeſſe we are his people whom he hath redeemed, though we know he hath ſent Chriſt into the world, and the blood of his own Sonne is cried up and down in the ſtreets, and calls upon men to believe, and take hold on it; though we do know theſe things, yet for all this equity of obedience to God, and notwithſtanding the neceſſity of obedience, how do people ſleight the will of God? it is his will we ſhould be fruitful under the meanes, heavenly in holy duties, fervent in calling upon his Name, that we ſhould have the true feare of his Name before our eyes; it is his will that we ſhould ſerve him in ſincerity all the dayes of our lives, that we ſhould ſtand for him, and glorifie him before men; that we ſhould walk with God and be ſtrangers upon earth, and wean our ſelves from the world, and be taken up
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94114:127"/>
with him, more then with any thing in this life, that we ſhould count no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deare for him, and deny our ſelves in every thing, it is his will for us to do theſe things, but who looks after theſe things? As if we were poſſeſſed with a legion of Devils, we go ſlighting, and contemning, and breaking all bonds of equity, and neceſſity of obedience, and Gods will is not obeyed, his worſhip is not promoted, his name is not feared, few give their minds to do theſe things; if God had not thrown millions of devils into hell for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt him; if God had not revealed his wrath againſt ſinne and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and all unrighteouſneſſe; if God had not ſhowen how jealous he ſtands upon keeping his Lawes, and obſerving his Commandments, and his holy and heavenly Word; if God had not revealed himſelf unto us, it had been another matter, but he hath revealed theſe things, yet how ſecure are we? He hath made it appear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh ſhall be upon every ſoul that doth evil, and curſed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this Covenant,</hi> Jer. 11.63. <hi>And he will come in flaming fire to render vengeance upon all that obey not the truth,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.8. Theſe things are ſpoken and delivered, and we know theſe things, and confeſſe them; yet God is not reſpected for all this; Nay, ſuch is the impudency of men, that they will acknowledge that God ought to be obeyed, and ſerved, and it is good to ſerve him, and it is a dangerous thing not to ſerve him, and yet for all this they will not do it, as if it were nothing to be damned, and as if they would try whether they can bear hell; nay, ſuch is the impudency of mens faces, that notwithſtanding they have heard they are unconverted, and their hearts are not ſubject to God, yet they hope they have true faith in God, and their ſins are infirmities, whereas you ſee it cannot be true faith unleſſe it make a man to be obedient to God in all his wayes, and binde a man in a perpetual bond to God for ever, never to depart from him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. For exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</note> it may be an Uſe of examination, to ſee whether we obey God or no, for if our faith be the faith we hope it is, it will make us obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Evidences of true obedience. 1. Willing and hearty.</note> then true obedience is a willing, affectionate, hearty obedience, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.1 <hi>My ſon, let thy heart keep my Commandments</hi>; the Lrod will have ſuch obedience as proceeds from the bottome of the heart, not when a mans heart is dull, and dead, and hangs off; but when the heart poures forth it ſelf in his wayes, and performing his gracious pleaſures from day to day; this the Lord requires, that it be done with the affection of the heart, as well as the thing be done, in the thing done, &amp; the wicked may go as far; nay, further then the ſincere, they may multiply duties as well as the other for the things done; but here is the thing, a wicked man doth duties heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, unaffectionately; but a child of God doth them ſincerely, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and lets out his heart and affections upon them all; <hi>God loves a chearful giver,</hi> 2 Cor 9.10. He loves a giver that gives with all his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo he loves a chearful comer to Church, that is glad to hear a Sermon, and his heart leapes to hear the Word of God, and he is affected with it, he loves a chearful praying, one that in prayer poures out his ſoul before him; he loves a chearful comer to the Sacrament, that delights to ſhew forth the Lords death till he comes; God doth not love a man unleſſe he doth this with all his affections; as it is ſaid, it is good to be zealous in a good matter, the worſhip and Commandments of God are good matters; now, it is good to be zealous in theſe matters; nay, to have the creame, and flower, and chief of our affections ſet upon theſe things; we are acquainted with the wayes, and hiſtories of grace, and we can ſpeak thereof, but it doth not ſink down into our hearts, it doth not warme us, nor put any heat into our ſouls, we are not quickened and moved by theſe things; we know Gods at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, his power, and wiſdome, and mercy, and juſtice, &amp;c. But none
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94114:127"/>
ſink down into our hearts, they affect us not as they ought to do, where are our affections in prayer? We pray, and come to Church, and to the Lords Table, but where are our affections in all theſe things? The Lord cares not for theſe ſervices, that have not affections to ſpice them and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them, and beautifie them; the Lord loves when a man ſerves him with all his heart; when the will hangs off, it is baſe ſervice, and the Lord regards it not; as the Lord loves that we that are Miniſters ſhould preach <hi>with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy minde,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.2. That we ſhould preach with gracious affections, and be affected in the Pulpit, and deſire from the bottome of our ſouls to do good to the people, and yearne over the people; the Lord loves theſe things when we do them willingly and heartily; ſo he delights in people when they heare and call upon his Name with affection; when we go about Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments as a Bear to the ſtake, God abhors it; may be God commands a man to do ſuch a thing, he doth it, but it is hard ſaith he; when money is to be fetched out of his purſe for good duties, it is hard ſaith he; and when he muſt go againſt the wicked, and pull the ill will of the Countrey upon him, may be he doth it, but it is hard; the Lord diſtaſts this, the Lord loves a chearful giver, and a chearful worker, a chearful Miniſter, and chearfull people; now if faith comes into the ſoul, it will not only work obedience, but chearful obedience, and from the bottome of the heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, true obedience makes a man reſigne himſelf to God,<note place="margin">2. Works reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God.</note> it makes a man to be altogether at Gods diſpoſe; <hi>I am thine,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> he looked upon himſelf as if he were altogether at Gods diſpoſe, as if he were his, and not his own; <hi>You are not your own,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>you are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 2 6. So that is true obedience, when a man gives up himſelf to God; many will do things that God commands, but they know not how to do them with reſignation, to be altogether at Gods diſpoſe; they love to be called Gods ſervants, but they will be only retainers; as many will get to be ſervants to ſome Gentleman, but it is only for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to ſave their purſes, to have the Gentlemans countenance, theſe will not dwell with the Gentleman, but in their own houſes, and when he hath ſome great ſtrangers at a Feaſt, or when he rides abroad in ſtate, then they will attend upon him, but yet they will live at home, and be their own men; ſo moſt people are but the Lords retainers, this is no obedience at all, it is none of faiths obedience.</p>

                     <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy ſoul, and all thy ſtrengh; Praiſe the Lord O my ſoul, and all that is within me praiſe his Holy Name,</hi> Pſal. 103.

Though it was a rich office, he was a Knight by his place, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks, it was worth five hundred pounds a yeare of our money; yet as ſoone as ever Chriſt called him, he left his place and went after Chriſt; ſo when a man will part with purſe and friends, and all he hath, and fling all at Gods foot, and give up all to him, this is true obedience; now if we have not this, we have not faithful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Diviſion of the Text.</note> What a jolly man he thought himſelf to be whilſt he was a Phariſee, before the Lord wrought upon him by the Law: <hi>Secondly,</hi> What a miſerable wretched creature he ſaw himſelf to be when the Lord took him in hand, and diſcovered his ſins unto him: before the Law came home unto him, and convinced his Conſcience, he thought himſelf to be <hi>alive; but when the Commandment came, Sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and he died.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In the former we may obſerve Two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The jollineſs of the Apoſtle, he thought himſelf to be alive; I was alive without the Law, I was a Phariſee, and thought my ſelf to be alive; I faſted twice a week, and prayed every day, and made long Prayers each day: when he conſidered how he walked thus in all the Ordinances of God, he thought, if this was not to be alive, he knew not what it was to be alive; <hi>I was alive once without the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We have here the cauſe why he had this good conceit of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it was becauſe he was without the Law, the law of God had not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, it had not diſcovered his miſerable and wretched eſtate unto him;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94114:129"/>
though he had ſome underſtanding in the literal ſenſe of the Law, yet the Law was not yet come home unto him, he was as yet without the Law, and that was the reaſon of that good conceit he had of himſelf, <hi>he did eſteem himſelf to be alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then again in the latter part; <hi>When the Commandment came, Sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, but I died.</hi> There we may alſo obſerve Two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Law ſhewed him what a wretched eſtate and condition he was in, for all his ſelf-conceitedneſſe, <hi>ſin revived, and I died</hi>: Though I thought before <hi>I was alive, yet when the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I died</hi>: I ſaw I was a dead man, when the Lord took me in hand to deal with me, and let me ſee how my caſe ſtood before him. Howſoever I thought my ſelf to be in a good caſe before, now I ſaw I was but a dead man; I did not ſee ſuch evil, and ſuch a maſſe of corruption before; but when the Lord diſcovered my ſelf unto my ſelf, and when I ſaw the Spiritualneſſe of the Law, then I ſaw that ſin was alive in me, and I died; when I ſaw how I ought to behave my ſelf in my affections, and in my inward man, then ſin revived, and I for my part was a dead man, I was fain to come down from thoſe high conceits, and imaginations I had before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We have here the Cauſe why he was thus brought down, it was becauſe of the Commandment of God which came home unto him, the Law of God came home unto his Conſcience, and diſcovered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, how it was with him, and it made him to ſhake in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his own eſtate, that he was but a dead man, and that he had gone to Hell, and periſhed everlaſtingly, if he had continued in that eſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>I intend at this time to treat of the former part, <hi>Without the Law I was once alive</hi>: And here Two things muſt be opened: Firſt, what doth the Apoſtle mean, by <hi>without the Law.</hi> Secondly, What doth he mean when he ſaith, <hi>I was once alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Firſt, When the Apoſtle ſaith, he <hi>was without the Law,</hi> he doth not mean ſimply, that he did think himſelf without the Law, that is, without the binding Authority of the Law, for ſo no reaſonuble creature is, yea, indeed no creature at all is without the Law of God, for there is a Law of Obedience impoſed upon all the Creatures, and the unreaſonable Creatures do keep the Law that is impoſed upon them by God; and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reaſonable Creatures depart from this Law and break it, yet they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the binding power of this Law; therefore the Apoſtle doth not thus mean that he was without the Law, therefore we muſt know, that to be without the Law is taken Four wayes:</p>
               <p>Firſt, To be without the Law, is meant, to be without the promulgation and publiſhing of the Law, and ſo the Heathen only are ſaid to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law, as we may ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. there the Heathen are ſaid to be <hi>without the Law</hi>: that is, without the promulgation of the Law, it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed only to the Jewes upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> was not without the Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is taken in regard of the literal knowledge of the Law, and ſo ignorant people are ſaid to be without the Law of God; they know not the Law of God; and in this ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> was not without the Law, he was trained up in the Law, he was learned in the Law, for he was <hi>brought up at the feet of Gamaliel,</hi> Acts 22.3. ſo that he had the logical meaning of the Law, and was able to ſpeak of the points of Religion, better then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand millions of carnal men, he had the literal knowledge of the Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is taken in regard of the moral Obedience to the Law, and ſo wicked men are ſaid to be <hi>without the Law,</hi> as we may ſee, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94114:129"/>
                  <hi>The Law is not given to a Righteous man, but to the Lawleſs and Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>; wicked men are lawleſs, they live as if there were no Law, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards and Prophane perſons, as they are ſaid to live without God in the world, ſo they are ſaid to live without the Law, as if there were no Law to bind them; they are people that are not to be held within any compaſs, they take notice of no command to rule in their hearts, and rectifie their lives; and in this ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> was not without the Law neither, for he lived after the moſt ſtrict and exact Sect of the Phariſees, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4, 5. <hi>If any man think he hath whereof he may truſt in the fleſh, I much more, circumciſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of Iſrael, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, as touching the Law a Phariſee</hi>; He was one that faſted and curbed himſelf, yea, he kept two Faſts a week, (as thoſe Phariſees did, that were of the better rank) he Prayed daily, and performed the duties of Religion, and there was no outward Ordinance of the Law which he performed not; he was one that was conformable to the letter of the Law, according as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Law, he was Morally Obedient to the Law; he was no extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, nor unjuſt perſon; no, he did the works of the Law, and thoſe things contained in the Law; nay, there was no body that could challenge him with any blame; none that were familiar with him, could ſay any thing to tax him withal, when he was in his ignorance, and blindneſs; therefore in this ſenſe he was not without the Law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Therefore in the Fourth place, we are ſaid to be without the Law in regard of the ſpiritual ſenſe of the Law, and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> was without the Law; he did not clearly underſtand the divine and ſpiritual ſenſe of the law; he did not ſee the glory and the beauty of the Law of God, how it did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all the breaches of Righteouſneſs, how it reached to all the inward parts, how contrary the Law of God was to all his nature; thus <hi>Paul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the ſpiritual nature of the Law, he had not the ſpiritual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Law, and thus he was without the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the other words, <hi>I was alive once.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is meant here ſpiritually towards God; he doth not mean naturally, for he was alive naturally, both before and after the commandment came; but the meaning is, he did not think himſelf to be ſuch a wretched curſed creature as he was; he thought he had the fear of God in him, and true Obedience in him; he thought he had a ſpiritual kind of life, as we may ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Ye are dead</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to ſin, but are alive to God in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Give not your members as weapons unto ſin, but give your ſelves unto God, as thoſe that are alive from the dead.</hi> i.e. As thoſe that have the pure and ſpiritual life of grace in them: So <hi>Luke</hi> 15.24. <hi>This my ſon was dead, and is alive again</hi>; that is, ſpiritually alive again; he was a dead creature, he was departed from his Father, which is the fountain of life; he was dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, he was a dead man, but now he is alive again, he hath ſpiritual life again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be alive is taken to be conceitedly ſo, alive in his own conceit, he hath no true life in him, yet he doth imagine that he hath life in him, he thinks he hath life, and is dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1. I know thy works, thou haſt a name thou liveſt, but thou art dead: Here the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> did imagine ſhe was alive, and others conceived ſo; ſhe ſeemed to be alive, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding was dead, ſhe had no true life in her: ſhe ſeemed to be alive, not only in the ſight of others, but in her own apprehenſion; ſhe ſeemed to be alive, and yet was dead; now this is the meaning of the words, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law I was alive once</hi>; that is, I thought my ſelf to be alive; I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended my ſelf to be no dead man, no damned man; I thought not my ſelf to be under the wrath of God, and one that ſhould periſh evermore, if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94114:130"/>
I continued in that eſtate wherein I was; I hoped better things of my ſelf, I ſaw theſe ſigns of Grace and Life in me, and I thought I was alive indeed, till the Commandment came, till the Law of God was preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Conſcience, and ſhewed me the contrary; I thought my ſelf to be a very live man, and one that had ſome hope of eternal happineſs, and one that might enter into glory, I took my ſelf to be alive; Thus we ſee the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obſer.</note>Now the Point I intend at this time to inſiſt upon, is the livelineſſe of a carnal mans heart, before the Law comes home to him, and is preſſed to him, and ſhews him his damnable eſtate, and that he is dead in his ſins and treſpaſſes, he hath ſome colour of Righteouſneſs, that he is moral and civil, and orderly, and he hath ſomthing that is like Grace and Life, he hath ſome hope towards God, and hath ſome kind of obedience, he ſeems to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the commandment of God; before he is humbled by the Law of God, he is a live creature. Here St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews it by his own example, <hi>Without the Law I was once alive</hi>; noting out unto us, how it is with every unhumbled man, with every unmortified man, that is not yet converted to God, he hath many things to ſay for himſelf, but he doth not underſtand the pureneſſe of the Law, the Law hath not yet killed him, it hath not yet pulled him flat down before Almighty God: A man that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled by the Law of God is a live man, he will not be perſwaded, that he is a dead, damned creature; he doth apprehend and hope he hath life: it is ſo with men, before their Converſion, they will not believe that they are damned creatures, and they think it unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe in any to ſay they are damned creatures, and dead creatures, they will not believe it; ſo long as the Law is not charged upon their Conſciences, ſo long as they ſee not how it is with them, they do verily apprehend that they have life in them, their hearts are not kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, their ſpirits are not dead within them, they are not pulled down in the apprehenſion of their own curſed eſtates before Almighty God: this is the thing I intend to inſiſt upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Proof of the Point, we may ſee. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.5. there the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaking of VVidows that lived in pleaſure, ſaith, <hi>She that liveth in pleaſure, is dead while ſhe is alive</hi>; that is, dead in pleaſure, dead in ſin, dead in the vanity of her own heart, and yet ſuch a VVidow liveth, ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not only a natural life, but ſhe is alive in her own conceit in regard of a ſpiritual life; for if ſhe conceived ſhe were a dead creature, a damned crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch thoughts would kill the heart of any creature under heaven, it would break the neck of all her pleaſure, but in that ſhe took her pleaſure, it was a plain token that ſhe was not killed.</p>
               <p>Now for the Opening of the Point, I will do theſe Three things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will ſhew what this livelineſs is, and wherein it conſiſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will ſhew what the Effects of it are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Uſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt I will ſhew what this livelineſſe is, and it conſiſts in theſe Three things; I could branch them into Four, but I will reduce them into Three Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, It conſiſts in the non-appearance of a mans dead, and damned eſtate: So long as a mans dead and damned eſtate doth not appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſo long a man thinks he is alive, and that he is not a dead man, he is not a man that hath the ſentence of condemnation lying upon him, ſo long as the Law hath not come, and ſhewed a man his wretched eſtate, and made his damnable eſtate appear in its ovvn colours unto him, vvhy he is alive man, he conceives himſelf to be alive becauſe the Lavv of God hath not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94114:130"/>
him of the contrary: if the Law of God doth ſeiſe upon a mans heart, and in its own colours appear to a mans eyes, and hold it ſelf as a glaſſe to a mans underſtanding, and ſhew him his wretchedneſſe, and what a curſed eſtate he is in before God, this will kill his very heart, and break the livelineſſe that is in him, and make him burſt out into out-cries, Oh! I am a dead man, I am a damned man; ſo that the livelineſſe that is here ſpoken of, conſiſts in the non-appearance of a mans dead and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable eſtate: As for example, an Adulterer, his damdable eſtate doth not appear to him, he knows not that he is a dead man, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.18. <hi>He knows not that the dead are there, and that her gueſts are in the depth of hell</hi>: When he goes to lie with his Whore, and commit his wickedneſſe, he doth not think that they are dead and damned men that are there, nor that they are in the pit of Hell. Though his Conſcience may tell him, that he is wicked, and ſinful, and wretched, and that he is half dead; yet he is not a dead man, he is not abſolutely a dead man, he doth not know this: It may be he will confeſſe it, Lord, I am a dead man, Lord, I am a damned man; it may be he will confeſſe this in his Prayer, becauſe he hath ſome light: but yet his heart is not taken down, the livelineſſe of his heart is not killed. I will prove it to you: for let another man, a Miniſter of God, or a child of God, ſay he is a dead man, a damned man, one that lies under the wrath of God, he will deny it, and ſay he is uncharitable, and judgeth hardly, and why may he not be a live man, and a good Chriſtian? he hopes he is, he doth not know that he is a dead man; as the wiſe-man ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.12. <hi>There is a way that ſeemetht right to a man, but the iſſues thereof are death</hi>: that is, there is a way that ſeems to be a way of life, and a man ſeems to be alive that walks in that way; but the truth is, it is a way of death, and a man that goeth in that way is a dead man, and a damned man; but yet in the mean time, while he walks in that way, it ſeems to be a way of life unto him; there is a non-appearance of the deadneſſe, and damnedneſſe of a mans eſtate and condition that walks in that way, and therefore it ſeems to him to be a right way, and a way of life, and there is great hope in him that he ſhall live for evermore; and many men do walk in that way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems to him to be a right way, and a way of life; it ſeems right to a man, but the end thereof is death: And this is the Firſt thing, wherein this livelineſs conſiſts, The non-appearance of a mans dead and damned eſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, It conſiſts in Performance, he is able, as he conceives, to do the duties that God commands; he hath wiſdom and ability at home to go about his Affairs; he hath underſtanding and ſupply at home; he hath life, and ſufficiency to go about theſe and theſe duties and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; let the Law tell him, he muſt be ſober, he hath life to avoid the Ale-houſe, and if he commit a Drunken Act, he would have you think he hath grace to be ſorry for it; and let a man tell him, he is a dead man, he hath no grace in him, no life in him; he will tell you, he doth thus and thus, he hears Gods Word, and he Prayes to God, and he Truſts in God, and he Believes in God; your telling of him this, doth not kill his heart, he thinks he is alive for all this; nay, let the Law of God, come and tell him, He is a dead man for all his doing; this will not kill him neither, ſo long as the Lord himſelf doth not open his eyes, and clear his eye-ſight, and diſcover his ſins, and convince his Conſcience; though the Law ſay he is a dead man, and a damned man, this doth not kill him, he can wait upon God and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form theſe and theſe duties. Then let the Law of God ſay, He is a dead man for all this, he muſt deny himſelf: why ſo he will; I confeſſe, Lord, I am an unrighteous man, a wretched man, a ſinful creature, and all my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is as menſtruous raggs; and now he thinks all is well, but the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94114:131"/>
Law of God, hath not yet come home unto him, and ſhewed him his heavie eſtate, but he is alive in regard of the performance of the duty, and thinks verily he hath life at home in him; whereas, if the Law of God did come home and charge his eſtate upon him, and ſhew him, what obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience the Law requires, what ſeverity, and truth in the inward parts, it would break a mans heart, and kill him, notwithſtanding all performances: but in the mean time that a mans heart is not killed, and the Law hath not given him his deaths VVound, he thinks he is alive: <hi>Cry aloud,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, ſhew my people their Tranſgreſſions, and the houſe of Iſrael their ſins,</hi> Iſai. 58.1. there the Lord looks upon the people as dead, wretched ſinners, and abominable people, but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they thought they were alive in performances, as we may ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my wayes, even as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that did righteouſly, and had not forſaken the Statutes of their God: they ask of me the Ordinances of Juſtice, they draw near to me, ſaying, We have faſted, and thou regardeſt it not.</hi> We ſee here they take delight in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching unto God, they take delight in Gods Ordinances, and ſeek God early, they can do thus, and thus, and are alive in all performances; but that man whole ſpirit the Law hath pulled down, and the Lord hath convinced him of his infinite inability to perform the Law, he cannot ſee any livelineſs in him, unto any performance. Let any duty come, it kills his heart: I ſhould now hear the VVord of God, but my heart is unprepared, and my ear uncircumciſed, and I cannot hear aright. Let an opportunity be offered to Pray, it kills his heart; I ſhould now call upon the Name of the Lord, but I have ſuch a curſed heart I cannot Pray, I cannot ſpeak one right word before God. Let an occaſion be offered of holy Conference, it kills his heart; Alas, ſaith he, I want pure language, my tongue was never touched with a coal from the Altar, my lips have not ability to drop forth ſavoury ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, I am not able to ſpeak one ſyllable aright to Gods glory; it kills his heart, he ſees no life at all in him, unleſſe he can have life from without, and ability from without, he is dead, all is nothing to him, the law hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the livelineſſe that was in him: But he that is not humbled by the Law, he is alive, he hath life in himſelf, it is nothing with him to Pray, and go to Church, and hear Gods Word, it is nothing, but thruſting to do the duty; he hath life in him to do duties, and wait upon God in his Ordinances, but when the Law comes home to him, it plainly lets him ſee that he hath no life in himſelf to do any good, he muſt ſeek for life and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from without, elſe he is a dead man, he can do nothing in this caſe: <hi>David</hi> in this caſe cannot look up: <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over my head, I cannot look up,</hi> Pſal. 40. <hi>Moſes,</hi> he is a man of uncircumciſed lips, and cannot ſpeak unto <hi>Pharaoh; Paul</hi> cannot do any thing that is good, <hi>In me dwelleth no good thing.</hi> Rom. 7. And ſo for the reſt of Gods people, when the Law hath killed them and laid them dead, in regard of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, they muſt have life from without, there is no life at home, no grace at home, no underſtanding at home, they muſt go out for all: but a carnal man, he is alive unto all performances. Many a man is like unſavoury Salt, good for nothing, but to throw upon the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil. He never received the Holy Ghoſt, and yet he will be inducted into a Living, and take a Paſtoral Charge upon him, as if he were able to perform the Duty of a Miniſter, and take the Charge of Souls upon him. So <hi>Ananias</hi> will be a Husband, and <hi>Sapphira</hi> a VVife; <hi>Athalia</hi> vvill be a Queen, and <hi>Nimrod</hi> a King; and <hi>Abimilech</hi> a Judge; they are alive to diſcharge all theſe Duties:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94114:131"/>
thus men are alive, the Law of God hath not killed their hearts, and pulled down their ſpirits; it hath not made it appear unto them, what wretched, curſed Creatures they are. This is the Second thing, wherein this Livelineſs conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Livelineſſe conſiſts in a preſumptuous hope; he conceives that he is juſtified before God, and that God will not damn him, but forgive him his ſins. There is nothing can make a mans heart more full of life, than to think that he is righteous before God, and that God will not impute his ſins unto him: there is nothing can make a man more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, then this. If they think they are juſtified before God, they have then a lively hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>even the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again, to a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the Dead.</hi> So theſe men have a hope, that makes them lively, and full of life; as a poor man that hath ſome grounded hope of an Earthly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it makes the heart lively: Poverty deads the heart; he that hath nothing to maintain himſelf, and thoſe that belongs unto him, it deads his heart; but if he hath ſome hopes of an hundred pound a year, and his hope is grounded, if he hath ſure hope of it, and he makes no doubt of it; it makes his heart full of life: ſo when a man doth believe that he is in a good caſe, that he is delivered from death, that he is in the eſtate of grace, when he hath ſome probability that God hath juſtified him from ſin; this breeds an hope in him of an eternal Inheritance, and this hope, the conſideration of it, makes the ſoul full of life; There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make a man more lively, then a hope that he is juſtified before God, and that God will not impute his ſins unto him. Now when a carnal man conceives he is righteous before God, and that God will forgive him his iniquities, that God will not damn him, nor count him a dead and a damned man; ſo long as a man doth imagine this, he muſt needs be a lively man; he is alive in his own apprehenſion; nay, all the delights in the world, cannot make a man ſo full of life, as this hope. It is not mens following their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that makes their hearts ſo full of life; as to have hope that the Lord doth not account them dead men, that they are juſtified men, and righteous men, that they have ſalvation to ſhew for, Heaven and eternal happineſſe to ſhew for, that they ſhall go to heaven. But if now the Law were charged upon a man, if he knew that he were a dead man, a damned man, it would pluck down his ſpirits, and make his ſpirits dead, for all his pleaſures. It is the conceit that men are Juſtified, that makes them ſo full of life; ſo long as the Law doth not come home to a man, and point him out in his colours, and make it appear to him, that he lyeth under the wrath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that the Lord doth account him an abominable, wretched Creature, ſo long as he doth not apprehend this; eſpecially if he have any good Gifts, and Parts, and Qualities, and Moral Obedience to the Law; doing good Duties, and a general laying hold upon the Promiſes, and a hope they belong to him; this makes him alive, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was a Phariſee, and did Moral Duties, and performed Moral Obedience to the Law of God, he thought he had Righteouſneſſe of his own; he calls it there, <hi>his own Righteouſneſſe,</hi> he ſo apprehended of himſelf; now this is that which makes men alive, when they conceive, that they have ſome Religion, and ſome Grace. You ſhall have many men and women that hate the Servants of God, and yet think they are godly men, and have Grace and Life in them. We may ſee it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.50. there it is ſaid that the <hi>Jews ſtirred up certain devout and honourable women, and raiſed Perſecution againſt</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>and expelled them out of their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94114:132"/>
Coaſts</hi>: Though they hated <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> yet they are ſaid to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout,</hi> and <hi>honourable women.</hi> They imagined they were very Devout, they conceived they were Religious; How many men and women are there, that think they are Righteous, and they will do many Duties, and take many good Courſes, in ſo much, that it would pity a man to think they ſhould go to hell? they will be very Zealous, they will be very Earneſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Drunkenneſſe, and cry out againſt the abominations of the times; they are marvellous Devout and Godly, and yet a man that is Devout and Godly in truth and in deed, they cannot abide him, but hate him. Now if the Law ſhould come home unto them, and diſcover how indeed it is with them, it would humble their ſouls, and pull down their ſpirits, and make them dead; ſo that this preſumptuous hope, that men are in good terms with God, and that God will be merciful to them, and forgive them their ſins; this makes them to be alive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We come now to the Second thing, and that is the <hi>Effect</hi> of this Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, what Effects it works in the heart; And the Effects of this Livelineſs are Four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It makes them ſound and heart-whole, like a Boyl unlaunced, it is yet ſound. The true ſight of ſin, and wrath of God in the ſoul, is able to break the heart of any man; it is able to dead his ſpirit, and kill all the Livelineſſe that is in him, and make him have little life to go on as he doth. But ſo long as the Law of God is not come home to a man, though he have no Title to Heaven, though Hell be the Portion of his Cup, yet he is as ſound as can be, as heart-whole as may be: Let carnal comfort come, he can take it; let pleaſures come, he is able to delight himſelf therewith, and go on in his courſe as if he ailed nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his infirmities, but a wounded spirit, who can bear?</hi> When the Lord comes to wound a mans heart with the ſight of his ſins, and the fearful condition he is in, what a curſed creature he is, having no Mercy, and being out of Chriſt; having no Pardon, no Grace, no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, but lyeth under the Curſe of God: If the Law thus come home, and wounds his Conſcience, he is not able to bear it; this man, let carnal Comforts come, he is not able to take them; it kills the heart. Look as it is with the Stomack, if it can take meat, and digeſt it, it muſt needs be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; for if the Stomack be dead, it can digeſt nothing. So for the Taſte, If a mans Palat, and all the inſtruments of the taſte be dead, he takes no delight in any meats: So there is a kind of ſoundneſs in the Soul, that is the reaſon why a man can delight in carnal pleaſures, in Drinking, and Sporting, and in Profit and Gain. There is a kind of ſoundneſs, and liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Heart; the heart is not yet broken: If the Law come, and take the Hearts life away, this will pull down the Heart, it will make a mans heart even break, it will pull down his ſpirit: But a man whom the Law hath not yet humbled, and ſhewed him his damned eſtate, his heart is yet whole, and ſound. When the Law of God had but a little killed <hi>Ahabs</hi> heart, you might ſee it in his very gate, he went ſoftly, he could not tread ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently upon the ground, as he was wont to do; it tamed his very ſteps, it is wonderful how his heart was broken; it appeared in his very go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down. When the Law comes home to a man, it is able to kill his heart, and makes him Soul-ſick, and makes him cry out, O the wretchedneſſe of my heart; it makes a man ſick at the heart, it lyes like a heavie Plague upon the heart and conſcience, it will make a man at deaths door with his ſins; it will make him ſay with <hi>Paul, When the Commandment came, Sin revived, and I died.</hi> But another man, though he hath evident demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he is a dead man, yet the Law of God hath not pulled down his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94114:132"/>
heart; ſickneſſe will pull down a mans Stomack: ſo when the law of God comes home to a mans conſcience, and makes him ſick, it makes him yield, and pulls down his ſtomack. Many men are crazy, and ſickly; and yet they lye not by it, but walk up and down, and go abroad; but if they were heart-ſick, it would pull them down, and make them lye by it. So many a carnal man, may have ſome qualms of ſin, but yet their hearts can go abroad after profits, and pleaſures, after vanities, and delights; they can go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad for all this. But when the law comes home, it will pull down a mans ſpirit, and make him heart-ſick. This is the meaning of that place, <hi>The wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le need not a Phyſician; but the ſick</hi> Mat. 9.12. Every carnal man, ſo long as he is not humbled, and broken under the ſight of his ſins, his heart is yet whole, his ſpirit is yet found, he is not yet wounded; as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.6. <hi>From the crown of the head, to the ſole of the foot, there is nothing, but wounds, and ſwellings, and ſores full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; there is no ſoundneſſe in him</hi>: He is indeed full of wounds, but the skin is yet ſound, it is not broken, he feels it not; the law hath not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his eſtate unto him. This is the firſt effect of this livelyneſſe; it makes men to be ſound, and heart-whole.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Second</hi> effect of this livelyneſſe, when a man is alive in the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearance of his dead and damned eſtate; alive in performance, alive in preſumption, and ſelf-juſtifying, and ſelf-hopes; The effect of it is, that he is fearleſſe; the more lively, the more fearleſſe. Firſt, the <hi>Object</hi> muſt dead the heart, before it can make the heart fear; ſo long as the heart is ſtout, the livelyneſſe that is in the heart, is able to keep out fear: So the livelyneſſe of a ſinner, makes the heart fearleſſe and ſecure. A man would wonder how any creature durſt provoke God; it is almoſt beyond the reach of true reaſon, how any creature ſhould dare to provoke God; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what infinite danger he is in, to have the wrath of the God of heaven and earth to hang over his head, to be under the hand of revenging Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; to pull down all the Woes, and Plagues, and Comminations of God upon the Soul; that a man ſhould do this, and yet be ſecure, it would make a man wonder at it. But a man that hath this livelyneſſe, he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God, and yet be ſecure, as <hi>Job</hi> 12.6. <hi>thoſe that provoke God are ſecure,</hi> the reaſon is, the law of God hath not taken down their hearts, the law of God hath not deaded their ſpirits; they are alive in preſumption, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and therefore though they provoke God, they are ſecure, and fear nothing. It is the diſquietneſſe of a mans heart, that makes him fear; therefore ſo long as a mans mind is quiet, and is not diſturbed, he is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: So long as the law hath not diſquieted a mans mind, nor broken the reſt of a mans Soul, nor diſturbed his conſcience, but tells him, go on in quiet; he ſpends his dayes in ſecurity, he fears nothing; whereas, fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and trembling, and horrible dread, would overwhelm him, if the law of God ſhould come and take away his life: It is fear that deads a mans heart, as we may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.4. when the Angel of the Lord ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away the ſtone from Chriſts Sepulchre, it is ſaid, <hi>For fear of the Angel, the Keepers trembled, and became as dead men</hi>: There is the effect of fear; if the law did but open mens eyes, and paint out before them, how it is with them, how they are liable to Gods wrath, and under the ſentence of condemnation: If they were once thus feared, it would make them ſeem as dead men: the Drunkards would be ſo afraid, that they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as dead men: All wretched men, all ungrounded Chriſtians, all that are not truly alive towards God, it would make them become as dead men; and it is the deadneſſe of the heart that makes men fear, and ſuch a man cannot be ſecure. Careleſſeneſſe and fear, are two contraries, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30.9.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94114:133"/>
                  <hi>In that day ſhall Meſſengers go forth from me in Ships, to make the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Ethiopian afraid, and great pain ſhall come upon them</hi>: The Prophet there makes theſe two contraries; they ſhall be full of fear, to rouze them out of ſecurity: ſo the cauſe why men are careleſſe to get Repentance, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to get deliverance from ſin, careleſſe of their walking with God; the reaſon is, becauſe of this damnable livelineſſe that is in their hearts, they are not yet deaded by the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another effect of this livelineſſe is this, it makes the heart ſtiff; what a deal of ſtiffneſſe is in the hearts of carnal men? Let God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid ſinne, they are ſtiff, and will ſtill continue in their ſins, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks, <hi>the heart of this people is waxed ſtiff,</hi> their hearts are marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtiffe; the reaſon of it is, becauſe the Law of God hath not taken away their livelyneſſe, it hath not humbled their hearts, and pull'd down their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: whereas if the Law had paſt upon them, and the conſideration of their eſtate were rooted in their minds, it would make their ſtoutneſſe to yeild, and their ſtiffeneſſe to come down; infinite is the ſtiffeneſſe of a man for want of this work of the law: Tell a vain gallant of his locks, how ſtiffly will he reaſon for it? Tell a prophane perſon of the lewdneſſe of his courſe, how ſtiffly will he argue for it? This is for want of this killing work of the law.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The laſt effect of this livelineſſe is this, it makes the heart peark, and brisk; what a deal of briskneſſe, and pearkneſſe do we ſee every day in the hearts of men, becauſe their hearts are not taken down? I will give you two or three Inſtances; If a man have a little knowledge more then others, he is proud, and brisk, and peark; and he will be ſome-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he will be talking, and thinks he hath ſuch a deal of knowledg: what is the reaſon of this, that he is ſo peark? It is becauſe the Law hath not made it known unto him, that he knows nothing as he ought to know. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. There ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If a man thinks he knows any thing, he knows nothing as he ought to know.</hi> If the law of God did ſhew him he were a beaſt, and a bruit for all his underſtanding; if it did diſcover unto him, his blockiſhneſſe, and blindneſſe, and ignorance, that he knows nothing of the Myſteries of Grace and Salvation, this would pull down his peark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; take another man, that hath more knowledge, and can ſpeak better a thouſand times, if the law hath ſhewed him his eſtate, and truly humbled him, all his briskneſſe is taken away, the law hath taught him ſuch a leſſon, that he cannot be peark: Oh! ſaith he, I know nothing, there is no man more fooliſh then I, I have not the knowledge of the moſt High in me; though he have never ſo much knowledge, and gifts, and parts, yet the law hath diſcovered his eſtate unto him, and pulled down the pearkneſſe of his ſpirit. Again, another man is ready to carp at every word, every little occaſion will make him on the top of the houſe, his heart is ſo brisk, that it is up upon every little occaſion, but when the law comes home unto him, this will pull down all his pearkneſs; alas, he angry at a word ſpeaking? The law hath told him how he hath offended God, and provoked his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from time to time; he is now cooled from being ſo peark, to be angry at every word. So take a man that is full of pleaſure and voluptuouſneſſe, and is ready to be vain and fooliſh, every pleaſure puts life into him; but; now let the law come, and be charged upon his conſcience, and then all his pearkneſſe is preſently down, he is not able to look up, he ſeeth ſo many ſins diſcovered by the law, that he is not able to look up: <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Go to now ye rich men</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>weep and howl for the miſery that ſhall come upon you.</hi> If the law were charged upon rich men, it would make them weep and howle; rich men are fulleſt of pleaſure and delight,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94114:133"/>
and fartheſt from weeping and howling, but if the Law were charged upon their conſciences, it would make them weep and howle, and have little heart to be ſo pleaſant.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Uſes, and the <hi>Firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is for Inſtruction, to ſhew us <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> the reaſon, why there are ſo many men and women among us, that think themſelves alive, that are ſo ſecure, and fearleſſe, and careleſſe, that have their hearts ſo ſound, and their ſpirits ſo unbroken; the reaſon is, becauſe the Law hath not yet come home, and killed their hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. The very <hi>letter</hi> of the Law is able to kill as many of us as are in this eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; therefore the cauſe of this livelineſſe, and ſecurity, is becauſe we are ſtrangers from the Law of God, our eyes were never open to behold it, the Law of God never came home unto our hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Second <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is this, When we find our hearts to be brisk and peark,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> let us pray unto God that he would be pleaſed to charge his Law upon our Conſciences: Let us buy precious eye-ſalve, that we may be able to look into the Law of God, this will make our hearts that they will not be ſo wanton, and our ſpirits, that they will not be ſo brisk, though they would never ſo fain mind earthly things, they cannot. If the Lord would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but to charge his Law upon the heart, it would make the ſtouteſt ſpirit to yield.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This takes away the imputation that is laid upon the Word of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>3</label> God; many think hardly of the Word of God, it takes away the ſpirits of men: the Preaching of the Law, it pulls down the ſpirits of men, and breaks mens hearts, it makes men have no ſpirits, as they ſaid of <hi>Jeremy, thou makeſt the knees feeble</hi>: ſo the Law infeebles the knees, and takes away the ſpirits of a man; why here we ſee that the Law of God will do ſo, it is the Property of the Law to do ſo, whereſoever it comes, it kills the heart, and pulls down all the pearkneſſe of it. The Law, it will ever break a mans bones, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Let me hear of joy and gladneſſe, that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce,</hi> Pſal. 51. The Lord had broken his very back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone by the Law, and now he could not rejoyce, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.15. <hi>I the Lord dwell with him that is of an humble and contrite ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble:</hi> When the Law of God hath broken a mans heart, and made him contrite, he is a dead man, till the Lord comes to revive him, and raiſe up his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Second part of the Text,<note place="margin">The latter part of the Text Opened.</note> 
                  <hi>When the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I died.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here alſo, as in the former part, are Two things to be expounded:</p>
               <p>Firſt, What doth the Apoſtle here mean by <hi>reviving? When the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came, ſin revived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What doth he mean by <hi>dying; I died?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Law and Commandment came, and diſcovered me to my ſelf, and ſhewed me what a damnable thing ſin was, and what a wretched dead creature I was for committing the ſame, and how I lay under the guilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>ſin revived, and I died.</hi> Therefore, What doth the Apoſtle mean by ſin <hi>revived?</hi> I Anſwer, The Apoſtle doth not mean here, as if ſin were indeed dead in him, before the Commandment came: for ſin is alive in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very carnal mans heart, before the Commandment comes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot mean thus, <hi>when the Commandment came, ſin revived,</hi> as if it were truly, and really dead before; for his ſins were not dead in him, when he was a Phariſee, his ſins were not mortified, when he was in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerated eſtate and condition ſin was not dead in him, that cannot be the meaning, eas if ſin vvere dead before, and now revived: But he ſpeaks of the <hi>Appearance</hi> of the death of ſin, though it vvere not dead before, yet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94114:134"/>
it did appear to be dead; as a Snake in cold weather, though it be alive, yet it appears to be dead, the life of it is in a ſwound; though it hath life, yet the cold benums it, and keeps it from appearing: ſo before the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came, ſin was in <hi>Paul,</hi> but it ſeemed to have no life but when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came, and diſcovered plainly, what a dead creature he was, then the life of ſin came indeed to be manifeſted.</p>
               <p>Now the Law of God doth manifeſt the life of ſin Three wayes; it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts Three lifes of Sin: There are three lifes of ſin that appear to the ſoul, when the Law comes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, There is the life of <hi>Aggravation</hi>; the Law of God doth ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate and point out ſin to the full life of it, it makes ſin appear in the true nature of it: the true nature of every thing is the life of the thing: the nature of a man is the life of a man: Now the Law did ſhew the nature of his ſins, it painted them out to the very life, in their lively colours; this made him ſee how his ſins were aggravated: what a curſed and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thing ſin was, and what a perſon it was committed againſt, this made ſin appear unto him in the very life of it; therefore in the 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Sin, that it might appear ſin, wrough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> death in me, that ſin might be out of meaſure ſinful by the commandment</hi>: that is, when the commandment comes, and is manifeſted to the ſoul, it makes the life of ſin appear, the life of ſin is then manifeſted, the Law of God like a glaſſe, doth ſhew the life of the Commandment and the very nature of all ſinning, and tranſgreſſing. Now before the Law came thus home unto him, he could not thus ſee ſin; he could ſay, he was a ſinner, and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted theſe, and theſe ſins: But what theſe ſins were, and the exceeding ſinfulneſſe of theſe ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he did not ſee that. He had a dead kind of picture of his ſins before, but the life thereof was not manifeſted; but the Law of God did make his ſin revive, and made him ſee his ſins in the life of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is the life of <hi>Irritation,</hi> as I may ſo call it; or of itching, and egging a man. This is another life of ſin, whereby it is full of Operation, and Working in the Soul: The Operation of a thing, is the life of a thing. Now before the Commandment came, ſin ſeemed dead, it wrought indeed many evils in him, but he did not think his heart had been ſo full of life, and ſo full of activity againſt Gods Law and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Sin ſeemed to lye dead before, but now when the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came, and ſet upon his heart, and began to charge him with better O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; now his heart grew itching, and marvellous full of life unto luſt. Hereupon ſin egged him the more on to luſt: It is like water, when a man goes about to ſtop it, it runs the more violently. So it is with ſin in the heart, the more the Law of God goes about to ſtop it, and hinder it, the more eager it is, and the more full of life and working, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Without the Law, ſin was dead</hi>: there was no ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſin in my mortal body then: but vvhen the Commandment came, vvhen the Lavv vvas charged upon my heart, then ſin took occaſion hereby to be the more violent, and vvork in me all manner of Concupiſcence: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I committed ſin vvithout any check, I had vain thoughts, and fooliſh courſes, and many a luſt in my ſoul, and I vvent to it as if it had been a good thing, not as if it had been evil: But vvhen the Lavv of God came to ſhevv me the ſlackneſſe of my Obedience, and to controle me, and convince me, and to ſtop the courſe of ſin, it vvrought all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence in me; it vvrought before in <hi>Paul,</hi> for it vvrought all his ſecurity, and all his hardneſſe of heart, and all his vain thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations: but this vvas but a dead kind vvorking, in compariſon of that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94114:134"/>
which it wrought after the commandment came. There are none that have ſuch active Rebellions againſt the Law and Commandment of God, as thoſe to whom the Law comes; it eggs a man forward, and makes him itch unto Rebellion. If a man had asked <hi>Paul</hi> before, whether he had ſuch a diveliſh heart againſt God? he ſaw no ſuch matter, he never meant God any hurt when he went on in his courſe, he thought not that he was ſo ſtubborn and Rebellious, he did not feel this ſtubbornneſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; But when the Law came once, it ſhewed him the venome, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed nature of his ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Third</hi> life of ſin is the worſt of all; and that is, the life of <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>; for here ſin is ſo full of life, that it is not only able to diſcover unto him, that he is a ſinful wretch, and an abominable creature; but to bind him over to wrath and ſend him to Hell, and everlaſting deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now it is the Law of God that diſcovers this life of ſin: before the Law comes, a man hath many vain hopes, that God is merciful, and Chriſt died for ſinners, and that God will forgive him his ſins, he doth not ſee the imputation of ſin: the imputation of ſin lying upon the Soul is not clearly diſcovered, before the Law come; for where there is no Law, there is no imputation of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13. there ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the time of the Law was ſin in the world; but ſin is not imputed, while there is no Law.</hi> Before the Law is charged upon the heart, the heart never dreams of the imputation of ſin, as if he ſhould anſwer for ſin, and be damned for ſin for ever: He thought the contrary before, but now the Law diſcovers the life of ſin unto him, and ſin revives, and appears to have life to damn him for evermore. Sin now appears to have life to caſt him off from God, and to bind him over to Everlaſting vengeance. Thus it was with <hi>Paul, when the Commandment came, ſin revived</hi>: I ſaw ſin was alive indeed, and I ſaw the life of Aggravation, I ſaw the helliſh nature of ſin, it was painted out to the full; I ſaw the life of Irritation, I ſaw the infinite egging, and itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin, how it did work in me; I ſaw the life of imputation, how all my ſins were imputed unto me, and did all lye upon my conſcience, and ſo ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, that is the meaning.</p>
               <p>Now for the meaning of the <hi>Second</hi> word, <hi>I dyed</hi>; that is, I ſaw I was a dead man; I ſaw plainly, and clearly, that I was but a dead man; I thought I was alive before, becauſe I did good duties, and walked in the Ordinances of God; and I thought that I might go for a Chriſtian, and Servant of God, as well as another. I did not think I was a dead man, I thought I had ſome goodneſſe in me, ſome hope of eternal life in me; I did not conclude that I was a dead man. But when the Law of God humbled me, and diſcovered my eſtate plainly unto me; then I ſaw I was a dead man indeed, my heart failed me, and the livelyneſs that was in me before, departed from me, I ſaw I was a dead man, and had not the Spirit of Chriſt come and quickned me, I had been a dead man to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I now ſaw that ſin began to revive in me, and I began to be a dead man. Thus we ſee the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>Now the Theame I propounded to you was this, namely, how the Lord converts the will; and the firſt work that prepares a man hereunto, is the work of pulling down the vvill, and the pulling down of a mans heart; for the will of a man is full of obſtinacy, full of livelineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth and commandment of God; full of livelineſſe in ſin, and conceives it ſelf to be in a better eſtate and condition, and ſo the will is obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſtill. Now when it pleaſeth God to convert a man, firſt he pulls down the will of a man, and pulls down his ſpirit; now here is a Doctrine to make way for this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:94114:135"/>
                  <note place="margin">Obſer.</note>Namely, <hi>That when</hi> the Lord takes a man in hand to pull him down, to pull down his will, he doth ſhew him what a dead Creature he is. The Lord by pronouncing a man in his own Boſom, a dead man, a damned man, one that can no way help himſelf; he is dead, abſolutely dead in his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and in Gods account, all his hopes are rotten; he is meerly, a dead, damned man: hereby the Lord pulls down his Will. We may ſee this in <hi>Paul,</hi> before his Converſion; his Will was full of Obſtinacy and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God, he would go and make havock of the Church, he would not ſubmit to the Will of God; but when the Lord came to work upon him, <hi>Saul, Saul, Why perſecuteſt thou me? It is hard for thee to kick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the pricks: What wilt thou that I ſhall do Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.6? Now his Will is come down: but mark how the Lord puts him off; <hi>Go to ſuch a place</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and there it ſhall be told thee what thou ſhalt do.</hi> The Lord puts him off, and would not give him an Anſwer preſently, what he ſhould do; as who ſhould ſay, Thou haſt as yet an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Will, thou wilt not do as I command thee: I will not tell thee as yet, what I will have thee to do, but go to ſuch a place, and I will Arreſt thee there, and charge my Law upon thy Conſcience, and ſhew thee thy dead, and damned eſtate. And now his Will is come down; he bids him be Baptized, and he was ſo; he bids him go and Preach the Goſpel, and he did ſo; now his Will is come down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So the Prodigal,</hi> his Heart was marvellous Obſtinate againſt his Fathers commandment; he would be gone from his Father, he could not abide to ſtay in a houſe where there were ſuch ſtrict courſes, he would have his Goods and Patrimony in his own hand, (as it is the Property of every carnal man) he would have his Inheritance in his own hand; he would have Power, and Strength, and Ability, and theſe Gifts, and Parts, in his own hand: but when he is humbled by the Law, he is content to have all in Gods hand, he is content to have all his VViſdom there, that he may come thither for it; he is content to have all his Righteouſneſſe there, and all his Ability, Strength, and Sufficiency there, that he may come thither for it; all is there, and he ſees himſelf a beggar, if he comes not to God, and keeps cloſe to God, and keeps faſt to his Covenant, he is a very beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. But this man would have all in his own hands, and go and ſquander away all upon his Luſts and Pleaſures, and he would not ſtay at home with his Father. Now when the Law of God came home to him, to ſhew this man to himſelf, <hi>when he came to himſelf,</hi> as the Text ſaith (his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did eſteem him a dead man before,) but when he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſaw he was a dead man for going away from his Father, the Father of Life: Novv his VVill is come dovvn, <hi>I will go to my Father, and ſay, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and againſt thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired ſervants,</hi> Luke 15.17. Here his VVill is come dovvn; he vvould be gone from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, he could not abide to be held in ſo ſtrictly, he vvould fain be gone, and be at liberty; he had no mind to ſtay in his Fathers houſe: But vvhen he came to himſelf, vvhen the Lavv ſhevved him, he vvas but a dead man, for going from his Father; and going after his Luſts and Pleaſures; novv his VVill is brought dovvn, and it ſubmits, and yields; and novv he vvill go to his Father, and humble himſelf before his Father, and ſay, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and againſt thee, &amp;c.</hi> Novv I deſire here to ſhevv you Three things, as I did in the former Point.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Uſes we are to make of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> Wherein this deadneſſe conſiſts: and it conſiſts in Three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In deadneſſe in <hi>being.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In deadneſſe to all <hi>doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt, It conſiſts</hi> in deadneſſe in <hi>being.</hi> When the law comes, it ſhews a man <hi>indeed</hi> to be a dead man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>the Letter killeth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: the very letter of the law, without the Spirit of life, which Chriſt doth inform it with, when he comes to work upon his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; The letter alone, without the Spirit of God, kills a man: now when a man is killed, he is a dead man; he is then fully dead, he hath the very being of a dead man, he is a dead man; that is his Eſtate and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So when the law of God comes home to a man, it ſhews him indeed that he is a dead man. The property of the law, when it is let in to work upon the heart, is to ſlay a man, <hi>I have ſlain them by the words of my mouth, Hoſ.</hi> 6.5. The law which proceeds from Gods mouth, is able to ſlay a poor ſinner, and kill him at the heart, and lay him for dead before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that he can ſtrive no more; the reaſon is, becauſe the law doth charge the <hi>truth of God</hi> upon a man. Now the truth is, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſinner is a dead man, this is the very truth of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. <hi>To be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally-minded is death</hi>: That man is a dead man; there is the very death of ſinne, and hell, and condemnation in that man, that is a carnal-minded man. Now the law of God when it comes, doth charge this Truth upon the Soul, it diſcovers a man to be in this eſtate and condition, wherein in truth he is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It conſiſts in <hi>deadneſſe in Gods account.</hi> For all a mans preſumptions, for all a mans vain hopes that he is juſtified; for this is the nature of man, before he is convinced by the law of God,<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf, (<hi>you are they that juſtifie your ſelves,</hi>) not that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed juſtified; but he falſely applies juſtification to himſelf, and he hopes he is juſtified before God, he is apt to pronounce this hope unto himſelf. Let a Miniſter tell him of his ſins, here is his Salve, God is merciful, and Chriſt came to ſave ſinners. Let Sermons beat upon him from day to day, to humble him, he cannot imagine that he is in a damnable eſtate: Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are too harſh, and cenſorious, and the like. But when the Law comes, <hi>it ſhuts up a man</hi> that he cannot get out, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Law hath concluded all under ſin</hi>: that is the nature of the word of God, to ſhut up a man, that a man is not able to get out: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law is <hi>charged,</hi> the heart hath a thouſand ſtarting-holes. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce hell, and damnation againſt it, it hath this ſtarting-hole, that Chriſt dyed for ſinners: diſcover plainly that he is a dead man, he hath theſe ſtarting-holes, he hopes he ſhall have peace, and he hopes he is not ſo vile before Almighty God, and he hopes he hath better righteouſneſſe then you would bear him down with; and ſo he hath an evaſion to get out: but when the law comes, and ſhuts him up, this will tame him. As we uſe to tame Lions, and Bears, and ſuch like fierce and cruel creatures, by ſhutting of them up, ſo the Lord tames the heart of a poor creature, when he would pull him down, he ſhuts him up, and layes him in the priſon, and in the Gaole, and he hath no way to get out, he is a dead man, and there is no way to get out, no evaſion to eſcape; but ſtill he is a dead man, and a damned man, he cannot open his mouth any more, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.63. <hi>That thou mayeſt remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, when I am pacified towards thee, for all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94114:136"/>
that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> The law indeed works thus in the Regenerate, though the Lord be pacified towards them, yet they ſhall never open their mouths, never cavil againſt Gods precepts more, never be ſo brisk any more. But ſo long as a man is in his ſins, the law doth not only convince him that he is dead in himſelf, but that he is alſo dead to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; that God accounts him a dead man, that God is not paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towards him, but he lies under the wrath of God, and this pulls him down, and ſtops his mouth. A carnal mans mouth will not be ſtopped, but he will have ſome thing to ſay, ſome vain hope, or confidence, or other, ſome pleading, or excuſing or other. His mouth will never be ſtopped, till the law of God comes; and when that comes, that <hi>will ſtop his mouth,</hi> and make it appear, that he is guilty before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Now we know, that whatſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law, that every mouth might be ſtopped, and all the world may be culpable before God.</hi> But before the law comes, a mans mouth will not be ſtopped. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.3. <hi>God came to Abimilech by night, and ſaid, Thou art but a dead man, becauſe of the woman which thou haſt taken, for ſhe is a mans Wife</hi>: He was a dead man, but he little thought it; he would not believe that he was a dead man: As the Text there ſpeaks of temporal death. So it is true of the other, carnal men are indeed dead men, but they will not believe that they are dead men, and damned men; they hope for mercy, and cry, peace, peace to their ſouls; but when the law comes, that knocks off all mens hopes, and layes them for dead in Gods account.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This deadneſſe I here ſpeak of, it conſiſts in regard of <hi>all manner of doing</hi>; when the law of God hath charged it ſelf upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and diſcovered to a man, that he is a dead, and a damned man. It makes it now appear unto him, that he is utterly unable to do any thing; he is in the depth of miſery, and he is unable to cry mercy aright, he is not able to make a prayer, no more then a dead man: he ſeeth he can no more keep a Sabbath as he ought, than a dead man. So for any duty of Religion, he ſeeth he hath no more life to do it, then a dead man hath to do the actions of the living: as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God.</hi> God made Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alive unto him, but firſt he charged his law upon his conſcience, and made him ſeem to be a dead man to the law: That he had no life or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do any thing pleaſing to God: but when the Lord made him alive to himſelf, then he could do ſomething, nay, <hi>he was able to do all things, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that ſtrengthned him.</hi> But in himſelf, both ſtill, and before, he was altogether dead to the law of God; ſo that when the law comes, and ſhews a mans eſtate unto him, it ſhews him his utter inability to the performance of any good duty. The Phariſee will to the Temple as well as the Publican; <hi>Saul</hi> will Sacrifice as well as <hi>Samuel</hi>; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane people will take up the Ordinances of God, as if they had life to go through them, as well as the people of God. But when the law comes, it plainly convinceth a man; it makes him feel and underſtand, that he hath no activity, or life to perform any thing pleaſing to Almighty God; a dead man can do nothing, he is cut off from all the actions of the living; dead men they cannot deviſe ought, they cannot purpoſe ought, they cannot work ought. So when the Law of God is charged upon a man, and ſhews him that he is but a dead man; and a damned man, now he ſeeth, he can as well create a world, as make a prayer; he can as well remove a Mountain, as do any thing acceptable to God. Such a man will ſay, I am a dry tree, and cannot grow; I am loſt in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94114:136"/>
wilderneſſe of ſin, and cannot get out again. Thus we ſee wherein this dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe conſiſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now I come to ſhew you the <hi>Effects if this deadneſſe,</hi> how it pulls down the heart: this will pull down the heart of a man marvellouſly, when the Law chargeth this upon him, that he is but a dead man; though the will of man be infinitely unruly, it is wild, it is like the <hi>mad man</hi> in the Goſpel, that the Divel was in, no man was able to bind him, no Chains were able to hold him, no Creature could tame him, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.34. So it is with the will of an unregenerate man, his will is marvellous wild, he breaks all bonds, and ſnaps all cords in pieces, and caſts off the yoak from him. Let God bid him do this, he will not do it; let him be in a good mood, he is preſently out of it again, let him be convinced of his vain hopes, and let him ſee what a wretched Creature he is, he will have vain hopes again; his will is infinitely unruly, and deſperately wild, the very Divel in hell hath the rule of it; it is full of life againſt God and his Commandments, and will never yield while the world ſtands, till now the Lord comes with his Law, and ſhews a man, that he is a dead man, and a damned man, and ſhews him that he is under the wrath of God; the Law is able to do this, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. <hi>The Law cauſeth wrath,</hi> It makes a man appear to lye under the wrath of God, under Gods ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting diſpleaſure, and in the mouth of hell and damnation; and if God be not merciful to him, and more merciful then to a world of men, he ſeeth he is a dead man, utterly loſt, and undone for ever; now this will make his ſpirit yield, and make his heart begin to come in; as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks concerning Princes, <hi>He ſhall cut off the ſpirit of Princes, he is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the Kings of the earth, Pſal.</hi> 76.12. Kings and Princes have ſtout ſpirits; now when the Lord ſends but a little terrour into their hearts, he is able to ſnib their ſpirits, for all their ſecurity, and for all the height of their magnanimity; he is able to cut off all, by ſending his terrour into their hearts, ſo the Law ſends terrour into the heart. Can there be a greater terrour then to have the Law denounce a man to be a dead man? and that the wrath of God is gone out againſt him? and that he lyeth in the very mouth of all the Canons of the fury of the moſt High? This will break the heart of a man, if his heart were made of braſſe, this would break it. Look as it was with the <hi>Moabites,</hi> 2 Sam. 8.2. They were ſtout againſt <hi>David,</hi> and would not yield and ſubmit unto him; but when <hi>David ſmote them, and meaſured them with a cord, and caſt them down to the ground; when he meaſured them with two cords to put them to death, and with one full cord to keep them alive; then</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites became Davids ſervants, and brought him gifts.</hi> So it is with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane creature, whileſt God lets him go on, he is ſtout, and will not ſerve God, but his will is altogether croſſe, and contrary to Gods will and Commandments; he will not take up thoſe courſes that God commands, he will not ſubmit himſelf to the preciſeneſſe of the Goſpel, his will is infinitely croſſe in this kind, and marvellous obſtinate. But if the Lord takes him in hand, and charges his Law upon his conſcience, he puts ſuch terrours into his heart, that he is willing to ſubmit unto God upon any terms. I confeſſe the Law cannot do this of it ſelf; it cannot thus bring down the will of a man, and mortifie a mans ſins: For if the damned in hell were let looſe again, to live here upon earth, they would forget all their former Plagues, and Torments, and ſin would revive again in them. The Law of it ſelf, can only lay ſinne in a ſwound, it will up again if it be looſe: the law cannot do this of it ſelf; but I ſpeak now of the Law, as it is <hi>Gods Inſtrument.</hi> Hereby he pulls down the heart of a man, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94114:137"/>
pulls down his Spirit; labour will pull down any mans ſpirit: when a man is in labour, and pain, and affliction, it will make a mans ſtomack come down; as we may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.11, 12. <hi>Becauſe they rebelled againſt the words of the Lord; therefore he humbled their heart with labour and heavineſs; then they fell down, but there was no helper</hi>: Before they were ſtout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, and would not hearken unto him, and obey his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; now the Lord brought down their heart. But how did he bring them down? he pulled them down by laying labours upon them; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and torment, and heavyneſſe pulled down their hearts. So when the Law makes the heart labour under the wrath of God, it lies labouring, and quaking, and ſhaking, and weltring, and bleeding under the wrath of God; this pulls down the will. And now I come to ſpeak of the <hi>Effects</hi> it works, in doing of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Firſt Effect</hi> is this, It caſts the heart into thoſe <hi>woful privations</hi> we read of; there are abundance of comfortable things, which the man which is alive in his own conceit, thinks himſelf to have. Now when the Law comes to deaden him, it knocks him off from all thoſe comfortable things he ſeemed to have; whereas he ſeemed to have ſome admittance to God in prayer, he could pray to him before, but now he ſees he is an out-caſt, and dares not lift up his eyes to heaven: Before he hoped that God would have mercy on him, and that he had ſome intereſt in Chriſt, and hope of ſalvation; but now he ſeeth he is loſt: Before he ſeemed to have liberty, and freedom; he could do this, and that, and had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand evaſions; but now he ſeeth himſelf a meer captive: before he thought he had ſome riches, ſome goodneſſe; but now he ſeeth he is but a poor begger: before he had ſome Fig-leaves to cover him, but now he ſeeth he is altogether naked: before he was heart-whole, and ſound, he had peace, and comfort, and quietneſſe within him, but now he is altogether broken. This is the effect of this deadneſſe, it brings all theſe <hi>privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> into the ſoul; death is a privation it ſelf, and it brings an hundred pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations with it; even a privation of all the priviledges of the living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this the Law doth when it comes. All this while the Soul is loſt, and captived, and poor, and blind, and miſerable, and naked, and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt; it is utterly undone, and altogether unable to help it ſelf; and this as it doth make a man an Object of the Goſpel, one for whom Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it points out ſuch a man; ſo there is a Finger of the Goſpel in it alſo, when the ſoul underſtands the goodneſſe of the Goſpel, and ſees it ſelf to be loſt for want thereof; yet notwithſtanding the firſt ſtroke is given by the Law, the firſt ſtroke that caſts the Soul into this privation is done by the Law, and if the Lord means to convert, there the Goſpel begins, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath annointed me, that I ſhould preach the Goſpel to the poor; he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the Captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind, that I ſhould ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed.</hi> When the Law hath humbled a man, and thus brought down his will, then begins the work of the Goſpel. As we uſe to ſay of Natural Philoſophy; where Natural Philoſophy ends, there Phyſick begins; So where the Law ends, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel begins. Thus we ſee the firſt Effect of this deadneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the Law hath done this, when the deadneſſe the Law hath wrought, hath produced this Effect; then the next Effect is this, the <hi>Law holds the heart there</hi>: when a man is dead, the effect of death is to hold a man there. There is no redreſſe, no return, without the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of God: there is no return to his former life. So when the Law hath deaded a man, it holds a man there, though a man would
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94114:137"/>
never ſo fain get out, he cannot; he will be ſnatching at a Chriſt, and looking at the promiſes, and be preſuming that there is mercy for him; he would fain be brisk again. But if the Law hath killed him, and made him a dead man, he cannot get out. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are delivered from the Law, being dead unto that wherein we were holden. St. Paul</hi> could not get out to his livelyneſſe again, but the Law held him. So it is with the Law, when the Law of God hath humbled a man, and made him a dead man, it holds him there; let the Divel come with all the comforts he can, there is no evaſion; let his vain neighbors bring what Scriptures they can to cheer him, there is nothing can lift that ſoul up: let all profits and pleaſures come, they cannot take off his heart, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make him alive again, unleſſe it pleaſe the Lord to quicken and revive him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next <hi>Effect</hi> of this deadneſſe is, that it makes the heart <hi>ſtiff</hi>: when the body is dead, all the members are ſtiff, the beatings of the pulſes ceaſe, and all are ſtiff. So when a man is killed by the Law, it makes his head ſtiff, it breaks off all his arguing, and reaſoning, and diſputing againſt the Law of God; That is againſt my profit, and that is againſt my pleaſure, and that is againſt my credit; thus the heart is full of life end activity before. But when the Law comes, and ſhews him he is a dead man: now he is not able to ſtir, now he can ſay, what if it be againſt my profit, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? what if it be againſt my credit? what if men make a mock at me? I am a <hi>dead man</hi> if I live not in this courſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.12. There ſaith the Text, <hi>They are fallen that work iniquity, they are caſt down and ſhall not be able to riſe.</hi> So when the Law of God comes, and preacheth righteouſneſſe to a man, and ſhews him againſt whom he hath ſinned, it makes him a dead man, he cannot ſtir any more; if the Divel bids him reaſon for his luſts, he dares not do it; if his old company perſwade him to his former life and converſation, he dares not do it. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41.21. <hi>Stand to your cauſe ſaith the Lord, bring forth your ſtrong reaſons, ſaith the God of Jacob.</hi> You could be reaſoning, and pleading for your luſts, let us now hear your ſtrong reaſons, and arguments. Now this man is a dead man, and a damned man; he hath no reaſon, no plea to alledge, to go on in his former courſe, this man is killed now.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This deadneſſe makes the <hi>heart yield</hi>; before the Law comes, the heart is marvellous obſtinate, but now when the ſtiffneſſe of it is gone, and the Law hath made him a dead man, now he will yield, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.8. As <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſpeaks; <hi>Be not now ſtiff-necked as your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thars, but give the hand to the Lord, and come into his Sanctuary.</hi> So when the Lord hath broken the neck of a mans ſtiffneſſe, and hath broken his back-bone, that he cannot ſtand ſtiffly out, and hath taken away his livelyneſſe, which was his whale-bone as it were, to uphold him in his ſtrength, and courage, and in his ſins. Now his heart is made to yield to God, he cannot now but yield to the Lord. Thus it is with a poor creature, when the law works upon him, he cannot ſtand out any longer: It is moſt true, before the Lord converts a man, he doth take away his ſtiffneſſe, and make a man a dead man. But you will ſay, <hi>when a man is dead, all his joynts are ſtiff,</hi> his body is cold, and grows ſtiff; but when a man is alive, his joynts are lithe and lively. I Anſwer, It is true, the law of God cannot take away a mans <hi>natural</hi> ſtiffneſſe, but his <hi>voluntary</hi> ſtiffneſs is taken away. The voluntary ſtiffneſſe is taken away when he is dead; when a man was alive, he could ſhut his hand, and hold it ſo; he could ſtretch out his arm, and hold it ſo: but when a man is dead, he cannot do ſo. So it is in this caſe, although the ſtiffneſſe of nature remain ſtill; yet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94114:138"/>
the voluntary ſtiffneſſe is taken away; the will and heart of a man is out of life; It cannot be ſtiff towards God. I confeſſe, the Lord doth not take a way all ſtiffneſſe, no not out of his Saints; but he takes ſo much ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe out of the heart, as to make it a <hi>patient,</hi> he ſhall not be voluntarily ſtiff, he ſhall not be <hi>overcomingly</hi> reſiſting.

               <p>The Uſe of the Points is this, Is it ſo that the law of God doth make a man a dead man? Then here we may obſerve the <hi>wonderful power of the law</hi>; a man hath ſo much livelineſſe in him, ſo much life and activity, and ſo many ſtrong conceits, that it is wonderful hard to make him dead; therefore the <hi>word of God is mighty.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Apolle,</hi> that <hi>he did migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily convince the Jewes, Act.</hi> 18.28. for he was mighty in the Scriptures; there had need be might in the Scriptures to do this.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94114:138"/>
And as the Philoſopher ſaith, That Privation is one of the Principles of Nature: Every body (ſaith he) hath Three Principles, Matter, Form, and Privation: No natural thing can have this or that From put into it, but it muſt be deprived of all other Forms, as if fire be turned into air; firſt the form of fire muſt be taken away, before it can be turned into air, ſo it is in Grace, Privation is one of the Principles of Religion; before the life of Chriſt can be brought into a man, there muſt firſt be a Privation of all other contrary lives: the life of the fleſh, that curſed livelineſſe of the fleſh, the life of ſin, and the life of the world, whereby a man lives unto the world, and the things of the world. A man muſt be deprived of all other lives, of all other forms, he muſt have a Privation of all other forms, before the life of Chriſt can be formed in him. As for example, Take a man that is worldly wiſe put him upon civil Affairs, he is wiſe enough to order all his buſineſſe; in eating, and drinking, he is wiſe enough not to diſtemper him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wiſe enough to keep a good diet: Put him upon matters of Religion, he is wiſe there too, he will not be ſo preciſe as ſome are, that are more nice then wiſe; he will be moderate, and wiſe in the Service of God: Tell him, that he is one that doth not pleaſe God, that he walks to hell-ward, that he hath no care of his Salvation; he thinks that he is wiſer then ſo. Would you make this man a wiſe man indeed? you can never make him truly a wiſe man, till you bring a Privation upon him, till he be firſt depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all that worldly wiſdom that is in him; <hi>If any man among you ſeem to be wiſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>let him become a fool that he may be wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.18. Let him have firſt a Privation of all the ſeeming wiſdom he hath, of all the wiſdom of the fleſh and carnal reaſon; he muſt firſt be a fool, or elſe true wiſdom is not able to enter into him: So if a man would be high, he muſt firſt be humbled, and brought low, before he can be truly high; a man muſt be naked, before he can be cloathed; a man muſt be loſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be found; there are none of you that live in your ſins, but you muſt be ſtripped of all the forms that are in you; there muſt be a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come into you, before true Grace can be formed in you. Privation is one of the Principles of Religion, and unleſſe you be deprived of all other forms, you cannot have the eſſential form of Religion come into you; it is <hi>the poor that receive the Goſpel</hi>: when a man is deprived of all other forms, then is he fit to receive the forme of the Goſpel. When a man is deprived of his own wiſdom, he may then receive the wiſdom of the Goſpel; when a man is deprived of his own ſelf-confidence, of his own ſtrength, and ſufficiency, then he may receive the ſtrength of the Goſpel: when a man is deprived of all other contrary livelineſſe, and contrary forms that are oppoſite to all theſe, when a man is deprived of all theſe, he is capable of the true life of Chriſt, and the Goſpel. I will Inſtance onely in one thing which I named before, and that is poverty: a man can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, or any impreſſion of the true form of Chriſtianity, till firſt his Heart be emptied, and his Will and his Mind be emptied, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be emptied, till all other forms be voided out, and he begins to be made poor and nothing in himſelf, till every room in the ſoule be naked, and empty, there is never a room for the kingdome of God to come into the ſoule; the kingdom of God is a great thing, and will take up a great deal of room where it comes, therefore the Heart, and the Mind, and the Will, and the Affections muſt be emptied: the ſoul muſt be rid and void of all other things, or elſe there is no room for the Kingdom of God. As our Saviour ſaith <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for they ſhall receive the Kingdome of God</hi>: Then there is room for the Kingdom of God, when the heart is made poor, and all is voided out, the world, and the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94114:139"/>
fleſh, and all cranal delights, and pleaſures, and all ſelf-conceitedneſſe, which the heart was full of. When it was full of the world, there was no room for Gods Kingdome; but when a man is made poor in ſpirit, when he hath a Privation of thoſe things wherewith his ſoule was filled; now there is room for the Kingdom of God; the reaſon is, becauſe a man can never be brought to Chriſt, till he is pinched with theſe Privations; before he can never come to Chriſt, his heart can never be brought to bid ſo much, and ſtake down ſo much for Chriſt, as he muſt do, if ever he come to attain him; unleſſe his heart be pinched with poverty, unleſſe his heart be void of all theſe high imaginations he had of himſelf, he will never come to Chriſt. It is plenty that brings down the market, and ſcarcity that makes it riſe: plentiful years, will make Corn of no price almoſt; but if there be famine, and ſcarcity, and no bread almoſt to be had, but men are ready to dye for hunger, then they wil give any thing, they will give ten ſhillings a buſhel, twenty, nay fourty ſhillings hath been given for a buſhel of Corn, as I have read in Chronicles; it is poverty that makes men come to a price. So muſt the heart be pinched with Spiritual poverty, elſe it will not come to Chriſt; men will give nothing for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, they will not part with a ſingle groat for Chriſt; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Gallant will not part with a look for Chriſt; the proud vain fool, will not part with a fooliſh lace, a fooliſh faſhion for Chriſt; the drunkard will not foregoe a pot for Chriſt, men will not part with any thing for Chriſt; they will not part with a paultry luſt, or baſe affection for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hriſt; People will not ſtir, they will not open their purſes, they will not open their hearts to give any thing for Chriſt; the reaſon is, their hearts are full already. People count their profits, and pleaſures, and luſts, and vanities, and delights, their Jewels, a man muſt be poor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will part with his Jewels; but if a man be throughly pinched with poverty, he will part with his old Gold; and Rings, and Jewels, and all; but he will never part with his Jewels, till he be forced to it by extremity. So all the luſts of the heart, all the things of the world, that the mind and affections run upon, men account them their Jewels, and they will not part with them, till they be pinched with poverty. Thus it was with the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30. when he was pinched with this poverty, he cryes out, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> when his heart was pinched with this poverty, he was content to part with any thing, he was willing to do any thing, to hearken to any terms that he might have mercy: So that it is neceſſary for a man to have all theſe Privations wrought in his heart, and be made poor, elſe he will never take Chriſt upon thoſe terms whereupon he is offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſe a man ſhould conceive worth to be in Chriſt, ſuppoſe he ſhould put a great price upon him, yet if a man be not under theſe Privations, if he be not pinched with poverty, with Spiritual need and want; he will never uſe all means for the attaining of the Kingdom of God. He will never betake himſelf to all thoſe courſes that God hath commanded himſelfe to be ſought in. It was need that made <hi>Ahab</hi> ſend up and down all Countries, and Soiles for water; it was need that made the rich Women of <hi>Shunem</hi> to hazard her life, and her family, and houſhold in a forraign Country; ſhe would not have gone a mile of that Journey, but for her poverty, as Divines uſe to ſpeak. Let two men go to the market, the one hath need, the other hath not; he that hath need will go whatſoever the weather be, though the weather be never ſo foul, he will go; bread he wants, and bread he muſt have, and bread he will have; and if he cannot have it at an eaſie rate, he will part with any
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94114:139"/>
thing; he will pawn his very cloaths from his back for it. Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he, and his Wife, and his Children want it. But the other he will go according as he likes the weather, if the weather be anſwerable to his mind, it may be he will go, and it may be not; and when he is there, it may be he will buy, and it may be not, according as the price goeth, becauſe he hath no need of it. So it is in Grace, let two men be called upon to ſeek out for Grace; one doth not feel any great need, he is not pinched with the want of Faith, and Repentance, and Pardon, and Peace of Conſcience: though he want theſe, yet he is not pinched with the want, his heart is yet full, he is not yet come to this Spiritual poverty. It may be he will come to a Sermon, it may be not; it may be he will part with a Luſt, and it may be not; it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the bargain pleaſeth him, he will never uſe all means, nor take up all courſes that are preſcribed: But a man that is ready to ſtarve for want of Chriſt; as <hi>Siſera</hi> ſaid, Give me drink or elſe I periſh; ſo, give me Chriſt or elſe I periſh: This man will take any courſe, uſe any means, he muſt have Chriſt, and will have him; when he comes to the Word, Chriſt he wants, and Chriſt he will have, and muſt have; all Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and all hearing, are but as Oile to the fire, they do but pinch his Soul ſo much the more, till Chriſt comes; he muſt have Chriſt in his Ordinances, becauſe he is ſenſible of his Spiritual poverty. So that it is he which is loſt that will be found, it is he which is a captive that will be freed, it is he that is blind that muſt have his ſight, and it is he that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that muſt be cloathed; he that lies under theſe woful Privations, he muſt have the form, he looks after it, he cannot be without it. Thus we ſee that Privation is neceſſary for Religion, the true life of Religion can never come into a man, till he be layed under all theſe woful Privations we read of in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>But now here is a Queſtion which will ariſe,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> which thoſe that are godly would be glad to have reſolved, and that is this: Whether theſe Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, makes a man the formal Object of mercy? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was alive once before the Law came, but when the Law came, and was charged upon his Conſcience, it deprived him of his livelyneſſe, and made him a dead man; I <hi>dyed</hi> ſaith he. Now the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is this, Whether is ſuch a man the formal Object of mercy? When the Law hath deprived a man of his conceited riches, and made him a poor man, and hath proclaimed him a bank-rupt, and a begger, and made him a captive, that he is not able to ſtir one foot, he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo much as to think a good thought; but he lyeth under wrath, and is not able to get out: Whether is ſuch a man the formal Object of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? I mean, whether is he ſuch a one, as the Goſpel hath promiſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance unto? When a man by the Law is made a dead Creature, and is altogether deprived of life and health; he hath no life actually, and there is no life actually to be had for him, (for ſo the law leaves him without any hope of getting any life.) Whether is this man the formal Object of mercy? whether is he ſuch a one as the Goſpel doth make promiſe to of quickning, and enriching, and gathering, and finding, and ſaving, and comforting, and the like? whether is this man the formal Object of mercy? Every man is the Object of mercy, but whether hath this man got thoſe properties that belong to the actual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of mercy?</p>
               <p>The reaſon why I propound this Queſtion, is this, Becauſe the Scripture ſeems to make ſuch a one the formal Object of mercy, ſuch a one as mercy is promiſed to, ſuch a one as the Goſpel looks upon, as the proper and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94114:140"/>
actual Object of mercy; for the Goſpel is ſaid to quicken the dead, and to give them life; it is the <hi>Letter that killeth, and the Spirit that giveth life,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. It giveth life to him that was before a dead man, to him that was killed by the letter. So for poverty; <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. <hi>To the poor the Goſpel is preached, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor, he hath ſent me that I ſhould heal the broken hearted, and preach deliverance to the Captives, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of ſight to the blind</hi>: So that when the Law hath made a man a poor man, and hath ſtripped him of all his conceited riches, and hath made him a begger, it ſeems that Chriſt is anointed to preach mercy to ſuch a one; it ſeems that ſuch a one is the formal Object of the Goſpel. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.2. <hi>He gathers the out-caſts of Iſrael</hi>: when the Law hath made a man an out-caſt, it ſeems he is the formal Object of mercy: The Goſpel undertakes to gather ſuch people ſo far loſt. <hi>The Son of man is come to ſave that which is loſt, Mat.</hi> 18.11. he is come for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it is his Commiſſion, he is ſent to ſave that which is loſt; when the Law hath made a man to be a loſt man, that he ſeeth he is utterly undone without mercy; Chriſt is come to ſave ſuch people, and to look upon them as the formal Object of mercy.</p>
               <p>So for death it ſelf, when a man is made dead by the Law; <hi>The houre ſhall come</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>and now is, that the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that do hear it ſhall live, Joh.</hi> 5.25. It ſeems that the Scripture makes ſuch as are made dead by the Law; and poor, and blind, and naked, and wretched, and miſerable, by reaſon of the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed upon them, and pulling them down with terrour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; it ſeems ſuch a one is the formal Object of mercy, ſuch a one to whom mercy is promiſed. I do not mean that he is the formal Object of the invitations of the Goſpel, that is moſt certain, there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of that, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary, and heavy laden, and you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls.</hi> Come unto me, all you that are poor, and blind, and naked, and dead, and I will give you life; have you a hard heart, that you cannot free your ſelves from, come unto me, and I will free you from it? have you no power to repent and believe? come unto me, and take mercy upon my terms, and believe in me; whatſoever weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is in you, I will ſtrengthen you; whatever diſcomforts and wants lye upon you, I will relieve and chear you. This is certain, the more a man ſeeth himſelf a dead man, the more he is the formal Object of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Goſpel. But the Queſtion is, Whether he is the formal Object of the promiſes of the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>I Anſwer, No; There is a great deal of difference between legal Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and theſe Privations as they are Evangelical, as the Goſpel makes them before it quickens a man: there is a great deal of difference between a man that is dead, and poor, and blind, and naked, and miſerable by reaſon of the Law; and a man that hath theſe privations wrought in him by the power of the Goſpel: when a man is made dead by the Law, and ſees himſelf a loſt creature by reaſon that the Law plainly ſhews him his eſtate and condition, this man may be a Reprobate for all this, and go to hell; there is no promiſe in the Word that God will quicken him, and raiſe him up, Chriſt is free from any promiſe in this kind, he may quicken him if he will, and not quicken him if he pleaſe. I may ſay in this ſenſe, as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. <hi>The Son of man quickens whom he will</hi>; He is free to quicken whom he will, though a man be made a dead man by the Law, and cry out he is a dead man, and a damned man, though he hath the works of the Law, and be terrified, and gaſtered, and humbled by the Law,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94114:140"/>
yet Chriſt is free from any promiſe he hath made to theſe people; there is never a Promiſe in all the Word, that Chriſt hath bound himſelf by to theſe people to quicken them: they cannot ſay there is ſuch a Promiſe in the Word that Chriſt ſhall quicken them. There are plain places in the Scripture, wherein the Lord invites ſuch people, upon condition they will come and believe, and ſubmit to the Goſpel; there is a conditional invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon theſe terms: But that theſe People ſhall be quickned, and ſhall have eternal Life given them, there in no ſuch Promiſe; the Lord is free, the Lord hath not bound himſelf to it; but when a man is dead according as the Goſpel makes a man dead before it quickens him, and when a man is poor according as the Goſpel makes him poor, and when a man is blind ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Goſpel makes him blind, now a man is within the compaſſe of Gods Promiſes, he is one that is the formal Object of Mercy, he is one that ſhall have Mercy, and ſhall have Salvation, and Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt; theſe dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and ſhall live; the tongue of theſe ſtammerers ſhall ſpeak plain, the eyes of theſe blind ſhall ſee, theſe out-caſts ſhall be gathered, theſe naked ſhall be cloathed, theſe loſt ſhall be found, theſe poor ſhall be enriched; when a man is dead, ſo as the Goſpel deads a man, before it quickens a man (for the Lord damns a man before he ſaves a man, and kills a man before he quickens him) like a good Surgeon, that cuts before he cures; or like a good Phyſician, that kills a man almoſt with Phyſick, ſo the Lord doth bring a man to deaths door before he quickens him; it is the Goſpel that truly humbles him, and works theſe Privations; and now he is within the compaſſe of the Promiſe: now he hath a Promiſe that he ſhall be quickned, and have ſupply in regard of all theſe Privations; but ſo long as theſe Privations are only legal, he hath no Promiſe that he ſhall be quickned, for many are humbled and made dead as it were by the Law, and yet ſhake it off again, and go to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and pleaſures, and delights, and hardneſſe of heart again; many a man hath been gaſtered by the Law, and cryed out of his damned eſtate and condition, and yet hath got up again, and recovered himſelf by the world and the things of the world; and it was ever ſo of old, as we may ſee in <hi>Cain,</hi> the Law had diſcovered him to himſelf to be a dead man, and a damned man: <hi>I ſee my ſins are greater then can be forgiven,</hi> or are forgiven, or ſhall be forgiven: he ſaw his puniſhment was intolerable, his condemnation was more then he was able to bear; <hi>From thy preſence am I caſt out, and a Vagabond ſhall I be upon the face of the earth,</hi> Gen. 4.14. Yet he was not the formal Object of Mercy; the Goſpel did not quicken him, nor convert him: he was not the formal Object of Mercy, for he ſhook off theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours again, as we may ſee in the very ſame Chapter, and went to building of Cities, and inventing of Muſick, and other Arts and Sciences; and this quickned, and revived him again: but he never came to true Life. So it is with many men, though they be terrified, and gaſtered, and humbled, and caſt down by the Law, yet they get up again, and run after the world, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecurity, and hardneſſe of heart again; ſo that ſuch a man is not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Object of Mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, We ſee many, though they be wrought upon thus by the Law, and their Eyes be enlightned, and their Conſciences awaked, and they ſee that they are in a wretched and damned eſtate; yet they ſcrape to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a company of vain hopes, and ſo heal themſelves again. VVhen they have been terrified by the Law, they ſeek preſently for Promiſes, and how they may get up again, and they would fain get up; and they lye at catch at every Sermon, and at every Chapter, and at every Word which a good man ſpeaks, and if they can get any hold, they catch at it; and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94114:141"/>
ſo get up again and go on: And when they have got a little comfort, and think they ſhall do well, they are as careleſſe, and as ſtubborn, and as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure as ever they were; they may go on in the profeſſion of Religion, but yet their latter end is worſe than their beginning: The unclean Divel may be caſt out, but the Devil transforms himſelf into an angel of light, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into them, and they go on in doing good duties, but they never have the power of Religion.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Many that are humbled by the Law, they run away, and never come to Chriſt, as <hi>Judas</hi> when he ſaw he was condemned, he went and hanged himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27 3, 5. Some expound it of Chriſt, when he ſaw Chriſt was condemned; but others expound it of himſelf, when <hi>Judas</hi> ſaw himſelf was condemned, and that ſeems to be the meaning of the place; for Chriſt was not condemned, nor ſo much as accuſed; there came not any witneſſe againſt him, till <hi>Judas</hi> had hanged himſelf, as we may ſee if we read that Chapter. But whether that be the meaning or no, this is true and certain, he ſaw he was a dead m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, he ſaw he lay under the guilt of his ſins, and he deſpaired of Mercy, and went and hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If ſuch a man were the Object of Mercy, then all the damned in Hell were the formal Objects of Mercy; for there is never a man in Hell, but the Law hath its work to the uttermoſt upon him; it can work a man no lower, it can ſink a man no deeper, it can make a man no more miſerable, then thoſe that are in Hell. Now if a dead man by the Law ſhould be the formal Object of mercy, then the damned in Hell ſhould be the formal Object of mercy, which cannot be; for from thence there is no Redemption, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Divel and his angels,</hi> Matth. 25. there is no quenching of that fire. So that we ſee, the legal killing of the Law, doth not make a man the formal Object of mercy. But yet ſuch a man hath a great deal of advantage, he is before a world of other men, that live ſecure; if men were in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, they were in a thouſand times more likelyhood to be ſaved. If I could hear of people that were gaſtered, and caſt down by the Law; that ſaw themſelves without Chriſt, and without Mercy, in the power of Satan, and in the bond of iniquity; if they cryed out, I am a dead man, and a damned man, if I dye now at this preſent I ſhall go to Hell, if People were in this eſtate and condition, there were more hopes of them a thouſand times: there is no hope of people that do live ſecure in their ſins; ſo long as the Trumpet of the Law hath not ſounded in their ears, ſo long as the Hammer of the Law hath not ſounded upon their hearts, there is no hope of mercy for them. Therefore now for the clearing of this a little more, let me ſhew you,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What it is to be dead, according as the Goſpel makes a man to be a dead man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is the difference between Legal Privation, and Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and when theſe Privations are Evangelical, and put a man under the actual title to Mercy, under an actual intereſt in the Promiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> VVhat Uſe we are to make of it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> VVhat it is to be Evangelically dead: To be Legally dead, is not to be half a quarter ſo much dead, as to be Evangelically dead, ſo as the Goſpel makes a man dead before it quickens him. VVhen a man is Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally dead, it makes him more dead by a thouſand degrees, then all the Law in the world can make him, it makes him more dead by odds; when a man is Legally dead, and ſees himſelf to be a damned creature, and whereas he hoped to have mercy, he ſeeth now he hath none; and whereas he hoped
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94114:141"/>
to go to Heaven, he now ſeeth the Gates are ſhut againſt him; and whereas he hoped he had ſome good in him, now he ſees he hath nothing in him: a man would think this were a dead man, but his livelineſſe is only in a ſwound, the Law lying upon him, will not let his livelineſſe appear; and if the Law ſhould lye upon him for ever, it would never let his livelineſſe actually appear; but yet he is not throughly dead all this while: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Self-conceitedneſſe, it is not deaded when a man is killed by the Law: you would think his conceitedneſſe were gone: he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited he was a good Chriſtian; but now he ſees no ſuch matter: he was conceited before, that he would repent, and God would be merciful to him; but now he ſeeth, he is utterly deprived of mercy, and lies under the wrath of God: you would think now that all his conceitedneſs was gone; but it is but only in a ſwound all this while, he lies for dead as it were, but he is not dead. So take a man that is in Hell, all his good conceits of mercy, and of himſelf, and his profits, and pleaſures, and vanities, and delights, they are all gone now. What doth Pride profit me? What good do Riches do me? What have all my Pleaſures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights done me good? All my labour is vanity, and all my delights folly; one would think all his conceits were clean gone; but they are only in a ſwound. If a damned man were out of Hell, if the Lord ſhould take off the laſh of his Law from him, he would have as good a conceit of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and Pleaſures, and Riches again, as ever he had; and he would have his carnal Reaſons againſt the ſtrictneſſe of Religion again, as rife as ever he had; they are only laid in a ſwound, indeed there they ſhall lie: a man can never get up again, becauſe the Law lies continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon him, he is continually under the laſh of the Law; and the Law holds this picture before his eyes, and ſhews him his damned eſtate ann condition: but upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, that he might come out of Hell, his conceits would riſe up again. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>Solomon</hi> there brings in a man wrought upon by the Law, the Law diſcovered him to be a dead man. <hi>How have I hated inſtruction, and deſpiſed correction, and have not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined my eare to them that inſtructed me?</hi> His carnal Reaſons are now all gone, they are in a ſwound; they were true Inſtructions that I have hated, they were true Reports that I have deſpiſed, and they were baſe and damned Courſes which I have followed. How have I lived? One would think all his fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits now were gone: they are in a ſwound indeed, and cannot get up. But the Goſpel will give a man his deaths wound; a man can never have that good conceit of himſelf he had before; nor of his luſts, and vanities, and profits, and delights; his ſelf-conceitedneſſe hath now got his deaths wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For ſelf-confidence, when the Law hath humbled a man, his ſelf-confidence is only in a ſwound; when he lyeth in Hell under the laſh of the Law, he ſeemeth to have no power in himſelf, no life, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to any duty. He ſees that he is poor, and weak, and rotten, and wretched. A poor creature he is, he ſeeth it plainly, and all his ſelf-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeems to he gone; but yet there is a great deal of ſelf-confidence actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Hell, for though they are in Hell, yet they think if they were alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what they would do; I would hear the Word, and call upon God; I would repent, and not live in ſin, and not do as I have done; they think they would do thus, and thus, as it was with <hi>Div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> Luke 16.30. <hi>I have five brethren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if one ſhould come to them from the dead, they would repent, and not come where I am.</hi> If they knew but as much as I know,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94114:142"/>
they would repent; I am ſure if they were in my caſe, they would, if they were in hell where I am, if they knew how certain it is, that they ſhall come to hell where I am when they die, unleſſe they do repent at the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Prophets, and hearken to the voice of Gods-Miniſters, and yield and ſubmit to God; they would do it: I would, if it were my caſe. This is ſelf-confidence; for ſelf-confidence is only laid aſleep in Hell, and it cannot riſe again. It is true, the Law may dead a man, and give him three deaths wounds. There are Three Wounds that the Law gives a man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It makes it appear that a man is worthy of death; the Law makes him ſee his guiltineſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Law pronounceth upon a ſinner the ſentence of death, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of a natural death, <hi>I received the ſentence of death,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.9. that is, I was a dead man, I took my ſelf to be a dead man. So the Law doth make a man to be a dead man, it pronounceth the ſentence of death upon him; it doth not only make it appear that he is worthy of death, (for ſo it may do, and yet he may have hope of mercy) but it makes a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſentence of death, and to be a dead man: If a man be once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, if the ſentence of death be paſſed upon him, then he is without hope that the Judge will ſave him, becauſe the ſentence of condemnation is paſſed upon him. A man may ſee himſelf worthy of death, and yet hope for mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. Therefore the Law doth pronounce the ſentence of death upon him, and makes a man in a ſecond degree dead.</p>
               <p>Nay, Thirdly, The law makes a man ſee there is no hope of return; as it is with a dead man, when a man is truly dead, there is no return from death, there is no riſing again: as the Wiſe-man ſpeaks of the ſtrange women, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.18, 19. <hi>Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her paths unto the dead, they that go unto her return not again, neither take they hold of the wayes of life.</hi> Here the Wiſe-man ſets forth the infinite miſery, and damnable eſtate of ſuch a creature, and the irrecoverableneſs of ſuch a perſon, without the extraordinary mercy of God. Ordinarily, ſuch perſons are ſeldom, or never brought to repentance: ordinarily they are irrecoverable. So the Law makes a man ſee he is guilty of death, and it paſſeth the ſentence of condemnation upon him, and it makes him ſee there is no repeal of that ſentence: thus the law leaves him. Now a man would think, Can a man be more dead then thus? How can a man be more dead? Yet he may be a thouſand times more dead; for the livelyneſſe of a man is but in a ſwound all this while: a man cannot be brisk, and peark, and ſelf-conceited, he is now laid in a ſwound, but is not ſtark dead. But when a man comes to be Evangelically dead, he is more dead a great deale. And I will ſhew you it in theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, He is moſt dead that is hardeſt to recover: Now when a man is legally dead, it is eaſie to recover that man; let but the laſh of the law be taken off, let but God let him alone; and the profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world, will make him alive again; his friends, and vanities, and delights, will put life into him again, it is an eaſie matter to recover this man; but let a man be evangelically dead, when the Goſpel hath deaded a man, he is a thouſand times more dead, and a great deal harder to recover, nothing can recover that man but Chriſt; let all the profits in the world come, they cannot chear him without Chriſt; if the devil ſhould come and put into his minde all good conceits, and the good opinion of the world: If the Miniſters ſhould tell him he is in a good eſtate, they cannot quicken his heart, he is dead ſtill, he is harder a thouſand times to be revived then the other, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>Set your
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94114:142"/>
affections on things that be above, not on things that are on earth; for ye are dead, and your life is hid in Chriſt.</hi> The Goſpel hath made you dead, and you cannot be revived by any thing but Chriſt, your life is hid with Chriſt; do not you ſet your affections on things that are below, they can never put life into you, therefore let not them take up your minds and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections any more, for your life is in Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, He is moſt dead that life it ſelf cannot make alive: When a man is but legally dead, the law hath made him a dead man, and killed him, and ſhewed him he is a damned creature; this man, let him have but a little life, or any thought of life come into him, let him have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affections towards God, any ſeeming deſires, it will make him think I am alive: But if the Goſpel once have made a man a dead man, life it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quicken him, Chriſt himſelf cannot make this man a live man in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though life come into him, and though he hath life from God, yet he himſelf is dead. <hi>I am dead through the law,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that I might live unto God</hi>; thus <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and that life I now live in the fleſh, I live by Faith in the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.19, 20. When the Goſpel had made him dead (for that is the meaning of the words) he was not only dead by the law, but by the power of the Goſpel working by the law: Now, ſaith he, though I have life, and Chriſt be come into me, and lives in me, yet I do not live: I live, but not I, but it is Chriſt that liveth in me: I live, yet do not miſtake me, I am a dead man, I have no life, it is Chriſt that liveth in me: when a man is evangelically dead, it makes a man content, that God ſhould keep life in his hand, and keep the purſe in his hand, and all in his hand, it makes him content to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength and ability, and to have nothing in his own hand, but to have all from the Lord; and he ſaith, I am a dead man, and if I ever have comfort, I have none in my ſelf, I muſt go to Chriſt for comfort, and life, and ſtrength, and ability: and ſo for power and activity, and riches, and means, and maintenance, and every thing; it is not my parts and gifts that can help me to them, but I muſt go to Chriſt to fetch them: now it is the deſire of mans heart to have life at home, he cannot abide to have life in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hands: and though the law, and hell it ſelf proclaim a man a dead man, and make a man ſee himſelf a dead man, yet it cannot kill this Principle, a man would have life and ſtrength in his own hand, and ability, and ſufficiency in his own cuſtody; we may ſee this Principle in Gods own Children, though this Principle be begun to be killed, yet it reſts part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Gods children, there is ſtill a ſecret luſt in their hearts, to have life, and grace, and ſtrength in their own keeping; and if any child of God be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in coming to God, it is becauſe of this Principle that remains in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, He is moſt dead that death hath moſt power over: Now when a man is legally dead, and the law hath made him a dead man, though he be a dead man, yet death hath no power over him, his heart is ſtubborn ſtill, and will not look toward Chriſt and the Goſpel, he is ſtill as ſtubborn as ever he was; he will roar and howl, and hear every Sermon, but ſtill he hath a hard heart, the law hath not power to break his heart to powder, and to ſoften his heart: but when a man is evangelically dead, when the Goſpel hath made him dead, as it doth before it quickens a man, it breaks the ſturdineſſe of a mans heart, and ſhatters a man all to pieces; that is the meaning of that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.3. <hi>He healeth thoſe that are broken in hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and bindeth up their ſores:</hi> Now he is thus made a dead man, it makes his heart to burſt under the weight of his ſins, and it beats him to powder: but a man that is onely legally dead, he is heart-whole
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94114:143"/>
ſtill, and his ſpirit is as ſtout againſt the kind working of the Goſpel as ever it was, nay, worſe a great deal; there are none more hardened then thoſe that ſee themſelves dead, damned creatures, by the power of the law, without the power of the Goſpel. But when the Goſpel comes, it breaks the heart to powder, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one, He that inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, and with him who is of an humble and contrite ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to give life to them that are of a contrite heart.</hi> This man is the object of Mercy that is evangelically dead, he is the formal object of mercy: Why? becauſe he is dead with ſuch a kind of death as hath gotten power over him, power to break his heart, to make it an humble and contrite heart: now ſaith the Lord, I will revive ſuch a man. This man is the formal object of mercy, and into him eternal life will come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second thing I promiſed to ſhew you, is the difference between theſe two, between legal and evangelical Privation. Between one that is legally dead, and one that is dead as the Goſpel deads a man before it quickens him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, He that is legally dead lies all along in his death: but when the Goſpel makes a man a dead man, it makes him ſtand up that he might have life, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee life</hi>: He doth not mean, ſtand up from being dead, but ſtand up from the dead, and then Chriſt ſhall give thee life; he means ſuch a ſtanding up from the dead, as before Chriſt gives him life: the Goſpel doth thus far awaken a man, though he be more dead a thouſand times, then he that is dead by the law, yet thus far it quickens him, that he ſtands up from his ſecure eſtate: when the law comes and ſhews a man that he is a dead man, he ſtill lies under his ſins, he is a dead man, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand up that Chriſt may give him life. That is the Firſt thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, He that is legally dead, made dead only by the law, he is deaf to the Goſpel: but when a man is evangelically dead, it boars his ears and makes him hear the voice of the Word, and not only ſo, but the voice of Chriſt in the Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Incline your ears and come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, hear and your ſoul ſhall live</hi>: He calls thoſe that were evangelically dead, Hear, and your ſoul ſhall live; they are made able to hear: Let their profits, and old courſes, and old companions come and tempt them to walk as they have done, they are deaf of that ear, they cannot go that way to work, no, now their ears are open heaven-wards, <hi>ſeek the Lord, and you ſhall live,</hi> Amos 5.6. They are made to ſeek the Lord, thus much life they have: though they are more dead in regard of their own miſery, then one that is dead by the law; yet thus much life they have put into them, that they will go and ſeek unto God in the uſe of the means, and follow him up and down, and nothing will ſatisfy the heart but Chriſt, they leave no ſtone unroled, they ſeek up and down every where.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, He that is legally dead, it is a kind of death to love; but he that is evangelically dead, it is a death of love; when the Church in the Canticles was but ſenſible of the countenance of Chriſt, ſhe was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſick of love, <hi>I charge you, O ye daughters of Jeruſalem, if ye find my welbeloved, tell him that I am ſick of love,</hi> Cant. 5. There is a great deal of difference between ſickneſſe and death, death is a total privation of life; ſickneſſe is but a partial privation: now when the Goſpel hath wrought upon a man that he hath ſome of Chriſt, and is not deprived of all, that privation makes him ſick of love; but when the Goſpel makes a man ſee he is dead, and altogether deprived of Chriſt, now he is dead of love: when
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94114:143"/>
a man is legally dead, this is his death that he is damned, and muſt go to hell; this is his death that he hath no mercy, not that he hath not grace, and holineſs, and Chriſt; but if a man be evangelically dead, this is his death, that he hath not Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Uſe is this, If there be any that the law hath made dead,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</note> reſt not there, but labour that the Goſpel may make you dead alſo; when thou art humbled by the law, thou mayeſt think that mercy is prepared for thee, but thy luſts may recover again, and that damned life that is in thee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover again; therefore labour to be more deaded by the Goſpel, that thou mayeſt have a total death begun in thee, that thou mayeſt have thy deaths wound given thee deep, not only to be in a ſwound, but to be dead indeed. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. Chriſt ſtaid four dayes after <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would raiſe him, becauſe he would have him irrecoverably dead before he would raiſe him: <hi>Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Martha</hi>) <hi>he ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, for he hath been dead four dayes,</hi> verſ. 39. If he had raiſed him ſooner, his glory had not been ſo great: ſo thou muſt labour to be dead in deed, and to be buried, and to be loathſome and abominable, and then Chriſt will quicken thee: It is certain, that Gods Children have ſome of this death wrought in them, before they are quickned at all; for death is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quickning in order of nature: there muſt be a corruption of one thing, before there can be a generation of another; there muſt be a privation of one form, before there can be an introduction of another: A child of God muſt be dead before he can be quickned. Now then, if he will have more life, he muſt labour to be dead more and more: now thou muſt labour to have this death truly begun to be wrought in thee, thou muſt labour to have the love of this world and ſelf-conceitedneſſe altogether dead in thee. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.2. <hi>After two dayes will he revive us, and the third day will he raiſe us up, and we ſhall live in his ſight:</hi> A man may be alive, though he have been ſeemingly dead twenty four hours; therefore it is a good cuſtom among us to keep men near two dayes before we bury them, that we may be ſure they are throughly dead; for there are many have been buried alive: ſo after two dayes he will revive us, and the third day he will raiſe us up: when a man is dead indeed, and hath his livelineſs through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killed in him, then God will revive him; if he ſhould revive him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his glory would not be ſo great, if he ſhould revive him before he were quite dead; when <hi>Ahab</hi> humbled himſelf, and put on ſackcloth,<note place="margin">1 King. 21.</note> and went ſoftly, a man would have thought he had been dead; but in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we may ſee he is alive again. So <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> one would have thought their covetouſneſſe had been dead, (whether they were any of the three thouſand that were pricked at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, I diſpute not; but they were pricked and made ſenſible of their damned eſtate, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to lay down all at the Apoſtles feet, one would have thought their covetouſneſs had been dead) but yet it was alive: therefore labour that the Goſpel may make thee throughly dead.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the verſes going before we have, 1. The charge that the Apoſtle gives to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ſhall judge the quick and the dead.</hi> There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties we are loath to come <hi>unto,</hi> and are tempted <hi>from</hi>; ſo that we have need of all ſtrong cords to draw us to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have the thing he gives him this charge for; and that is, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Preach the Word in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, &amp;c.</hi> which duty ſtrongly lyeth upon the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to hold forth the Word of God, to edifie and convert mens ſouls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here is the reaſon why he gives him this charge, and that is in the third and fourth verſes, <hi>For the time will come, when they will not endure ſound Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> The more danger there is among people, the more inſtant ſhould Miniſters be, to preach the Word unto the conſcience. Now in the verſe I have read unto you, the Apoſtle perſwades <hi>Timothy</hi> to watchfulneſſe; as who ſhould ſay, Though others be careleſs and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, yet I would have thee to be watchful, conſider, thou art a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Every Chriſtian is to watch over his own wayes, and thoſe that are committed to his charge: but Miniſters are watchmen over their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, therefore here is a double reaſon to move him to watchfulneſs; both in regard of his own ſoul, and the people he was ſet over, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.37.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94114:144"/>
our Saviour ſaith, <hi>What I ſay to you, I ſay to all, Watch.</hi> And what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here to <hi>Timothy,</hi> I may ſay to all Chriſtians, Watch in all things.</p>
               <p>For the better handling of this point, I will ſhew you,</p>
               <p>Firſt, What it is to watch.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The things we muſt watch.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What it is to watch.<note place="margin">What it is to watch.</note> And to watch in Scripture is taken two wayes, <hi>Literally,</hi> and <hi>Spiritually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Watching ſometimes is taken Literally,<note place="margin">Literally.</note> and then it ſignifies a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, when the time, or nature calls not for ſleep; for there is a difference between watching, and waking: we are all awake at this time, or elſe ought to be, but yet we cannot be ſaid to watch; but this is to watch, when time or nature calls for ſleep. When a man awaketh all night, or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the night, as <hi>Luke</hi> 2.8. <hi>The Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pherds were watching their flock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> by night</hi>: And this is two fold, either <hi>Ordinary,</hi> or <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ordinary watching is contrary to immoderateneſſe in ſleeping.<note place="margin">Ordinary.</note> As when a man is ſober in eating, and drinking, and other lawful things; ſo we ought to be ſober in our ſleep, for it is a dangerous thing, if we ſuffer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate ſleep to fall upon us.</p>
               <p>Now Extraordinary watching is contrary to ſleep it ſelf,<note place="margin">Extraordinary.</note> as ordinary watching is contrary to ſleepineſſe; for it takes away our natural ſleep, which otherwiſe we are to have. And this is for two reaſons:</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is for a <hi>Civil end,<note place="margin">For a civil end.</note> when we watch with thoſe that are ſick,</hi> as a duty of Charity; it is fit that thoſe that are well, ſhould break their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſleep and reſt, to be helpful to thoſe that are ſick; this is a Civil end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is a <hi>Spiritual end</hi> of extraordinary watching,<note place="margin">For a Spiritual end.</note> and that is, when a man is not only moderate in ſleeping, but abates himſelf of that reſt he may lawfully take, for a Spiritual end. As Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Watch unto prayer,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.7. and the Church, <hi>Lament.</hi> 2.19. watched to humble their ſouls under Gods hand. For ſometimes we have need to break our very natural reſt, for the good of our ſouls. Though we be never ſo careful, and conſcionable in the day time, yet it may ſo fall out, that the day will not be enough, but we muſt entrench upon the night alſo, to ſeek the Lord extraordinarily; but this watching is not here meant, though it be ſometimes required. But a <hi>Spiritual</hi> watching is ſpecially meant,<note place="margin">Spiritually.</note> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Three things in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It doth note a readineſſe of minde to be drowzy;<note place="margin">It implies proneneſs to be drowzy.</note> for as in natural and literal watching, it doth note a natural proneneſs to be drowzy, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the darkneſſe of the night, or the heat of the weather, or the like; ſo this ſpiritual watching ſignifieth unto us, that we are naturally ſubject to be ſecure ſpiritually, and vain, and idle, and negligent, and have need to be rouzed up: for indeed all Commandments ſince the Fall, are ſuch as do not agree with our nature; as when he commands us to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, that intimates, that we are by nature apt to put it off, and to be careleſs of making our peace with God; and when the Lord ſaith, <hi>pray alwayes,</hi> it doth imply, how backward we are to that duty, how apt to neglect it, or to ſhuffle it over, and to be luke-warm in it: before the Fall when God did bid man do any thing, the bidding of him did imply, that if he were not careful, he was in a poſſibility of breaking the commandments; it did not argue a proneneſs to break them: but ſince the Fall, the commandements of God, whatſoever God hath commanded us to do, either for matter or manner of it, it implyeth, how backward to, and untoward we are in doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:94114:145"/>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> Watchfulneſſe doth imply a labour and endeavour in our ſelves,<note place="margin">Endeavour to ſtir up our ſelves.</note> to take off this ſinful proneneſſe to evil that is in us, and to be ſeriouſly ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, to look after our Duty, whatſoever it is, both towards God, and towards man, we ought to ſhake off all untowardneſſe of Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are unfit to Watch; Watchfulneſſe implyeth this alſo, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead</hi>: as who ſhould ſay, Shake off thy drowzineſſe, and labour to break off this folly of heart, whereby thou goeſt dreaming on, and rouze up thy ſpirit, and ſtand upon thy guard.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">It is an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in all Caſes.</note>The <hi>Third</hi> and main thing: This Watchfulneſs doth include ſome further buſineſſe or duty to be done that is not yet performed; for watchfulneſs is an act to help forward ſome further act: As for example, We are bound to remember God in all our wayes; the want of this, is the reaſon we ſo often ſin againſt God; now if we did remember God, if we did remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Holineſſe, if we did remember the greatneſſe of his Power, and the ſtrictneſſe of his Juſtice againſt Sin, if we did remember our Death, and what account we are to make before him, this would be a great help to keep us from ſin; now if we would remember this, a ſpecial way to help us, is to watch, as <hi>Acts</hi> 20.31. <hi>Watch and remember,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; he being deſirous that they ſhould remember the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions which he had propounded, he layes down this as a ſpecial means to help them hereunto, <hi>to watch</hi>: So we are to be watchful, that we may be ſober in eating and drinking, and all lawful things; for how ſudduly do diſtempers break in upon us, unleſſe a man look to himſelf? now watchfulneſſe is an excellent help to Sobriety, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Let us watch and be ſober</hi>: We had need to watch whatſoever we go about, that we may be ſober in it; whatſoever wordly buſineſſe we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in our Callings, we had need to have this watchfulneſſe, that we be not overwhelmed, and over head and ears in the world, that we way not be intemperate in our eating and drinking, that we may not give our ſelves too much liberty and freedom in talking and diſcourſing of the things here below; ſo we are bound to keep our garments, that our nakedneſſe may not be ſeen, that the ſins that are up and down in the world do not defile them, that the temptations, and allurements, and occaſions we meet withal, and the examples of the times, and ſuch like, do not take away our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from us: now watchfulneſſe is an help hereunto, as we may ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15. the text ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments</hi>: So that watchfulneſſe is an excellent help for a further act to be done: when a man hath ſome duty or other to be done, which the Lord requires ſhould be done with care and diligence, watchfulneſſe is a help thereunto, as <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.1. the Prophet knowing there was ſome Prophecy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them, the Prophet laboured to be in a fit caſe to receive it; and that he might ſo be, <hi>I will watch</hi> ſaith he: in a word, watchfulneſſe, is an intentive conſiderateneſſe of the heart, when a man doth conſider how he is to do every thing, leſt he be ſurpriſed either by Satan, or the world, or by his own ſubtil fleſh; when a man is conſiderative, and takes heed to himſelf, to his thoughts, and his words, and all his actions, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Take heed, Watch, and Pray,</hi> Mark. 13.33. When he would deſcribe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, what it is, he ſets another phraſe by it to open it to us, <hi>Take heed, watch and pray.</hi> There is a kind of heedleſſeneſſe that is apt cleave to the heart, whereby the heart is careleſſe what ſnares are before it: now watchfulneſſe doth take off this, and maketh a man to take more heed in whatſoever he doth, ſo that there can be no opportunity of doing good, but he takes it; no good motion is ſuggeſted, but he lyeth at catch to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

                     </gap>h me, watching daily at my gates</hi>: here you may ſee watchfulneſs is expreſſed, when a man comes into the preſence of Chriſt, waiting to hear whatſoever ſhall come from Chriſt, and there is nothing that drops from the Miniſter that concerns him, but he is ready to receive it; when a man waits to be ready to obey whatſoever commandment the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and to take heed to avoid whatſoever the Lord forbids. This is watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>ſecond thing</hi> is, <hi>what we muſt watch?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What we muſt watch.</note> I Anſwer, We muſt watch our ſelves, and all the duties of Religion, and time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt we muſt watch over our ſelves.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our Selves.</note> 
                  <hi>Ponder thy pathes,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.26. as who ſhould ſay, Look to thy ſelf; take heed to every ſtep that it be ordered aright: How ſoon may a man be turned out of the way? How ſoon was <hi>David carried</hi> away into thoſe two great ſins of Murther and Adultery? How ſoon was <hi>Peter</hi> put beſides his Reſolution in the high Prieſts Hall, for want of watchfulneſs? If he had watched and remembred our Saviours <hi>item,</hi> he had never denied his Maſter: A man is marvellous ready to be carried away, therefore we muſt watch our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Firſt, And in particular we muſt watch our <hi>own thoughts</hi>:<note place="margin">Our thoughts.</note> naturally all our thoughts are idle and unprofitable, our minds are apt to ſpend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon that which will do us no good: we had need therefore to watch over our thoughts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Beware</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>that there be not an evil thought in thy heart:</hi> Take heed that vain thoughts come not into thy mind, idle thoughts, or wordly thoughts will dead us, and dull us to the ſervice of God, and poyſon the heart, and no good thing can dwell in us, if we do not look unto our thoughts: the eyes of the Lord are upon our thoughts, therefore watch over thy thoughts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We ſhould watch over the Heart it ſelf</hi>:<note place="margin">Heart.</note> The <hi>heart</hi> is the very ſpring, there be the very iſſues of Life and Death, the actions flow from thence; therefore, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Keep thy heart with all keeping</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as who ſhould ſay, Thy heart is deceitful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, it will make thee believe thou art going to heaven, when it leads thee to hell; if thou be never ſo well affected for a time, this heart will fly off, it is naturally ſo naught and reprobate to what is good; <hi>Therefore keep thy heart with all diligence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Watch over thy Words</hi>:<note place="margin">Words.</note> Pſal. 141.3. <hi>Set a watch, O Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the door of my lips.</hi> We muſt watch our lips, and have a care that our words be agreeable to Gods Word, and ſeaſoned with ſalt, and that we ſhun all manner of communication, that doth not miniſter grace to the hearers; we muſt take heed leſt idle words proceed out of our mouths, for which we muſt give an account at the day of Judgement; how many times do ſuch words proceed out of our mouths that we would give a world to recal again, onely becauſe we do not watch over your words, that they may be ſuch as may tend to edifying, and expreſſe the grace that is within?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Again, we ſhould watch over our <hi>Senſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Senſes.</note> we ſhould make a covenant with our <hi>eyes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eyes.</note> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks chap. 31.1. <hi>not to look upon a maid</hi>; when our eyes are looking up and down, though they be not caught with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, or ſuch groſs ſins, yet there is danger to be caught one vvay or other; for when a man looks upon the Objects of the world, as good, and the like, how ready is his mind to be carryed after it? Men are led by their eyes, they carry the mind and heart with them, therefore we ſhould have a care, that whatſoever comes to our eyes, we make a good uſe of.</p>

                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> Again,<note place="margin">Ears.</note> we ſhould ſet a watch before our <hi>Ears</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhould take heed what we hear, when we come in company, leſt we be infected by what is ſpoken; we ſhould have an hedge about our ears, to ſtop them from unſavoury things. <hi>Doth not the ear taſte words,</hi> ſaith Job? VVe ſhould have taſting ears, that ſhould be able to taſte and reliſh the good words that are ſpoken, and hate the contrary, and diſtaſte them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Whole ſelves.</note>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We ſhould watch <hi>our ſelves, over the whole man</hi>: Only <hi>take heed to thy ſelfe,</hi> Deut. 4.9. As who ſhould ſay, This is the only thing; have a care of, watch over thy ſelf, leſt thy ſelf undoe thy ſelf; there is no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſo dangerous unto us as our ſelves: the Divel in hell cannot do us ſo much miſchief. How many corruptions are there in us, to draw us from God, and incite us unto ſin? There are abundance of corruptions lying in the heart of man, to make a man unfit for any thing that is good; that is, idleneſſe in the underſtanding, it cannot abide to take pains, and exerciſe it ſelf in Divine matters. There is in the will and affections, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and abundance of corrupt inclinations, that if a man look not to, it will break forth: So that this is the thing we muſt watch over, our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We are to watch over the duties of Religion</hi>;<note place="margin">Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</note> as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, we are to <hi>watch unto prayer,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. we are to watch to meditating, and reading, and hearing of the Word of God. Otherwiſe though we do them for the matter of them, yet we cannot for the right form, and manner of them: though our hearts be in a pretty good tune for the preſent, yet we cannot hold this frame, if we watch not thereunto. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.3. is an excellent place, <hi>If you will not watch,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>and hold faſt, I will come againſt thee as a thief in the night</hi>: As who ſhould ſay, Stir up thy ſelf and watch, that thou maiſt hold faſt; if thou haſt got any hatred of ſin in thy heart, hold it faſt; if ſtrength againſt corruption, hold it faſt. How ſhall I do that? why watch ſaith he, or elſe Chriſt will come againſt thee as a thief. If a book be in a mans hand when he is drowzy, it will fall out, he cannot hold it faſt; So when a mans heart is drowzy, and ſecure, it will let go comfort, and any thing that God hath beſtowed for the good of the ſoul; therefore we ought to watch: if we have any ſweet diſpoſition of heart, to go on in the Service of God, and in the duties of Religion, we may go on if we be watchful. And now to branch this into particulars.</p>

                  <hi>We muſt watch before the Duty. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,</hi> Exod. 20.8. So I may ſay, remember Prayer, to keep it holy; remember Meditation, to keep it holy; remember all the duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to keep them holy, and perform them in an holy manner: think of them before you go about the performance of them; we cannot pray unleſs we watch unto prayer, unleſs we be careful, and have our eyes in our heads, before we go about the duty.</p>
               <p>In the morning as ſoon as we awake, we ſhould think of prayer; and when tempted to ſin, we ſhould think of prayer. If I ſin, how can I pray unto God? I have ever and anon need to poure out my prayers before God; now if I commit theſe and theſe ſins, how can I look up to heaven, when my conſcience doth reproach me for ſin? So when we hear the word of God, <hi>look to thy foot when thou comeſt into the houſe of God.</hi> Eccleſ. 5.1. that is, Before thou goeſt into the Houſe of God to hear the Word of Salvation, ſee into thine own heart, think whoſe word

it is thou heareſt; and that thou goeſt to hear the Word, that ſhall judge thee at the laſt day. When thou comeſt into the preſence of God, take heed leſt thou heareſt as fools hear; and take heed leſt thou prayeſt as fools pray; and comeſt to the Sacrament, as fools uſe to come; we ſhould watch before the duty, that all things may be in a readineſſe, before we come to the performance of it, that we may prevent all things that may hinder us, and be fitted with all things that may help forward the duty; that time, place, and all advantages may meet together for the better doing of it.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, <hi>We muſt watch in the duty,</hi> as well as before the duty.<note place="margin">In Duty.</note> As the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning prayer, ſo I may ſay concerning all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties, <hi>Continue in prayer, and watch therein with thanksgiving, Col.</hi> 4.2. As we are to watch before, that we may have preparation, ſo we muſt watch in the duty, that we may rightly diſcharge it; for though a man hath been watchful before the duty, and hath been prepared in ſome meaſure, and fitted, yet you are not without danger. But when you are in prayer, and when you are at the Lords Table, or any other duty; for all your former preparation, if you be not watchful now, you may fail in ſome kind or other, and ſo mar the duty; therefore we ſhould watch <hi>in the duty,</hi> that our hearts may be waking in it, and our mind at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive upon it, that our hearts may be fixed upon that we are about; <hi>My heart is fixed, my heart is fixed,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David</hi>; he was a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, he repeats it again and again; as if a man ſhould be jocund, and ſay, I have got it, I have got it. We ſhould get hearts fixed upon the duty, that ſo we may not have wavering hearts, half off, and half on the duty; but that the whole man may be employed about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhould be watchful <hi>after the duty,</hi> that we may not loſe the benefit, and reward <hi>of the duty,</hi> leſt the ſubtilties of Satan, and the wiles of our own hearts, do rob us of the fruits of it; though a man hears ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attentively, and pray, and perform all other duties very enlargedly, yet when he hath done all, he may loſe the comfort and reward of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Therefore when we hear the word, we ſhould watch over our hearts, that the fouls of the ayre may not pluck it out again, that if we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny quickning, we may not loſe it again; if we have heard any thing that hath helped us forward in Grace, we ſhould take heed that we loſe not the ground again; As the Publican, as ſoone as he had prayed to God, and performed an Ordinance aright, how careful was he not to loſe the benefit thereof? He went to the Temple to pray, and he was watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful before the duty; thinking, I am now going to pray, and power out my ſoul before God. He was watchful in the duty, for you may ſee how humbly, and feelingly, and penitently he did pray; ſtanding a far off, and ſmiting upon his breſt, and not lifting up his eyes to heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the hardneſs of his own heart, and rowzing it up. <hi>Lord be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to me a ſinner</hi>: and when he had done this, he was careful afterwards, for the Text ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.14. As he had prayed for mercy, ſo he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to carry it along with him. He prayed that he might be juſtified, and as he prayed for it, ſo he was careful to carry home juſtification in his boſome. So when we are at a Sermon, we ſhould watch, that we may go home quickned, and bettered: and when we are at conference, we ſhould watch that we may return home with the fruit and benefit of the duty: So for all other Ordinances, we ſhould be careful and watchful, that we may not loſe the reward, for the Divel is crafty, and our own hearts are ready to betray us, therefore we had need be watchful; and that is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing we ſhould watch, <hi>the duties of Religion.</hi>
               </p>

                  <note place="margin">Time. Preſent time.</note>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhould watch <hi>times and ſeaſons</hi>; God knows what miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things are a coming, therefore what time the Lord allots us, we had need improve it to the beſt advantage, that we may redeem the time. How many hours do run from us, before we are aware? How many dayes, and months, and years, have we let ſlip away, and we are little the better? Our time is a ſpecial thing, and therefore we had need to watch it, that we may improve it to the beſt advantage, that we may be no longer fools, but wiſe in the imploying of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhould watch all the <hi>times of Gods anger and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>;<note place="margin">Time of Gods wrath.</note> it is a miſerable thing when a man paſſeth on like a fool, and Gods anger comes forth, and a man is not provided, hath not a defence for it. There be dayes of anger, and viſitation, when God comes to viſit people for their ſins; to viſit a pariſh, to viſit a family, to viſit a perſon; and what a woful thing is it, for a man to be drowzy and negligent, when Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger burſts forth, and ſo he hath no evidence of comfort to his ſoul; he knows not how to meet God in the field? But when the wrath of God breaks out in any kind upon his Goods, or Wife, or Children, or Body, or Friends, or any thing, he is at a loſſe, and knows not what to do; he is fain to ſink under the hand of God, and hath no refuge to flie unto; therefore we ſhould watch againſt the day of Gods anger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Time of Grace.</note> We ſhould watch over <hi>the times of Grace</hi>: for there be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and acceptable times, as the Apoſtle calls them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.21. Many times good motions come in: Now if we do not watch, to keep them, and nouriſh them in our hearts, the Lord will paſſe us by at another time, and we ſhall not be moved. Sometimes God affects thy heart at a Sermon, and puts in a good reſolution to forſake ſin, and lead a new life; now have a care to keep theſe reſolutions, and let them not periſh in thee, and go out like lightning. The Lord hath given many a bleſſed ſeaſon, and oportunity of mercy, the water was moved, if he would have but ſtepped in, if he would but have taken hold of the mercy, he might have had it; but afterwards, he may go mourning, and thirſting, and longing, and never have the mercy offered more; and it is well if he can be humbled for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of that mercy, by his neglect, and watch for the future the <hi>times of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again we ſhould watch the <hi>times of Death</hi>;<note place="margin">Death.</note> we are all mortal men, muſt die, and <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find him ſo doing,</hi> Mat. 24.5. If any of us ſhould dye, before we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and brought home to God, we periſh for ever: Whoſoever thou art, if thou die in thy ſins with thy dead, hard, unſanctified, unregenerate heart, thou art damned, thou goeſt to Hell. Therefore watch for the coming of death, that ſo when it comes, it may not be the King of Terrours, and an amazement to thy heart.</p>
               <p>Againe, We muſt watch for <hi>the day of Judgment</hi>;<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> as Death leaves us, ſo Judgment will find us: Therefore we ſhould conſider with our ſelves ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, the ſtrictneſſe of the account we are to give at the dreadful day of the Son of man, when all works ſhall be brought to a Touch-ſtone, and all ſecrets ſhall be Preached on the Houſe top. It is an excellent thing, when a man doth conſider theſe things before hand; when a man hath looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his thoughts, for they ſhall be Judged; and upon his ſpeeches, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all his wayes, for they ſhall all be brought before the Judgment Seat of God; and according as a man hath done, ſuch reward he ſhall receive for evermore.</p>
               <p>The next thing, is, the <hi>Reaſons why we are to Watch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons. Our proneneſs to be drowzy.</note>And the <hi>Firſt</hi> Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe we are marvellous prone to be Drowzy
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94114:147"/>
in Spiritual things.</hi> In temporal things we are watchful enough; for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, and Pride, and the like, we are very watchful, but in Spiritual things, how ſubject are we to Drowzyneſs? <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was fain to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, <hi>I know that in me, that is, in my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing, Rom.</hi> 7.18. Is thy heart better then Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>? If he were left to himſelf, he ſhould be as miſerable, and proud, and untoward as another; and have as vile an heart as another: and therefore that made him watch. Therefore we had need to watch, for how loath are we to be brought to watch? And how unwilling to take ſuch an hard piece of ſervice to do? we are marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous apt to be ſecure. If <hi>Jonah</hi> had watched, if he had had a watch over his heart, he would have gone to <hi>Nineveh</hi>; but for want of watchfulneſſe, he ran away. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>I ſleep,</hi> ſaith the Church; it was not like the ſleep of the wicked, and ungodly, for her heart waked; but ſhe was aſleep, ſhe was proud, and marvellous ſecure, there was a great deal of untowardneſſe of ſpirit grew upon her: And as we are untoward to that which is good, ſo we are prone to that which is evil; we are glued naturally to the world, and the things of this life, it is an eaſie thing to draw us away into evill, therefore we had need to watch. As it is ſaid of the Diſciples of Chriſt in regard of temporal drowzineſs, ſo it is with us, in regard of Spiritual drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.43. <hi>He came and found them aſleep again, for their eyes were heavy</hi>: Though Chriſt had awakened them, and jogged them, yet they were aſleep again, for their eyes were heavy; So though the Lord hath awakened us, even now we were awakened by a Croſſe, by Sickneſſe, by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, by a Reproof, ſomething or other God hath been pleaſed to waken us by; but all on the ſuddain we fall aſleep again, for our hearts are very heavy: as it is with an heavy brain, what a doe he hath to keep himſelf awake? though he pinch himſelf, and rowze up himſelf, yet he hath much adoe to keep his eyes open; ſo the heart of man is ſo drowzy, that he hath much adoe to keep any Grace alive in himſelf; we are ſo apt to be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that we had need to watch. <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.1. the Prophet complains of the drowzineſs of his heart, <hi>The Angel that talked with me, came again and waked me, as a man a wakened out of his ſleep</hi>: when God was talking with him, he fell into a ſleep. So when we are in Prayer, we have much adoe to hold out in the duty, we have ſuch vile natures, and curſed diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. How ought we then to watch over our ſelves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another reaſon why we ſhould be watchful, is,<note place="margin">Chriſtians life is a Warfare.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe our life is a Warfare,</hi> and we do not lie like two Armies in a field, removed one from the other; but we lie in the midſt of our enemies round about us, and ſo they are ready to ſurprize us.</p>
               <p>The greateſt means of doing us miſchief, are moſt commonly thoſe things we have need of; as our meat, and drink, and affaires,<note place="margin">The world an Eenemy.</note> and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; we cannot go to prayer, but worldly thoughts are ready to intangle us; we cannot go to the Houſe of God, but a man is in danger to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped. There is danger in every thing we go about, by reaſon of the worlds powerful enticements, therefore we had need to ſtand upon our guard, and be careful, for elſe how can we avoid to be ſurprized, and led away? This is the reaſon, why ſo many ſink into Perdition: Many that have given good hopes, many that have promiſed excellent things, have come to nothing, but have fallen away as the fall of a leafe. Whence comes this, but becauſe they have not been careful and watchful?</p>
               <p>The Divel is watchful, to inſnare and intrap us,<note place="margin">The Divel</note> therefore we ſhould watch to avoid his ſnares; As the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Be ſober and watchful, for your Adverſary, the Divel, goeth about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour</hi>: The Divel is alwayes buſie, and therefore we had need
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94114:148"/>
watch and buſie our ſelves, and be careful at all times: when we are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and conſider not God, and conſider not the good of our Souls, and the peace of our Conſciences; Satan preſently hath advantage againſt us: If the Divel had any thing elſe to do, it were ſomething, but the Divel hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, but to hurt us, and lay Siege againſt us; All his practice, from the beginning of the world to this day, is to go roaming and ranging up and down to do miſchief, it is all his employment, from the beginning of the day to the end thereof; If he get us alone, he will enſnare us there; if not there, he will enſnare us in company; if he cannot get us there, he will get us in a Sermon, and if any thing falls againſt our luſts, he will cauſe our hearts to riſe againſt it. Now when we do not watch over our ſelves, we are led away by Satan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore we had need be careful, for the Divel is alwayes watchful, therefore we ſhould labour to be alwayes provided to reſiſt him.</p>
               <p>Again, we have <hi>the fleſh</hi> that is continually about us, it is an enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, it is that which doth betray us to the World, and the Divel, even our own hearts do betray us, and therefore we had need be careful; we have enemies from without, and our own hearts within, and all to undo us. Take a man that is in a good way, and hath all means, and helps to make him Godly, though there be no temptation from without, yet he may de damned from his own heart, if he be not delivered from it. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Every man is tempted by his own luſts,</hi> and Jam. 4.5. <hi>The Spirit that is within us luſteth to envy,</hi> and covetouſneſs, and ſecurity, and vanity, and carnal eaſe, it luſts after theſe things, and therefore we had need to watch.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Third</hi> reaſon is,<note place="margin">The certain advantage of Watchfulneſs.</note> Becauſe it <hi>will do us a great deal of good</hi>: for as if we do not watch we are eaſily ſurprized, ſo if we do watch it is an eaſie thing to ſtand: all our miſcarriages in the duties of Religion, lye in ſecurity; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if we were watchful, and would walk with eyes in our heads, and would conſider the ſnares that be laid for us, and conſider Gods threatnings, and Commandments, the duties of Religion would be eaſie: For if we do not watch, the Divel, and the World, and the Fleſh have advantage againſt us; but if we do watch, this is as it were a fence to the heart, to hedge a man in to keep him ſafe. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. There is an excellent place, <hi>Be watchful. and ſtrengthen the things that remain</hi>; it is the ſtrength of the ſoul. When a man watcheth, let a man have but a little grace, ſuppoſe a man be marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly fallen off, and hath but a little good remaining, a few graces in him; a little faith, a little hope, a little ſanctified deſire; he hath but a little ſtrength to go on againſt ſin, if a man doth but now watch, if a man do but husband this little, how ſtrong will he be? A little Faith is able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the Divels in Hell, well managed: a little hope is able to keep a man above water from ſinking: a little ſtrength is able to maintain the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: a little affection to goodneſs, if a man have a carefull heart to improve it to the uttermoſt, will go a great way; if a man did but watch, it would ſtrengthen the things that remaine. Though a man were never ſo infeebled, and come to never ſo low an ebb, watchfulneſſe is a ſtay, and ſtrength to the heart.</p>
               <p>

And we cannot pray to him to ſave us, unleſſe we watch: it is to tempt God, to pray to him to preſerve us from evil, when we do not watch over our ſelves: it is to tempt God, to pray to him to quicken us, when vve deaden our ſelves: to intreat God to give us an holy

Therefore ſee vvhat Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.38. <hi>Watch and Pray, that ye fall not into temptation</hi>: As vvho ſhould ſay, You cannot Pray that you may not enter into temptation, you tempt God if you intreat him to do any thing, if you do not vvatch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your ovvn ſouls. Though a man hath no Activity to do any good, yet God vvill have him be vvatchful; if he mean to purifie a man, he vvill make him purifie himſelf; if he mean to keep him from pride, he vvill make his ovvn heart reſiſt pride: therefore <hi>watch, that thou enter not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> if thou mean to pray to God, not to lead thee into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <hi>All a mans watching will do no good,</hi>

               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 'Tis true indeed, unleſſe the Lord keeps a mans ſoul, all a mans watching is nothing. But I tell thee, If thou watcheſt, thou haſt Two watchers, thou haſt God to watch over thee, and thy ſelf to watch over thee; thou haſt God to watch over thee, and keep thee in all thy wayes, and then thou watcheſt over thy ſelf, and art ſuſtained by God, ſo that thou haſt two watchers, God above, and thy own ſoul within thee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about this work.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> Reaſon is,<note place="margin">Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe this is the very means preſcribed by God to do us good</hi>: It is the very remedy that the Lord of Heaven hath appointed unto us to ſave us from danger, and keep us from falling; the Lord hath ſanctified this means to this very end and purpoſe: therefore when our Saviour Chriſt would diſſwade his people from carking and caring for the things of this life, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36. ſee what means he preſcribeth and layeth down to do it, <hi>Be watchful</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and pray</hi>: the world is ready to get in, <hi>therefore watch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and pray alwayes, that you may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to eſcape theſe things</hi>: So that we ſee this the means preſcribed by God himſelf, to eſcape the falling into ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Again, We ſhould be ſo much the more careful in this watch,<note place="margin">None can Watch for us.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe no other can watch for us</hi>: in outward things one man may watch, while another ſleepeth; as in ſailing, when all the reſt are aſleep, there is one watcheth: ſo in war<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when all the Souldiers lye in their tents aſleep, it may be ſome few are watching, that the reſt may take their reſt but it is not ſo in regard of our ſouls, one man cannot watch while another man ſleeps, but every man muſt watch over his own heart: If we do not watch our own ſouls, we ſhall periſh; and if we do not periſh everlaſtingly, we ſhall have miſerable temptations, and evils, and many inconveniences we ſhall be expoſed unto.</p>

They put this duty over to God, as if it did not belong to them, they will watch over outward things, for plowing, and ſowing, and reaping, and the like; but for the good of their ſouls, they never acquaint themſelves with this watching; their hearts are like the wilderneſſe, as the wilderneſſe is open for all wild-beaſts, ſo their hearts are open for all temptations, that is the reaſon they have ſuch dead hearts, and cold affections, that is the reaſon they look ſo little after ſalvation and eternal life, becauſe people never look after this duty of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; nay, they are ſo far from watching how to be ſaved, that they watch how the divel may take them; when a man ſins, he wiſheth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel would help him to more ſin; a covetous man is ſo far from watching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his ſin, that he would have more opportunities, and more occaſions of getting; the Devil cannot come faſt enough to fill his heart with theſe things: So if a man be given to pleaſure, he thinks he cannot have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but would have more ſtill. Thus people would have the Divel put more corn into the hopper: They are ſo far from watching for good, that they watch for evil, they deviſe evil upon their beds, as the Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> ſpeaks: They are poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of ſlumber, they have eyes and ſee not, they have eares and hear not, hearts and underſtand not; they do not know what watchfulneſſe is, if they do, they are the leſſe excuſable, becauſe they practice it not, they do not watch and wake unto Prayer, that they may not enter into temptation, but are carried away with the world and ſin.</p>

When we are called forth on the ſudden to pray or do any thing for the good of Gods Church and People, that we are ſo unfit to do it, and ſo backward; it is for want of watchfulneſs. Nay, what is the reaſon that we perform not the Worſhip of God in our Families better, but becauſe we do not watch: the very Regenerate themſelves, what a world of miſchief do they do to their own ſouls, for want of this duty of watchfulneſs? How do they ſwell in ſin, and are ſlack in goodneſſe, and ſlubber over Gods ſervice? How do they favour themſelves too too much, and ſuffer the diſhonour of God, by the wicked? and ſuffer their own hearts to diſhonour him too too much?</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Directing how to watch.</note> 
                  <hi>The next <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe ſhall be to ſhew you the Rules that are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in watching,</hi> and the Rules are theſe: If you would watch over your ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:94114:149"/>Firſt, <hi>Count watchfulneſſe your very life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Account watchfulneſs our life.</note> and think if you let watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe go, you let your life go; for if once watchfulneſs go, hovv dead are you in Prayer, and hearing the Word of God? So that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the heart, vvill be the death of the heart; vvherefore if vve vvould go on in vvatching, let us labour to keep this Holy diſpoſition; count it your very lives, and think vvith your ſelves, I let Life go, if I let Watchfulneſſe go. We uſe to ſay of Sleep, that it is the brother of Death, and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.6. vve may ſee the Phraſe uſed by the Apoſtle; vvhere vvaking is put for living, and ſleeping, for dying, that is the meaning of the vvords. So that as ſleep, natural ſleep, doth lively repreſent death; ſo it is vvith Spiritual ſleep, vvhich is the death of the ſoul. Therefore doſt thou find thy ſelf to be out of frame, and not vvatch over thy vvayes? then think vvith thy ſelf that thou art a dead man, and take up thy vvatch as faſt as thou canſt again.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Thou muſt let thy watch ſtand Catholically, univerſally in all duties,</hi> and all times; vvatch thereunto, and perſevere therein;<note place="margin">Watching in all things.</note> vve muſt not only watch, but Perſevere. Be careful in the morning how vve may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin our vvatch; in the day, hovv vve may ſpend it; at night, how vve may end it. So vve muſt vvatch in all duties; vvhen vve go to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, vve muſt vvatch in prayer; vvhen you go about your Callings, vvatch about them; vvhen vve are alone, vve ſhould be vvatchful; and vvhen vve are in Company, vve ſhould be vvatchful, for the Divel, and our ovvn ſouls, plot a great deal of miſchief againſt us, vve muſt vvatch in all places; in our houſes, and vvithout doors, and in the fields; vve are ſtill in danger vvhereſoever vve are.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>We ſhould proportion our watch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proportioning it to what we are about.</note> 
                  <hi>according as the duty is we take in hand,</hi> ſo our vvatching may bee; there is one kind of vvatching for one kind of duty, another for another. If vve be to go about our callings, then our vvatching muſt be againſt diſtruſtfulneſſe, and covetouſneſs, and diſtracting cares; that ſo vve may not be over head and ears in the vvorld. If our duty be prayer, vve muſt have an eye to the promiſes, and take hold on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and come in his mediation and his onely. So vvhatſoever duty it be, if it be hearing of the Word of God, there is a vvatchfulneſs to be proportionable to it. A man ſhould think, the vvord will do me no good, unleſſe the Lord meet vvith my luſts: I have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified heart, and unleſſe the Lord vvork upon me, I ſhall never lie dovvn under him. Therefore vve ſhould be vvatchful, that vve may practice, and be able to apply vvhatſoever is ſpoken to us; vve are to keep a due vvatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, for that vvhich is due to one thing is not due to another; that vvhich is ſufficient for one, is not for another.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Take heed of all things that may hinder Watchfulneſſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Avoiding hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>Take heed of vain Company.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vain company.</note> If vve will be watchful, we muſt exerciſe our ſelves vvith thoſe that are godly. To be vvith ſecure Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is the vvay to be ſecure; this vvill hinder a man: A man had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be alone, then be in bad Company, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.7. <hi>I watch and am alone as a Sparrow on the houſe top</hi>: he was alone, and yet he was <hi>watching.</hi> A man when he is alone may be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather then when he is in ſuch Company: a man can never look to himſelf well, unleſſe he prize the Communion of Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, A man ſhould be ſober; Take heed of Spiritual Drunkenneſs</hi>:<note place="margin">Spiritual drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe.</note> Take heed of the cares of this life, and that you be not immoderate in any lawful thing; we ſhould ſtand upon our guard, and keep our hearts with all manner of keeping; if our hearts grow drowzy and idle, and if we neglect Sobriety, then we are gone, therefore in Scripture theſe are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94114:150"/>
put together, <hi>be ſober, and watch,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.6. 1 Pet. 5.8. I do not mean Drunkenneſſe with Wine, for there is a Drunkenneſſe, and not with Wine, as the Prophet ſpeaks, a man may be drunk with the love of the Creature: if thou loveſt thy eaſe too well, or any thing in the world too well, thou art drunk with it, thy heart is giddy, thou art no more able to Pray, or do any thing that's good, then a drunken man is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Setting God before our eyes.</note> If thou wilt Watch, <hi>then ſet the Lord alwayes before thy eyes</hi>: Set the watchman of Iſrael before thy face, God is called <hi>a watcher,</hi> Dan. 4.23. Now if thou wilt watch over thy ſelf, ſet God before thy face, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8. <hi>I have ſet God before mine eyes</hi>; ſo alwayes ſet the Lord before thine eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Exhorting to watchfulneſſe.</note>Now I come to the laſt thing, which is an <hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Motives.</hi> Becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will be ill with us at laſt.</note>Firſt, <hi>We all deſire to do well. Now how can we do well at laſt, unleſs we watch well all our life time</hi>? VVhat is the reaſon that many are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort, not like the Servants of God, full of horrour, and fear, and quaking? It is becauſe they do not <hi>watch,</hi> as it was with the Five wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, they were ſomething wiſe, not like the fooliſh, but they ſlumbred too; Now when the bridegroom came, there was a cry; they made an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, and a skrieking, and an howling, they were undone, the bridegroom was come: one would have thought, they ſhould have rejoyced that the bridegroom was come. What godly Chriſtians, and Religious People, when the bridegroom comes to fall a howling and a crying? This was becauſe they ſlumbred, whereas if a man be watchful over his life, and careful to keep an humble heart, and to honour God, and ſtudy how to die comfortably at laſt, he may rejoyce at the coming of the bridegroom; but becauſe they were in a ſlumber, there was a cry, therefore as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The end of all things is at hand, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſober, and watch unto prayer</hi>; the Apoſtle brings this as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo I may ſay, <hi>the end of all things is at hand, therefore be ſober, and watch</hi>; as a Traveller, when the day is almoſt ſpent, and he hath a great way to go, he puts ſpurs to his Horſe, and rides the faſter; ſo the end of all things is at hand, therefore we had need to be the more diligent and watchful, that we may have all things ready; the end comes upon us: We have had the Goſpel a long time, and God knows how ſoon we ſhall have an end thereof; therefore how ought we to be careful? as a man that is to write a Letter, may be at firſt he is ſomething careleſſe, and writes his lines ſomething broad, but when he comes near to the end, and hath a great deal to write, he writes his lines cloſe, and crowds them together: So now when we are coming towards an end, we cannot look that God ſhould alvvayes ſtrive with us, we ſhould now therefore labour to write cloſe, and to make our Duties thick, and to be enquiring after Grace, whereſoever we come, we think the time is long, but we may juſtly fear it is ſhorter then we imagine; as when an hour-glaſs is almoſt out, a man that ſits below, will think there is a great deal to run, but the ſand is hollow, and is run out before a man is aware; ſo the Lord ſo carries himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards people, that they may think there is a great deal of Patience more, and a great deal of Mercy more to be extended towards them, but when all comes to all, they ſhall find it lyes hollow, and will be out before they are aware.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Becauſe our ſouls are ſickly.</note> 
                  <hi>Conſider how ſickly and diſeaſed our Souls are</hi>; how apt they are to fall into ſin: Sickly men are moſt careful; Now our Souls are ſick of ſin, ſick of Pride, ſick of Covetouſneſſe, and Earthly-mindedneſſe, eaſily carried away with the ſins of the times; they are ſick of proneneſſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94114:150"/>
to do evil, and indiſpoſedneſſe to that which is good, therefore we had need to watch over our ſouls, we had need be our own Porters. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.34. our Saviour Chriſt doth compare every Chriſtian to a Porter; <hi>The Lord of the houſe takes a great journey, and commands the Porter to watch</hi>: We ſhould all be Porters, and keep the gates of our Souls, for we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in danger.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider that God hath awakened many of us already,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">We are already awakened.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a miſerable thing for us to ſleep again: wicked and ungodly men that were never converted, and healed, and awakened, and wrought upon, they go to Hell and damnation in a ſleepy ſecurity; but when a man hath been once awakened, and hath ſhaken off ſleep, and God hath made him look about him, to ſee how he might be ſaved; if this man fall aſleep again, it is a moſt miſerable thing; the latter end of that man will be worſe then his beginning.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Conſider the badneſſe of the Times, and Places,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Badneſs of the times, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of the moſt.</note> 
                  <hi>and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies we live in</hi>; they are all ſecure, and therefore we had need be ſo much the more vvatchful; and you knovv it is a very hard thing, for a man not to do as others do; therefore the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.6. vvould not have them ſleep as others do, as vvho ſhould ſay, Others do ſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have ſo much the more need to look to your ſelves, that you may not do as others do.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Purpoſe is to ſpeak of the ſeveral VVorks of Gods holy Spirit in the hearts and minds of his choſen; they are Gods peculiar people, and therefore he vvill vvork greater Mercies for them, then for any elſe: Novv the Firſt grand diſtinguiſhing vvork of the Holy Ghoſt in the Elect is Regeneration; he is the Author of Spiritual life in them, they are born of him, though by nature they are born of the fleſh, and ſo are fleſh; and in that eſtate can never enter into the kingdom of God: yet vvhen the Spirit of God comes to regenerate them, they come to be Spirit, they come to have a nevv life, and the Spirit of God gives it them: it is true that Chriſt is the Author of this life, he procured it by his death, he quickens whom he will, as he told his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo</hi>: Life is derived by Chriſt to all the Members of Chriſt; for as all in <hi>Adam</hi> died, <hi>Adam</hi> is the general root of all, in his loins, and by him they come to be dead in ſin; ſo Chriſt is the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> and all that are in his loins, all that are in him, he is a quickning Spirit to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. <hi>The firſt man Adam was made a living Soul, the ſecond Adam was made a quickning Spirit</hi>: Chriſt is the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and is a quickning Spirit to all that are in him;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94114:151"/>
God the Father hath appointed him to be <hi>the Prince of Life,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> tells his Hearers, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.15. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is the Prince of life to all the people of God: and therefore Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.12. He is the Father of this new Birth, and he is the daily and continual Father of it: He is not a Father for one, or two, or divers years, but <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>An everlaſting Father,</hi> to regenerate a people to God; and he doth it by his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. This muſt needs be granted, That Chriſt muſt be the Author of this new Life.</p>
               <p>Now you will ſay, <hi>Then why is it attributed to the Spirit? The Text gives it to the Spirit of God, the Holy Ghoſt; now if Chriſt be the Author of this new Birth, and the giver of this new Life, and God the Father hath appointed him to be ſo, Why is it then here ſaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Regeneration attributed to the ſpirit,</note> 
                  <hi>That the Spirit doth it</hi>?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer: It is given to the Spirit for Three Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe Chriſt doth it by the Spirit</hi>:<note place="margin">Becauſe Chriſt doth it by the ſpirit.</note> Whatſoever Chriſt doth without, he doth it by the Spirit: when he caſt out Divels here upon Earth, he did it by his Spirit; all the outward VVorks that he wrought, he wrought them by his Spirit; and therefore the Spirit is called, <hi>the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God,</hi> Luk. 11.20. Now if Chriſt do this VVork by his Spirit, if he do Regenerate all his people by his own Spirit, there is Reaſon why they ſhould be ſaid to be <hi>born of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Another Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe though this life be all from Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spirit is the bond of union between us and Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>it is he that begets it</hi>; (it is he that is the ſoul of every Believer, as I may ſo ſpeak) yet <hi>it is the Spirit that is the Bond of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi>; it is the Spirit that joyns Chriſt and them together, it is the Spirit that tyeth the knot, it is the Spirit that unites and puts them together into one; though Chriſt be life, and eternal life, yet notwithſtanding they are all Aliens from Chriſt, they are all out of Chriſt, that the Spirit doth not joyn together with Chriſt, they that have not the Spirit of Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> they are none of his; they are all out of Chriſt, they are like dead branches out of the Vine; <hi>it is the Spirit that is the bond of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between Chriſt, and thoſe that are Chriſts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe the Spirit quickens the Word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Becauſe the ſpirit quickens the word whereby we are born again.</note> 
                  <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this is done</hi>: The people of God, the thing that they are born of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it is the immortal ſeed of the VVord, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>You are born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible</hi>; Now this ſeed is ſowen in all mens hearts, ſcattered among all the Congregation, but yet it doth not Regenerate all the Congregation: The Reaſon is, where the Spirit comes, that makes it fruitful, and that makes it to quicken the heart; and thus you ſee the meaning of the words, <hi>That which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here are Two Points:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghoſt, Regenerates all the people of God</hi>; whoſoever is born again, is born of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Second Point is this, <hi>That all that are Regenerate, all that are born of the Spirit, they are Spirit</hi>; that is, they are ſpiritual, they are like the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Firſt is, <hi>That it is the Spirit of God, the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That the ſpirit of God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate all the Saints.</note> 
                  <hi>that doth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate all the people of God</hi>; this is that which makes them to be new Creatures, to be new men, to be altogether different from that they were before; this is that which doth diſtinguiſh them from themſelves, even as much as white from black; this is that which doth alienate them from the courſes of the world; this is that which doth make them to be ſingular
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94114:152"/>
and odde fellows, as if they were of another world; this makes them lead a different kind of life, and follow a different kind of way from all their neighbors, becauſe the Spirit of God works in them; as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> though <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was born after the fleſh, yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born after the Spirit, as the Apoſtle alludes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.23. that is, one took one kind of courſe, the other another; one was born one way, the other another way; the Spirit begat one, the Fleſh the other; and this made <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to perſecute <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> could not abide his courſes; they were of different Natures and Diſpoſitions, one was born after the Spirit, the other after the Fleſh.</p>

                  <hi>That it is the renewing of a man</hi>; It is not every change, there may be abundance of changes and alterations, and yet a man for the main may be the ſame man he is; a man may be changed from a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard to be ſober; from an Adulterer to be chaſte; yet ſtill he was the ſame man he was before, though there be changes wrought in him: but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is the renewing of a man, the making of a man another man, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Old things are paſſed away, and all things are become new</hi>: The Lord doth take away the old frame, and the old affections, and the old inclinations, the old acquaintance, the old courſe and converſation; all theſe things paſſe away, and the Lord puts in new things in the room thereof, till all things become new; thus it is in this work, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>According to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; the Lord removeth the old rubbiſh, and puts a new fabrick in the room; as a Goldſmith, he takes a veſſel of diſhonour and melts it, and makes it a veſſel of honour; God doth undo the old workmanſhip, and makes a new: as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Create in me, O Lord, a clean heart, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 51.10. <hi>David</hi> thought he had loſt all, therefore he prayeth to God that he may be new caſt, that he may be taken all to pieces, as a VVatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker takes a VVatch that is out of order, he takes it all to pieces, and ſets it together anew again; ſo he prayes God to deal with him, he had loſt all in ſenſe and feeling, and would have God make him a new workmanſhip, it is called the renewing of a man. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. there is an excellent place, <hi>I will give them a new heart, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord puts out, and he puts in, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven juſt as a Suiſter doth when ſhe works cut-works, ſhe puts out the cloths own threds, and puts in needle-work; ſo the Lord puts out the old heart, and puts in a new heart; he takes out that which was ſtark naught, and puts in that which is good and agreeable to his mind: the old heart is corrupt, and the old man is ſtark naught, there is nothing good in it; theſe the Lord takes out, and puts in all new: A man is altogether naught and reprobate before; what poor creatures are all people that are not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate? they are all proud, and vain, and fooliſh, and wordly, and earthly, and harden their hearts, and are careleſſe of Gods wayes, they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94114:152"/>
have no fear of God before their eyes, they are altogether rotten, how ill-favouredly do they pray? How worldly do they go on in their callings? How unfruitfully do they come to Church? They are all rotten and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory, they do nothing that right is; now when the Spirit of God doth make them up, he puts out all old things, and makes them new. This is the Firſt thing, <hi>Regeneration, is the renewing of a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As it is the renewing of a man,</hi> ſo <hi>it is the renewing of the whole man</hi>:<note place="margin">A Renewing of the whole man.</note> It is not only in ſome things, for <hi>Saul</hi> was another man in ſome ſenſe; but Regeneration is <hi>the renewing of the whole man,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The God of peace ſanctifie you throughout, in body, ſoul, and Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. it is a work upon the whole man; our Saviour Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to leaven, which a woman took and leavened the whole Lump: It is like unto Original ſin, as Original ſin infects the whole man; ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation doth repair and renew the whole man; it is as general and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, as original ſin: the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.9. <hi>It is in all goodneſſe</hi>; in the goodneſſe of a mans mind, and in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a mans affections, in the goodneſſe of the inclination and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, in the goodneſſe of the whole man; <hi>the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſs</hi>; indeed it begins in the goodneſſe of the mind, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Be renewed in the Spirit of your minds</hi>: Where he calls upon them for this new work; <hi>Put off the old man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and be renewed in the Spirit of your minds</hi>; that is the Firſt thing, when a man hath a new mind given unto him, a new knowledge put into his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, a man is renewed in knowledge, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. This is the firſt thing, when God reneweth a mans knowledge and apprehenſion of things, when a man begins to know the plagues of his own heart, and the evils of all his own wayes, now a man begins to ſee through theſe things, and now he begins to ſee the wayes of God, and to dive deep beneath the irkſomneſſe of them, to know the amiableneſſe of them, the ſweetneſſe of them: the delights of them are hidden from a man, ſo long as he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate; but when God doth begin to regenerate a man, now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to diſcover them to him, that a man ſeeth what they are: he could ſay before that the wayes of God were good, but he could never taſte and find them ſo; but when a man is renewed, now he ſeeth the luſtre and amiableneſſe of them: ſo alſo, he ſeeth the uglineſſe of ſin, this was covered before, ſin deceived the heart, and carried him after it; but now ſin begins to be laid ſtark naked, and a man ſeeth the deformity of it, here begins Regeneration in the mind; for the underſtanding is the key of the Soul, the key of all the Faculties of the Soul, it is like a ſluce or flood gate, pull up that, and the water goes out and runs all abroad; ſo when the Lord doth pluck up this ſluce, and lift up a mans heart, and mind, and underſtanding: now the waters of life flow into the ſoul: this is againſt them now, that have plenty of knowledge, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding go no further; that have new minds, and old wills and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is a new brain, but an old heart; this is not regeneration: rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration (it is true) begins in the underſtanding, but it runs along in all the ſoul, it deſcends into heart and mind, and all the whole man, and therefore it is called a new creature; whoſoever is in Chriſt is a new creature; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I make all things new,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.5. As <hi>Regeneration is the renewing of a man,</hi> ſo <hi>it is the renewing of the whole man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is done by degrees</hi>: Though Regeneration be in all parts,<note place="margin">By degrees per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</note> yet it is not in all degrees at once; the ſpirit of God doth renew more and more, and beget a man more and more; there is of the old birth a great while, but he doth eat it out more and more, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94114:153"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>And we all with open face, &amp;c.</hi> Mark here, he calls this change glory, becauſe it is a glorious creature; as long as a man is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, he is a baſe creature; but when he is renewed, he is a glorious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Now ſaith he, when the Lord doth this, he doth it from glory to glory, from one degree to another; as this is done by the ſpirit of God, ſo he doth it more; he proceeds from little beginnings to greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it was not ſo with <hi>Adam,</hi> God made him in his full ſtature at the firſt, he was a man at the firſt daſh; but this new creature, is as a Babe conceived in the VVomb, it begins there, and ſo grows up; <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the Word,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. He is a babe firſt, and ſo growes, though it be not a ſtarveling but grovvs, yet it is but a vveak one at firſt, and muſt grovv and come to its ſtrength more and more: it is like a good husband that begins vvith a little, and ariſeth up to a great eſtate in the end; ſo Regeneration makes a man a good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, puts a little ſtock into his hands, and makes him riſe to a great matter.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">According to Gods Image.</note> 
                  <hi>This is according to the Image of God</hi>: It is not all kind of Renewing: A man may have a new work that he had not before; but the work of regeneration, as it is a renewing, ſo it is a <hi>renewing after the image of God</hi>; man had quite and clean loſt the Image of God, which conſiſted in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs; Now when Gods Spirit comes to regenerate a man, that reneweth him according to this Image: As the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. <hi>That ye put on the new man which is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after his image</hi>: and how is that? In <hi>Righteouſneſs and Holineſs.</hi> As it is in Nature, though a man be never ſo godly when he begets a man, he begets him after his image, as he is by nature polluted and unclean: <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3. So <hi>Adam</hi> begat <hi>Seth</hi> in his own image: ſo when the Spirit begets a man again, he begets him after his own image, he makes him <hi>merciful as his heavenly Father is merciful,</hi> Luke 6.36. and <hi>perfect as he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> Matth. 5. ult. There are none regenerate and born again, but thoſe that are like God, the Lord ſtamps upon them his own ſimilitude, and makes them like to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">In Jeſus Chriſt</note> 
                  <hi>This is the Image of God in Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; who is the expreſs image of his Father; he is the pattern after which this frame is made: nay, God did order it ſhould be ſo from eternity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Whom he did fore know, he did predeſtinate, that they ſhould be conformed to the image of his Son</hi>: 'Tis true, this ſimilitude is not preſently made out, it is but by halves as it were; it is but a poor firſt draught, and never perfect in this life, but it ſhall be made perfect, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>We know when he appears, we ſhall be like him, and ſhall ſee him as he is; then we ſhall be perfectly like him, and ſee him as he is, and know him as he is</hi>; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>You are dead, and your life is hid in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Here the work is hardly come to its glory, there is a great deal of baſeneſſe and old rubbiſh ſtill, but it ſhall be glorious before God hath done, it ſhall come to be perfect then; in the mean time, it is but by degrees; but the work of regeneration puts a man to go to Chriſt, and believe in Chriſt; <hi>You that follow me in Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.28. When a man is regenerate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation puts a frame into a mans heart to be like unto Chriſt, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſteps, and his example, that as he hath done, ſo he may do more and more: this is the work of regeneration, <hi>That the Spirit of God works in Gods people, conforming them to the Image of Chriſt</hi>: Yea, Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth more than repair a man, more than reduce a man to that eſtate wherein he was in <hi>Adam</hi>'s loins before the Fall; it is the ingrafting of a man into Chriſt, and the eſtating a man into the Merits and Priviledges of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94114:153"/>
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it is a greater matter, then the bare reſtoring of a man to that which he loſt, it is the reſtoring of a man to a better eſtate; this differences it from Sanctification. Thus we ſee what Regeneration is.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Second Thing</hi> is, <hi>Why it is ſo called?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why called Regeneration.</note> Why this ſame bleſſed work of the renewing of the whole man after the Image of God in Chriſt Jeſus is called Regeneration. There be Two Reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>To ſhew us how marvellouſly we are corrupt by Nature</hi>:<note place="margin">To ſhew the great Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature.</note> Until the Spirit of God take us in hand, a man is quite rotten, there is no ſoundneſſe left, there is nothing in him will ſerve, it is not a little melting will ſerve the turn, it is not a little plaiſtering, or patching, or piecing will do the deed: though there be a thouſand changes in a man, yet if a man be not another man, if he be not a new creature, it is to no effect, it will never bring a man into the kingdom of God; what ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God</hi>: As who ſhould ſay, Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, a man is all to ſhatters, all to pieces, all rotten, and unleſſe he be born again, and made a new creature, it is impoſſible he ſhould enter into the kingdom of God; though a man be never ſo much altered, he is not in the eſtate of Grace till he be a new man, till the Lord hath given him a new frame, and a new inclination: except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God, he cannot ſee the kingdom of Grace: that is the firſt dowry of the kingdom of Grace, to give a man a new Being that he never had before: a natural man is juſt like an old rotten houſe, that hath not one piece that will ſerve the turn; but a man that will make it an habitable houſe, muſt take it all down to the ground, and build it up from the ground: ſo it is here, there is not one piece will ſerve the turn; though ye ſee admirable things in men, though they ſeem excellent in the eyes of men, yet they will not ſerve the turn, they are rotten and ſtark naught; there is <hi>an abſence of all Good,</hi> Rom. 7.18. Nay beſides, there is an univerſal indiſpoſition in a man, like to a thing that is all rotten and marred, and can never be made up again, except it be made ſpick and ſpan new; and ſo it is with a man, he is altogether corrupt, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. <hi>from the ſole of the foot, to the crown of the head, nothing but bruiſes and putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoars</hi>; take a man that is never ſo civil, and of fair carriage, ſo long as he is not a new creature, this is nothing for the entring into the kingdom of God, and being amiable in his ſight: Nay, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. the Text ſaith, <hi>The thoughts of the heart of man are only evil continually</hi>; there is nothing ſound in a man, though he daily think of Grace, and think of God, his thoughts cannot be ſaid to be good, for the mind whereby he thinks of theſe things is rotten, and unſavory; though he ſpeaks of never ſo good things, the ſame things the Saints of God ſpeak of; though he doth the ſame actions the people of God do; though he hears the ſame VVord, and receives the ſame Sacraments, he cannot do them aright, they are abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Gods ſight, therefore when God regenerates a man, he muſt make him another man then he was before. This ſpeaks natures corruption.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The work well expreſſed by the Name</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe the things of Regeneration are admirably ſet out by way of this ſimilitude</hi>: Natural Generation is generally, ſweetly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this VVork of Regeneration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>As a man cannot come into the World without Parents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Father, both in Natural and Spiritual Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</note> but he muſt have a Father to beget him, ſo it is in this new Birth: as in the other there was an earthly Father, ſo here is an heavenly Father, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. <hi>How much rather ſhall we be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Father of Spirits?</hi> There are two Fathers, an earthly Father, the Father of the natural and corrupt man, and God the Father of our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94114:154"/>
Spirits, that is, the Father of our ſpiritual Nature, as many excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do expound it: though it may be expounded <hi>the Father of our Souls</hi>; yet this is more likely, becauſe here is an oppoſition between the Father of the Fleſh, and the Father of the Spirits: God himſelf is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this new work.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">A Mother in both.</note> 
                  <hi>Here is a Mother too</hi>; That <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, is the Mother of them all; they are all <hi>Zions</hi> Children, here is the Womb that theſe new creatures lye in, Chriſts Spouſe; the Lambs wife is their Mother; though the world hate them and her too, yet they love her; nay, though the woman be thrown out into the wilderneſs, yet their hearts run after her; the Regenerate only are the true born, this is their Mother.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Firſt, Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then Birth.</note> As it is in the Natural Birth, <hi>There is a ſhaping in the Womb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a coming into life</hi>: ſo it is here, as the Apoſtle ſaith, there is a conceiving of a man in the womb, before he is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. <hi>My little Children, of whom I travel in Birth, till Chriſt be formed in you</hi>; There is the Conception; 'tis true, wicked men have many Conceptions, but they do not bring forth, Chriſt is not formed in them; they may have many ſtirrings that way, but they periſh in the Birth; but <hi>Zion travels and brings forth Children,</hi> Iſa. 66.8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Pain accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies both Births.</note> 
                  <hi>Again,</hi> As it is in the Natural Birth, <hi>None is brought forth, without the pains of travel</hi>; So there be pains in this new Birth, legal ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which the Reprobate are killed with and die under, but the godly come forth from under them ſafe and bettered.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Both come to a Being they had not.</note> 
                  <hi>Again,</hi> As it is in the firſt Birth, the Child that is born and comes into the world, he comes from no Being to a Being, from no Exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to an Exiſtency; ſo it is here in this new Birth, thoſe which were no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are now made the people of God; thoſe that had no being in Chriſt, now have a being in him; they are come into a new world, into a new heaven and a new earth; others live in this world, but they live in a new world.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">New Kindred follows both.</note> 
                  <hi>Again,</hi> As it is in the firſt Birth, <hi>A man comes to have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> to have Brothers and Siſters; <hi>ſo in this Birth, a man comes to have new Kindred,</hi> all the Godly in the world are of his Conſanguinity; though they be counted the <hi>Puritans</hi> of the Pariſh, yet they are of his bloud, and Chriſt himſelf is their Brother, and <hi>Abraham</hi> is their Father (under God) and <hi>Sarah</hi> is their Mother; there is a new Kindred. Indeed here is the difference, that the Children of the firſt Birth they are viſible, and their lives and courſes are viſible, and their alliance and kindred is viſible, and all that they are and do is viſible; but the Children of the ſecond Birth are not viſible: indeed their perſons are viſible as well as others, but their life is an inviſible thing, their excellency, their glory, this new creature in them, this is inviſible, it is like that River in Spain, which runs fourteen miles under ground; whence they have a Proverb, That the Bridge over the River is fourteen miles long: So there is a River in <hi>Surry</hi> that is juſt the like, it runs under the ground inviſible, they cannot ſee it; ſo theſe new creatures they cannot be ſeen, their lives run under ground, their lives are hidden with God, indeed their perſons, and outward actions and courſes may be ſeen; nay, wicked men may do thoſe very outward actions which they do; they may Pray together with them, and come to Church together with them, but this new workmanſhip they cannot ſee, that runs along under ground, the world ſeeth it not, neither can they know it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not Chriſt the Author of it: Thus we ſee the ſecond thing, namely, <hi>Why it is ſo called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:94114:154"/>Now the <hi>Third Thing</hi> is, <hi>Wherein this bleſſed Work doth conſiſt</hi>:<note place="margin">Wherein Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note> and it conſiſts in Two Things, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is Vivification; that is, when a man doth not only die unto ſin, but riſe up again to a new life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Likewiſe reckon ye your ſelves to be dead unto ſin, but alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> This is the other work of Vivification, when a man is made alive unto God, and is made able by the ſpirit of God to be alive unto God, and to wind himſelf out of death into life, by the ſpirit of the holy One. Theſe be the Two Parts whereof many Divines make Regeneration to conſiſt of; but though they beat at the ſame thing, yet I rather make them the Effects and Conſequents of Regeneration, as flowing from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; this paſſive work goeth before, a man never goeth on in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the works of the Fleſh, and never raiſeth himſelf up to this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life till he be Regenerated; ſo that regeneration is the firſt ingrafting of a man into Chriſt, whereby he is alive, that he may do all theſe things; it is a power put into him whereby he may believe and repent, ſo that Believing, and Repentance, and Mortification, and Vivification are acts of the new creature; a man muſt therefore be a new creature firſt, now this is by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, ſo that Regeneration conſiſts only of theſe Two Things:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94114:155"/>
Firſt, <hi>Of a paſſive receiving of Chriſt the Son of God.</hi> Secondly, <hi>In having a title to be the Son of God</hi>; and Regeneration doth not only bring <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative change,</hi> but <hi>a real change</hi> to a man: If you would know the meaning of the phraſe, A <hi>relative change</hi> is this, when there is a change in a man, from that he was before; but the change doth not lye in a man, as the change of Juſtification: before he was not Juſtified, now he is Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the man is changed, but he is not changed in himſelf, but it ſtands on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Gods imputation; he is not juſt in himſelf, but by imputation juſt. Now the <hi>real change</hi> is, When God doth purifie and make up the defects in a man more and more, that is a <hi>real change</hi>; ſo that I ſay, Regeneration is not only a <hi>relative change,</hi> whereby God accounts a man as a child; but it breeds a <hi>real change</hi> in a man, it gives a man a ſpiritual Being; for the Spirit of God when it comes to work this work, is a fruitful principle of all good in that man more and more: Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The fruits of the Spirit, are joy, peace, long-ſuffering, &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 5.22. 'Tis true, the Spirit doth not bring forth theſe Graces till after a man is regenerate, but by working that Regeneration, which makes the ſoul to bring forth theſe fruits, and making the heart an honeſt heart, and ſo a good ground to bring forth theſe ſeeds; the Spirit is a fruitful principle of all good in that man. Thus you ſee the Third Thing, <hi>viz. Wherein Regeneration conſiſts.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Man is totally againſt it of himſelf.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe</hi> it is ſo far from being wrought by any power in man, or any counſel in man, or any endeavours in man, it is ſo far from that, as <hi>that a man is totally againſt it</hi>; A man is an enemy unto it, a man hath reluctancy and repugnancy againſt it, he would not be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; when a man doth think he deſires heaven, and to be regenerated of God, he doth apprehend Regeneration in a wrong way, and heaven in a wrong way, ſo as he apprehends it, he doth Will it; he thinks of heaven as of a fine place, and a place full of pleaſure, and therefore deſires it; but that he ſhould alwayes be with God, that he ſhould alwayes be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and thinking of God, and minding of God, and have his heart weaned from all other things, and ſet it on God, this is heaven, but he hates theſe things, and ſo hates heaven, ſo he Wills that which he apprehends to be Regeneration; but Regeneration, is when a man hath a new heart, and when he is a new man: he was wordly before, but he is now brought to be ſpiritual, he was proud before, but he is now come to be humble, but the heart cannot abide this, therefore let the Lord fling in abundance of throws into a natural mans heart, to begin ſome preparatory work this way, to make a man begin to look out towards heaven, he flings all away, he is weary of them quickly; as a man at a Sermon, perhaps may have throws concerning the new Birth, but the corruption of his heart will throw all way, he cannot endure them, they are contrary to the corruption of a mans nature; nay, when God comes to work upon his own people, what a deal of pleading is there with the world, the fleſh, and the Divel, that they may not be caſt out: Therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw that through the grace and power of God, this work was wrought in thoſe he wrote unto, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. Mark how he ſpeaks, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his, abundant mercy, hath begotten us again to a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead</hi>: He lifts up his hands to heaven, and bleſſeth God that ever this work was wrought; he ſaw ſo much adoe, and ſuch a ſtir, and ſuch a deal of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this is a plain ſign that it is not of man, it is <hi>not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God which ſheweth mercy,</hi> Rom. 9.16. Neither can man Will, neither can he run, neither go, nor ſtir towards it; nay, though God make him go, how apt is he to laggar in the way, and draw back again? So you ſee the Fourth Thing, <hi>Why it muſt needs be the Spirits Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Fifth Thing</hi> is, <hi>How the Spirit of God works this Work.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How the Spirit worketh Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</note> It is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an unſpeakable manner: Who can declare the noble acts of the Lord? The works of God in Nature are marvellous. <hi>David</hi> himſelf, when he looked upon his natural Birth, the Conception of him in the Womb of his Mother, he wondered at it, <hi>Pſal</hi> 139.14. That was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful work, how much more is this unſpeakable, and unutterable? As it is ſaid of our Saviour Chriſt, Who can declare his generations? So may I ſay in a lower ſenſe, of this Work, Who can declare this Regeneration of his people? But yet thus far the Scripture doth authorize, and warrant us to go.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94114:156"/>Firſt, <hi>That he doth it by the word of Life</hi>;<note place="margin">By the Word of Life.</note> By the Goſpel of Salvation, by the Preaching of it, or otherwiſe according as he pleaſeth, that is the immortal ſeed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, &amp;c.</hi> And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Though you have ten thouſand inſtructers, yet you have not many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15. As who ſhould ſay, You are begotten and born again, and you are born again by the Word, and I was an inſtrument under God of your new Birth, by the Word which I have Preached among you; and therefore, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2. he calls <hi>Timothy, His own Son</hi>; So <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.4. he calls him, <hi>His Son in the Faith</hi>: that is, he was an inſtrumental Father under God, by the Doctrine of Faith, to bring him to be a Child of God: So that I ſay it is done by the Word, <hi>Of his own Will hath he begotten us by the Word of truth,</hi> Jam. 1.18. The Spirit of the Lord ſanctifies the Word when he is pleaſed to convert a man, the Word ſhall ſhew him what a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature he is by nature; it ſheweth him that fleſh and bloud cannot enter into the kingdom of God; it ſheweth him that he is utterly forlorn in himſelf, and paſt all recovery, and ſhews him where life is to be had: namely, in Jeſus Chriſt, diſcovering his worth, and excellency, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and that all Grace and good is in him, and ſhews him the freedom of this gracious offer: Thus the Spirit of God, when he propounds the Word to the ſoul, holds it before the eyes and conſcience, and ſanctifies it, and puts a power into it, to enter deep into the ſoul, that it may Conceive in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">By a ſecret and ſupernatural power.</note>Secondly, <hi>The Lord doth it by an unſpeakable working</hi>: There is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine work which the Lord worketh; The ſpirit comes into the ſoul after the manner of water; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>Except a man be born again of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> that is, unleſs he be born of the Spirit, which worketh in the ſpirit of a man, as water doth in working upon a foul thing. Now what this working is we cannot tell; but we can tell you the effects of it: whereas the ſoul was rotten and naught before, and impotent to all good; now it begins to have a better diſpoſition and a new power: And whereas it did ſavour of the things of this life before, now it ſavours of the things that are above: but this is a ſecret kind of working in the ſoul, therefore it is called the waſhing, and the laver of it: And the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> what miſerable creatures they were before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, he nameth Drunkards, Idolaters, Adulterers, &amp;c. and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of filthy perſons, <hi>Such were ſome of you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before your Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but now you are waſhed, and juſtified, and ſanctified in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11. That ſame waſhing there, he means by that you are Regenerated; ſo that Regeneration, it is a ſupernatural, an unſpeakable kind of waſhing of the ſoul by the holy Ghoſt, whereby the ſoul hath its Corruption waſhed from it in part, and made clean in part, and way made for all the Graces of Gods Spirit to come in now, and all the fruits of the ſpirit to be brought forth: Thus the Spirit of God works this work, he works it in an ineffable manner by the word of Life, and by a ſecret kind of waſhing.</p>

ſhews it is not of man: who is able to beget himſelf, and ſhape him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the womb, and diſpoſe of his own body in the belly? Nay more, Can any man beget himſelf again? The very name of <hi>Again,</hi> ſhews that it is a work only of God, none but he can do it; and we ſee it plainly, it is wrought no where, but where God himſelf doth it, and they that have it are able to ſpeak it, that they did not chuſe God, but God choſe them; <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not</hi>; all the ſouls of his people will ſubſcribe, That <hi>it was not in them that willed, or in them that ran, but in God that ſhewed mercy:</hi> It is God only that is the Author of this thing, and none but he.</p>

                     <hi>Information.</hi> Of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual need of the Spirit.</note> This ſhould teach us to conſider that we have alwayes need of the Spirit of God: If the Spirit of God hath begotten us again, then we have alwayes need of him; it is not in this as in the firſt Birth; when the Child is born, though the Father be gone, the Child may ſubſiſt but it is not ſo here: but the Spirit of God as he begets a man, ſo he is fain alwayes to ſtand by him and bear him up, and give him ſupplies of Grace from day to day: As it is with the Air, the Sun doth not only enlighten it, but it doth every moment give light to it: for ſuppoſe the Sun ſhould ſhine four or five hours in the day, yet if the Sun ſhould with-hold its light, the Air would be dark preſently; it is not as it is with Fire, let a man heat the water, though he take away the Fire, the water will keep its heat a while after; but do but with-hold the light of the Sun, and all is gone in the ſame moment; ſo it is with this new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Spirit of God, he doth dwell in the ſoul, as the Sun in the Air; his preſence warms the ſoul, and quickens the ſoul, and inables a man to good, and gives a principle of life, and enables to all actions that are good; therefore how ſhould all Gods people carry themſelves towards this Spirit? They ſhould have a care that they quench him not, nor go againſt him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is for all Gods people,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exhortation</hi> 1.

I ſay to all ſuch perſons, <hi>Let them endear this Spirit of God, let them not grieve , or offend, or diſpleaſe him,</hi> ſeeing he is ſuch a gracious worker in them: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. The Apoſtle makes this very Inference, <hi>in whom after ye believed ye were ſealed by the holy Spirit of Promiſe</hi>: that is, whereby you were Regenerated; Regeneration is the firſt ſeal of the Spirit, whereby he ſeals Gods good will to a man. Now, hath the Spirit of God ſealed you? Then do not grieve him, nor cauſe him to take any indignation againſt you; for though he will never depart from them, whom he hath made new Creatures, yet notwithſtanding he may hide his face for a time if we diſpleaſe him. Yea, Conſider, Will any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Child willingly diſpleaſe his loving Father? The Spirit of God is our Father, therefore we ſhould have reſpect to him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>To them that are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerated</hi>:<note place="margin">3.

make a man up again: As <hi>David</hi> prayed when he had the Spirit, <hi>Lord, take not thy holy Spirit from me,</hi> Pſal. 51.11. So when a man hath not the Spirit of God, he ſhould pray to God, <hi>Lord, Give thy holy Spirit to me, and ſend down thy holy Spirit into my heart, that may work this work in me.</hi> But it may be many of you will think that you expect this, and deſire it, and wiſh it, and uſe ſome means. I Anſwer, Then ſhew it by thy coming unto God for it, from day to day; will any man ſay, That <hi>Noah</hi> did expect that God ſhould deliver him from the Deluge, if he had not took that courſe which God appointed? If he had not built an Ark, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we may juſtly ſay, That he did not look that God would deliver him. Therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> That as he did expect that God ſhould keep him; <hi>ſo being warned of God, he built an Ark, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 11.7. So when a man ſhall ſay, That he looks that God ſhould deliver him from his natural eſtate and condition, that God ſhould renew him by his Grace and goodneſs, yet if a man will not prepare an Ark: if when a man is Commanded and directed by God what to do, yet he will not come to God, to do that which ſhould be done for him, theſe men do but deceive their own ſouls, and treaſure up indignation againſt themſelves. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 14. when the Children of Iſrael were in <hi>Pi-hahiroth,</hi> and the Egyptians were behind them, and the Mountains were on the ſide that they could not paſs, and the Sea was before them, and there was notable crying out, Oh! that God would deliver them, now they were dead men, the Egyptians were come out to deſtroy them, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were on the ſide, and the Sea before them: Now mark what an Anſwer God gives to their cry; cauſe the people to go forward, you keep a crying to me, I pray go forward, you are not yet at the red ſea, but go to the red ſea, and when you are there, then cry to me; you are idleing, and lazing, and miſtruſting me; though the red Sea be before them, yet cauſe them to come thither, and when they are there, then cry for help to me: So thou ſayeſt thou deſireſt that God would Regenerate thee, and quicken thee, and turn thy heart, and vouchſafe thee his holy Spirit: do you ſo? I ſay it is very well, the thing is very good, but if the deſire be ſincere, you will take that courſe God bids you: art thou come to the utmoſt difficulty? Are not many things to be done which thou refuſeſt to do? Muſt thou not ſeek God more, and more carefully? Go forward, go forward, if thou meaneſt to have help and aid from God, otherwiſe it is in vain: if thou wouldſt go on in the wayes of God, and do what God Commands thee, thou ſhouldſt be quickened and renewed.</p>

May be thou doſt theſe things for fear, or ſome by-reſpects: A worldly man may ſpeak of heavenly things , but is thy nature heavenly? A man may think of God, but is thy nature godly? Here is the thing, If a man be regenerate, there is Grace got into a mans Nature, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. When God Regenerates his people, he ſaith, <hi>He

The old creature may hear, and pray, and be ſober, and moral, for by nature the Heathen did the things contained in the Law: But if a man be Regenerated, as he doth the things contained in the Law and Goſpel, ſo he doth them with a new nature; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29. when the Children of Iſrael had ſpoken admirable ſpeeches; <hi>All that the Lord ſaith to us we will do</hi>; they made goodly profeſſions: now mark what God ſaith, <hi>Oh that there were an heart in this people to keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>!

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Spirit of God hath Regenerated a man, then <hi>the heart begins to be a good ſoyl for Grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The heart's a good ſoil for Grace.</note> and the heart begins to be ſutable, ſo that the heart is fit for Grace; A natural heart is not a proper ſoyl for Grace: As if a man ſhould bring a Plant from <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſet it here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it cannot thrive, unleſſe a man meet with a ſoyl that is fit for it: So Grace, if it come into the heart, and the heart is not a ſoyl for it, it can never thrive there, unleſſe the heart be Regenerated, and unleſſe there be a new nature: There may be admirable things in a natural man, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good purpoſes, and reſolutions; God may come to him, as a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger that lodgeth for a night, but he is gone the next morning; he may come as a ſojourner, to endure for a while, but here is no dwelling for him; theſe reſolutions, and purpoſes, and deſires cannot laſt long, that heart will ſquander them away; it is like the putting of a new piece into an old garment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.16. When a man puts a new piece into an old garment, a fine new purpoſe into an old heart, a new good deſire into an old mind, the rent will be worſe, for that man will return back again, and will have his luſts, and will be worſe then he was before, for the heart is not able to hold theſe: 'tis true, in the beſt hearts of Gods people, is a great deal of unnatural ſoyl for Grace; but there is ſome of this good new ſoyl, that Grace now can hold, and ſhall hold, ſo that the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail; it is not for any goodneſſe of the heart, but for the goodneſſe of Grace in the heart: there may be tranſient acts of goodneſſe in a wicked man, as Prayer, and ſuch-like tranſient acts; but when the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient act is done, there is a concluſion: but nature is permanent and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during thing, it is not only to come to Prayer, and then be dead; to come to a Sermon, and then be dead; but it is a permanent thing, a man is godly between Prayer, and Prayer, and the religious between Sermon and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and in all his wayes he ſets himſelf to be good, and well diſpoſed all his dayes. God complains againſt thoſe that give him tranſient acts of goodneſſe, <hi>Oh Ephraim! what ſhall I do to thee, that art as a morning cloud, &amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Spirit of God hath made a man a new nature, <hi>then he cannot live in ſin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He cannot live in Sin.</note> As the Apoſtle ſaith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He was carried away in his paſſion, but he could not hold on in that ſtrain, for it was againſt his nature; ſo if a man be overcome with any other ſin, yet when a man is renewed, as a Spring clears it ſelf of the mud, ſo this new nature is ſo oppoſite and contrary to ſin, that he cannot go on in ſin.</p>
               <p>

And if a mans nature be proud, how pleaſing is it to be flattered, and ſpoken fair, to be reverenced and reſpected at every word? A man loves theſe things a life, becauſe they ſuit with his nature: So if a man have a new nature, and partakes of the divine nature, how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing will Prayer be? And how pleaſing will the Word be? how pleaſing will Counſels and Exhortations be? how pleaſing to be corrected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for ſin? <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my mouth,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.103.

               <p>
                  <hi>It is a part of a mans Ingrafting into Chriſt by Faith, whereby a man is ingrafted into the Body of Chriſt, having one common life with all the reſt of the Members for mutual conſent, and profit, and care, and help, and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, or fellow-feeling.</hi>

Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip one with another</hi>; So that if a man be in Chriſt, he hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Body of Chriſt; if he hath fellowſhip with Chriſt, he hath fellowſhip with the Body of Chriſt; ſo that you ſee the Spirit doth both by one and the ſelf-ſame act, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Ye were at that time without Chriſt, and aliants from the common-wealth of Iſrael:</hi> It is all one thing to ſay that a man is out of Chriſt, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant from the common-wealth of Iſrael, without that corporation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Body, he is no Member of that Body; therefore it follows on the other ſide, If a man be in Chriſt, and ingrafted into Chriſt, then he is of this ſociety, he is of the common-wealth of the Iſrael of God: So that this is the Firſt Thing, <hi>It is a part of a mans ingrafting into Chriſt.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">VVrought by Faith.</note>Secondly, <hi>This likewiſe is done by Faith:</hi> When a man is ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Chriſt, he is ingrafted into him by Faith: As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.23. <hi>And they alſo, if they abide not in unbelief, ſhall be grafted in, for God is able to graft them:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, If ever they have Faith, they are ingrafted into Chriſt; it is Faith that ingrafts a man into Chriſt, and the ſame Faith that makes a man to be of the Body of Chriſt, that puts a man into the number of the Members of Chriſt; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To Titus my Son in the common Faith,</hi> Tit. 1.4. that is, it is ſuch a Faith as doth not only ingraft this man into Chriſt, but the very ſelf-ſame Faith, another man having it, it doth ingraft him into the Body of Chriſt too: So that it is a common Faith, whereby one is ingrafted into the Body of Chriſt as well as another, as <hi>Act.</hi> 2.44. They were all of one minde, and one heart, they all hung together as one body, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted their gifts, and things they had, even to their very Lands and Goods, one to another; here was a ſweet communion: but then, what was the reaſon of this?

It was Faith; for the text ſaith, <hi>they were believers,</hi> or elſe they could not have done it: And therefore as we are ſaid to come to Chriſt, ſo to the Body of Chriſt, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. <hi>But ye are come to Mount Zion, to the

City of the living God, the celeſtial Jeruſalem, and to the company of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Angels; and to the congregation of the firſt born, which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heaven.

               </p>
               <p>Then in the Third place, <hi>It makes a man have a common life with all the reſt of the Members of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>:<note place="margin">Making us have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt who is our life</hi>; We that are the people of God, <hi>Chriſt is our life,</hi> we have one and the ſelf-ſame life, all one and the ſelf-ſame minde in the wayes of God; As it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32. <hi>The multitude of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved were of one heart and one ſoul</hi>; all the people of God in the whole world would quickly be acquainted if they were brought together, for they are all of one and the ſelf-ſame diſpoſition and mind; As our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeaks to his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou art in me, and I in thee, ſo that all they may be one in us</hi>: As the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the bleſſed Trinity are three diſtinct Perſons, and yet are all one; ſo in ſome ſenſe, the Members of the Body of Chriſt, though they be of ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al callings and conditions in the world, yet they are all one, <hi>that they may be all one as we are one,</hi> verſ. 21. They all live by the ſame rule, and walk by the ſame rule, they are all guided by the ſame Word, and ſwayed by the ſame Commandment, they all walk in one Way, they all Pray by one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, they have <hi>a life that is common</hi>: look as one lives, ſo lives another; look as one repents, ſo another repents; look as one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, ſo another believes; and look as one apprehends of God, and comes before him with affection, and fear, and trembling, ſo doth another; though they never ſaw one another, yet they all meet in the ſame life, for <hi>they have the ſame root of life, the ſame cauſe of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Fourth place, <hi>It makes a man to be of one conſent with all the people of God every where</hi>;<note place="margin">It makes of one conſent with all the people of God.</note> As you may ſee, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the Name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent.</hi> The Lord helps them all to Pray after one pure language, and gives them all one pure conſent in the Service of God (though it is in different degrees indeed, one ariſeth to an higher pitch than another) therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you brethren, by the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye ſpeak all the ſame things, that there be no diviſions among you</hi>: As who ſhould ſay, All the Members of Chriſt are ſo, I beſeech you endeavour to have this ſign of being Members of Chriſt, be all joyned together in the ſame mind; it is true, that this union, and conſent, and agreement, and oneneſs of heart and mind (as I may call it) is very imperfect, but in ſome it is more imperfect then it is in other, ſome have attained to a further degree, there is a great deal of unlikeneſs of affections, a great deal of unlikeneſs in Prayer, a great deal of unlikeneſs in Obedience, there is a great deal of jarrings now and then through weakneſs; but as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As far as we have attained, let us be thus minded,</hi> Phil. 3.15, 16. Let us walk by the ſame rule, and mind the ſame things; the Children of God throughout the whole world, they are of one mind, as far as they have attained, though in Faith, in Repentance, in new Obedience they differ gradually in their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet they all agree in this conſent of judgment, That ſin muſt be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that a man muſt live in no ſin, that a man muſt yield Obedience to all Gods commandments, that a man muſt deny himſelf in all things, that in all things God muſt be glorified; they all agree that we are Members one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and that we muſt love one another, and forgive one another, as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us; they all agree in this, They are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94114:161"/>
all of one mind: and as one is mortified, ſo is the other; and as one is meek and gentle, ſo is the other: It is true indeed, one hath attained fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then another; but whereunto they have attained, they are all alike minded: Now whereunto we have not attained, God will reveal it in his good time unto us, ſaith the Apoſtle: May be one ſeeth ſuch a thing is a duty, which another doth not, yet all ſee that it is their duty to fear God, and obey him in all their wayes, and they all ſet themſelves to hate and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all manner of known ſins: <hi>As far as they have attained, they are all of one minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">For mutual care and help.</note>Fifthly, <hi>All this is for mutual profit, and help, and care, and ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> as you may ſee delivered by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>That it muſt be for mutual profit,</hi> ſee the ſeventh <hi>verſ.</hi> The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal; that is, when the Spirit of God doth manifeſt himſelf in one man one way, and in another man another way; he gives one man (may be) the gift of Teaching, to another man the gift of Knowledge; ſome have excellent gifts in one kind, ſome in another (but all have the gifts of new Obedience.) Now look whatſoever gifts they are, whenſoever the Spirit doth manifeſt it ſelf to any Member of the Body of Chriſt, it is to be helpful and uſeful to others, ſo that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt need one another: that you may ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.22. <hi>The eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee: nor the head to the foot, I have no need of thee, &amp;c.</hi> We cannot be without the pooreſt, and vileſt, and contemptibleſt Member in the Body; nay, the very life of the Body may depend upon the vileſt Members.</p>
               <p>So again, <hi>That they are to care for one another</hi>; That you may ſee in the 25. <hi>verſe; Leſt there ſhould be any diviſion in the Body, but that the Members ſhould have the ſame care one for another.</hi> You ſee how it is in the Body of a man, the head hath care of the feet, it guides the feet; and the foot hath care of the head, to hold it up, and carry it up and down; and the hand is uſeful for the relieving of any part, they have all the ſame care one of another, ſo it is in the Body of Chriſt. And for a <hi>Sympathy,</hi> ſee it in the 26. <hi>verſe, Wherefore if one Member ſuffer, all ſuffer with it; and if one Member rejoyce, all rejoyce with it</hi>; all have a fellow-feeling of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neceſſities and comforts. Therefore when the Spirit of God doth implant a man into the Body of Chriſt, it is all one with the implanting a man into Chriſt, he doth give him a common life, one minde and heart, he doth give them all natural help, and natural care one of another, for they have need one of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That this is the Spirits work.</note>In the Third place we muſt ſhew, <hi>That the Spirit doth this,</hi> And <hi>why he doth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is the Spirit that unites and tyeth all theſe Members toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; This makes them hang together; therefore it is called, <hi>the unity of the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4.3. He exhorts the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that were the Members of Chriſt, <hi>to keep the unity of the Spirit</hi>; becauſe as the Members of Chriſt are united to Chriſt, ſo they are united mutually by the Spirit; <hi>Therefore take heed</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to keep the unity of the Spirit, that you may be of one mind, and one heart</hi>: Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Body of Chriſt, he compares it to a building; A building conſiſts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers bricks, and ſtones, and timber, which being joyned together, make up an houſe: So the Members of Chriſt being joyned together, make up an houſe for God to dwell in: But who makes this? The text ſaith, <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> Eph. 2.22. The Spirit of God makes up this bleſſed building, all the elect of God, all the faithful, all the heirs of Grace in the world, are as an houſe or body: though there be never ſo many parts in it, yet
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94114:161"/>
they make all but one body or houſe, ſo it is here; Now the Spirit unites theſe, and layes them artificially together, ſo that they may prop one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. The Lord there ſpeaking of his Elect, <hi>I will give them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one heart, and make them of one mind</hi>; How will he do it? <hi>I will put a new Spirit within them</hi>; And ſo he makes them <hi>to be of one and the ſelf ſame mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Reaſon, <hi>Why the Spirit of God doth do this,</hi> is,<note place="margin">Reaſons why the Spirit of God doth thus unite to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe none elſe beſides the Spirit is able to do it</hi>:<note place="margin">None but the Spirit is able.</note> For by nature we are wofully and fearfully different from the Body of Chriſt, we are of another nature, of another kind, of another life; nay, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it: all the Members of Chriſt, they are as young ſucking chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but wicked men, and all men by nature are Lions, and Leopards, and Bears, and Tigers, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6, 7. Now the Prophet there ſpeaking how Chriſt means to effect it, is to unite theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to make the Lion and the Lamb to have communion together, to make the Bear and the Kid to lye down together: Mark how he ſheweth how Chriſt will do it, in the ſecond <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> the text ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him</hi>; he ſpeaks of Chriſt; that is, whereas this requires a great deal of power to do this, to make a man to be clean contrary to his nature; whenas a mans nature is carnal, and wicked, and earthly, to make him of the Body of Chriſt; therefore ſaith the text, <hi>The Spirit of Might ſhall be upon him, &amp;c.</hi> There is a great deal of Might required to turn their diſpoſitions: it is a mighty thing to change a man that is a drunkard, a proud perſon, a wicked wretch; to turn this man topſie-turvy, to make him mind other things, to make him clean another man; this requires infinite wiſdom: Therefore <hi>the Spirit of Wiſdom ſhall reſt upon him</hi> to do it; and <hi>the Spirit of Knowledge, and the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord</hi>; that is, the Lord Jeſus ſhall put in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Fear into mens hearts, and this will turn them, this will alter mens minds, and converſations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There is none ſo fit as the Spirit of God to do it:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">None but the Spirit is fit to do it.</note> For this Body of Chriſt, it is a company of Sons and Daughters that God hath up and down in the world, that are able to cry, Abba Father: now who is ſo fit to do this as the Spirit of the Son? As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That he might redeem them that were under the Law, that they might receive the Adoption of Sons,</hi> Gal. 4.5.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>How the Spirit of God doth this</hi>;<note place="margin">How the Spirit doth Unite to Chriſt's Body.</note> and that is <hi>Two wayes,</hi> as the Scripture reveals to us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>One</hi> is, <hi>By being one and the ſame Spirit in all the Members of Chriſt</hi>:<note place="margin">By being one and the ſame ſpirit in all Members.</note> He comes into them, and dwells in them as one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, and ſo makes up this union: The ſame Spirit that was in <hi>Paul,</hi> was in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; and ſo all the reſt of the Members of Chriſt one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit is in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Know ye not that yeare the Temple of God, and that the Spirit dwelleth in you?</hi> Therefore look what Spirit of Faith one man hath, another comes to have the ſame Spirit of Faith; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. <hi>We having the ſame Spirit of Faith with them, as it is written, I believe, and therefore I ſpeak; ſo we believe, and therefore we ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Spirit doth this by uniting and tying a knot between theſe Members:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By tying a knot between all the Members.</note> He doth unite them, and make them hang together in one; he makes them to be of one heart, and of one ſoul by knitting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining of their hearts all together: Therefore this fellowſhip is called the <hi>fellowſhip of the Spirit,</hi> Phil. 2.1. Though <hi>Paul</hi> were far off from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> yet he could adjure the <hi>Philippians</hi> by <hi>the fellowſhip of the Spirit.</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:94114:162"/>
But you will ſay, How can this be? Can the people of God have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowſhip one with another when they are ſo far aſunder one from another, and may be never ſaw one another, may be never heard one of another? How can this be? I ſay, Very well: for the Spirit of God hath a long arm, and is able to make the people of God ſhake hands, though they be a thouſand miles aſunder; it is the Spirit that tyeth this knot, and unites them together: As <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Though I be abſent in the Fleſh, yet I am preſent with you in the Spirit</hi>; and methinks I am in your company and meetings; when you meet together; I ſee you in my mind me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, and <hi>I joy in your order</hi>: The Spirit makes the communion between the people of God; and hence it is that they can love one another, becauſe all the Members are tyed together by one knot; and they come to help one another, and do any thing one for another; even by the very love of the Spirit which they have one towards another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15 30. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had ſome need of the good <hi>Romans</hi> to help him: Now ſee how he doth intreat help from them: he deſires them by <hi>the love of the Spirit, to pray heartily for him</hi>: he knew that the <hi>love of the Spirit</hi> would be a great motive to them: you know you and I are joyned together by the ſame Spirit, <hi>for the love of the Spirit pray for me.</hi> Thus we ſee,</p>

                  </hi> Is it ſo that the Spirit of God doth unite all the Saints of God together in one Body? <hi>Then here we may ſee the reaſon of the difference of men in the world</hi>: The difference of our Congregations; ſome companies that hang together are of one mind, another of another mind; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, they have a different Spirit; but all the Saints of God have the Spirit of God which makes them hang together; and the wicked, they have another Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Let none put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder what the Spirit joyns.</note> Doth the Spirit of God joyn all the Saints of God together in one Body? <hi>Then that which God hath joyned together, let no man put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</hi> It is ſpoken in regard of man and wife; if it be ſuch a horrible thing to part man and wife, then what a horrible thing is it to part Saint and Saint that are joyned together by the Spirit of God; this bleſſed communion of the Spirit, what a fearful thing is it for a man to root it out? When there ſhall be heart-burnings and ſtrivings between thoſe that are the children of God, what a fearful thing is this? Is the number of thoſe that fear God ſo great, that we can ſpare any? Or are the Graces of Gods Spirit Wilderneſs Graces, that can walk alone and need no help from, or can do no good to others? Therefore the Apoſtle prayeth God in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Corinthians, That the Members of Chriſt may be of one minde, and live in peace,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.11.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> upon God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.10, 11. <hi>Abijah</hi> there ſpeaking againſt <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the King of Iſrael, though himſelf had no great goodneſs in him, he ſaith, <hi>The Lord is our God, and we offer ſacrifices, and burn ſweet incenſe every day</hi>; Every day they did it; as who ſhould ſay, it were a ſign that God were not amongſt us, if we did not this: he takes it as a principle written in the conſcience, though he were a natural man, yet he doth reaſon thus, that where there is not every day ſome time for Gods Worſhip, God is not amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Another Reaſon is, Becauſe every morning God reneweth his Mercies,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> and every evening they are continued to us, as the Church ſaith in the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> ch. 3.23. <hi>Every morning his mercies are renewed to us, and in the evening his compaſſions fail not</hi>; therefore every morning we are to ſet our ſelves before God, to ask of him the forgiveneſſe of our ſins; every morning and evening we are to do this. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.1, 2. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, to ſing praiſes to thy Name, O thou moſt High; To ſhew forth thy loving kindneſs in the morning, and thy faithfulneſs every night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then again God is the Alpha, and Omega, he is the beginning, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> the ending of all things, and of all actions we do; God ſhould therefore have the beginning and ending of every day, that the Worſhip of God may have the ſtart of all other actions; it is neceſſary it ſhould be ſo: when a man firſt awakes in the morning, God ſhould be the firſt thought that ſhould come into his mind; As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>My voice will I lift up unto thee in the morning</hi>; as ſoon as ever he awakes in the morning, his heart is lifted up to God: ſo it is good for a man to make the firſt part of the day holy, that the reſt of the day may be thereafter: and ſo as we are to begin the day with the ſolemn Worſhip of God, ſo we are to end it in the evening, that we may reckon up all our accounts, and make even with God; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath</hi>: ſo let not the Sun go down upon a dead heart, upon a carnal heart, upon a worldly heart; but as the Sun goeth down upon our bodies, ſo let the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſet upon our hearts, that we may lye down in peace, having all our reckoning made even, and all ſcores cancelled.</p>
               <p>The Third Propoſition is this, As there muſt be ſome time for Gods immediate Service, and there muſt be every day ſome ſet time,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 4. <hi>A</hi> particular ſpecial day for Gods worſhip.</note>The Fourth Propoſition is this, As there muſt be a ſet time every day, and we are to keep every day as a Sabbath day in ſome ſenſe, ſo there muſt be a particular ſpecial day, ſet apart for Gods immediate Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: This is the next Propoſition I will prove unto you; for though every day is to be a Sabbath day, yet we have particular callings, and we have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe in the world to employ our ſelves about, ſo that we cannot be every day hearing of the Word, and employing our ſelves in Prayer and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al exerciſes; though every day we are to keep it holy, yet we cannot be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant wholly and totally every day; Now therefore I ſay, That there is a ſet day that the Lord hath called for to be devoted unto him: The very School-men themſelves do acknowledge this, and the very Heathen have found it out; They have ſet a day apart for the Service of their Gods, which they call their holy day, wherein they lay aſide all other buſineſſe, and ſet themſelves apart to honor and worſhip their Images and Idols, according to their manner. Now I will make this good by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that God will have a ſet day, beſides the every day Sabbath, he will have a ſet particular Sabbath for his Worſhip and Service.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> The Firſt Reaſon is, Becauſe he will have a little emblem and picture of the kingdom of heaven among his Saints and Children in this life; in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven there is no buying and ſelling, no eating and drinking, no worldly buſineſſe, there is nothing but prayſing and glorifying of God, and ſpeaking of God, and ſinging of Halelujah unto his holy Name; there
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94114:164"/>
is nothing but enjoying communion with the Lord, and feeding upon him continually, there is nothing but this in the kingdom of heaven; Now God will have a little picture of this among his Saints here upon earth: You know <hi>there remains a reſt for the people of God,</hi> Heb. 4.9. It is an expreſs place, the word in the Original is, <hi>There remains a Sabbath for the people of God.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, There is a glorious Sabbath that all the Elect of God ſhall have, and they are preſerved for it, and that is reſerved for them, and they ſhall enter into it, when this body of death is laid down, and they ſhall enjoy God face to face, to all eternity, they ſhall behold him as he is, and have communion with him; now the Lord will have a little picture of this here in this life; we cannot have it altogether in this life, for we have mortal bodies, that muſt be fed, and cloathed, and ſtand in need of the creature; for mans ſin is not yet purged away, but there is a great deal of rubbiſh ſtill left, therefore this cannot be complete here: but yet God will have a little picture or this, even in this life, and that is the Sabbath day, wherein they are to lay aſide all the works of their ordinary callings, and reſt from all ſervil labours, this is Gods day, and we muſt now call upon him, and hear what he ſaith, and wholly employ, and occupy our ſelves about him, as neer as we poſſibly can; but now, this we cannot do every day, for we have Children to look after, and Families to provide for, and there be an hundred occaſions to call a man away; it may be a man thinks to go into his Cloſet, and ſeek God in private, and one occaſion or other calls him aſide, that he cannot go on; but the Lord will have a little em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem and expreſſion of the kingdom of heaven upon the Sabbath day: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith, It <hi>remains for us,</hi> ſcil. <hi>in the life to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second Reaſon, why the Lord will have a ſet day for his Worſhip and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> Service beſides the every day Sabbath, is becauſe the honour of God doth ſo require, it doth require that there ſhould be a ſolemn day for Gods Service; as Kings, though their ſubjects are to obey them every day, and keep their Laws every day, and if a ſubject tranſgreſs the Laws at any time, he is in danger of the diſpleaſure of the King; but he will have one day of ſolemnity to his Majeſty: So God Almighty, though every day we are to tremble before him, and ſtand in aw of his Word, and take heed we do not err from his Commandments, yet he will have one ſolemn day for the honour of his Name, he will have a ſolemn day; wherein his people ſhall have nothing elſe to do, but to ſet themſelves apart for his Worſhip; therefore this ſet day is called, <hi>The honourable of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 58.13. that is, we muſt count the Sabbath day an honourable day, a day of honour, wherein Gods Servants ſhould from morning to evening fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and confeſs that great is the Lord God: We ſhould wholly dedicate it unto him, ſeeking of him in Publick and in Private, that we may ſtore up holy affections for all the week following.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe God ſometimes calls for an extraordinary day, and an <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> extraordinary day hath ever relation to an ordinary; if I ſay this is my extraordinary food and diet, I imply that I have ordinary diet: ſo if the Scripture tells us that God calls for extraordinary dayes, it is an evident Argument, that there be ordinary dayes which he calls for.</p>
               <p>Now that God calls for extraordinary dayes, it is plain,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, He calls for extraordinary dayes of rejoycing; when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth us about with ſongs of Deliverance, and works wonderful Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies for us, we ought to ſet a part a day for rejoycing, and delighting in his goodneſs and favour towards us, and this day is to be an holy day, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 8.9. <hi>This day is holy unto the Lord your God, mourn not, nor weep</hi>; So that when we are to rejoyce towards God for any ſpiritual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94114:165"/>
towards us, we ought to keep this day an holy day, we ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the hours of the day in labouring to affect our hearts with his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and labouring to make his goodneſs to have impreſſion upon us, that we may with cheerfulneſs run over all our dayes afterwards, that we may adhere unto him the better all our life time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, As he calls for extraordinary dayes of rejoycing, ſo he calls for extraordinary dayes of Faſting and Humiliation, and that in Four Caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, When we fear ſome heavie judgement to come upon us, or elſe when ſome judgement is already upon us: may be ſome heavie judgement is upon us, or elſe we fear it to come upon us, and now we are to ſet an extraordinary day apart to ſeek the Lord, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat</hi> proclaimed a Faſt, when the Land was in danger: Suppoſe the Lord ſhould take away the Goſpel, and the feet of thoſe that bring glad tydings ſhould be turned from us, then ſhould we Faſt in thoſe dayes, we ſhould grieve before God, and bewail the loſs of his Mercies and Favours; that we may have his Goodneſſe to quicken us, and keep us, and uphold us in the want of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, In caſe that we want ſome Mercy that we cannot well be without, in ſuch a caſe as this, if ordinary ſeeking will not do the deed, we ought to ſet apart an extraordinary time to prevail with God; as <hi>Ezra,</hi> he was in danger of the enemy, and if he ſhould go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would ſet upon him; now, thought he, if I ſhould go to the King, though he were very great with the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> at that time, yet thought he, if I ſhould go to the Kigng for a Band of Souldiers, he would think our God were a weak God; I have told him what a ſtrong God we have, and that he is ready to help all thoſe that truſt in him; now if I ſhould go to him for a Band of Souldiers, he might think that our God were not able to deliver us, and it would be a great diſhonour to God; therefore he ſet a day apart for a Faſt, and laboured to get aid and help from heaven, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.21. So when a Child of God is exceedingly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with any croſſe or temptation, and he ſhall wonderfully diſhonour God, and caſt a ſnare upon them that fear his Name, in this caſe he is bound to ſeek God extraordinarily, and if the ordinary means that God hath appointed will not prevail, he is to ſet a part a Faſt to ſeek him extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, If we be aſſaulted from hell, and Satan, and our own hearts, with ſtrong temptations, then we are to ſeek God extraordinarily; as it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> when the Meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him, when he lay under ſome heavy temptation, either unto Pride, or Luſt, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, ſome prick in the fleſh, that the Lord ſent upon him, and let him be encountered withal; then <hi>Paul</hi> ſought God in a ſolemn manner, more then ever he did at other times, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. <hi>For this I beſought God thrice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, In caſe a man is to do ſome notable ſervice, he is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into ſome new Calling; or if the Lord doth put him upon ſome new ſervice, that doth require ſome more then ordinary help, now a man is to ſeek God by Faſting and Prayer, as you may ſee it was with <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> when they entred into the Miniſtery, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I name theſe things is to ſhew you, that ſometimes God will have an extraodinary ſet day for his immediate worſhip and ſervice, when we are to lay aſide all other buſineſſe, and ſet our ſelves apart, to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Name, and ſeek him. The thing I gather from hence is this, If there be an extraordinary ſet day, then there muſt be an ordinary ſet day for Gods immediate Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:94114:165"/>Another Argument is taken from the Equity of it, and that ſtands Two wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, It is very equal when as we have ſix dayes to provide for our <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label> ſelves, and for the maintenance of our bodies: God gives us divers dayes for that; now Equity doth require that we ſhould give one day to him, we having ſeveral dayes; it is equity that he ſhould have at leaſt one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Therefore this doth aggravate our ſins exceedingly, if we give not this day to God. Did not this aggravate the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> in eating of the forbidden fruit? in that God gave him liberty to eat freely of all other trees in the garden, and forbad him only the eating of that one? Now what excuſe could <hi>Adam</hi> have for not abſtaining from that one? So here, God having given us divers dayes for the good of our bodies, and for means and maintenance of the things of this life; duty requires, that we ſhould not touch Gods day, nor ſet our foot upon it, nor turn our eyes away from it, we ought to remember it; as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid in regard of his Miſtris, when ſhe enticed him to folly; mark how he anſwers the temptation; <hi>My Maſter hath put all things into my hands that are in the houſe, he hath with-hold nothing from me but only thee his Wife,</hi> and that is equal, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, <hi>how therefore ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin agaiſt God?</hi> Gen. 39.9. So ſhould we ſay, when we are tempted to break the Lords day, we ſhould ſay, The Lord hath not impoſed any day beſides, the Lord hath given us all the ſix daies for our uſe, how therefore ſhall I do this great wickedneſſe, and ſin againſt God with worldly thoughts, and ſpeeches, and actions upon that day? It ſtands with very good equity that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, It ſtands with equity, in regard of our Souls; if our bodies which are the worſer part, have ſeveral dayes for their uſe, then how much more ſhould the ſoul have one day, which is a thouſand times more worth then the body? You know what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> Matth. 16.26. Our ſouls are more worth then our bodies, and we have more need to ſeek out for Holineſſe and Grace for them, and to be well provided for in regard of them, then for any thing in this preſent world; if we want meat; we can but ſtarve; if we want cloaths, we can but famiſh; if we want outward things, we can but temporally periſh; but if we want Grace and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, we periſh for ever. Now if there be ſix dayes allowed for the good of our bodies, how much more ſhould we be willing to have one day for the good of our ſouls, ſpecially conſidering what need we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? This Argument our Saviour Chriſt uſeth to prove the Sabbath, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.27. <hi>The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath</hi>: The Sabbath was made for man, as meat was made for the body; and a man cannot be without food, no more can the ſoul be without the Sabbath; ſo that we ſee, there muſt be a ſolemn day ſet a part for Gods Worſhip and Service.</p>
               <p>The Fifth, Propoſition is this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 5. One day of Seven to be ſet apart for Gods worſhip.</note> That as there muſt be a ſet day for Gods Worſhip and Service, ſo this day muſt be one of ſeven, not one of eight, or nine, or five, or four, but one of ſeven; and this, though it be not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally moral, yet it is poſitively moral, though it be not natural, written in the heart of man, as a man: if he had no teaching, his conſcience would find out that he ſhould not be idle, and ſteal, commit murther; the Conſcience will grope out theſe Ordinances and Statutes of God; and the Conſcience will find out that there muſt be a ſet day for Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service; the light of nature will find out that, but that it muſt be one day of ſeven, that it cannot find out; but I ſay,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94114:166"/>
that it is the poſitive law of God, that it muſt be one of ſeven.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> Now, Becauſe it is not written in the heart of man, but in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God poſitively delivered to us, and required of us; I can give no other Reaſon for it, but only the reaſon taken out of the Scripture; there can be no reaſon taken from the judgment of man, as other Lawes, the very law of Reaſon will enforce them; but there can be no other reaſon for this, but only out of the Word of God. The Lord hath commanded, ſix dayes thou ſhalt labour, and being his Will, it muſt be performed; for God might require ſix dayes for himſelf, and leave us but one day; God might have ordained it ſo; but God intending we ſhould live by the ſweat of our brows, the Lord was pleaſed to allow us ſix dayes; now he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us ſix dayes, doth reſerve unto himſelf one of ſeven.</p>

It is no ſtrange thing; to ſee ſome things in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are not eſſential to them, becauſe the Commandments were delivered to the Jewes: though they concern the whole world, yet the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that actually ſtood before God, when the Decalogue was delivered, were only the Jewes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.22. God ſpake to the Jewes; now no wonder, that God, ſpeaking to the Jews, did ſpeak divers particulars according to them, and in their phraſe, which if we had been alive, and they to ſucceed us, God would have ſpoken according to us, as he did according to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, We ſee plainly, there are ſome things in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which do not concern the whole world, but only the Nation of the Jewes, as in the firſt Commandment, <hi>I have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the houſe of Bondage: [Thou ſhalt have no other gods but me:]</hi> That is the Commandment; but though they, together with the other, were put into the Tables of Stone, yet it concerns only the Jewes. 'Tis true indeed, it is a type of our deliverance, that we are delivered from Hell, and Sin, and Satan, as they were delivered out of Egypt, and the houſe of Bondage; but literally theſe words belong only to the Jews; and the Commandment is this, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods but me</hi>; So it is for the fourth Commandment.</p>
               <p>Again, There is ſomething in the Fifth Commandment, that doth not concern us, but only them; <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, &amp;c. [That thy dayes may be long in the Land which the thy God giveth thee]</hi> that belongs only to the Jews, it is meant particularly of the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> This then is the effect of the Commandment, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy dayes may be long in the Land of</hi> Canaan. So that the firſt words are the Commandment, and the later part belongs only to the Jewes: So <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.14. the Fourth Commandment, it was put into the Tables of Stone thus, <hi>Remember the ſeventh day to keep it holy, for the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou ſhalt do no manner of work, thou; nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, &amp;c. that thy man-ſervant, and thy maid-ſervant may reſt as well as thou</hi>; that belongs to us, as well as to them, but then it follows, <hi>Remember thou wert a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the Land of Egypt</hi>: Here you ſee the Jewes have another Argument, beſides the Arguments that we have; but though we have not that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet the Commandment ſtands ſtill, and the Commandment is only thus
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94114:167"/>
much; namely, That there muſt be a Seventh day, and that ſeventh day God reſted upon: now whereas the Jewes kept the laſt day of the week, that was only by a temporary Commandment, becauſe the making of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, was the greateſt thing that God had then done, and God reſted from that upon that day; but now if God work a greater work then the Creating of heaven and earth, and reſt from that, then by vertue of the fourth Commandment, we are to keep that day holy, upon which he reſted from that work.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> The Firſt Reaſon is, Becauſe God did inſtitute the Sabbath before there was any room for Ceremonies; it was commanded to <hi>Adam</hi> in his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: Now all Ceremonies did prefigure Chriſt; and before <hi>Adam</hi> fell, there was no Promiſe of the Seed of the Woman, nor no need of it, and ſo no need of a Figure to repreſent it; but before <hi>Adam</hi> fell, the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was preſcribed, Gen. 2.2, 3. <hi>On the ſeventh day God reſted from all that he had made, ſo that God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it:</hi> So that you ſee God having reſted upon this day, he ſanctified it, and put holineſs upon it; therefore we are not to name that Common, which he hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Holy; now though we do not read of <hi>Adams</hi> keeping this day, nor <hi>Abels,</hi> nor <hi>Enochs,</hi> nor <hi>Noahs,</hi> nor <hi>Abrahams,</hi> nor <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> nor <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>; yet it doth not follow it was not kept: for <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not take in hand to ſet down the actions of the Fathers, but only generally; for you ſee what a ſhort ſtory we have of <hi>Methuſhelab,</hi> a good man, though he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a thouſand years almoſt, yet we have ſcarce Three Syllables concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. Now ſith <hi>Moſes</hi> did not undertake to ſet down all that they did, therefore they might keep the Sabbath, though he did not ſet it down: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afterwards doth he ſet it down for 319. years, and 111. years, which 430. years, to the time of the Judges, we have nothing ſpoken of concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sabbath; therefore ſeeing God did Inſtitute it to <hi>Adam</hi> in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, that is enough; but what though the Fathers had not kept it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth it therefore follow that we muſt not keep it holy? They had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wives, doth it therefore follow that we muſt have many wives? So, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they did not ſanctifie the ſeventh day, (though wee can ſee no proof that they did not) yet this is enough, That God did ſanctifie it before any Ceremony was.</p>
               <p>Again, Though we do not read that they practiſed this, yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth intimate to us that they did it.</p>

of ſtone and put into the Ark, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.18. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. the Commandments were written upon Two tables of ſtone, and by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God; Now all Divines, in all ages, agree upon this, that the writing of this Commandment in the Two tables of ſtone, is an evident Argument of the morality of it. For as a Reverend Divine ſaith, Not to think the Fourth Commandment to be moral, is the way to all Atheiſme; for if one ſhould ſay the Fourth Commandment is not moral, but cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial; another might ſtep up the next year and ſay the Second, and the Fifth, is not: So that whereas the Law is written by the finger of God in tables of ſtone, if we root it out of the tables of ſtone, we ſhall root it out of the heart of man; therefore the writing of it in the tables of ſtone, is an evident Argument of the morality of it to all ages.</p>
               <p>A Fourth Argument is this, The Lord doth urge this Commandment,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label> more then any other Commandment in the Decalogue; ſo that a man may queſtion the Firſt, or Second, or any of the Ten as well as this; for firſt we know that God hath made this Commandment larger then any of the reſt: Secondly, hee hath made it ſtronger, and urged it with more argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then any of the reſt. 3. He hath fixed a <hi>memento,</hi> remember be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it: As who ſhould ſay, Be carefull of this, and take heed of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, take heed of thoſe that ſhall teach you the contrary, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is not morall. 4. It is negatively delivered, and affirmatively; the other delivered only one way; either affirmatively only, as the Fifth, <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother</hi>: or elſe negatively only, as all the reſt: There is never a Commandment delivered both negatively and affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, but only the Fourth, as, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy</hi>; there it is delivered affirmatively: And afterwards it is delivered nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>In it thou ſhalt do no manner of work, thou, nor thy ſon, nor thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord hath delivered it both wayes; noting, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is equall and equipollent with the other: and the Lord did this in infinite wiſdome, becauſe he had not written this Commandment in the heart of man by the light of nature, therefore the Lord did urge it more with Arguments, that what was wanting in the light of nature, might be ſupplyed by the preſſing of Arguments.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another Argument is, Becauſe if this be not morall, then we have <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>5</label> not Ten morall Commandments, there are but Nine: now this is falſe; for the Scripture tels us, that the Commandments are <hi>Ten,</hi> as <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.4. it is not an Eccleſiaſticall thing, but the Lord hath ſaid it, as you may ſee there: <hi>And he wrote upon the Tables according to the firſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Ten Commandments, which the Lord ſpake unto you in the Mount, out of the midſt of the fire.</hi> The Lord ſpake <hi>Ten</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; now if the Fourth Commandment be not morall, there be not ten Commandments: And you may as well deny the Articles of the Faith, and the Petitions of the Lords Prayer, as the ten Commandments.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> Argument is this; Chriſt tels us plainely, that it is a <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>6</label> morall Commandment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.20. <hi>Pray</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the Sabbath day.</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was forty yeares after Chriſts Aſcenſion, when all Ceremonies were ceaſed, as <hi>Paul</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> That <hi>if any man would be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhould profit him nothing, Galat.</hi> 5.2.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.2</note> That is, if he would keep the Ceremonial Law: Now Chriſt bids thoſe that ſhould live forty years after the Ceremonies were ceaſed, I would have you have a care of the Sabbath, and delight in hearing of the word of God, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating upon it, and ſo forth; and if any occaſion come that you fall
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94114:168"/>
into the hands of your enemies, pray that your flight be not in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor on the Sabbath day: as who ſhould ſay, If it be in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that will do hurt, and be troubleſome to your bodies: and ſo if you fly upon the Sabbath day, that will trouble your conſciences, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Gods commandment and the good of your own conſciences; if you regard or fear Gods name, it will grieve you to fly on the Sabbath day, whereby you ſhall be deprived of the Congregation of Gods Saints; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray that your flight be not upon that day: Intimating, that it was Morall; for if it had been Ceremoniall, he would not have wiſhed them to pray that it might not be upon that day.</p>
               <p>Now whereas our Saviour doth ſo often condemn the Phariſees in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their ſtrictneſſe of the Sabbath; it is not as if he did diſallow the keeping of it; but they were fooliſhly preciſe, they ſtrained at a gnat, and ſwallowed a camel; they crowded out, and regarded not Mercy and Judgment, they would not pull a poor beaſt out of a pit, or relieve a poor man upon the Sabbath day: they found fault that a man ſhould be helped from deaths door by our Saviour upon the Sabbath, this was their folly. Now our Saviour did not condemn ſtrict keeping of the Sabbath, but he did condemn their Superſtition; for ever ſince <hi>Adams</hi> time, it was lawful to do works of Mercy on the Sabbath, it was Lawful to pull a beaſt out of the pit, and do works of Mercy, and Neceſſity upon the Sabbath day. And, whereas the Law ſaith,<note place="margin">Exod. 35.3</note> The Jewes might not kindle a fire on the Sabbath day, if we were in their caſe, we might not neither; for they were in the Wilderneſſe, in an hot Countrey, where they needed no Fire, and having their Food provided to their hands. And being in an hot Countrey, if they kindled a Fire, it was out of wantonneſſe, but if it had been a cold Countrey, in <hi>Adams</hi> time, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and in all times, it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to kindle a Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>7</label> Againe, another Argument is this, The very Heathen themſelves have ever kept a Sabbath day, though they could not tell which the day was; ſome kept the Eighth day, and ſome the Ninth, yet they ever kept a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: Yea, it is certain, many of the Heathen themſelves kept the Sabbath after their manner. <hi>Alexandrinus,</hi> a godly Father, that lived but a little after Chriſt, ſaith, That the Heathen did count the Seventh day, an Holy day. And it is related of <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> though he were a Pagan, and Infidel, yet every Sabbath day, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from his Warlike affaires, and went up into the Capitol to worſhip his gods. And it is reported againe in Heathen Hiſtories, our boyes go not to School upon the Sabbath day, neither are Humane Arts taught on that day; but we have a Reſt upon that day: Nay, ſome of the Heathens tell us, That they keep it from the Creation; therefore <hi>Philo</hi> tells us, That the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, is the Creation day: and divers other poor people, that never had Scripture, or Prophet, or Miniſter among them, but went meerly by the light of Nature, and what they had learned from their Anceſtors and Fathers, they did keep the Sabbath day. Nay, one of them ſaith, That on the Seventh day, all the Hoſt of Heaven and Earth was finiſhed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing the very Heathen have learned to keep this day Holy, it is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Argument, that this is a Moral Commandement. I conclude the Proof of this Point, with the ſaying of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſhall paſſe away, but not one jot or title of the Law ſhall paſſe away</hi>: Marke, our Saviour ſaith there, that there ſhall not one jot or title of the Decalogue paſſe away. As for the Ceremonial, and Judicial law, they ſtand not ſtill, but the whole compaſſe of them is removed, the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law is quite and clean aboliſhed; and the Judicial Law, in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94114:168"/>
therefore our Saviour meant it not of thoſe two Laws, but he ſpeaks of the Decalogue, and he ſaith, <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſſe away, before one jot of it ſhall paſſe away,</hi> much leſſe an whole branch be rooted out. And Gal. 3.10. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in all things that are written in this Law to do them</hi>: not only he that continueth not in the firſt, or ſecond, or third Commandment, but he that continueth not in the fourth, and fifth, and all the reſt. And <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there ſaith, <hi>If a man ſhould keep the whole Law of God, and be guilty only in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> Suppoſe thou didſt keep the Three firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and all the Six laſt, if thou keepeſt not the Fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou art guilty of the breach of all the Commandments.</p>
               <p>I let this paſſe, and come now to the laſt Propoſition, which is this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 9. The firſt day of the week was the Lords day, and ſo to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the end of the world.</note> That though the laſt day of the week were kept for the Sabbath, till the coming of Chriſt, yet the firſt day of the week, that ſeventh day, is now the Lords Day, and is ſo to continue to the end of the World: I frame it thus, The change of the ſeventh day, to the firſt day of the week, is not by Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Law, or by the Law of man, or Apoſtolical Tradition, but it is by the Inſtitution, and expreſs Commandment of God.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument to prove it, is taken out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.24. It is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <label type="milestone">

The thing is plain, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.1, 2. the Prophet Prophecyeth of the Day of Chriſt, and ſaith, They are bleſſed that keep the Sabbath, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord, Keep Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Juſtice, for my Salvation is at hand to come, and my Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to be revealed: Bleſſed is the man that doth this, and keepeth my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths.</hi> This is a Prophecie of the day of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt and he pronounceth a bleſſing upon thoſe that keep the Sabbath in thoſe dayes. Again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.10. it was Prophecied of old, that the firſt day of the week, ſhould be the Sabbath day, the Lords day: <hi>In that day, there ſhall be a Root of Jeſſe, which ſhall ſtand up for an Enſigne to the people, and the Nations ſhall flie unto it, and his Reſt ſhall be Glorious</hi>: Not only the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Reſt ſhall be glorious, when he had Created Heaven, and Earth, and reſted the ſeventh day, but Chriſts Reſt alſo ſhall be glorious; for all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines agree, that the Prophet ſpeaks of the Reſt of Chriſt, from the work of Redemption; now his Reſt ſhall be glorious. As God the Father Reſted from his work, and his Reſt was glorious for four thouſand years together; ſo Chriſts Reſt from his work ſhall be glorious, there ſhall be glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour put upon it, as well as upon the Reſt of the Father, when he Reſted from making of Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Argument to prove this, is out of <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. there <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> Saint John ſpeaking of the firſt day of the week, the Spirit of the Lord calls it the Lords Day, <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords Day,</hi> ſo that it is not by Apoſtolical Tradition only, but by the Inſtitution of God himſelf, he doth call it <hi>the Lords Day, I was in the Spirit upon the Lords Day</hi>; he calls the firſt day of the week the Lords Day, by the ſame reaſon that the Sacrament
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94114:169"/>
is called the Lords Supper. Now the Sacrament is ſo called, becauſe the Lord Inſtituted it, and therefore it muſt be Holy: ſo the Lords Day is called ſo, becauſe the Lord Inſtituted it, and therefore it muſt be kept Holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> Another Argument is this, Our Saviour Chriſt himſelf doth Intitle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Lord of the Sabbath, and therefore able to alter it, and change it, and appoint what buſineſſe is to be done, and what not to be done, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that day; he doth openly profeſs, that he is <hi>Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> Mark 2.28. and <hi>John</hi> 5.23. he ſaith, <hi>They ſhall Honour the Son, as they Honour the Father</hi>; As they honour the Father with a Sabbath, in regard of his Reſt from the work of Creation, ſo they ſhall honour the Son with a Sabbath, in regard of his Reſt from the work of Redemption, which being compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. where it is called the Lords Day: Theſe two being put together, do plainly prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Chriſt himſelf did command his Apoſtles to keep this day, it was not by the Apoſtles counſel, as if they would ſet up this day in the Church, as ſome would have it; but Chriſt did command them ſo to do; for the Apoſtles did deliver nothing Generally to the Church, but what they received from the Lord, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>What I have received from the Lord, that I declare unto you,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. But I will prove it was the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt to them, by this Argument, Becauſe the firſt day of the week was alwayes kept for the aſſemblies of the people of God, before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles durſt order any thing in the Church: the Apoſtles never durſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſet up any order in the Church, until the Holy Ghoſt fell upon them in fiery tongues, and that was fourty dayes after. Now the firſt day of the week was kept long before this, <hi>John</hi> 20.19. they kept the firſt day of the week: and again the next week, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. they kept the firſt day of the week; and <hi>Luke</hi> 24. they kept the firſt day of the week. And if you compare three or four places of Scripture together, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.16, 20. together with <hi>John</hi> 20.19, 26. we ſhall ſee plainly in <hi>John,</hi> that they did meet upon the firſt day of the week, and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. we ſhall ſee that Chriſt appointed them ſo to do, it was by his Commandment.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>5</label>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another Argument to prove that it is by Divine Inſtitution, and not by Humane Ordinance, is this, Becauſe the Wiſdome of Jeſus Chriſt, would never have committed ſuch a weighty thing as this is to the Judgement of man. Certainly the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, before his aſcending up unto his Father, would never have left things to raw, and uncertain, and imperfect, as to leave ſuch a Branch of ſuch a Sacred Ordinance, to be at the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, being ſo apt to take liberty, and ſo negligent to keep any day Holy, ſurely the Lord would never have left it to the Arbitrament of men. Therefore we may well conclude, it is to be found in Scripture by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of God; for mark what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As Moſes was faithful in all his houſe, ſo Chriſt is faithful in all his houſe,</hi> Heb. 3.2, 3. He proves that Chriſt is more faithful then <hi>Moſes</hi>: Now <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful, for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the whole mind of God to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there was nothing left out, for time, or place, or manner; there was not any Ceremony in the worſhip of God left out, but he delivered all to them, he was faithful. So Chriſt is faithful in his houſe, therefore ſeeing Chriſt knew how ready men were to neglect, and prophane the Sabbath, plain reaſon tells us, that he would order it himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>6</label> Again, Who ſhould Inſtitute any Ordinance in the Church, but only he that is the Head of the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>7</label> Again, Another Argument is this, It hath been the Practice of all holy men ſince the Apoſtles daies, to keep this day. That it was the practice of the Apoſtles, that you will grant, that they kept the firſt day of the week.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94114:169"/>
Now if there were no Argument but this, that the Apoſtles did keep it, this were enough to prove the change of the day, when we find that the Apoſtles did ſanctifie this day, this were proof enough to ſtay our mindes; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they had a more Infallible guidance and direction then we have, and they inſiſted upon this day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1.2. They ordained, and John the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine kept this day, though he were in the place of his baniſhment, where he could hear no Sermon, but was all alone, yet he would keep the Sabbath, on the firſt day of the week, and the Lord rewarded his ſanctifying of this day, by declaring the Revelation unto him, to incourage all good people to go on in keeping this day. But to leave theſe, and come to the time of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, immediately after the Apoſtles; they all agree upon the firſt day of the week: <hi>Jgnatius</hi> doth ſo; and Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, as the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is among women, ſo is the firſt day of the week, among dayes; as ſhe was bleſſed above women, ſo is the firſt day of the week bleſſed above daies: No man that makes conſcience of his wayes, but ſhall find a bleſſing upon eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day; but God hath bleſſed this day in a more peculiar manner, and the ſoul that makes conſcience of the keeping of it, may by the Covenant of God expect a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the dead times of Popery, If ever the Sabbath was out of memory, and out of date, then was the time; for then there was a great falling away, a great forſaking, a great declining, and people hearkned to Doctrines of Divels, and Damnable Hereſies, and the whole world groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under Popery: Yet in the dead times of Popery there were abundance of Prophets, the Lord did keep their Judgements entire in this thing, as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> and <hi>Silveſter,</hi> and others, though they were Superſtitious Papiſts, yet they ſay, That the change of the Sabbath, from the laſt day of the week to the firſt, is by Divine Inſtitution. Now to come to the times of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, here we have abundance of Reverend men beyond the ſea, both in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> that maintain it is by Divine Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Another Argument is taken from the Judgements of God; If men will not <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>8</label> hearken to reaſon, and the examples of the Saints, and Judgement of Divines in all ages, yet the Lord will make it appear from heaven, that this is the Lords Day, and the Lord hath ſealed it.</p>
               <p>Firſt by his Judgements, for the wrath of God hath been revealed from heaven upon thoſe that have prophaned this day: the Stories in all ages ſhew it. In the Councel of <hi>Paris,</hi> where Divines out of all Countries in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were met together, to conſult about matters of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Miniſters ſtepped up, and made complaint, concernining the Sabbath, Let us make a Canon for the ſanctifying of the Sabbath day, for to our knowledg, the Lords wrath hath broken out upon the Countrey for the breach of this day; and one related one ſtory, and another, another; as one told a Story of a Miller, that grinding upon the Sabbath day, a fire brake out, and burnt Mill, and Man, and all. Another, of an Husbandman, that going into the field to fetch home his Corn upon the Sabbath day, thunder and lightning brake forth, and burnt him and his corn. Many ſuch ſtories were related in that Councel, and the <hi>Magdenbergs</hi> have a ſtory of a Noble-man, that uſing to Hunt upon the Sabbath day, the Lord brought it ſo to paſſe, that his Wife brought forth a child, with a head juſt like a dog. I could relate abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Stories beyond ſea, but we have enough here at home; the Town of <hi>Stratford,</hi> in <hi>Warwick</hi> ſhire, at it is related in the Practice of Piety, was Burnt three times upon this day. And the Story of the <hi>Parris</hi> Garden, 1583. they were gathered together this day, to ſee the ſport of the Beaſts fighting together, and the Scaffold fell down, and eight were ſlain, and abundance hurt. So there are many more ſuch Examples, I remember my ſelf above
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94114:170"/>
a dozen within this half year; the Lord hath revealed his diſpleaſure from heaven, for the breach of this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Again the Lord hath ſealed this in the conſcience of his people. For who are they that break this day, but looſe, and vain, and prophane men? And who make conſcience of it, but thoſe that moſt fear God, thoſe that God hath moſt crowned with Righteouſneſſe and ſanctification? they delight in this, and Sanctifie it, and count it Holy to the Lord; and the more a man fears God, the more careful he is of the keeping of this day, and the more he is grieved to ſee it prophaned, either by himſelf or others, becauſe he hath experience of the bleſſings of God upon the keeping of this day; no man doth Sanctifie this day conſcionably, but he ſhall find a bleſſing, therefore it is ſurely from the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> The <hi>Firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is this, Is the firſt day of the week the Sabbath by Divine inſtitution? then here we ſee, that we are to keep a whole day. The Divel, if he cannot make men keep no day, then it is his policy to make them keep it by halves. Oh, ſay they, Do we not keep the Sabbath? Do we not come to Church, and hear the word, and Divine Service Morning and Evening? Is not this to keep the Sabbath? But if the Lord hath Inſtituted this day, then certainly he hath Inſtituted a whole day. It is madneſſe, and want of reaſon for a man to think the contrary. Suppoſe I hire a man to labour with mee for a day, do I not make account he ſhould work one whole day? Suppoſe I hire a Servant for a year, do I not mean an whole year? though I put not in the word <hi>Whole,</hi> yet I ſuppoſe he muſt dwell a whole year with me. And if I hire a man for a day; it is for an whole day: ſo that in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſenſe, when the Scripture ſaith, Thou ſhalt Sanctifie the Sabbath day, it is meant a whole day. It is not in this, as in other words; any piece of a ſtone is ſtone: but in things that ſignifie the whole, it is not the ſame, as a day; a part of a day, is not a day: the leaſt part of water is water, or of fire is fire, but a part of a day, is not a day Remember thou keep holy the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; and I was in the Spirit on the Lords day; and they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the firſt day of the week: it is a day, therefore the meaning of the ſcripture is, that it ſhould be a whole day, and it is ſo in reaſon, and therefore we are to keep an whole day: therefore we ſhould not curtail the Lords day, as the ſervants of <hi>Hanun</hi> did the garments of <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants. You know what became of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> that brought but part, when they ſhould have brought the whole; they ſhould have brought the whole price of their inheritance, but they brought but part, therefore the Lord ſmote them with death: ſo when the Lord requires a whole day, and we give him but a part, we ſhall bring vengeance upon our own heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> There are divers arguments for it: Firſt the weeke conſiſts of ſeven dayes, and he hath given ſix to us and reſerves one day to himſelf: now we wil grant that we have not part of ſix dayes, but ſix whole dayes. If you aske a man what, do you work all day? <hi>Why yea,</hi> the Lord hath given us ſix dayes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſix whole dayes. Now by the ſame reaſon God muſt have an whole day; if we take any part of the ſeventh day, then we have more then ſix dayes, which is contrary to the ſcripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another reaſon is this God reſted the ſeventh day: now looke what time God reſted, that time we muſt ſanctifie: now God reſted the ſeventh day, all of it, he left none of the creation to do upon the ſeventh day, he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the creation in ſix dayes; and reſted all the ſeventh day, therefore we muſt keep the whole day. Thirdly, becauſe this is the nature of a Sabbath to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> bee 24 houres, not to be an artificiall day, but to be a naturall day, 24 houres together, as you may ſee Lev. 23.32. <hi>you ſhall keep the Sabbath from evening to evening</hi>; then the dayes were reckoned from evening to evening
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94114:170"/>
from the creation; though now under the goſpel, becauſe Chriſt aroſe in the morning, they are reckoned from morning to morning.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, another argument is this, God never ordained halfe holy dayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in his Church: indeed the Church of Rome have halfe holy dayes, as ſaint <hi>Blacies</hi> day, which is to be kept in the fore noon: ſo they have other dayes that are to be kept in the after-noone, but in the fore-noone, they may do what they liſt: ſo heathens did, as <hi>Ovid</hi> ſaith, the former part of the day is holy, the latter part of the day is not holy; the Lord hath no ſuch days as theſe, but all holy dayes in ſcripture: if God ever appointed a faſt, or new moon, or feaſt of Tabernacles, whatſoever holy day, he did inſtitute, it was an whole day, and not a part of a day, therefore much more this ſolemn day.</p>
               <p>Again, the judgment of all Divines in all ages hath been concerning an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> whole day. I could inſtance in the fathers, as in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who ſaith, we are to continue in the Sabbath all the day long, for the Lord hath required all the day to be kept holy unto him, and the ſaints of God have alwayes kept an whole day: ſo ſaint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, It is not enough, that wee keep three or four houres of the day, but that we reſt the whole day. And what reſt? not only to reſt from our bodily labours, for the beaſts keep this Sabbath; nor the reſt of ſport and paſtime, for that is the Sabbath of the golden calfe; they ate and drink, and roſe up to play: No, but that thou mayeſt be vacant to God all the day in prayer and ſerving of him. So in the Councell of <hi>Mexicon,</hi> there was an aſſembly of miniſters out of all nations in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and they ordained a canon, concerning the Lords day, <hi>We ordain, that people keep the whole Lords day holy, and that they ſet themſelves the whole day to pray to God, and delight in God, and heare his word: and if a countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſervant breake this day, his puniſhment ſhall be to be beaten with ſevere blowes,</hi> [<hi>ictubus gravioribus,</hi> are the very words of the Councell;] <hi>and if a Lawyer offer to plead this day, he ſhall not have the benefit of his pleading or caſe; and if a miniſter breake this day, he ſhall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be excommunicated half a year, and throwne out of the Church, and ſhall not be received into the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but upon great humiliation.</hi> This was the judgment of Divines in all ages, and it is the obſervation of a reverend Divine, <hi>Muſculus,</hi> upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. God doth not ſay, Remember the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to keepe it holy; he that keeps it an hour or two, keeps it holy: but, Remember the <hi>Sabbath Day,</hi> to keepe it holy; he will have a <hi>day</hi> kept holy: Nay <hi>Calvin,</hi> whom they take to be on their ſide, to be a patron of their liberty, he himſelfe writing upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. upon theſe words, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day,</hi> he ſaith, we are to keep this day, (ſpeaking of himſelfe, and all the people of God,) we are to keepe this day; and not a <hi>part</hi> of it, but <hi>all</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Uſe is this: we may hence ſee that ſports and paſtimes are not <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> agreeable to the Lords day; for if the Lord hath forbidden our weekly works on that day, then ſurely he hath forbidden ſports and paſtimes.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is good, firſt becauſe our weekly works, are things Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at other times, now ſports and paſtimes are never Commanded by God, but onely permitted: now if things commanded, and things that are good at ſometimes, if theſe notwithſtanding may not be done upon the Lords day, then much leſſe muſt thoſe be done that are permitted onely.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe weekely works do leſſe diſtract a man from God. then ſports and paſtimes. I appeale to any man here preſent, if he be not more heavenly and better employed, and leſſe diſtract from good thoughts, and gracious affections, when he is plowing, or ſowing, or threſhing, then when he is diceing, and carding; ſports and paſtimes beat a man further off from religion, and let a man go to prayer after ſports and paſtimes, he ſhall
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94114:171"/>
find himſelfe more unfit and unaffected a great deal, then he ſhall when he comes from the works of his calling. Now if thoſe things that do leſſe diſtract from Gods worſhip and ſervice are forbidden upon the Sabbath day, then ſurely much more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
