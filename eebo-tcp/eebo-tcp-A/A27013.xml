            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had not long raigned, but that growing cruel and odious, the Grand Vizier came with an Army out of <hi>Perſia</hi> and depoſed him, forcing him to returne to his Cell (where he had lived like a relgious man all the Reign of <hi>Achmat</hi> his Brother) and fetching <hi>Oſman,</hi> the heire of <hi>Achmat,</hi> out of priſon, ſet him in the Imperial Th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and to proteſt they would not follow, but rather ſet up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King in his abſence. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> they ſeventh of <hi>May</hi> in the year 1622. while his Tents and other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations for his journey were paſſing over unto <hi>Aſia</hi>-ſide, the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahies</hi> ſuddenly met at the <hi>Hyppodrome</hi> in the City,<note place="margin">Mutiny.</note> upon a word given, and from thence ran to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which is the great <hi>Turks</hi> Palace, in tumult, and there cryed out for the King, who appeared to them, asked what this inſoleney meant, and what they pretended? They then by the mouth of the multitude (for they had no head but that of the Monſter) demanded, Firſt, that he ſhould not proceed in his purpoſe to go to <hi>Mecah,</hi> nor to <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Demand ſome chief Officers of State to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</note> Secondly, to have delivered to their fury the great Vizier <hi>Delevir Baſſa,</hi> the <hi>Hoia,</hi> or the <hi>Caſſiaraga,</hi> the <hi>Teftardar,</hi> the <hi>Cadeleſcher,</hi> and ſome others as Enemies to the State. The firſt after a little diſpute, the King grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, promiſing to give over his journey; but they not content with words, exacted it in writing. To the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he replyed, that it was diſhonour to him to have his ſervants ſo uſed without order of Juſtice, but perſwaded them to have patience to ſtay till <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>Divan</hi> or publick Councel, where they ſhould appeare; and if they were found culpable, they ſhould receive puniſhment (not meaning to performe any of this,<note place="margin">which the King denying,</note> but to get time and allay their preſent fury.) Theſe fellows not content with that moderate anſwer, undertook to know that they were guilty, and therefore they needed no other <hi>Witneſſe, Tryal,</hi> or <hi>Judge</hi> but themſelves, and with extreame clamour called to have them rendred. But the King refuſing to give them any other ſatisfaction, and they unprepared for force, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the City, which now was all in feare; every houſe and ſhop being ſhut up, expecting a general ſack. But they followed the way of their own hatred , and firſt went to the houſe of the <hi>Hoja,</hi> which they brake and pillaged; But not finding him, they proceeded to the great <hi>Viziers,</hi> who made ſome defence, and they being unarmed, beat them off: and ſo they ſeparated, being now even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet kept a guard in ſome parts of the Town.</p>
            <p>That night the King made an attempt to fortifie and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49270:4"/>
defend the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which was ſtrongly walled about,<note place="margin">They aſſemble in Arms next morning.</note> and had alwayes in it of houſhold ſervants, above three thouſand; but it ſeems no man would arme in his cauſe: So the next morning the mutiniers aſſembled againe, and taking their armes, went firſt to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> or Arch-Prieſt among them, and enforced him and divers others to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them to the Court, where they anew demanded theſe men, but with more inſtance and fury; in the mean time the <hi>Hoia Cadeleſcher</hi> and <hi>Tofterdar</hi> fled; and were not in long time diſcovered; the <hi>Vizier</hi> retired to the King, and perſwaded him earneſtly to go over in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his own boates to <hi>Aſia,</hi> and there to take horſe, and he would ſecure him from all peril; but the King would not move, bidding him ſtay, confident and aſſured that he would puniſh theſe rebels.</p>
            <p>The wiſe old man ſeeing this conſtancy (or obſtinacy) deſired leave to ſhift for himſelf, which he took or obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo got away to the Hermitage of a Saint renowned amongſt them, who (like himſelf) betrayed him; yet did him the favour, as not to deliver him to the multitude, but perſwaded and carried him back to the Kings houſe. At this time it was diſputed in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of thoſe Officers, the Emperour refuſing; the rebels clamouring and threatning, inſomuch as he began to feare they would break in, and in their rage do worſe then they yet pretended. Whereupon (whither by the Kings order, or by his own conſent willing to be the peace-offering) the brave Vizier went out to them, and with a good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſſe demanded what they ſought of him, and wherein he had offended? <q>At firſt they were amazed,<note place="margin">Cut the Vizier in pieces.</note> but one inſolent villain breaking the general modeſty, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him with their ſwords, and ſuddenly cut him in pieces.</q>
            </p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49270:7"/>
to kill him where he could firſt be found; the Viziers houſe was ſacked, and infinite treaſure taken, ſo that the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier was quieted for a day or two by making a new Vizier <hi>Muſtapha Baſſa,</hi> who was of a ſoft nature, and ſcarce durſt do juſtice for fear of offending any man.

            <p>The Emperour gave them a ſhort but ſatisfactory anſwer, yeelding to their requeſt, yet mingled with ſome admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as became a Prince.<note place="margin">The Segmen Baſſa, the man principally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, hides himſelf, but being found is put to death, with ſome 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. others of both Orders.</note> And ſo they departed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man to their own reſt. But the <hi>Segmen Baſſa</hi> having ſome intimation that his name was renued in that liſt of death, took the firſt opportunity, fled and hid himſelf, and divers others conſcious of their own merits <hi>retyred,</hi> and thereby condemned themſelves. With much diligence the <hi>Segmen Baſſa</hi> was apprehended and brought to the Court, he was examined rather to finde his own Treaſure, which was infinite, then to diſcover other men. The Grand Signior ſent for him, and after a few words, gave ſentence to have his head ſtruck off, which was inſtantly done before the door; afterwards divers of both Orders (that is <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hies</hi>) were taken to the number of twenty two, were taken,<note place="margin">After which the Army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to their duty, and peace to the Empire.</note> and privately ſtangled and thrown into the ſea; theſe (prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally branded) were hidden or fled. And ſuddenly, as if peace were riſen out of the old <hi>Chimachams</hi> grave, there was an end of the tumults and diſorders among the ſouldiers; the <hi>Spahies</hi> ſhrunk, not one revenging <hi>Spahie</hi> to be ſeen in all the City; and the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> as their glory, took upon them an auſtere Reformation; and all things were ſo calme as if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had come down from heaven among them.</p>
            <p>THe reading of Hiſtory having in it no recompenſe but delight, unleſſe it look forward to uſe and action, either to correct errors paſt, or direct wayes for the future: it will not be unprofitable upon the foregoing diſcourſe to raiſe ſom Obſervations, Firſt Theological, Secondly, Moral and Political.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Theological. There are in this diſcourſe ſeveral things of God diſcovered, worthy our taking notic of.</p>
            <p>As firſt the abſolute and uncontroulable Soveraignty of God over the greateſt Monarchs and Emperors of the world.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49270:14"/>
Behold one of the greateſt Monarchs of the earth, ſuddenly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of all, by his own Vaſſals, who at their firſt riſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no ſuch thing. He cuts off the ſpirit of Princes; he is terrible to the Kings of the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerve here the infinite wiſdome of God, who can by the Paſſions, and luſts, and furies of men accompliſh his own, wiſe, and juſt holy ends. This Army in all their mad fury did not what themſelves plotted and intended, but what God decreed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, behold here the exact juſtice of God (in revenging firſt the blood of <hi>Oſman,</hi> then the blood of <hi>Georgi,</hi> though wicked men) to his Enemies; ſhall he not much more avenge the blood of his Elect?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, obſerve here the wonderful power of God over the ſpirits of men; how ſoon can the Lord calme their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rage and fury? and none can do it but he; he ſtilleth the raging of the ſea, and the tumults of the people.</p>
            <p>For Moral Obſervations take theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, how dangerous a thing it is for any ſupream power to ſtand in need of a conſtant ſtanding Army; they do but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtride an unruly Camel, which they cannot manage, as this unfortunate <hi>Oſman</hi> dreamt, before his death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what a dangerous thing it is for the Civil Power, to permit the ſouldiers and Officers of the Army to hold their Counſels and Conventicles. Theſe were the root of all theſe troubles in the Turkiſh Empire.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, how much better it is to be under the worſt of Monarchies, then at the courteſie of a mutinied Army, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this ſtory.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that the common ſouldier having been debauched by their own Officers, may at laſt prove honeſt, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>miſleaders</hi> to Juſtice, may return to their duty and obedience. <hi>Amen.</hi>
