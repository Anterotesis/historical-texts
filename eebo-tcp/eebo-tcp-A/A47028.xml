         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Joſh. 24. 15.</bibl>
               <q>If it ſeem evil to you to ſerve the Lord, chuſe
you this day whom you will Serve: But, as
for me and my Houſe, we will Serve the
Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THeſe words were ſpoken by <hi>Joſhua</hi> to the
Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and they do acquaint
us,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First of all,</hi> That the Service of God may have
a great many Prejudices and Objections rais'd againſt
it: For, <hi>It may ſeem evil to ſome Men to ſerve the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They inform us, that though the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God may have ſo many Prejudices and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
rais'd againſt it; Yet, its Excellence is ſo far
beyond all things in the World, that it may be
ſafely put to any Mans Choice, whether he will ſerve
God or no. The difference between Religion and
Irreligion is ſo great, that no reaſonable Man can be
at a ſtand which to chuſe: God is ſure which way
the choice will go. And therefore he ſays, <hi>Chuſe you
this day whom you will ſerve.</hi> And therefore they give
us to underſtand,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That, If notwithſtanding the Excellence
of Religion, Men will be ſo wilfully blind, as to
chuſe Irreligion before it; Yet, it is the Duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Joſhua,</hi> it is the Duty of every <hi>Maſter of a Family,</hi>
to ingage both <hi>Himſelf</hi> and his <hi>Family,</hi> to ſerve God
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66181:3"/>
againſt all Oppoſition to the contrary. For, <hi>If it
ſeem evil to you to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you this day
whom you will ſerve: But, as for me and my Houſe, we
will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Three Heads of Diſcourſe would take me
up Four Sermons at leaſt. And therefore, the next
Lords-Day being the laſt time that I ſhall Preach
from this place; I ſhall now treat only of the laſt
Propoſition, which is moſt <hi>Vſeful</hi> for, and moſt
<hi>Neglected</hi> by moſt Men. In treating of which, I ſhall
ſhew you from <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Example, That,</p>
            <p>Every Maſter of a Family is indiſpenſably bound in
Conſcience to bring up his Family in the Service of God.
<hi>And the Reaſons of this are ſuch as theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First of all.</hi> The Law tells us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 5. That
every Man was bound to <hi>Dedicate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> or to <hi>Conſecrate,</hi>
or to <hi>Sanctifie</hi> his Houſe unto the Lord. And the
reaſon of the thing tells us, that it being impoſſible
to <hi>Sanctifie</hi> the Walls of a Houſe, there being no
Sanctification, <hi>properly ſo called,</hi> in Stone, Brick and
Timber: Therefore, to <hi>Sanctifie</hi> a Houſe unto the
Lord, is nothing elſe, but to be careful for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of a Man's Family, and to bring it up in
the Service of God; that ſo, his Houſe may be God's
Houſe, his Children God's Children, and his Servants
God's Servants.</p>
            <p>For indeed, if a Man does not inſtruct his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
at Home all the Week long, their going to
Church on the Lord's-day does them little or no
good: For, the Maſter does them as much and more
harm in his <hi>own Houſe,</hi> than the Miniſter did them
good in <hi>God's Houſe.</hi> The Maſters bad Example
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66181:3"/>
out-does the Preachers good Preaching, though he
Preaches <hi>with the Tongues of Men and Angels.</hi>
The Maſter's cuſtomary <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Drinking,</hi> and
<hi>Cheating in his way of Trade,</hi> every Day in the Week,
out-does a little ſhort florid Sermon, only once or
twice a Week. And that too perhaps, deſign'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>pleaſe a few itching Ears,</hi> and not to ſink down
deep enough, and to work upon their Hearts and
Conſciences. The Maſters neglect of <hi>Family-Duties</hi>
which the Miniſter preſſes ſo home, and upon his
Conſcience in Church, makes the Servant imagin,
that the Miniſter is ſome <hi>Preciſe, Rigid Puritan,</hi> that
would fain oblige Men to ſuch things as God never
obliged them to. For elſe ſays the Servant, <hi>My
Maſter who is reckon'd ſuch a Grave, Prudent and Just
Man in all other things, would never be ſo unjuſt to
God, as to deny him the ſmall Tribute of</hi> Family-Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>if he thought they were any way due to him.</hi> And
by this means, the Maſter infects his Servant, and
the Servant infects his Servant when he has one;
and ſo on to the end of the World. And thus, as
I take it, the caſe now ſtands at this preſent time;
I would to God I were miſtaken in it! This Evil
of neglecting <hi>Family-Duties,</hi> is come to ſo great a
Head, that <hi>partly</hi> by the ſtrength of Cuſtom and
Preſcription, which ſome Men impudently pretend
for it: <hi>Partly,</hi> by the General corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
And <hi>Partly,</hi> for want of frequent and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Preaching againſt it, it will be a very hard
matter to convince Men of their Duty in this
caſe.</p>
            <p>And therefore, notwithſtanding it is my uſual
way to ſpend much time in the Application of my
Diſcourſes to the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men, yet at this time, I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66181:4"/>
ſhall be forced to apply my ſelf wholly to your
<hi>Judgments,</hi> by endeavouring to Convince them of
the <hi>Abſolute Neceſſity of</hi> Family-Duties, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
applying my ſelf to raiſe and to ſtir up your <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
which muſt be reſerved to ſome other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and ſome other Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> The Character that God gave <hi>Abraham</hi>
was this:<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
               <hi>I know him;</hi> that is, I approve of him, I
commend him for what I know in him: <hi>I know him
that he will command his Children and his Houſhold
after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord to do
Juſtice and Judgment,</hi> Gen. 18. 19. This was one of
our Father <hi>Abraham</hi>'s greateſt Commendations. And
therefore without all doubt, it made up the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
or at leaſt, a very conſiderable part of his
bounden Duty and Service. And therefore alſo, if
ever we will be the true Sons of our Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
We muſt do the Works of our Father</hi> Abraham;
and among the reſt, we are more eſpecially bound
to do this Work of his, we are to command our
Children and our Houſhold <hi>after us.</hi> We are to take
care for them againſt that time, when we ſhall be
dead and gone, leſt our Memory ſhould Stink and
Rot among Men. We are in our Life-time to take
care what ſhall become of them after our Death.
We are to command them to keep the way of the
Lord, to do Juſtice and Judgment. And we are to
bring them up in the Service of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we find, that when Chriſt had converted <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi>
he ſaid, <hi>This day is Salvation come to this
Houſe, foraſmuch as he alſo is the Son of</hi> Abraham,
Luke 19. 9. <hi>Mark it</hi> all you <hi>Maſters of Families:</hi>
Chriſt does not ſay, this Day is Salvation come to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66181:4"/>
this <hi>Man Himſelf:</hi> But, it is come to this <hi>Man's
Houſe</hi> alſo; his whole Houſe, as well as himſelf
was to be ſaved by his Salvation. And if you
would know the reaſon of it, he tells you in
the very next Words, that the reaſon of it was
this; <hi>The Maſter of that Houſe was the Son of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;
<hi>and therefore, he was bound to bring up his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
in the Service of God, as his Father</hi> Abraham
<hi>had done before him.</hi> For, if <hi>Peter,</hi> or any one elſe
that is Chief or Head of a Place, do fall away from
his Duty; then, others alſo; <hi>yea,</hi> a very <hi>Barnabas</hi>
himſelf will be drawn away too. And therefore,
tho he himſelf diſcharge his own Duty well enough;
yet, if he takes not care, that all under him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
theirs alſo, he is guilty of their Sin. <hi>God
never increaſeth a Man's Family, but at the ſame
time he increaſeth his Charge and his Care too.</hi> It is
not enough for a Maſter of a Family to do the Duty
of a Man; but he muſt alſo do the Duty of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of a Family. And thus, it is not enough for a
Conſtable, or a Church-warden, or a Juſtice of
Peace to do the Duty of a Maſter of a Family, and
to look after his own Affairs at home; but he muſt
alſo do the reſpective Duties of Conſtable, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden,
or Juſtice of Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Fourth Commandment commands
every Maſter of a Family to take care of his Son and
Daughter;<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> his Man-Servant and Maid-Servant; <hi>yea,</hi>
and even of the very Cattle and Strangers that are
within his Gates, <hi>that is,</hi> within his Juriſdiction or
Protection. And certainly; That God, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
every Maſter of a Family to take care of his
<hi>Servants,</hi> does much more command him to take
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66181:5"/>
care of his <hi>Children.</hi> And that God, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
every Maſter of a Family to take care of his
<hi>Cattle</hi> and his <hi>Strangers, that is,</hi> his <hi>Lodgers</hi> and his
<hi>Sojourners,</hi> does much more command him to take
care of his <hi>Servants.</hi> For, a Chriſtian Servant is
really more than a Servant, <hi>he is above a Servant, he
is a Brother beloved,</hi> Philem. 16. Yea rather, <hi>There is
no difference between either Bond or Free: for, we are
all but one in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Gal. 3. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Every Maſter of a Family is bound to
do as much Good as he can in his Generation:<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> Or,
as the Scripture ſpeaketh, of the Patriarch <hi>David,</hi>
he is bound to <hi>ſerve his Generation.</hi> And whoever
that Maſter of a Family is, who does not bring up
his Family in the Service of God, he does not bring
it up to ſerve his Generation: But, he is ſo far from
ſerving it, that he does it all the Diſſervice imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For, as <hi>Ariſtotle obſerveth in his Politicks,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
are the firſt Societies in Nature, and they are
the Ground and Original of all the reſt. Families are
the Nurſeries and the Seminaries of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
They are the ſame to a Kingdom, that a
<hi>Fountain</hi> is to the <hi>Streams</hi> that flow from it: Or that
a <hi>Cauſe</hi> is to the <hi>Effects</hi> that come from it. And as
the <hi>Streams</hi> can never be good when the <hi>Fountain</hi>
is bad; and as the <hi>Effects</hi> can never be good when
the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is bad: So likewiſe, <hi>No Kingdom can ever
be good as long as the Families of the Earth are out of
courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, the beſt, and indeed, the only way
to make Godly Pariſhes, and Godly Countries, and
Godly Kingdoms, is, to being where we ought to begin.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66181:5"/>
It is in the firſt place, <hi>To make Godly Families.</hi>
And therefore, a Miniſter is not only bound to
Teach his People in Publick, but he is alſo to Teach

in <hi>God's Houſe,</hi> but he is alſo to go and meet them
in their <hi>own Houſes,</hi> if he may be admitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any extraordinary Rudeneſs offered to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Meſſage: He is to go <hi>from Houſe to Houſe,</hi>
and to ſet up a Godly, and a <hi>Strict</hi> Diſcipline in their
Families. And let no Man imagin that he has not
Authority enough to do this. For, St. <hi>Paul</hi> did it,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 20. And what he did, is written for our
inſtruction, that we might do ſo too. Aſſure your
ſelves, Every Miniſter has as much Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
God's Rent out of every Houſe, <hi>that is,</hi> to
call them to an account for the Improvement of
their Spiritual Talents, as any Gentleman's Steward
has to call for, and demand his Maſters Rents from
his Tenants, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 24. And Wo be to Us if we
do not exerciſe this Power! And Wo be to them
that will not ſuffer us to put it in Execution! But
ſerve us, as thoſe <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Barbarous</hi> Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſerved the Lord's Servants, who went to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Fruits of their Lord's Vineyard, either
<hi>beat us,</hi> or <hi>ſtone us,</hi> or <hi>kill us,</hi> or <hi>ſend us away em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty,</hi>
and <hi>caſt us out of the Vineyard,</hi> ver. 35, 39.</p>
            <p>From the Families it is, that Vertue or Vice, a
good or a bad Example, does firſt ariſe, and ſpead
it ſelf both far and near. And therefore, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
are to be carefully looked after in the firſt
place. <hi>One Atheiſtical Family is enough to infect the
whole Neighbourhood.</hi> It ſendeth a Son into one
Houſe, a Daughter into another, a Servant into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſome Body or other almoſt into every

Houſe. And every one of them, like ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Perſons, do poyſon and infect all thoſe with
whom they converſe. But what do I ſay, that one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical
Family is enough to infect the whole Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood?
When it is plain, That <hi>One Man, One</hi> Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,
<hi>is enough to infect the whole Church and State, and
to make all Iſrael to ſin, even for many Ages after his
Death.</hi> One <hi>Achan</hi> troubled all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and brought a
ſevere Judgment upon them all by his own ſingle
Treſpaſs, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. throughout the Chapter. One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous
<hi>Corinthian</hi> made all the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
to be <hi>puffed up,</hi> and involved them all in his Fault,
becauſe they had him not Excommunicated, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 2. One infected Member infects all the reſt. And
we Chriſtians are all of us but ſo many Members one
of another: And therefore, <hi>The care of one, ought
to reach to, and affect us all,</hi> Rom. 12. 5. 15.</p>

For, even Nature teacheth us, that if a <hi>Needle</hi> be

mark of a ſound Chriſtian that is himſelf thoroughly
Converted, when his Care reacheth unto his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

he and his Houſe would serve the Lord againſt all Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The Mark of <hi>Zaccheus</hi> his goodneſs was, <hi>that

The Mark of <hi>Criſpus</hi> the chief Ruler of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue's

neglected by all ſorts of Men now-a-days, which
was heretofore <hi>ſo much,</hi> if not <hi>Vniverſally</hi> Practic'd.
But however, let the neglect of it be what it will,
yet ſure it is, if thou doſt not do all thou canſt to
make thy whole Houſe good as well as thy ſelf, thou
haſt no good Aſſurance that thou thy ſelf art a good

no Proſelyte might preſume to come to the Paſſover,

this Law, as well as its Equity were ſtill in force? And
we find alſo, that God would have Killed <hi>Moſes</hi> in
the Inn, in his way to <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe he had not
Circumciſed his Son, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 24. The great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of his Embaſſage, and the great Haſte it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
could not poſſibly have prevented his Death, if
his Wife had not preſently Circumciſed his Son. <hi>God

in <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 2, 3. That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had no

            <p>But theſe you'll ſay,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> are all of them Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>But thanks be to God for it,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> neither Chriſt nor
his Goſpel do in the leaſt diſingage you from <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Duties,</hi> but do rather much more Confirm and
Eſtabliſh them. For, St. <hi>Paul</hi> is expreſs, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 4, 5.
That no Man may be made</hi> a Biſhop or a Prieſt, <hi>but
one that ruleth well his own Houſe, having his Children
in Subjection with all Gravity. For, if a Man know not
how to Rule his own Houſe, how ſhall he take care of the
Church of God?</hi> Nay, and what's a great deal more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66181:7"/>
than all this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us plainly, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 8.
That if any provide not for his own,</hi> though they be
abroad and gone from him; <hi>and eſpecially for thoſe
of his own Houſe,</hi> that are at Home with him, <hi>he hath
denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> And
<hi>if a Man have denied the Faith, and be worſe than an
Infidel,</hi> that does not provide Food and Raiment
for his Family, and take care for the welfare of
their <hi>Bodies only:</hi> How bad then is that Man that
does not provide for the <hi>Souls of his Family?</hi> For,
is it not worſe to ſtarve the Soul, than to ſtarve the
Body? And is not Eternal Death far worſe than
Temporal Death? And are not the <hi>Gnawings of the
never-Dying Worm, far more intolerable, than the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of an Empty Stomach?</hi> Certainly, as much as
the Soul exceeds the Body, ſo much the worſe is
that Man that neglects the Souls of his Family, than
he that neglects their Bodies. And yet, if he that
only neglects their Bodies, <hi>have denied the Faith, and
be worſe than an Infidel:</hi> Then judge you your ſelves,
what Name is bad enough for that Man that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
their Souls? And now, let any Maſter of a
Family, that does not bring up his Houſe in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, tell Me and this Congregation, how
he can pretend to be a Chriſtian, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
him here to his Face, that <hi>he hath denied the Faith,
and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any of you ſhall be pleaſed to call me
<hi>Raſh, Cenſorious, Poſitive, Peremptory,</hi> and I know
not what, for paſſing ſuch a ſevere Judgment upon
you that are guilty of this Sin, (if any of you are
guilty of it,) do but remember it is not my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s: And then, if you muſt needs
find fault, find fault with him; and let him anſwer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66181:8"/>
for it, and not I. And with Him, not to ſay with Us,
<hi>It is a very ſmall thing that we ſhould be judged of You,
or of Mans judgment: He that judgeth us is the Lord,</hi>
1 Cor. 4. 3, 4. And therefore, do you ſay what you
will, I do conclude notwithſtanding, that no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of a Family can have any Aſſurance of his own
Faith; for, <hi>he hath denyed that:</hi> and conſequently,
he can have no Aſſurance of his own Salvation nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
unleſs he endeavour to make all his Family

               <note place="margin">Reaſon 6.</note> A Bad Maſter of a Family makes all his
Family bad; or at leaſt, he is not wanting on his
part, as far as his bad Example will go. An Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Maſter makes all his Family to ſerve his Luſt,
and prompts them to Uncleanneſs. A Drunken,
Swearing Maſter, provokes all his Family to give
themſelves to Drinking and Swearing: And a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Maſter brings the very Root of all Evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Family, and infects them all with a ſtingy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious
Humour, which <hi>Eats up</hi> the very Vitals and
Bowels of Chriſtianity. And ſhall not a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of a Family be as careful to make his Family
good, as a bad Maſter is to make his Family bad?
Shall not the good be as true to God, as the bad is
to the Devil? Shall not Heaven ingage the good to
make as many Converts, as Hell does ingage the
Bad? And ſhall not everlaſting Joys be as ſtrong
and prevailing Motives, as everlaſting Torments?
Oh how will the Devil inſult over thee for this at

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:66181:8"/>
thee for! And how will he then upbraid thee
for having promoted his Kingdom of Darkneſs,
more than thou didſt the Kingdom of Chriſt? Me,
thinks I hear, and I even tremble to hear him Plead
againſt thee after ſome ſuch manner as this! <hi>This
Man was thine by Creation, O'Chriſt; but he has made
himſelf mine by his own Choice: He was thine whether
he would or no; he could not hinder his Creation; but
he became mine by his own voluntary Act and Deed. Thou
didſt Redeem him; but he preſently ſold himſelf to me
for a trifle, for nothing, for worſe than nothing; for
Death, for Eternal Death. Thou didſt Dye for him;
but he ſerved me, and lived and died in my Service;
in the drudgery and ſlavery of Sin. And yet for all
this, I gave him nothing, and I promiſed him nothing,
ſave only the burden of a Surſeit, or the vanity of Fame,
or the filthy pleaſure of a Night, or the joys of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or the delights of a Diſeaſe, or the comfortable
entertainment of Horror, Anguiſh and Deſpair. I never
Sweated great Drops of Blood for him; I never Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Croſs for him; only, when he was thine by
the merit of thy precious Death, he became mine by his
own baſe Ingratitude. He Swore in his Baptiſm to be
thy Soldier, and he has forſworn himſelf a Thouſand
times over to Fight my Battles. He ought to have made
his Houſe a Houſhold of Faith, but he has made it a
Den of Thieves, and a Cage of every unclean thing.
None of my Servants do ſerve me thus: My Servants
are all true and faithful to me; they take care that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be ſeen or heard in their Houſes all the Year long,
but Drinking, and Swearing, and Gaming, and Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and Backbiting, and ſuch like extravagant Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.
And yet, does this Maſter of a Family pretend
to be thy Servant, and ſerve me all the while, and ſuffer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66181:9"/>
his Houſe to be full of all manner of Sinners, yea, and
prefer Sinners to his</hi> Acquaintance, <hi>to his</hi> Table, <hi>to his</hi>
Boſom, <hi>to his very</hi> Bed, <hi>before thoſe which his own
Conſcience cannot but tell him to be good and honeſt
Men.</hi> And this, or ſome ſuch invidious Accuſation,
the Accuſer of the Brethren, the Devil, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bring againſt thee at the Day of Judgment. And
therefore, as thou wouldſt avoid it Then; ſo, be
thou Now ſure to bring up thy Family in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God: which is the only thing that will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſtop the Devil's Mouth againſt thee at that
<hi>great and terrible Day of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here now I am preſently aware of a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
ſort of Men, who are neither notorious ill Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
nor notorious good Livers: Who neither drink
nor ſwear, nor whore, nor keep any bad hours in
their Families. And theſe Men content themſelves
with a <hi>Negative</hi> ſort of Religion. They think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to eſchew Evil, and they never think of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Good. They think it enough to haue their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
at home, and to give them good ordinary
Food and Raiment, and to keep them in pretty good
Order for their Credit and their Trade's ſake; and
they never think of providing for their Immortal
Souls, for God's ſake, tho they do much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
and do much more ſtand in need of their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Aſſiſtance. They call them to an exact Account
for every Farthing that they entruſt them with; and
they never call them to any Account at all for thoſe
innumerable Talents that God hath committed to
their Charge. They enquire of them diligently
what News they have heard abroad; and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enquire of them what good Sermon they have
heard at Church, and how much the better they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66181:9"/>
are for having heard it. They ask them, whether
ſuch a ſtrong Place, or ſuch a Fortreſs be taken or
ſurrendred; and they never ask them whether ſuch
a Thorn be taken out of their Fleſh, or ſuch a Sin
taken Captive, or ſuch a <hi>Jericho</hi> demoliſhed, or ſuch
a Luſt mortified, or ſuch earthly Members crucified
to the Croſs of Chriſt. They <hi>take on mightily,</hi> and
<hi>lay on unmercifully,</hi> if they be not always at home to
wait on them at their Tables, and they never are at
all concern'd whether ever they wait at God's Table,
and go to his Altar to receive the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And thus theſe Middling Sort of Men do keep
their Families at home indeed, but they do not
make them do any good at home. They keep them
from the groſſer Acts of Sin, but they do not bring
them up to Vertue. They keep them from Drinking,
and Swearing, and Whoring, <hi>(and 'twere well if all
would but do ſo much)</hi> but they do not bring them
up to Read and to Pray, and to ſing Pſalms; and
they do not inſtruct them in the Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by Catechizing them, and Reading and expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures to them, as far as they are
able.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, Theſe and ſuch like Godly Exerciſes
were conſtantly uſed in thoſe <hi>Late Times,</hi> which
ſome Men have learned to call <hi>Hypocritical.</hi> But
how deſervedly, let them look to it. For, none is
able to diſtinguiſh a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> from an <hi>Honeſt Man,</hi>
unleſs he can do as God does, <hi>Search the Heart.</hi> And
if our Religion does not Exceed, <hi>yet,</hi> does not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
that of the Hypocrites, Good God, what will
become of us! Let us have a care leſt our Portion
be not as good as theirs! Let us not deceive our
ſelves! The cloſe Hypocrite does not do the Church
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66181:10"/>
of God ſo much Harm as the Profane Perſon. The
Hypocrite commends Religion. For, none counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits
that which is bad. But the Profane Perſon lives
in open Defiance to it, and proclaims War againſt
Heaven, and dares the Almighty to his Face. <hi>Ahab</hi>'s
Hypocritical Repentance procured him a great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Bleſſing, even from God Himſelf. But we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read of any Bleſſing that God beſtows upon a
Man for his Profaneneſs. And therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> Do not thou call any Times Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Do not thou preſume to neglect <hi>Family-Duties,</hi>
becauſe they were moſt practiced in thoſe
Times, which thou thinkeſt moſt Hypocritical. The
very Hypocrite's Practice of them, both juſtifies and
commends them. For, he is never at the pains to
counterfeit ought but what is good. The Devil
transforms himſelf only into an Angel of Light, or
at leaſt, ſomething elſe that is better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Let us not therefore thus pitifully deceive our
ſelves any longer. The Hypocrite's practice of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Duties
will not juſtifie, but condemn us, and
aggravate our Condemnation for their Neglect. God
neither is, nor will, nor can be mocked by you. Your
Sins of Omiſſion are damnable as well as your Sins of
Commiſſion. Your omitting Family-Duties is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
as well as your committing Family-Sins. Men
ſhall be damned for doing <hi>Nothing,</hi> as well as for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Somthing that is bad. Idleneſs</hi> is mortal as well

his Eſtate upon Eaſe, Luxury and Pomp. Men ſhall
be damned not only for <hi>Cheating, and Oppreſſing, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66181:10"/>
grinding the Face of the Poor;</hi> but alſo, for <hi>not Aſſiſting,</hi>
and <hi>not Relieving</hi> the Poor; for not giving them
<hi>Meat, Drink, Cloathing</hi> and <hi>Lodging</hi> when they ſtand
in need of it, as too many of them do in this cold
Seaſon of the Year, as you heard this Morning
from His Majeſty's Gracious Letter to the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
and the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> on the behalf of
the Poor in and about this City. Which I would have
you all <hi>Effectually</hi> to lay to Heart. And therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>I beſeech thee, <hi>yea,</hi> I beg of thee for Chriſt his
ſake, and for thine own ſake too, that when thou
haſt taken ſo much care to keep thy ſelf from <hi>Sins
of Commiſſion,</hi> do not ſuffer thy ſelf to be damned
for <hi>Sins of Omiſſion.</hi> Thou that haſt kept thy ſelf
from <hi>Doing Evil,</hi> do not ſuffer thy ſelf to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
for <hi>not doing Good.</hi> Thou that haſt kept thy
Family from Sin, do not ſuffer thy ſelf to periſh for
not bringing it up to Vertue. It is the height of
Miſery to have watched for the Bridegroom till he
was juſt coming, and then in the very nick of Time
to fall aſleep, and to be ſhut out for ever from the
Marriage-Feaſt. It is the utmoſt diſappointment
to fall ſhort of the Prize within a ſtep of the Races
end. There are Proverbs made on't. 'Tis a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
beyond Expreſſion, beyond Thought,
beyond all things, to go to the Devil in the ſight of
God, and to be tumbled into Hell from Heaven-Gates.
And therefore, thou that haſt taken ſo
much care with thy Family, do not make thy ſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
miſerable for not taking a little more care
with it. Thou that haſt gone ſo far, do not damn
thy ſelf for not going one ſtep farther. Do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Heaven for one bad Action. Do not forfeit E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
for nothing, for one Sin of Omiſſion, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

Man to bring up his Family in the Service of God,
tho he himſelf has not God in all his Thoughts. For,
Self-preſervation obliges a Man to avoid a Peſt-Houſe,
or an Houſe infected with the Plague: It ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
him to avoid all violent Torments, ſuch as the
<hi>Rack,</hi> the <hi>Wheel,</hi> and the <hi>Gallows;</hi> and it never

obliges a Man to avoid theſe and ſuch like fatal Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
of God's Wrath, does much more oblige
him to bring up his Family in the Service of God,
and to empty his Houſe of all Bad Livers. For, if
thy Servant be ſick of any <hi>Catching</hi> Diſtemper, doſt
not thou preſently get him out of thy Houſe, leſt
Thou, and thy Wife, and thy Children, and the
reſt of thy Family ſhould catch that Diſtemper?
And yet, is there any Diſtemper half ſo catching,
and half ſo miſchievous, as that of Sin? And wilt
not thou then much more get rid of a Sinful, than a
Sick Servant? Eſpecially, ſeeing all his Sickneſs is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the effect of his Sinfulneſs; And it is Charity,
and perhaps thy Duty, to entertain thy ſick
Servant, which thou art never bound to do
to thy ſinful Servant. Doſt thou harbor a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

thou haſt any thing by thee that is worth their
ſtealing? Doſt thou harbor a Company of <hi>Adulterers</hi>
or <hi>Fornicators</hi> in thy Houſe, if thou haſt either a
<hi>Chaſte Wife,</hi> or a <hi>Chaſte Daughter,</hi> or a <hi>Chaſte Maid</hi>
living with thee? And yet, wilt thou harbor a
Company of <hi>Wicked Servants</hi> in thy Houſe, that will
rob thee of thy very Soul, and will bring the Curſe
and the Plague of God upon thee and all thy
Family? Yea, wilt thou harbor a Company of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66181:11"/>
Devils</hi> in thy Houſe? For, what our Saviour
ſaid of <hi>Judas, I have choſen Twelve Diſciples, and behold
one of them is a Devil,</hi> is but too true of every other
Wicked Man, he is a Devil; he is led, or rather vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
hurried on, by the ſame Spirit that the Devil
himſelf is led by. And art not thou afraid to keep
a Company of <hi>Incarnate Devils</hi> in thy Houſe, when
a little <hi>Fire</hi> or <hi>Water,</hi> or a <hi>few Thieves</hi> ſhall be ready
to make thee at thy Wits end?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reaſon 8.</note> Self-Intereſt obliges a Man to bring up
his Family in the Service of God, though he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
careth not for God. And <hi>Intereſt</hi> certainly will
do much in ſuch a place as <hi>This,</hi> when all other things
fail. Where <hi>Robbing of Orphans, Oppreſſing Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
Grinding the Face of the Poor, Griping Vſury,</hi>
and <hi>Suing out Pardons from the State for Extortion:</hi>
Where theſe and ſuch like abominable Sins do reign
at ſuch a rate; certainly <hi>Interest,</hi> yea, the very <hi>Name</hi>
of it, will paſs for a ſtronger Argument than all
the <hi>Power and Demonſtration of the Spirit.</hi> And
therefore, methinks, that <hi>this Place</hi> of all others
ſhould be moſt remarkable for <hi>Family-Duties,</hi> which
advance their <hi>Intereſt</hi> even to an Hundred-fold.
For, if a Man be bad himſelf, yet if he have but a
good Servant, God will bleſs that bad Man for the
ſake of his good Servant. For, notwithſtanding <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi>
was an Idolater, and notwithſtanding his Wife
was an Adultreſs, and would have committed a
Rape upon her Chaſt Servant, that <hi>preferred the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Chriſt before the Members of ſuch a Lewd Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot:</hi>
Notwithſtanding all theſe Villanies that were
enough to have undone a whole Kingdom, and
much more one Houſe: Yet ſtill, the Holy Ghoſt
is expreſs, that the Lord bleſſed the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
Houſe for <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ſake. <hi>And again,</hi> The Lord bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66181:12"/>
the Houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> for the Arks ſake,
<hi>And again,</hi> The Lord bleſſed <hi>Laban</hi> for his Servant
<hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſake. <hi>And again,</hi> The Lord cured <hi>Naaman</hi>
the <hi>Syrian</hi> of his Leproſie, for his little <hi>Hebrew</hi> Maids
ſake. <hi>And again,</hi> The Lord ſaved all the Men that
were with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Ship, for <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſake. <hi>And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
The Lord would have ſaved all <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrha</hi> for the ſake of Ten Righteous Men. <hi>And
in one word,</hi> whatever a good Servant putteth his
Hand to, the Lord will proſper it in his Hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
1. 3. And who then would be without a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
or ſome other good Man in his Family, if he
might be had either for <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Mony,</hi> if he might
be had at any rate? Eſpecially, ſeeing that even Self-Intereſt
obliges a Man to get him ſuch a one. And
therefore, though a Man ſhould be never ſo bad
himſelf, yet even his Intereſt would oblige him, one
would think, to bring up his Family in the Service
of God, though he, like the Unjuſt Judge in the
Goſpel, <hi>cared neither for God nor Man,</hi> nor did at all
value either Heaven or Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reaſon 9.</note> Good Manners, and good Breeding, and
common Civility, oblige a Man to bring up his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
in the Service of God, though he himſelf has
no Religion at all. For, there is no Man ſo ill-bred,
as to invite a Friend to take a Commons with him,
and yet provide him nothing but what he knows he
hath a perfect <hi>Antipathy</hi> againſt, and what he hates
in his Heart, and what will make him <hi>Swoon</hi> away
at the very ſight of it. No Man is ſo ill-bred as to
ſerve his Friend thus. And I believe, that no Man
is ſo ill-bred as to invite a Friend to a Place, where
he can neither ſee, nor hear, nor ſpeak to any but
what are his Mortal Enemies, and what have Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66181:12"/>
his beſt and his only Friend, and what
would Murder him alſo, if ever they meet him. No
Man certainly is ſo ill-bred as this comes to. And
yet we all know, there is ſcarce a wicked Man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth, but what Prays in his Houſe at ſome time
or other, or at leaſt ſends for the Miniſter to Pray
with him at the point of Death. Then at leaſt,
once in his Life-time, the Miniſter, <hi>That Dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Creature he ſo often Laugh'd at, and Libell'd in all
Places,</hi> the Miniſter is thought ſit for his Company,
when he himſelf is fit for no Bodies elſe. And what
is it for a Man to pray to God in his Houſe? Is it
any thing elſe, but to deſire God to come into, and
to Bleſs his Houſe, and to enter under his Roof,
and to Dwell in the Temple of his Body, and to
Sup with him, and to tranſlate him from Death to
Life, and from Earth to Heaven? Is a Family-Prayer
any thing elſe? <hi>And yet ſhall that Wicked Man
Invite God to come into that place, that place of Sin,
that Dunghil of Filth, his own Houſe, which he knows
that God hates, and loaths and abhors? Shall that Wicked
Man invite God to come into the Company of thoſe
wicked Servants of his, who have Crucified his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son, and trampled upon the Lord of Life, and
counted his Blood an unholy thing, and done deſpite
to his Spirit of Grace? Shall that wicked Man invite
a Jealous God to come into the Company of Whoremong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Adulterers, whom he himſelf will judge to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Scorchings in Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Fire? Shall that Wicked Man
invite God to come into that place where he ſhall hear
himſelf Curſed and Sworn againſt, and his Name Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed
to his Face? Where he ſhall ſee a Swiniſh Luſt
preferr'd before him, and a Drunken Cup preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Cup of Bleſſing, and a PAINTED</hi> Jezabel <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
before the Charms of the Immaculate Jeſus that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66181:13"/>
has neither SPOT nor Wrinkle?</hi> Would any Man that
has either Good Manners, or good Breeding, or any
common Civility left him; would any Man at all
ſerve a Friend at ſuch a rate, <hi>ſuch a barbarous rate as
this?</hi> What, ſend for a Friend to abuſe and affront
him in his own Houſe, and to buffet and to ſpit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and to turn him out of Doors aſſoon as he
comes, <hi>wounded, mangled, bleeding, gaſping, dead,
dead with the death of the Croſs?</hi> And yet, at this
and a far worſe rate does every Man ſerve God,
who invites him to come into his Houſe, <hi>where he
can neither ſee nor hear any thing, but what Wounds and
Stabs him to the Heart, and pierces his Bleeding Sides, and
Crucifies him afreſh, and puts him again to an open
ſhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now canſt thou poſſibly find in thy Heart
to ſerve God thus? What has God done that he
ſhould deſerve this at thy Hands? The very <hi>Abjects</hi>
of the People that came about, and the <hi>Drunkards</hi>
that made Songs, and Jeſted upon Holy <hi>David,</hi> did
not ſerve him ſo ill as thou doſt God. <hi>Nay,</hi>
and ev'n <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelf did not ſerve his very <hi>Aſs</hi>
ſo ill as thou doſt God: He preſently ſaw his Error,
but thou goeſt on ſtill in thine, and wilt not ſee it.
Tell me ſeriouſly, wherein has God offended thee
ſo much, that thou doſt thus uſe him? Is not God
thy <hi>Creator,</hi> thy <hi>Preſerver,</hi> thy <hi>Redeemer,</hi> thy <hi>Saviour,</hi>
thy <hi>All? If yet thou haſt any ſhare at all in him.</hi> And
which of all theſe unſpeakable Mercies makes thee
ſo much his Enemy? 'Tis greatly to be feared, that
thou haſt not the leaſt Intereſt in God. Thou haſt
not the leaſt Intereſt in that <hi>Houſe</hi> which thou thy
ſelf doſt wilfully ſet on Fire. Thou haſt not the leaſt
intereſt in that <hi>Ship</hi> which thou thy ſelf doſt help to
Sink. Thou art not the <hi>Right Owner</hi> of that <hi>Child</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:66181:13"/>
which thou thy ſelf doſt cauſe to be divided, and
killed in it's <hi>Mother's Preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if it be againſt all Good Manners to invite
God to come into your Houſes that you may affront
him to his Face: Then, No Man that pretends to love
God may preſume to keep Company with bad Men,
where God is daily affronted, without forfeiting all
Claims to good Breeding. For, can I poſſibly go
into that Company, and can I take any Pleaſure in
that Society, which abuſes, and kills my Friend,
<hi>that I love as my own Soul? Yea,</hi> Is it not far worſe
for me to take pleaſure in bad Men's Company, than
it is for me to be a bad Man my ſelf? <hi>Is it not worſe
for me to love a Fornicator, than it is for me to be a
Fornicator?</hi> Yea verily. For ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking
of Fornicators, and the Haters of God, They <hi>knowing
the Judgment of God (that they which commit ſuch
things are worthy of Death) not only do the ſame, but
have pleaſure in them that do them,</hi> Rom. 1. 32. From
whence it is plain, <hi>That to take pleaſure in thoſe Men's
Company that do bad things, is far worſe than for a Man
to be bad himſelf.</hi> And therefore for the future, take
ſpecial care what Men and Women's Company you
take Delight in, and become <hi>One Fleſh with.</hi> Do
not find fault with thoſe Men that <hi>bear their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
againſt theſe things. And do not reckon thoſe
Men proud, who are reſolved, by God's Grace, <hi>to
live and die</hi> according to theſe Rules, and to avoid
all <hi>Familiarity</hi> with all God's Enemies, as far as they
know them. For, how canſt thou poſſibly pretend
to be the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt, and yet take her for thy
Wife, or him for thy Husband, who takes the Members
of Chriſt and makes them the Members of an Harlot?</hi>
From all which it is plain. That tho thou pretendeſt
to no great ſhare of Religion: Yet, thou pretendeſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66181:14"/>
to Good Manners, and Good Breeding, and Common
Civility; and theſe very Motives, if there were none
beſides oblige thee to bring up thy Family in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God.</p>
            <p>And yet alas! theſe very Men that pretend
moſt to Good Breeding and good Manners, do treat
God the moſt unmannerly and the moſt rudely of
all others. For, their Houſes have the leaſt Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in them. There it is, <hi>that Reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Praying, and Singing of Pſalms, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
of Sermons, and Examining and Instructing
of Families are the leaſt obſerved.</hi> The richer thoſe
Men are, the more careleſs they are in Family-Duties.
<hi>That is in plain Engliſh,</hi> The more kind God is to
them, the more unkind, and the more ungrateful
they are to him. Thoſe very Bleſſings that ſhould
oblige them to bring God's Service into their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
are uſed as Arguments to baniſh it out of all
their Dwellings. Their very Greatneſs. <hi>Their Honour,</hi>
which ſhould oblige them to honour God moſt, for
having honoured them ſo much above their Fellows,
makes them to think it below them to condeſcend ſo
far as to inſtruct their own <hi>Children, and much leſs their
Servants.</hi> They did not think it below them to beget
their Children in Sin, and conſequently to ſerve the
Devil; and yet, they think it below them to bring
up their Children in the Service of the Living God.
They did not think it beneath them to make their
Children the Firebrands of Hell, and the Children
of Wrath; and yet, they think it beneath them to
make their Children the Children of Light, and
the Heirs of Heaven.</p>
            <p>And here now, I know very well, that theſe
<hi>Gentile-Men,</hi> as they think themſelves, do charge
us with Ill-Breeding for telling them of theirs ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66181:14"/>
Publickly. But, whatever they <hi>Think</hi> of it, we
<hi>know</hi> otherwiſe. We know whom we have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>We know our ſelves guilty of as great a Fault,
in not telling them of their Faults, as they are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them.</hi> And therefore we are forc'd to tell
them further, That, this is not all the Rudeneſs and
Incivility that theſe <hi>Civil Men, theſe Men of Good
Manners, and Good Breeding</hi> are guilty of. For,
it is not enough for them to think it below them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelves
to bring Religion into their Families,
but they would have all others think it ſo too.
They would have all others to run into the ſame
exceſs of Riot with themſelves. They neither go to
Heaven themſelves, nor ſuffer others to go thither,
by their Good Will. But, if their <hi>Cups,</hi> their <hi>Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
their <hi>Revelling,</hi> and <hi>Clamorous Balling</hi> and <hi>Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
do perhaps permit them at ſometime to over-hear
their Godly Neighbours either a Praying or a Singing
of Pſalms, or a doing any other Chriſtian Duty in
their Families, the leaſt they ſay, is, That they
are <hi>diſturbed by them,</hi> and that they can have
no quiet in their Houſes for their <hi>ſilly whining;</hi> and
in plain Terms, that they are a <hi>Company of rank
Hypocrites and Fanaticks.</hi> But Oh good God, what
Times are we now fall'n into, when Sobriety, Gravity,
and Family-Duties, ſhall be enough to Un-Church
a Man! What Times are we now fall'n into!
when Men are counted <hi>Sinners</hi> for following the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Bleſſed Jeſus, who expounded <hi>All</hi> thoſe
things to his Family in Private, which he had taught
them in Publick, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 34. What an Age is this that
we now live in! When Men are counted <hi>Sinners</hi> for
doing as the Primitive Chriſtians did; for making
their Houſes to be the Houſes of God, and for turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them into ſo many little Churches and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66181:15"/>
of the Saints of God, <hi>Rom. 16. 5. 1 Cor. 16. 19.
Col. 4. 15. Philem.</hi> 2. And you do not know but
that in one of theſe <hi>Little Hutts, your Lot,</hi> the Pawn
of your Peace, the Pledge of your Safety, and the
Hoſtage of your Security, <hi>your Lot may dwell. Once
more.</hi> What an Age is this that we now live in!
When Men ſhall be counted <hi>Hypocrites</hi> for doing
thoſe <hi>Family-Duties,</hi> and making ſuch a neceſſary
Proviſion for the Souls of their Children and their
Servants, which if they do not make, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
them expreſly, <hi>They deny the Faith, and are worſe
than Infidels!</hi> And if Men are grown to ſuch an
extravagant, and ſuch a monſtrous Height of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
as to reckon that to be no Breach of Duty,
but rather a commendable Action, which makes
them <hi>Denyers of their Faith, yea,</hi> and makes them
<hi>worſe than the very worſt Infidels.</hi> Good God! What
will the end of theſe things be?</p>
            <p>And thus I have done. But do not you think,
that you alſo have done with what you have now
heard. Your Work does but <hi>Begin,</hi> when mine is
<hi>Ended.</hi> Your Work is to <hi>Do</hi> and <hi>Practiſe</hi> what I
have deliver'd according to God's Word, and not
to <hi>Judge,</hi> and to <hi>Cenſure</hi> it. <hi>For, if thou</hi> judge <hi>the
Law, thou art not a</hi> Doer <hi>of the Law, but a</hi> Judge,
Jam. 4. 11. Your Work is to Do, and not <hi>Only</hi> to
Hear. Do you therefore make a Solemn Vow unto
the Lord: But make it <hi>Now:</hi> Make it before you
ſtir from hence. <hi>Joſhua</hi> gives you, and the thing it
ſelf requires no longer time to conſider of it. For
ſays he, <hi>Chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve.</hi> If you
will chuſe at all, you muſt chuſe out of hand, you
muſt chuſe <hi>to day,</hi> even <hi>Now.</hi> Now therefore do you
All make a Solemn Vow unto the Lord, That, if you
have neglected <hi>Family-Duties</hi> hitherto, you will
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66181:15"/>
never neglect them for the time to come. But, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
others may do in their Families, <hi>As for Vs, as
for All Vs that are here preſent, we and our Families
will ſerve the Lord; yea, we will ſerve him againſt
all Oppoſition to the contrary.</hi> And let all the People
ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> Lord Jeſu, <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>

               <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> How I would have <hi>Family-Duties</hi>

               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> The Church of <hi>England</hi> had

whether the one way or the other. And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of this Anſwer are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> There is no Learned and Sober <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
               <hi>The Authors of the</hi> Common-Prayer-Book
<hi>did never deſign it for the uſe of Private Families.
For otherwiſe,</hi> A Form of Prayer to be uſed in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

<hi>And Biſhop</hi> Patrick <hi>is expreſs in the Preface to his

will be beſt preſerved, by imploying it
only in the Publick Divine Service; or in the Private,
where there is a Prieſt to Officiate. <hi>And therefore, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
according to the Church of</hi> England <hi>it ſelf,</hi> A
Prayer of any ones making may be as well, if not better
uſed in Private Families, than even the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi>
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> The 55 Canon does command all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

preſcribed, But alſo to <hi>that Effect, as briefly as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
they may.</hi> And if the Church <hi>Commands</hi>
us to do ſo in Publick, much more does it <hi>Allow</hi> us
to do ſo in Private. And therefore, even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Church of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf, <hi>A Prayer of

as well as a Set-Form.</hi> And therefore, ſeeing
theſe things are ſo; I do</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First of all,</hi> make this humble Requeſt to all
Diſſenters: Seeing the moſt Learned and the moſt
Pious Authors of your Perſwaſion have <hi>Printed,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66181:17"/>
thereby have <hi>Allowed</hi> the uſe of Set-Forms of Prayer
for <hi>Family-Duties:</hi> And ſeeing that all among you
have not the <hi>Gift of Ex tempore Prayer:</hi> Therefore
be pleaſed to Pray to God by a Set-Form, rather
than not Pray to him at all. When you cannot make
a Prayer of your own, be pleaſed to make uſe of
one already made to your Hands: Or to make uſe
of your own Compariſon, <hi>Take Crutches when you
cannot go without them.</hi> Take the Help of others,
when you cannot help your ſelves. And that this
is no unreaſonable Requeſt is plain, from this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Inſtance.</p>
            <p>An Ingenious and a Pious Merchant of this City,
my Good Friend, Lodged in his Youth in a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Diſſenters Houſe: And after ſome Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he perceived that he and his Family never
went to Prayers. Upon which, he very fairly took
his Landlord aſide, and asked him the reaſon why
he had no Family-Duties in his Houſe? And his
Landlord gave him this Ingenuous Anſwer. Iown
my ſelf guilty of Sin in doing as I do, and I do not
know how I can poſſibly avoid it. For, <hi>I cannot
Pray Ex tempore; and I reckon it unlawful to Pray any
other way.</hi> And let all Unlearned Men of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
lay their Hands to their Hearts, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be not more or leſs their own condition?
And that's my Firſt Requeſt. And my</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Requeſt</hi> is to the Church of <hi>England</hi>-Men,
and 'tis this. Seeing the Church does not oblige you
to uſe the Common-Prayer-Book in your Families:
<hi>Yea,</hi> ſeeing it does rather oblige you to uſe ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prayers, <hi>unleſs you have a Prieſt to Officiate: Yea,
farther,</hi> Seeing its Canons do leave you at liberty to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66181:17"/>
uſe a Set-Form, or elſe, to make a Prayer of your
own <hi>to the ſame Effect, as conveniently as you may:
Yea and further yet,</hi> ſeeing it gives you this Liberty
even in Publick before your Sermons; Then, do
not you be as <hi>ſuperſtitiouſly for,</hi> as ſome few others
are ſuperſtitiouſly <hi>against Set-Forms.</hi> Let not thoſe
that Pray <hi>Ex tempore Deſpiſe</hi> them that Pray by a
<hi>Form:</hi> And let not thoſe that Pray by a Form <hi>Judge</hi>
them that Pray <hi>Ex tempore.</hi> For, I do not in the
leaſt doubt but they both do it to the Lord. And I
do not in the leaſt doubt neither, but the Lord hath
received them both. The only Miſery on't is this.
We both agree very well when we underſtand one
anothers meaning. But we ſcarce ever vouchſafe to
give one another a Meeting, that we may underſtand
one another. Let then the Diſſenters be but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to Pray by a <hi>Form</hi> in <hi>Our</hi> Families, and we will
come and Pray <hi>Ex tempore</hi> in <hi>Theirs.</hi> Or if they
cannot condeſcend to this, let them but be of the
ſame <hi>Heart,</hi> tho they cannot be of the ſame <hi>Mind</hi>
with us. Let us love one another, and freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
together without any Jealouſie or Suſpicion.
And then, tho we ſhould chance to be like <hi>Chriſts
Coat of divers Colours, and various Judgments:</hi> Yet,
we may be like it alſo, <hi>Seamleſs, and all of a piece,
knit together in one common Bond of Charity. We may
hold the Faith in Vnity of Spirit, in the Land of
Peace, and in Righteouſneſs of Life.</hi> And that this is
no unreaſonable Request neither, is plain from this
following Inſtance.</p>
            <p>About three or four years ago, I was acquainted
with a Learned, a Sober, and a Wealthy Country-Gentleman
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66181:18"/>
ſome Aſſurances that he gave me of his Friendſhip,
both by <hi>Word of Mouth,</hi> and by <hi>Letter,</hi> I took
him to be my Friend. And one Night being in his
Houſe, and being deſired to read Prayers, I readily
complyed with ſo good a Motion. But, finding the
Second Leſſon to be a difficult Chapter in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which I my ſelf did not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
I exchanged it for another, <hi>againſt the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Apparel,</hi> as I thought, of more Edification to
ſome Perſons who were there preſent. But the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
belike, took it ill, that I ſhould offer to
change the Chapter, and asked me the Reaſon why
I durſt do ſo. To which I gave theſe Anſwers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I did not well underſtand that Chapter my
ſelf, and 'twas not very likely that his Family could
underſtand it better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If I had underſtood it better, I would
not have read it notwithſtanding: Becauſe, another
was more uſeful for ſome Perſons there preſent, who
were, in my Judgment, but too vain and light in
their Apparel: Adding, that where-ever I ſhould
chance to be, I would always do that, which would
do moſt good to my Hearers, tho it were to my
great Diſadvantage in this World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I had the expreſs Order of the Church
for what I did: For, <hi>the Admonition to all Miniſters
Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> Printed before the Homilies, has theſe
Words, <hi>Where it may ſo chance ſome one or other Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Old Teſtament to fall in order to be read up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sundays or Holydays, which were better to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66181:18"/>
changed for ſome other of the New Teſtament of more
Edification, it ſhall be well done to ſpend your Time to
conſider well of ſuch Chapters before-hand, whereby your
Prudence and Diligence in your Office may appear; ſo
that your People may have cauſe to glorify God for you,
and be the readier to embrace your Labors, to your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Commendation, to the Diſcharge of your Conſciences
and their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet for all this, and a great deal more to
the ſame purpoſe that I then ſaid to him, he ſo ſtifly
and ſo obſtinately ſtuck to the <hi>Kalendar,</hi> that He
wholly diſregarded the <hi>Edification of his Family, the
Breach of Friendſhip, and the excellent Order of the
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From both which Inſtances, not to give you any
more, I humbly conceive, that both my Requeſts
are not at all <hi>unreaſonable</hi> or <hi>unſeaſonable.</hi> And God
of his infinit Mercy grant that they may be both
<hi>Duly weighed,</hi> and <hi>Conſcientiouſly Practiced.</hi> And
God grant alſo, that the <hi>Rigid</hi> and <hi>High-flown</hi> Men
of both ſides may be Diſallowed and Diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced!
And that the <hi>Moderate</hi> and <hi>Sober</hi> Men of both
ſides may be only approved and encouraged! That
ſo, <hi>Our Moderation may be known unto all Men,</hi>
and that our <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> may be a City that is at Peace
and Unity with its ſelf! And Oh how willingly would
I go and meet them half way! Yea, How willingly
would I go and meet them to their own <hi>Houſes!</hi> And
God grant all Men may be of the ſame Mind for
Chriſt his ſake! <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides theſe things that do equally concern
my <hi>Conforming</hi> and <hi>Non-Conforming</hi> Brethren: I have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66181:19"/>
one thing more which I humbly crave leave to offer
to the Conſideration of my <hi>Brethren the Clergy of
the Church of</hi> England in <hi>particular,</hi> becauſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it will very much further the Obſervation of
<hi>Family-Duties:</hi> And 'tis this.</p>
            <p>The chief things which <hi>Family-Duties</hi> conſiſt of,
are <hi>Reading the Scripture, Praying and Catechizing.</hi>
And the <hi>Rubrick</hi> obliges all Miniſters to Read, in their
reſpective Churches, Morning and Evening-Prayer,
<hi>Every Day,</hi> as well as <hi>Every Lord's-Day</hi> throughout
the Year. And the <hi>Rubrick</hi> and the <hi>59th Canon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them alſo to Catechize <hi>every Lords-Day, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Holy-Day,</hi> (and not only in <hi>Leant-time,</hi>) in the
Afternoon for half an Hour or more, either <hi>before
Evening-Prayer, or after the Second Leſſon.</hi> And this
they oblige them to upon pain of <hi>Sharp Reproof</hi> for
the Firſt Fault, <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> for the Second, and <hi>Ex-communication</hi>
for the Third.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>Pariſh-Miniſters</hi> will not do this of <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs;</hi>
and if the Biſhops will not make them do
it, by putting the Laws in Execution againſt them:
Then, How can it be expected, that the <hi>People</hi> will do
it in their Private Houſes, when the <hi>Clergy themſelves</hi>
will not do it in the Church of God? How can it
be expected, that the <hi>People</hi> ſhould <hi>Pray</hi> and <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize</hi>
in their Families, when the <hi>Miniſters</hi> dare not
preſs them to do ſo, for fear of betraying their own
<hi>Careleſsneſs and Breach of Subſcription?</hi> No Man can
<hi>Heartily</hi> Preach againſt that Sin, which he himſelf is
guilty of, but his Conſcience muſt needs fly in his
Face: And if he do Preach againſt it <hi>after ſome ſort
or other</hi> no, Man can ſcarce believe a word of what
he ſays, ſeeing his own Practice is quite contrary,
and his Example confutes his Preaching.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:66181:19"/>
God knows my Heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do not ſay this to <hi>Caſt</hi>
any Contempt upon the Clergy: But, it poſſible, to
<hi>Wipe away</hi> ſome of that which, I am afraid, is but too
deſervedly caſt upon too many of Us. Which God
of his Infinite Mercy grant, for Chriſt his ſake. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Amen.</hi>

<hi>Maliciouſly and Induſtriouſly</hi> ſpread about concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, to the hindrance of my Miniſterial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
