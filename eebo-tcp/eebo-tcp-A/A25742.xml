            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Meditations were not at first design'd for publick view, but fix'd upon to reclaim a busie roving thought from wandring in the pernicious and perplexed maze of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions; whereinto the vain cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity of youth had drawn me to consider and translate the account some old Poets and Philosophers give of the original of things: which though I found it, blasphemously against God, and bruitishly below the reason of a man, set forth by some, erroniously, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and uncertainly, by the best; yet had it fill'd my brain with such foolish fancies, that I found it necessary to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the fountain of Truth, to wash out all ugly wild im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and fortifie my mind with a strong antidote against all the poyson of humane Wit and Wisdome that I had been dabling withal. And this effect I found; For comparing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, God gives of himself and his operations, in his Word, with what the wisest of mankind, who only walk'd in the dim light of corrupted nature and defective Traditions, could with all their industry trace out, or invent; I found it so transcendently excelling all that was humane, so much above our narrow reason, and yet so agreeable to it being rectified, that I disdained the Wisdome fools so much admire themselves for; and as I found Icould know nothing but what God taught
<pb facs="tcp:50109:3"/>
me, so I resolv'd never to search after any knowledge of him and his productions, but what he himself hath given forth. Those that will be wise above what is written, may hug their Philosophical clouds, but let them take heed they find not themselves without God in the world, adoring figments of their own brains, instead of the living and true God.</p>
            <p>Lest that arrive by misadventure, which never shall by my consent, that any of the pudled water, my wanton youth drew from the prophane Helicon of ancient Poets, should be sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about the world, I have for prevention sent forth this Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say; with a Profession that I disclaim all doctrines of God and his works, but what I learn out of his own word, and have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd it to be a very unsafe and unprofitable thing for those that are young, before their faith be fixed, to exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the study of vain, foolish, atheistical Poesie. It is a miracle of grace and mercy, if such be not depriv'd of the light of Truth, who having shut their eyes against that Sun, have, instead of looking up to it, hunted gloworms in the ditch bottoms. It is a misery I cannot but bewail, that when we are young, whereas the lovely characters of Truth should be imprest upon the tender mind and memory, they are so fill'd up with ridiculous lies, that 'tis the greatest business of our lives, assoon as ever we come to be serious, to cleanse out all the rubbish, our grave Tutors laid in when they taught us to study and admire their inspired Poets and divine Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers.</p>
            <p>But when I have thus taken occasion, to vindicate my self from those heathenish Authors I have been conversant in, I cannot expect my work should find acceptance in the world, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the more full and various delight I have found in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Truth by its own conduct; Nor am I much concern'd how it be entertain'd, seeking no glory by it, but what is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to him to whom it is only due. If any one of no higher a pitch than my self, be as much affected and stirr'd up in the
<pb facs="tcp:50109:3"/>
reading, as I have been in the writing, to admire the glories and excellencies of our great Creator, to fall low before him, in the sense of our own vileness, and to adore his Power, his Wisdome, and his Grace, in all his dealings with the children of men, it will be a success above my hopes; though my charity makes me wish every one that hath need of it the same mercy I have found.</p>
            <p>I know I am obnoxious to the censures of two sorts of people: First, those that understand and love the elegancies of Poems, They will find nothing of fancy in it; no elevations of stile, no charms of language, which I confess are gifts I have not, nor desire not in this occasion; for I would rather breath forth grace cordially than words artificially. I have not studied to utter any thing that I have not really taken in. And I acknowledge all the language I have, is much too narrow to express the least of those wonders my soul hath been ravisht with in the contemplation of God and his Works. Had I had a fancy, I durst not have exercis'd it here; for I tremble to think of turning Scripture into a Romance; and shall not be troubled at their dislike who dislike on that account; and profess they think no poem can be good that shuts out drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and lasciviousness, and libelling Satyr, the theams of all their celebrated songs. These, (though I will not much defend my ownweakness) dislike not the Poem so much as the subject of it.</p>
            <p>But there are a second sort of people, whose Genius not lying that way, and seeing the common and vile abuse of Poesie, think Scripture prophan'd by being descanted on in numbers; but such will pardon me when they remember a great part of the Scripture was originally written in verse; and we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to exercise our spiritual mirth in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs; which if I have weakly compos'd, yet 'tis a consenting testimony with the whole Church, to the mighty and glorious truths of God which ir not altogether impertinent, in
<pb facs="tcp:50109:4"/>
this atheistical age; and how imperfect soever the hand be, that copies it out, Truth loses not its perfection, and the plainest as well as the elegant, the elegant as well as the plain, make up a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in confession and celebration of that all-creating, all-su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining God, to whom be all honour and glory for ever and ever.</p>

               </l>
               <l>And when with thanks we render him his own,</l>
               <l>Either he gives us back our offerings,</l>
               <l>Or our submission pays with better things:</l>

               <l>We cannot miss ease and vicissitude,</l>
               <l>Till our last rest our labours shall conclude.</l>
               <l>Natural tears there are, which in due bound</l>
               <l>Do not the soul with sinful sorrow drown,</l>
               <l>Repentant tears too are no fretting brine, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10.</note>
               </l>

No murmuring winds of passions here prevail,</l>

               <l>And draws rich extracts from the soaked seeds,</l>

               <l>Augments the evils of our present state,</l>

               <l>Vain is that grief which can no ill redress,</l>

               <l>Whatever doth to mortal men befall</l>
               <l>Not casual is, like shafts at randome shot,</l>

               <l>In which th' obedient and the meek rejoyce,</l>
               <l>Above their own preferring Gods wise choice:</l>

               <l>Tho' our gross sense pierce not its mysteries.</l>
               <l>As there's but one most true substantial good,</l>
               <l>And God himself is that Beatitude:</l>
               <l>So can we suffer but one real ill,</l>
               <l>Divorce from him by our repugnant will,</l>
               <l>Which when to just submission it returns,</l>
               <l>The reunited soul no longer mourns,</l>
               <l>His serene rays dry up its former tears,</l>
               <l>Dispel the tempest of its carnal fears,</l>
               <l>Which dread what either never may arrive,</l>
               <l>Or not as seen in their false perspective;</l>
