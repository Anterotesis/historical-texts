            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If the Law hath thus setled a load upon conscience then she may conclude that she is under a condition of ease, and hope of pardon; if thou feel then that the Lord hath thee at his infinite advantage, thou mayst conceive some comfort in the midst of thy frights, and allthough thou mayst finde it hard to graple with the promise as thou wouldst; yet (as one who is under an exactor)

would chose to put himselfe upon the mercy of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, rather then be quite undone, (if he will not shew him favour yet he is but as he was, an undone man) but perhaps his enemy may be moved with compassion towards him: so here, a poor soule may and ought to choose the hazard of a promise (allthough hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) rather then be desperate and disdaine to come in to seek reconciliation: Let all then who would be under hope prove themselves to be under streights; for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The union of Grace is not like that of creation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the measure, nor in the instrument of it; not in the measure, for in the creation there was a total and ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat union in that kinde, and it was a perfect one having Gods image in it without let or impeachment; but this union of Grace is an imperfect union for measure in this life, because the reliques of corruption and the old <hi>Adam</hi> as drosse mix themselves with the soul, suffers not God and it to knit fully, but as it is with the science put into the clift of a stock, if there be any drosse in the clift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the stock and the science it cannot be close and grow perfectly: so here, the Lord and the soul cannot be so nere in this life, because there is fo much scurf within us that God and we cannot close, God being contrary or disagreeing with <hi>Baal</hi>; and this appears further in this, that the estate that answers Paradice is not of Grace, but that to come in glory, when corruption and sin and death shall be swallowed up in corruption, full righteousnesse and life, not that there is not even here a true and reall union, but not a full and intire one: The instruments of unions are unlike, for that of creation needed no other tie or bond save the immediate presence of God in his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which had then no sin nor let to divide it; but the union that is now, is incumbred with lets and enimies, must needs be maintained by a band of greater perfection

then any is in us; the nearer infused grace of light and holinesse joyned <hi>Adam</hi> and God, and that free will in his nature upheld that Image of God in her exercise and action; but it is otherwise now in this decay of nature, there must be wrought in the soule another instrument to knit us to God, and hold his grace in continuall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise; Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

much as she once had this life and Image of God created in her, and hath wilfully lost it; therefore before he can restore her to it the second time, his justice, which is wronged by her sins, and hath justly accused her for it, must first be satisfied, and the soule must apprehend this Sanctification to her selfe as her own, and by this means her guiltiness and curse must be washed off, and removed out of his way, for otherwise how can he and the corrupt soul be brought together, what communion can there be between sin and purenesse? Secondly, He enlightens the soul in the way it self, to wit, that in his wisdome and love he hath granted his own Son, true God, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which was offended, to suffer the imputation of guilt, and the death which it procured in the nature, and for the nature of guilty man, and by this suffering he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied justice to the full; so that hereby by the way that sin had shut up might stand and lie open, for the restoring of poor lost souls to their former nature and life of God a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gain. Having thus enlightned the soul about this way, he then applies it to the soul, and that by a second closer work of his grace, for he applies this work of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the instrument of his word and promises, which is as a seed of his Regeneration, cast into the womb of the soul by hearing it preached; as St. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Of his good will begot he us by the word of truth:</hi> This word carrieth with it a forming power of the second birth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a creating of God in the soul. Againe, Secondly, The efficient cause is the spirit of Regeneration, taking the word and casting it into the soul, there hatching and cherishing the same till it hath formed Christ therein, who is the second <hi>Adam,</hi> the true way and life, that quickning spirit. And Thirdly, He effects this in the soul by the power of faith, which receives this seed of the word, and this quickning of the spirit, and posesseth the soul therewith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42908:10"/>Faith doth these two things. First, it receivs the way of this life into the soul, which is the putting away of guilt and curse, which <hi>Adams</hi> sin contracted, and that is pardon and forgivenesse.

            <p>REdemption to two things. First, thraldome and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42908:21"/>
slavery to sin, and so to all enemies who by sin strove to hold the soul under fear and bondage. Secondly, to the sting and dint of all such crosses as sin hath brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, as the tokens of Gods displeasure for it. Touching the first, Redemption sets the soule at liberty from all that servitude and tiranny, it buys out and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores the soul to the liberty of the released and ransomed ones, makes it free onely to righteousnesse, and that for ever bears the eare for God, and yet not to make the soul slavish but a servant being delivered from all enemies, yea death it selfe, the last enemy, to serve the Lord in righteousnesse and holinesse alwayes: From hence issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an heart in larged to God, so fearing him as fearing nothing else, not serving in the oldnesse of the letter but in the newnesse of the spirit, delivered from the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of <hi>Moses,</hi> the traditions of Pharises and Papists, the bonds imposed unjustly by bad men upon consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Hence, secondly, floweth a right to the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and providence of God and to his holy hand over us and ours against the violence of outward enemies, or those crosses which threaten our lives, health, liberty, and welfare begun in this life ending at the resurrection. And lastly, to those two may be added freedome to Gods service, to finde it an easie yoak and a light burden, yea to count it our happinesse to deny our own wills, because bodies and souls are bought with a price, that we should not be at our own but at his will who dearly bought us, see 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. The will hath lost her freedome to all true good and is tyed to evill onely and continually, the conscience hath lost hers by guilt and accuseth in stead of excusing, or else excused deceitfully, or else is senslesse of either, sorrow begins at home by sin but ends abroad, for by this means whatsoever fear or evill sin hath incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Devil abuses to hold the soule under by, as the wrath of God, the purenesse and terrour of the Law,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42908:21"/>
the one to tempt the other to terrifie the day of account and last Judgement, the time of death which is the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in this life eternall misery hereafter, besides many calamities here either felt or feared, from which though a sinner be actually saved, yet not secured of, but all the life long subject unto bondage; by these Satan enslaves the soul, so that either their bondage by sin i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> used by the Lord as a step to deliver from bondage to sin; sin hath set up a court in the conscience of man, in this court the debt or crime impleaded is sin, the pleader and informer is Satan, the rule of proceeding is the Law of Justice, the evidence given or witnesse is conscience, the Judge the Lord, the penalty is death and distruction; during the substance of this court in what a pickle is man; the strong man Satan by this house of conscience holds this sinner bound and shut up under brazen bars and bolts not to be broken open by a mortall opposite but rules and keeps all at peace and at his own pleasure.</p>
