         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THis Honourable Perſon ought to be

and Perſeverance in the Royal Cauſe,

termed, <hi>The Flower of</hi> Engliſh <hi>Fidelity,</hi>

mentioned according to that of the Pſalmiſt,
<hi>Pſalm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 112. 6.</hi> The Righteous ſhall be had
in Everlaſting Remembrance.</p>
                  <p>He was Son and Heir to Sir <hi>Arthur
Capel</hi> of <hi>Hadham Hall</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi>
a Gentleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a great Eſtate, one who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Old Mode of our Nation, kept a
bountiful houſe, and ſhewed forth his Faith
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97935:4"/>
by his works, extending his charity in ſuch
abundant manner to the poor that he was
<hi>bread</hi> to the <hi>hungry, drink</hi> to the <hi>thirſty,
eyes</hi> to the <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>legs</hi> to the <hi>lame,</hi>
and might be juſtly ſtiled <hi>Great Almoner
to the King of Kings.</hi> Concerning
the humility of this worthy Knight
(though it be too ſudden a diverſion) I ſhall
preſume to inſert a ſtory, which I have heard
delivered by ſome well acquainted with his
Worſhip; that he being one time at his Gate
all alone, in a plain but decent habit, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-man
who had plumed himſelf with his
Maſters caſt Feathers came riding to him,
&amp; asked him if Sir <hi>Arthur Capel</hi> were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<hi>Sir,</hi> replied the knight, <hi>he was there
not long ago, and if you pleaſe to walk
in you may hear further of his Servants;</hi>
Old Father, ſaid the Serving-man, here take
my horſe and walk him; and therewithal
gave him a ſmall peice of Silver, it being
the firſt money he ever received in that kind;
Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> agreed to the motion, and with a
ſmile received from him a ſingle penny, took
his horſe, and walkt him, whilſt the finical
ſpruce Serving-man ſtrutted with convenient
boldneſs into the houſe; But being informed
by the Servants, that their Maſter was at
the Gate, he replying that he was not there,
one of them to juſtify himſelf went with him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97935:4"/>
to the Gate to ſee, where they found Sir
<hi>Arthur</hi> very induſtrious in his Imployment;
the Serving-man very much aſhamed of his
miſtake, craved pardon, and with humble
obeiſance, with his hat in his hand, with
many cringes, would have received the horſe
from the knight, <hi>Nay ſtay, ſays</hi> Sir Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,
<hi>you paid me my hire, get up as ſoon
as you will, for I am reſolved to ſee
you on Horſe-back.</hi> Then the old Knight
putting his hand into his purſe gave him
half a piece, which he ſaid was for taking ſo
much care of his Maſters Horſe, being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
thus liberal to incourage his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to imitate his careful example.</p>
                  <p>But to return to his ſon, he was very well
educated, attaining to ſome perfection in
learning; his Father dying, as he inherited
his Eſtate ſo he did his virtues. The Privacy
of this noble Lord before the war was paſſed
with as much popularity in the Country, as
his more publick appearance in it was with
valour and Fidelity in the Field. In our too
happy time of peace none was more Pious,
Charitable, and Munificent; In our unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
differences none more reſolved, Loyal and
active; The People loved him ſo well that
they choſe him one of their Repreſentatives
and the King eſteemed him ſo much, that
he made him one of his Peers in Parliament;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97935:5"/>
the King and People agreeing in this one
thing, to have a juſt kindneſs for the Lord
<hi>Capel;</hi> He was one of thoſe excellent Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
whoſe gravity and diſcretion the
King ſaid, <hi>He hoped would allay and fix
the faction to a due Temperament;</hi>
guiding ſome mens well meaning zeal by ſuch
rules of Moderation as are beſt both to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
and reſtore the health of all States and
kingdoms, keeping to the dictates of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
rather than yielding to the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of the People, to what was juſt, rather
than what was ſafe, ſave only in the Earl
of <hi>Straffords</hi> caſe, wherein he yielded to the
publick neceſſity with his Royal Maſter, but
repented with him too, ſealing his Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for that miſcarriage with his blood, when
he was more troubled for his forced conſent
to that brave Perſons death than for loſing
his own life; he ventured through the firſt
war, and by his Ingagement in the ſecond,
for after the ſurender of <hi>Oxford</hi> he retired
to his own houſe but could not reſt there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the King was brought home to his, which
all <hi>England</hi> endeavouring as one man my
Lord adventured himſelf at <hi>Colcheſter to</hi>
Extremity, yeilding himſelf upon Condition of
Quarter, which he urged by the Law of
Arms, that Law that governeth the World;
<hi>Yet</hi> (as he ſaid,) <hi>againſt the Law of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97935:5"/>
God &amp; man, for keeping the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
he was ſacrificed on</hi> a Scaffold
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with a courage that became
a clear Conſcience, and a reſolution befitting
a good Chriſtian, expreſſing that ſame Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Piety at his death, which he did in
this Incomparable Book of his Meditations
in his life, A Piety that (as it appeared by
his diſmiſſion of his Chaplains, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
of that times Devotions, before he
came to the Scaffold,) was rather his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
frame and habit, than outward Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or Pomp, from the Noble ſentiment
whereof, the Poet not unhappily alluding to his
Arms, A <hi>Lyon Rampant</hi> in <hi>Field Gules,</hi>
between <hi>two Croſſes</hi> thus expreſſeth it:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Our <hi>Lyon</hi>-like <hi>Capel</hi> undaunted ſtood</l>

                     </l>
                  </q>
                  <p>As one that affrighted death rather than
affrighted by it. It being very obſervable,
That a learned Dr. of Phyſick preſent at the
opening and Embalming of this Lord, and
the Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> delivered at a publick
Lecture; <hi>That the Lord</hi> Capels <hi>was the
leaſt heart, and the Dukes the greateſt

going from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to <hi>York</hi> at the

and the Meſſages of Peace from the Army in

to <hi>Cornwal,</hi> where he was hurt in two or

                     </hi> in anſwer to that of Sir <hi>Tho.

The Prince ſent a Trumpet with an Anſwer

a paſs for the Lord <hi>Capel</hi> to go to the King
to make him ſome overtures from the Prince,

taking notice ſoon after of an Order of the

                  <p>After this a pretended High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice

that if all the Magiſtrates in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

<hi>preſervation</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:</hi>
For I believe <hi>both</hi> duties are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<hi>conjoyned</hi> in this occaſion. The inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
after this led me into the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

&amp; that as <hi>thoſe</hi> are not to be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

appearance of little elſe remaining, ſave

by the <hi>paſſive.</hi> (And truly I doubt
not but the <hi>divine goodneſs,</hi> will act for

                     <p>Theſe cogitations drew from me the

That His <hi>Majeſty</hi> is indubitably <hi>God</hi>'s
<hi>Vice-gerent</hi> over us, and that this <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi>
we owe unto Him, we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
by the Oaths of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance;</hi>
That not any of his <hi>Subjects</hi>
can ſtretch forth their Hands <hi>againſt
Him,</hi> and be <hi>Guiltleſs;</hi> That they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
(according to the Practice of the
<hi>Holieſt Chriſtians,</hi> in all Ages) a Time
and Place to <hi>prove this</hi> great <hi>Truth</hi> they
now aſſert, by Evidence out of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
and if this be <hi>not allowed</hi> them, then
to declare, they refuſe not to <hi>ſeal</hi> it by
<hi>Martyrdom?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I do very readily acknowledge, that
the Qualifications for ſo great an <hi>Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
ought to be <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>ſerious;</hi> and
that to ruſh into <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> (as long
as <hi>God</hi> hath left us any <hi>juſtifiable human
Means)</hi> may want as much of true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Piety,</hi> as it may ſeem of <hi>Prudence.
God</hi> hath engaged our Nature to many
and ſeveral <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Functions;</hi> and
each hath its ſeveral <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
whereby they are ſo ſet on work,
that each may attain their due and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Ends.</hi> Nor is the <hi>greateſt</hi> Means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>beſt,</hi> when there are others, though
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97935:51"/>
yet <hi>fitter.</hi> But if I miſtake not,
<hi>Ventum eſt uſque ad Triarios;</hi> We muſt
bring up the <hi>Reſerve. God</hi> hath in his juſt
Judgments, (upon our <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)</hi>
permitted all our <hi>Temporal</hi> Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to be diſſipated and fruſtrated;
we may ſay, Our <hi>Van</hi> and our <hi>Battle</hi> are
routed: But if the Courage of this our
<hi>Reſerve</hi> fails us not, I hope we ſhall <hi>rally</hi>
our ſelves again about it; and, by the
Divine Goodneſs, have a <hi>fair day</hi> of it.
This will <hi>awaken all, encourage</hi> the <hi>half-ſpirited,
corroborate</hi> all <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi>
Minds. Methinks, I have Reaſon too
on my ſide, when I believe it will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall into this Conſequence. All the
<hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (with very little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception)
will ſecond ſo Chriſtian an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
Beſides, moſt <hi>entire Families</hi> will
be engaged; and ſcarce will there be
<hi>One,</hi> but will have a ſhare in it. For to
this Point the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> will frankly
concur; divers reputed <hi>Independents</hi> (of
whom I know ſome much valued by <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)</hi>
will be joyned unto you; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the <hi>Army,</hi> the Impreſſion of it
will be notable. Nor can their preſent
<hi>Power</hi> prevent the Expreſſion of ſo <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi>
a Senſe, ſo <hi>piouſly incited,</hi> and ſo <hi>well
warranted.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="97" facs="tcp:97935:51"/>
Whereby will appear their <hi>Paucity.</hi>
Upon good Advertiſement I am aſſured,
that they <hi>believe</hi> they have the <hi>Hearts</hi>
of the <hi>greater number</hi> of the People; ſo
much hath their Proſperity <hi>dazled</hi> them:
But of nothing am I more <hi>certain,</hi> than
that they have not the <hi>Fortieth</hi> Man.
And an <hi>Expedient</hi> like to this, to let
both the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Them</hi> into a <hi>View
one of another,</hi> I know not. And yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
would this be further proſecuted:
This <hi>Atteſtation</hi> would be ſent into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and all the <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> and
<hi>States</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> (for with the <hi>Others</hi> we
communicate not.) And for it I know
an <hi>Expedient proper,</hi> and of <hi>Reputation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If this Progreſs of it ſhould fail, though
improbably, which hath ſuch a politick
Seemingneſs in it; yet in my Opinion,
it doth not at all vitiate the <hi>Pious Part</hi>
of it: The <hi>means</hi> and <hi>end</hi> being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
truly <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I ſay, if it ſhould fail,
yet I ſee not that any thing we can <hi>do</hi>
or <hi>ſuffer,</hi> can more than anſwer the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi>
of the <hi>Occaſion,</hi> and the <hi>Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
that lieth upon us as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to do
the utmoſt of our <hi>Duty.</hi> How long, and
with how many Arts and Subtilties have
<hi>theſe</hi> Men <hi>abuſed</hi> and <hi>deluded</hi> the People
with the Pretenſions of their <hi>candid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,</hi>
                           <pb n="98" facs="tcp:97935:52"/>
only to preſerve the <hi>Laws</hi> of
the Nation, and the <hi>Proteſtant Profeſſion?</hi>
But now that they are poſſeſſed of ſo
great <hi>Power,</hi> with what <hi>Impitdence</hi> do they
<hi>confound thoſe,</hi> and with what <hi>Impiety</hi> do
they <hi>ſubvert this?</hi> But ſince in this caſe
<hi>both thoſe</hi> do ſo well accord, were it not
beſt to ſet this <hi>laſt named</hi> in the <hi>Front,</hi>
and to draw up the <hi>Civil Affair</hi> to it:
and though we contend for <hi>both,</hi> yet to
fight under the Banner of <hi>this,</hi> in ſome
ſuch manner as I have ſtated it, and by
your Wiſdom will be diſpoſed into the

                        <p>I ſhall add ſuch a <hi>Conſideration</hi> more,
that if it ſtood <hi>ſingly,</hi> yet in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
would juſtifie and quit the Coſt of
any <hi>Endeavour</hi> or <hi>Indurance:</hi> That is,
The unparallel'd <hi>Sufferings</hi> of this <hi>Great

me, Multitudes of Men are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
if in the Point of his <hi>Temporal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,</hi>
he had not been in a much <hi>better
condition,</hi> (though I profeſs not in a <hi>good</hi>
one) had he timely <hi>relaxed</hi> much of his
<hi>conſtancy</hi> and <hi>ſincerity</hi> towards the Rights,
Preheminencies and Patrimony of the
<hi>Church.</hi> Neither is <hi>our</hi> Obligation but
very great to him; his Sufferings being
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97935:52"/>
for our <hi>Laws;</hi> ſo unqueſtionable is our
<hi>Proſperity</hi> mixed with <hi>His Dignity.</hi> Now,
ſhall this <hi>Great Perſonage</hi> ſuffer <hi>Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Deprivation</hi> of <hi>Majeſty, Abſence</hi> of
all <hi>Worldly Comforts,</hi> and minutely <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of Life,</hi> for his Magnanimous <hi>ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastneſs</hi>

And truly, in Human Reaſon, (the

no <hi>Guard</hi> for his Life, but by ſome

                        </p>
                        <p>I cannot refuſe to believe, that this

readily acknowledge; but the <hi>Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>

                           <pb n="101" facs="tcp:97935:53"/>
But after all this, I ſhall make this

Indeed, I am not at all guilty

and perhaps, diſpoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to it, in a much <hi>better manner</hi>
than I have propoſed. I have only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
my <hi>Opinion.</hi> Receive it, I pray,
<hi>as it is;</hi> I may affirm, in the <hi>weakeſt</hi>
part of it, not wanting ſome meaſure
of a <hi>pious Jealouſie,</hi> (as a <hi>Son</hi> of this
<hi>Church)</hi> for this great <hi>Verity</hi> taught and
profeſſed in it, and as a Tranſport of
that <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>care</hi> I have for the <hi>ſafety</hi>
of this <hi>Gracious Prince,</hi> my <hi>Maſter.</hi> To
which I ſhall add, That I have had too
much <hi>Experience</hi> in this World, to be
ignorant of this frequent <hi>Truth</hi> in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
That in <hi>Good Men</hi> there is always
a <hi>modeſty</hi> accompanying them, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
they <hi>begin over-late:</hi> And it is
almoſt proper to them neither to <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinate,</hi>
nor to be over-haſty to <hi>encounter

                     <p>This proceeding (I acknowledge) is
not ordinary, not exampled: but the
occaſion is altogether <hi>new,</hi> and ſo <hi>unima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,</hi>
That (all the circumſtances
weighed) all hiſtories are ſilent, that the
like thing ever entered into the heart of
man, as this intended enterpriſe of <hi>theſe
men</hi> of the <hi>Army:</hi> That a <hi>King</hi> and a
<hi>free Monarch,</hi> the <hi>Protector</hi> of our <hi>Municipal
Laws,</hi> ſhould, contrary to all Laws, to
our own Laws, but yet with the <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ſemblance</hi> of a <hi>packed Jury</hi> be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto <hi>Tryal for his Life.</hi> To encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this <hi>horrid novelty</hi> a way altogether
<hi>new</hi> muſt be excogitated, and ſeconded
with a <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> above ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
Why may not your <hi>Lordſhips</hi>
find it convenient to remonſtrate to all
<hi>Kings, Princes, States, Potentates</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
your diſclaimure of ſo <hi>foul</hi> a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and deſire their <hi>aſſiſtance,</hi> if it may
be timely had, for the <hi>preſervation</hi> of his
<hi>ſacred Majeſties Life?</hi> For if that were
but in a reaſonable <hi>ſecurity,</hi> you need
not doubt, but that the Kingdom hath

more than means enough to <hi>ſtruggle</hi> for

                     <p>THE conjectures of men are ſtrangely
<hi>various</hi> (yea, of the ſame perſons)
concerning the <hi>ſafety</hi> or <hi>danger</hi> of the
<hi>King,</hi> my <hi>Maſter:</hi> Sometimes their <hi>hopes,</hi>

ſhould be much aſhamed if I were the leaſt
guilty of ſo univerſal an <hi>inquietude,</hi> in ſo
juſtifiable an occaſion, and ariſing from
ſo good a ground, as a <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi>
they owe to their <hi>Lawful Prince.</hi>
I frankly give you leave to think (nor
do I value the inconvenience it could
draw along with it) that there is not
that <hi>honeſt</hi> expedient in the world to <hi>ſerve
Him</hi> by, that I would not <hi>hazard</hi> my
ſelf in, to imploy for <hi>Him:</hi> nor do I
know what <hi>Earthly felicity</hi> it is, could
be ſo <hi>welcome</hi> to me, as to advance a
ſtep, beyond <hi>any other</hi> in my duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Him.</hi> But my <hi>preſent condition</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
me the <hi>ability</hi> of any thing elſe,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97935:58"/>
but that of <hi>invocating the favour of God</hi>
for Him; and making my addreſſes to
<hi>you,</hi> whom I take to be the <hi>figure</hi> that
gives the denomination to the ſequence
of a great many <hi>Cyphers</hi> that follow you:
And therefore I do the rather believe
that a perſon, that <hi>ſignifies ſo much,</hi> will
the better apprehend what weight and
ſignification <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> have in
all <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Actions;</hi> and that
theſe at laſt will make a <hi>Conqueſt</hi> upon all

                     </p>
                     <p>I can hardly perſwade my ſelf into (I
think) the too common opinion, that
the extraordinary <hi>ſucceſs</hi> and <hi>felicity</hi> that
hath conſtantly followed your <hi>attempts</hi>
(who as the ſaying is, ſeem to have <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
fortune to ſerve you at day-wages)</hi> hath
<hi>dazled</hi> that light of <hi>underſtanding</hi> that
formerly was uſual to you. You cannot
forget the <hi>advantages</hi> on the <hi>Houſe's</hi> part,
and the <hi>Infirmities</hi> and <hi>wants</hi> on the <hi>Kings</hi>
part, at the beginning of the <hi>War;</hi> and
that the complication of <hi>many favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
accidents</hi> on the part of your Affairs,
will challenge a ſhare in the <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> yet
is there a large room too left for your
<hi>merit</hi> in <hi>Martial Conduct;</hi> and you have
cauſe enough to value your ſelf upon a
<hi>better foundation,</hi> than the <hi>event</hi> of <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:97935:58"/>

Wiſdom</hi> is not the <hi>worſe,</hi> becauſe <hi>eaſilieſt

man is <hi>Happy</hi> and <hi>Wiſe</hi> together. And
if that leſſon alſo be good, That <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

in which I have been ſtrictly diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd
for <hi>ſeven years;</hi> ſo that I muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be an <hi>egregious Dunce,</hi> or no <hi>ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller</hi>
for you; there being a Perſon ſcarce
to be found, that lyeth under ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a <hi>temptation</hi> of <hi>ſeeming proſperity,</hi> and
therefore fitteſt to be adviſed and <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled</hi>

do aſſure you I do ſo little repine at your

of the Nation by a diſcreet <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>People,</hi> as you have
been inſtrumental in their long <hi>ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
I ſhall prize your <hi>prudence, courage,
induſtry,</hi> and <hi>ſobriety,</hi> at as high an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
as the ſufficienteſt wit can deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it in Language.</p>
                     <p>I doubt not, but both of us are eaſily
agreed in this point, That <hi>ſucceſs legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
not a quarrel, nor the power which
ſupports it,</hi> Neither are the Inſtruments
of the <hi>Calamity</hi> of a Nation thereby <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</hi>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:97935:59"/>
We cannot but remember and
obſerve, that it is no more than the <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt</hi>
and <hi>imperfecteſt Creatures</hi> have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
effected, which have <hi>driven people
out</hi> of their Countreys, made <hi>deſert</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
extreamly <hi>fertile.</hi> Have not <hi>Frogs</hi>
and <hi>Locuſts</hi> deſolated <hi>Empires?</hi> and other
<hi>Vermine</hi> ruined great <hi>Cities,</hi> and large
<hi>Territories?</hi> By theſe means God magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
his own Power and Juſtice: the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi>
remain but what they were,
their Nature and Quality not <hi>changed.</hi>
But in the Acts of Gods Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to thoſe; who have been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in deſtructive <hi>practices,</hi> there is a
mutation of <hi>Qualities;</hi> an ejection of thoſe
<hi>vicious,</hi> and an infuſion of contrary <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and thoſe Affects and Appetites,
which are <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>connatural,</hi> but
<hi>miſguided,</hi> are by his goodneſs <hi>guided</hi> to
<hi>good ends.</hi> And thus was <hi>Saul</hi> from a
furious <hi>Perſecutor</hi> transformed to a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Profeſſor;</hi> from a <hi>Deſtroyer</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> to a <hi>Maſter-builder up</hi> of it. No
doubt but God in both had his ends, by
and upon Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> and from my Soul
I wiſh it, that <hi>your</hi> caſe may have a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
with <hi>his;</hi> that of <hi>him</hi> in the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
Affair, (which was the Function to
which he was ſeparated) you may be a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97935:59"/>
reſemblance in the <hi>Temporal;</hi> and from
a <hi>Deſtroyer</hi> (by God's goodneſs) rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a <hi>Reſtorer.</hi> This in paſſage to thoſe
other conſiderations I intended to you.</p>
                     <p>That which weighs moſt, and lyeth
heavieſt upon mens hearts, is, the <hi>fear</hi>
of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Perſon;</hi> that the whole
Kingdom may lye under the imputation
of the guilt of <hi>violence</hi> offered to it; and
that a <hi>mutation of the form of Government</hi>
ſhall ſucceed it. If this be the <hi>End</hi> aimed
at, then my preſent endeavour is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
to you, how humanely <hi>impoſſible</hi>
it is to <hi>attain</hi> unto it. Firſt there is no <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi>
(the neceſſary circumſtances obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
that encourageth ſuch an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
For examine <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Stories</hi> of all
<hi>States,</hi> and you will not find ſo much as
<hi>one inſtance</hi> (I pray obſerve how I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it) that ever <hi>any people within the fifth
degree</hi> (I might double the proportion)
as we of <hi>England</hi> are, or in the <hi>ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>
ſo <hi>ſpacious a Territory,</hi> were ever tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
from a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> to an <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi>
or <hi>Democracy.</hi> Some <hi>Cities</hi> and
<hi>petty Principalities</hi> have ſometimes ſuffered
a <hi>change</hi> to thoſe Formes; and from
thence have arrived (yet not without
deſperate <hi>inteſtine Seditions</hi> and <hi>Vexations)</hi>
to a great <hi>Puiſſance:</hi> The <hi>people growing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97935:60"/>
up</hi> and increaſing with the <hi>widening of the
State,</hi> the Governing by <hi>multitudinous
Councils,</hi> through conſtant habit and
practice, hath not alwaies ill ſucceeded.
But to attempt to introduce ſuch a form
(which is ſo <hi>vitrious</hi> and <hi>brittle,</hi> and ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
carryed into <hi>Diſtemper, Tumult</hi> and
<hi>Multitude,</hi> being ſcarce ſeparable) upon
ſuch a <hi>huge maſs</hi> of <hi>people</hi> as <hi>we</hi> of <hi>this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
are, and altogether <hi>unexpect</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſirous</hi>
of it, the matter it ſelf in reaſon
will be found manifeſtly <hi>repugnant to,</hi> and
not <hi>ſuſceptible</hi> of ſuch forms; nor is there
a <hi>pattern</hi> to be found, to give any light of
<hi>direction</hi> for the managing of ſuch a deſign.
Reaſons may be ſeduced from the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
happening <hi>this Parliament,</hi> which
well weighed and pondered, will afford
matter more than enough to clear this
queſtion. Something like an example
may be produced (though rarely too)
that large <hi>Monarchies</hi> have been <hi>cantoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</hi>
But that (I think) few have any
<hi>jealouſy</hi> that this is intended.</p>
                     <p>The next conſiderable is, That the
<hi>change</hi> from the ancient and long-eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<hi>rule of Governing</hi> will demoliſh all
the received <hi>rules of Property.</hi> And if
that inconvenience be with difficulty
provided for; yet the people will not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97935:60"/>
expect other, but that with <hi>new Lords</hi>
they muſt have <hi>new Laws:</hi> And more than
probable it is that the people will be
ſhaken into ſuch an <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of it, that
they may <hi>fall upon the Heads</hi> of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſers.</hi>
We frequently ſee that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are hardly reclaimed from <hi>cuſtoms
barbarous</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable;</hi> how much
leſs can <hi>our beſt Nation</hi> (the <hi>beſt civilized</hi>
the world hath known) be withdrawn
from the love of <hi>Laws,</hi> ſo <hi>prudently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted,</hi>
and under which they have <hi>ſo
long</hi> continued, that the very <hi>deſires</hi> of
the <hi>People</hi> are <hi>aſſimilated</hi> into the <hi>Nature</hi>
of their <hi>Laws.</hi> The <hi>People</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi>
will always be alike. Are their <hi>Laws
Monarchical,</hi> ſo will be the <hi>Affections</hi> of
the people? <hi>Cuſtom is a ſecond Nature,
and in many things goes beyond it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon what <hi>Principle,</hi> upon what <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
muſt ſuch a proceeding be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
It can be no other, but that the
<hi>people have the right and power to depoſe an
Eſtabliſhed Government, erect a new Form,
arraign the ſupream Magiſtrate, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Him.</hi> Herein is <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſilent: and
it will not only be diſclaimed by all
thoſe you call <hi>Cavaliers</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
but alſo by a conſiderable number of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents:</hi>
The remainder then will
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97935:61"/>
amount to a <hi>ſlender body</hi> of people. So
that whereas the pretence is, that the
<hi>ſenſe of the people</hi> is acted, nothing will
prove to be a groſſer <hi>miſtake.</hi> But this
embroilment in the State, eſpecially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>this principle,</hi> will make all <hi>Kings</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to the quarrel: Yea, all <hi>States</hi> that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
<hi>Ariſtocratically,</hi> will be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engaged to defend their <hi>right</hi> of <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
So that there is little queſtion,
but that the greateſt <hi>calamity</hi> that can
befal a Nation, will inevitably be drawn
upon <hi>us,</hi> that is, a <hi>Forrain Invaſion.</hi> And
<hi>Trade</hi> (which Nature ſeems to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
our Nation moſt properly for)
will be <hi>embarred</hi> by all <hi>Kings</hi> and thoſe
<hi>States.</hi> Nor can it be expected that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
will be given to thoſe of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Trafick,</hi> who derive themſelves
from a <hi>State,</hi> from whence they ſhall
bring the <hi>contagion</hi> of ſo <hi>deſtructive a
maxime</hi> to thoſe <hi>rules of Governing,</hi> where
they expect <hi>Commerce.</hi> Yea, even <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
States</hi> will abhor ſo <hi>prodigious</hi> a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
and <hi>Proceeding:</hi> they having been
urged by neceſſity to uſe a <hi>ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi>
though for <hi>time limited,</hi> yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from <hi>Queſtion</hi> and <hi>Tryal:</hi> whereof
the ancient State of <hi>Rome</hi> gives us fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Examples. No man ſure is ſo mad
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97935:61"/>
as to ſearch <hi>our Chronicles</hi> for a <hi>preſident</hi>
of this Nature.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of <hi>Scotland</hi> will have
a large ſhare in this Affair: for the <hi>Regal
Rule</hi> can receive no <hi>diminution,</hi> much leſs
<hi>alteration here,</hi> but that it muſt make a
notable impreſſion on that <hi>State;</hi> and
can have no other event but a <hi>diſunion</hi>
of the <hi>Nations;</hi> the <hi>union</hi> of which hath
ever been ſo much <hi>conſidered</hi> and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
deſired by all our <hi>prudenteſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and by the moſt <hi>fortunate Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi>
of them, (with ſo much fruitleſs loſs
of blood) often <hi>attempted,</hi> yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by Gods providence ſo <hi>happily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,</hi>
and in a moſt peacable manner,
to the univerſal contentment of all ſorts
in both Nations. 'Tis not poſſible there
can be an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> where there
is a <hi>diſſimilitude</hi> in the Nature and Form
of <hi>Government;</hi> for they will perpetually
<hi>ſtrive one with another.</hi> Nor can a <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
upon the <hi>perſon</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a way to let <hi>Scotland</hi> into a <hi>Quarrel</hi>
undeniably <hi>juſt,</hi> and unavoidably <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi>
for the <hi>loſs</hi> of their <hi>Liege Lord</hi> and
<hi>Lawful Soveraign,</hi> and <hi>unconſulted</hi> with.
To this Conſideration of <hi>Scotland,</hi> i'le
joyn that of <hi>Ireland.</hi> 'Tis apparent that
the Army will have more than their hands
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97935:62"/>
full (if <hi>Scotland)</hi> ſlept with the <hi>vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>difficulties</hi> that will ariſe here at

an <hi>eighth part</hi> remains not, with any

to one ſenſe; Take alſo into the

the Houſe for adhering to the <hi>King</hi>
in this War, which at leaſt will be <hi>four</hi>
or <hi>five parts</hi> more: the remaining part of
the <hi>Lords</hi> have <hi>diſclaimed</hi> to have any
ſhare in ſuch proceeding. So that by
this <hi>Index</hi> of this Nation you may ſee
the Spirit of the <hi>whole body</hi> of it, the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
Gentry,</hi> all perſons of <hi>diſtinction,</hi>
and all of any <hi>competent ſubſiſtence:</hi> and I
am perſwaded, (beſides the unſucceſsful
Tryal that hath been made of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
practiſed and learned in the <hi>Laws,)</hi>
even thoſe of your late ſelected <hi>Jury</hi> or

ſhall caſt your eye upon ſo <hi>horrible</hi> a <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle,</hi>
you cannot let it long reſt there.
We then thus <hi>turmoil'd</hi> and <hi>diſquieted,
Ireland</hi> will be left to <hi>it ſelf;</hi> or rather

                     <p>Very conſiderable alſo is the <hi>faſhion</hi>
and <hi>ſhape</hi> of the proceeding, which (they
ſay) is intended againſt his <hi>Majeſty;</hi> ſo
<hi>ugly, monſtrous,</hi> and <hi>deformed,</hi> that when
it appears upon the <hi>ſtage</hi> to act, the
<hi>horror</hi> of it will <hi>irritate</hi> the whole <hi>Nation</hi>
to <hi>revenge.</hi> What? (for it is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
apprehended) that a <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>War</hi>
of that <hi>Army,</hi> that profeſs to act under,
and by the Authority of the two <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
ſhould impoſe <hi>Rules</hi> to judge by, and
<hi>Judges</hi> for thoſe rules too upon <hi>thoſe</hi>

not more than any other <hi>ſubmittable</hi> to an
<hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and <hi>Extrajudicial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</hi>
Who is it that after this can
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97935:63"/>
expect <hi>ſecurity of Life,</hi> or quiet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſion
of any thing he hath? It is ſaid
(but who almoſt can believe it?) that a
Title is derived from <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration:</hi>
If it were but <hi>talk,</hi> it were
but <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and would be thought ſo
ſimple, that it would not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as guilty of <hi>malice:</hi> but to act under
ſuch a notion, were a plain confeſſion
that all other <hi>Titles</hi> are inſufficient. Nay,
if it be but mingled with any other
<hi>pretenſions, the peſtilent quality</hi> of it would
poyſon all the reſt: and, believe it,
the dropping of ſuch expreſſions, by
the <hi>unſobreſt</hi> of thoſe that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of your Party, hath <hi>incredibly
diſcredited</hi> thoſe who are indeed <hi>well-adviſed.</hi>
Away with it then, as that
which will bring the <hi>certaineſt</hi> and <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneſt
deſtruction;</hi> as that which will <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>
the whole <hi>Nation</hi> to a <hi>furious vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
of <hi>themſelves,</hi> from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as ſuch a <hi>ſilly generation</hi> of <hi>people,</hi>
that ſhould be couſened out of their <hi>good,

The <hi>people</hi> do already take themſelves to
be ſcornfull mocked, that they muſt be
<hi>ſtigmatiz'd</hi> with the <hi>defamation</hi> of ſo <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piom</hi>

Rules,</hi> which would have guided
them, (the <hi>paths</hi> they expected they

<hi>palpably</hi> wander from their <hi>truſt,</hi> and the

                     <p>The laſt conſideration that impedes
the mutation of the <hi>Government</hi> is the

unavoidably mix it ſelf with all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

of the one, will not be without the <hi>aid</hi>
of the other. Yet this following hath
ſomewhat more in it. 'Tis <hi>This King,</hi>

                     <p>Upon the proſpect of theſe foregoing

and laſtly, to deal frankly
with you, (becauſe their temper in your

for <hi>the greater number a vertiginous</hi> and

let the <hi>profit</hi> of it to the Actors

                     <p>I Hope this Paper will find you upon
your <hi>Recovery:</hi> You have my daily
and hearty <hi>Prayers</hi> for it; not ſo much
for your <hi>own ſake,</hi> (for I doubt not, but
it would be much better for you, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of your <hi>ſelf,</hi> to be <hi>diſſolved,</hi> and <hi>be
with Chriſt)</hi> but in the behalf of the
<hi>Church,</hi> your <hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>poor Family;</hi>

will be merciful, howſoever he diſpoſeth
of <hi>you,</hi> either for this <hi>Life,</hi> or for a <hi>better.</hi>
But if you live, (as I pray, and hope you
will) you ſhall do very well to write
the Life and Death of that Noble <hi>Lord,</hi>
and Bleſſed <hi>Martyr,</hi> who profeſſed at his
Death, <hi>That he died for the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment:</hi>
And to die in the Defence,
and for the Teſtimony of any <hi>Divine
Truth,</hi> is truly and properly to be a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</hi>

That which I can contribute towards
this Work is, to communicate ſome few
Obſervations I made of him, and from
him, before and after his <hi>Condemnation.</hi>
I was ſeveral times with him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found him in a very <hi>chearful</hi> and
<hi>well-compoſed</hi> Temper of Mind; proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from true <hi>Chriſtian Grounds,</hi> and not
from a <hi>Roman Reſolution only</hi> (as his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
are pleaſed to ſpeak of him.) He
told me often, It was the <hi>Good God</hi> he
ſerved, and the <hi>Good Cauſe</hi> he had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for, that made him not to <hi>fear Death:</hi>
Adding, He had never had the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſo much as a <hi>thought,</hi> to <hi>check</hi>
him for his Engagement in <hi>this Quarrel;</hi>
for he took it for his <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Glory;</hi>
and wiſhed he had a greater <hi>Ability,</hi> and
better <hi>Fortune</hi> to engage in it.</p>
                     <p>After his <hi>Condemnation,</hi> and the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
before his <hi>ſuffering,</hi> we were a great
while in private together; when, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing</hi>
with that Senſe which became a
<hi>true</hi> (and not <hi>deſpairing) Penitent,</hi> the
<hi>ſins</hi> of his <hi>Life</hi> paſt, the <hi>greateſt</hi> he could
remember was his <hi>Voting my Lord of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s
<hi>Death:</hi> which though (as he ſaid)
he did without any <hi>Malice</hi> at all, yet
he confeſſed it to be a very <hi>great ſin;</hi>
and that he had done it out of a <hi>baſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97935:72"/>
Fear</hi> (they were his own words) of a
<hi>prevailing party:</hi> Adding, That he had
very often, and very heartily <hi>repented</hi> of
it; and was confident of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Pardon</hi>
for it.</p>
                     <p>Then he told me, He had a great
deſire to receive the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament</hi>
(ſo he called it) before he died the next
Morning; asking, What <hi>Divine</hi> of the
<hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Party</hi> I would recommend to him?
I replied, That (though many were
more <hi>worthy,</hi> yet) none would be more
<hi>willing</hi> to do him that Service than <hi>my
ſelf.</hi> Which he accepting very kindly,
told me, He durſt not <hi>deſire</hi> it; for fear
it might be ſome <hi>danger</hi> to <hi>me.</hi> After
this, and ſome Conference in order to
his <hi>preparation,</hi> both for his <hi>Viaticum,</hi>
and his <hi>Voyage,</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> and his
<hi>Death;</hi> he deſired me to <hi>pray</hi> with him.
Which after I had performed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to be with him by ſeven the next
Morning, I left him for that time to his
<hi>own Devotions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next Day I was there at the time
aſſigned; and after ſome ſhort Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in order to the preſent Occaſion)
he deſired me to hear <hi>him pray:</hi> which
he did for half an hour in an <hi>excellent
Method,</hi> very <hi>apt Expreſſions,</hi> and moſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97935:73"/>
                        <hi>ſtrong, hearty,</hi> and <hi>paſſionate Affections:</hi>
Firſt, <hi>Confeſſing</hi> and <hi>bewailing</hi> his <hi>ſins</hi> with
ſtrong Cries and Tears: Then hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and moſt earneſtly <hi>deſiring God</hi>'s <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
through the <hi>Merits</hi> of <hi>Christ only.
Secondly,</hi> For his dear <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi>
with ſome <hi>paſſion;</hi> but for her <hi>eſpecially,</hi>
with moſt <hi>ardent</hi> Affections: recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
them to the <hi>Divine Providence</hi>
with great Confidence and Aſſurance;
and deſiring for them rather the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of a <hi>Better Life,</hi> than of <hi>This.
Thirdly,</hi> For the <hi>King, Church,</hi> and
<hi>State.</hi> And laſtly, For his <hi>Enemies,</hi> with
almoſt the ſame Ardour and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>After this ſending for my <hi>Lord</hi> of
<hi>Norwich,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> I read the
whole <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>Good Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:</hi>
and then, after a ſhort <hi>Homily</hi> I
uſed for the preſent Occaſion, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> In which Action
he behaved himſelf with great <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi> And being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
after we had done, how he found
himſelf; he replied, Very much <hi>better,
ſtronger,</hi> and <hi>cheerfuller</hi> for that <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Repaſt;</hi> and that he doubted not to
walk like a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> through the <hi>Vale</hi>
of <hi>Death,</hi> in the Strength of it. But
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97935:73"/>
he was to have an <hi>Agony</hi> before his <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi>
and that was the parting with his
<hi>Wife, Eldeſt Son, Son-in-Law,</hi> two of his
<hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles,</hi> and Sir <hi>T. C.</hi> eſpecially the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with his moſt <hi>dear Lady;</hi> which
indeed was the <hi>ſaddeſt ſpectacle</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I beheld. In which Occaſion he
could not chuſe but confeſs a little of
<hi>Humane Frailty;</hi> yet even then he did
not forget both to <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>counſel</hi>
her, and the reſt of his Friends; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
in bleſſing the <hi>young Lord,</hi> he
commanded him never to <hi>revenge</hi> his
Death, though it ſhould be in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
The like he ſaid unto his <hi>Lady.</hi>
He told his <hi>Son,</hi> He would leave him a
<hi>Legacy</hi> out of <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and that
was this; <hi>Lord, lead me in a plain Path.</hi>
For, Boy, (ſaid he) I would have you
a <hi>plain honeſt</hi> Man, and hate <hi>Diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, with much adoe I perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his <hi>Wife,</hi> and the reſt to be gone:
and then being all alone with me, he
ſaid, <hi>Doctor, the hardeſt part of my Work
in this World, is now past;</hi> meaning the
<hi>parting</hi> with his <hi>Wife.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then he deſired me to pray <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi>
to his <hi>Death,</hi> that in the laſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97935:74"/>
he might ſo behave himſelf, as might
be moſt for <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Glory,</hi> for the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his <hi>Dead Maſter</hi>'s <hi>Memory,</hi> his
<hi>Preſent Maſter</hi>'s <hi>Service;</hi> and that he
might avoid the <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>ſaying</hi> of any
thing, which might favour either of <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
or <hi>ſullenneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This being done, they were all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Houſe; where
I was with him, till he was called unto

                        <p>It will not lengthen the time
much if you ſtay while you have a return
from him. My Lord, you ſhould do
well to beſtow your time now in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon, and imploring of the free
mercy of God in Chriſt for your Eternal
Salvation, and look upon that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreaming
Fountain of his precious Blood,
that purgeth us from all our ſins, even
the ſins of the deepeſt die: the Blood of
Jeſus Chriſt waſhes away all our ſins, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97935:78"/>
that Blood of Chriſt is poured forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all ſuch as by a lively faith lay hold
upon him: God ſo loved the World,
that he gave his only begotten Son, to
the end, that whoſoever believed in him
ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting
Life; that is now, my Lord, the Rock
upon which you muſt chiefly reſt, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to fix your ſelf in the free mercy of
God through Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are from Everlaſting to Everlaſting,
unto all ſuch, as with the eye of Faith
behold him; behold Jeſus the Author and
Finiſher of your Salvation, who hath
ſatisfied the Juſtice of God by that all-ſufficiency
of his Sacrifice, which once
for all he offered upon the Croſs for the
ſins of the whole world, ſo that the ſting
of Death is taken away from all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and he hath ſanctified it as a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to Everlaſting Bleſſedneſs: It is true,
the Waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> run ſomewhat
rough and ſurly betwixt the Wilderneſs
and our paſſage into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but let us
reſt upon the Ark (my Lord) the Ark
Chriſt Jeſus, that will carry us through,
and above all thoſe Waves to that Rock
of Ages, which no Floud nor Waves can
reach unto; and to him who is yeſterday,
to day, and the ſame for ever, againſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97935:78"/>
whom the Powers and Principalities,
the Gates of Hell ſhall never be able to
prevail; lift up and faſten your eyes now
upon Chriſt crucified, and labour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Jeſus ſtand at the right hand of his
Father, (as the Protomartyr <hi>Stephen)</hi>
ready to receive your Soul, when it ſhall
be ſeparated from this frail and mortal
Body: Alas, no man would deſire Life,
if he knew beforehand what it were to
live, it is nothing but ſorrow, vexation
and trouble, grief and diſcontent that
waits upon every condition, whether
publick or private; in every ſtation and
calling there are ſeveral miſeries and
troubles that are inſeparable from them;
therefore what a bleſſed thing it is to
have a ſpeedy and comfortable paſſage
out of this raging Sea, into the Port of
Everlaſting Happineſs. We muſt paſs
through a Sea, but it is the Sea of Chriſt's
Blood, in which never Soul ſuffered Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck,
in which we muſt be blown with
Winds and Tempeſts, but they are the
gales of Gods Spirit upon us, which
blow away all contrary Winds of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his mercy.</p>

                        <p>I think it is truly not very
neceſſary for me to ſpeak much, there are
many Gentlemen and Souldiers there
that ſee me, but my voice truly is ſo weak,
ſo low that they cannot hear me, neither
truly was I ever at any time ſo much in
love with ſpeaking, or with any thing I
had to expreſs, that I took delight in it;
yet this being the laſt time that I am to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97935:79"/>
do ſo, by a divine Providence of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, who hath brought me to this
end juſtly for my ſins; I ſhall to you Sir,
Mr. Sheriff, declare thus much, as to the
matter that I am now to ſuffer for, which
is as being a Traytor to the Kingdom of
<hi>England:</hi> Truly, Sir, it was a Country
that I equally loved with my own, I
made no difference; I never intended ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the generality of its prejudice, or
any particular mans in it: what I did
was by the Comand of the Parliament
of the Country where I was born, whoſe
Commands I could not diſobey, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
running into the ſame hazard there
of that condition that I am now in:
The ends, Sir, of that Engagement is
publick, they are in Print, and ſo I ſhall
not need to ſpecifie them.</p>

my ſelf being ſatisfied with
the Commands that is laid upon me, and
they ſatisfied with the Juſtneſs of their
procedure; according to the Laws of this
Land. God is juſt, and howſoever I ſhall
not ſay any thing as to the mater of the
ſentence, but that I do willingly ſubmit
to his Divine Providence, and I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that very many ways I deſerve even
a worldly puniſhment, as well as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for we are all ſinful, Sir, and I a
great one: yet for my comfort, I know
there is a God in Heaven that is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
merciful; I know my Redeemer
ſits at his Right Hand, and am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
(clapping his hand to his Breaſt)
is Mediating for me at this inſtant; I am
hopeful through his Free-Grace, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
merits, to be pardoned of my
ſins, and to be received into his mercy;
upon that I rely, truſting to nothing but
the Free Grace of God through Jeſus
Chriſt: I have not been tainted with my
Religion, I thank God for it, ſince my
infancy, it hath been ſuch as hath been
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97935:80"/>
profeſt in the Land, and eſtabliſhed;
and now 'tis not this Religion, or that
Religion, or this or that Fancy of men
that is to be built upon; 'tis but one
that's right, one that's ſure, and that
comes from God. Sir, and in the Free
Grace of our Saviour. Sir, there is truly
ſomething that (<note n="*" place="margin">Obſerving the Writers.</note> had I
thought my Speech would
have been thus taken) I
would have digeſted it into
ſome better method than now I can, and
ſhall deſire theſe Gentlemen that do write
it, that they will not wrong me in it,
and that it may not in this manner be
publiſhed to my diſadvantage, for truly
I did not intend to have ſpoken thus
when I came here.</p>
                        <p>There is, ſirs, terrible aſperſions has
been laid upon my ſelf, truly ſuch as I
thank God, I am very free from; as if
my actions and intentions had not been
ſuch as they were pretended for; but
that notwithſtanding what I pretended
it was for the King, there was nothing
leſs intended than to ſerve him in it. I
was bred with him for many years, I was
his Domeſtick Servant, and there was
nothing declar'd by the Parliament, that
was not really intended by me; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97935:81"/>
in it I ventured my Life one way, and
now I loſe it another way; and that was
one of the ends, as to the King; I ſpeak
only of that; becauſe the reſt has many
particulars, and to clear my ſelf from
ſo horrid an aſperſion as is laid upon me:
neither was there any other deſign known
to me by the incoming of the Army, then
what is really in the Declaration publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
His perſon, I do profeſs, I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to love, as he was my King, and as
he had been my Maſter, it has pleaſed
God now to diſpoſe of him, ſo as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be thought flattery to have ſaid this;
or any end in me for the ſaying of it, but
to free my ſelf from that calumny which
lay upon me: I cannot gain by it; yet
Truth is that which we ſhall gain by for
ever.</p>
                        <p>There hath been much ſpoken Sir, of
an invitation into this Kingdom: it's
mentioned in that <hi>Declaration;</hi> and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to that I did and do remit my ſelf:
and I have been very much laboured for
diſcoveries of theſe Inviters, 'Tis no
time to diſſemble. How willingly I was
to have ſerved this Nation in any thing
that was in my power, is known to
very many honeſt, pious, and religious
men; and how ready I would have been
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97935:81"/>
to have done what I could to have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them, if it had pleaſed them to have
preſerved my Life, in whoſe hands there
was a power: They have not thought it
fit, and ſo I am become unuſeful in that
which willingly I would have done. As I
ſaid at firſt, (Sir) ſo I ſay now concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that point; I wiſh the Kingdoms
happineſs, I wiſh it peace; and truly
Sir, I wiſh that this blood of mine may
be the laſt that is drawn; and howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I may perhaps have ſome reluctancy
with my ſelf, as to the matter of my
Fact, for my ſuffering for my Fact, yet
I freely forgive all; Sir, I earry no ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
along with me to my Grave; His
Will be done that has created both Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, and me a poor miſerable
ſinful Creature now ſpeaking before him.
For me to ſpeak (Sir) to you of State-bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
and the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or my opinion in that, or for any
thing in that nature, truly it is to no
end, it contributes nothing; My own
inclination hath been to peace, from the
beginning; and it is known to many that
I never was an ill inſtrument betwixt the
King and his people: I never acted to
the prejudice of the Parliament; I bore
no Arms, I medled not with it: I was
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97935:82"/>
not wanting by my Prayers to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
for the Happineſs of the King;
and truly I ſhall pray ſtill that God may
ſo direct him, as that may be done which
ſhall tend to his Glory, and the Peace and
Happineſs of the Kingdom.</p>

And ſo having lain a ſhort ſpace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly

at one Blow ſevered his Head

                        <p>IT is to no purpoſe (I think) to ſpeak
any thing here. Which way muſt I
ſpeak? And then being directed to the
front of the Scaffold, he (leaning over
the Rayls) ſaid; I think it is fit to ſay
ſomething, ſince God hath called me to
this place. The firſt thing which I muſt
profeſs, is, what concerns my Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and my Breeding, which hath been
in a good Family, that hath ever been
faithful to the true Proteſtant Religion,
in the which I have been bred, in the
which I have lived, and in the which by
Gods Grace and Mercy I ſhall dye. I have
not lived according to that Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I had in that Family where I was born
and bred. I hope God will forgive me
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:97935:87"/>
my ſins, ſince I conceive it is very much
his pleaſure to bring me to this place,
for the ſins that I have committed. The
cauſe that hath brought me hither, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
by many hath been much miſtaken.
They have conceived that I have had ill
Deſigns to the State, and to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
Truly I look upon it as a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a juſt Judgment of God, not
but I have offended ſo much the State,
and the Kingdom, and the Parliament,
as that I have had no extream vanity in
ſerving them very extraordinarily. For
thoſe Actions that I have done, I think
it is known they have been ever very
faithful to the Publick, and very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to Parliaments. My Affections
have been ever expreſt truly and clearly
to them. The diſpoſitions of Affairs
now have put things in another poſture
than they were when I was engaged with
the Parliament. I have never gone off
from thoſe Principles that ever I have
profeſſed; I have lived in them, and by
God's Grace will die in them.</p>
                        <p>There may be Alterations and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that may carry them further than I
thought reaſonable, and truly there I
left them: But there hath been nothing
that I have ſaid; or done, or profeſſed,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97935:87"/>
either by Covenant or Declaration,
which hath not been very conſtant, and
very clear, upon the principles that I
ever have gone upon; which was, to
ſerve the King, the Parliament, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(I ſhould have ſaid in the firſt place)
the Commonwealth, and to ſeek the
Peace of the Kingdom; That made me
think it no improper time, being preſt
out by Accidents and Circumſtances, to
ſeek the Peace of the Kingdom, which I
thought was proper, ſince there was
ſomething then in Agitation, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
agreed on for ſending Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the King; that was the furtheſt
aim that I had, and truly beyond that I
had no intention, none at all.</p>
                        <p>And God be praiſed, although my
blood comes to be ſhed here, there was
I think ſcarce a drop of blood ſhed in
that Action that I was ingaged in. For
the preſent Affairs as they are, I cannot
tell how to judge of them; and truly
they are in ſuch a condition, as (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
no body can make a judgment of
them; and therefore I muſt make uſe of
Prayers, rather than of my Opinion;
which are, That God would bleſs this
Kingdom, this Nation, this State; that
he would ſettle it in a way agreeable to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97935:88"/>
what this Kingdom hath been happily
governed under; by a King, by the
Lords, by the Commons; a Government
that I conceive it hath flouriſhed much
under, and I pray God the change of it
bring not rather a prejudice, a diſorder,
and a confuſion, than the contrary. I
look upon the Poſterity of the King, and
truly my Conſcience directs me to it, to
deſire, that if God, be pleaſed, that theſe
people may look upon them with that
affection that they owe, that they may
be called in again, and they may be, not
through blood, nor through diſorder
admitted again into that Power, and to
that Glory, that God in their birth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to them. I ſhall pray with all
my Soul for the Happineſs of this State,
of this Nation, that the blood which is
here ſpilt, may even be the laſt that may
fall among us; and truly I ſhould lay
down my life with as much chearfulneſs
as ever Perſon did, if I conceived that
there would be no more blood follow us;
for a State, or Affairs that are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
blood, is a Foundation for the moſt
part that doth not proſper.</p>
                        <p>After the Bleſſing that I give to the
Nation, to the Kingdom, and truly to
the Parliament, I do wiſh with all my
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97935:88"/>
Heart, Happineſs, and a Bleſſing to all
thoſe that have been Authors in this
buſineſs; and truly, that have been Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
in this very work that bringeth
us hither: I do not only forgive them,
but I pray heartily and really for them,
as God will forgive my ſins, ſo I deſire
God may forgive them.</p>
                        <p>I have a particular relation, as I am
Chancellor of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and truly I
muſt here, ſince it is the laſt of my prayers,
pray to God that that Univerſity may
go on in that happy way which it is in,
that God may make it a Nurſery to plant
thoſe perſons that may be diſtributed
to the Kingdom, that the ſouls of the
people may receive a great benefit, and
a great advantage by them, and (I hope)
God will reward them for their kindneſs,
and their affections that I have found
from them.<note n="*" place="margin">Looking towards M. <hi>Bolton.</hi>
                           </note> I have ſaid what

(I may ſay ſo, I hope, without vanity)
of much Affection to Religion, and of
much faithfulneſs to this Kingdom, and
to this State, I have endeavoured to do
thoſe Actions that became an honeſt

became a good Chriſtian. I have been
willing to oblige thoſe that have been in

and truly, I find a great reward of
it; for I have found their Prayers, and
their Kindneſs now in this diſtreſs, and
in this condition, and I think it a great
reward, I pray God reward them for it.</p>
                        <p>I am a great ſinner, and I hope God
will be pleaſed to hear my Prayers, to
give me faith to truſt in him, that as
he hath called me to death at this place,
he will make it but a paſſage to an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life through Jeſus Chriſt, which I
truſt to, which I rely upon, and which
I expect by the mercy of God. And ſo
I pray God bleſs you all, and ſend that
you may ſee this to be the laſt Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the laſt Blood that is likely to
be ſpilt among you. And then turning
to the ſide-rayl, he prayed for a good
ſpace of time; after which Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi>
ſaid:</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="173" facs="tcp:97935:89"/>
My Lord, Now look upon him whom
you have truſted. My Lord, I hope that
here is your laſt prayer, there will no
more prayers remain, but praiſes; and
I hope that after this day is over, there
will a day begin that ſhall never have
end; and I look upon this (my Lord)
the morning of it, the morning of that
day. My Lord, You know where your
fulneſs lies, where your riches lie, where
is your only rock to anchor on; you
know there is fulneſs in Chriſt: If the
Lord comes not in with fulneſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to you, yet reſolve to wait upon
him while you live, and to truſt in him
when you die; and then ſay, I will dye
here, <hi>I</hi> will periſh at thy feet, <hi>I</hi> will be
found dead at the feet of Jeſus Chriſt.
Certainly, he that came to ſeek and ſave
loſt ſinners, will not reject loſt ſinners
when they come to ſeek him; He that
intreateth us to come, will not ſlight us
when we come to intreat him. My Lord,
there is enough there, and fix your heart
there, and fix your eyes there, that eye
of Faith, and that eye of Hope; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
theſe Graces now, there will be no
exerciſe hereafter.</p>
                        <p>As your Lordſhip ſaid here take an end
of Faith, and take an end of Hope, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:97935:90"/>
take a farewel of Repentance, and all
theſe; and welcome God, and welcome
Chriſt, and welcome Glory, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Happineſs to all Eternity; and ſo
it will be an happy paſſage then, if it be
a paſſage here from Miſery to Happineſs.
And though it be but a ſad way, yet if
it will bring you into the preſence of joy,
although it be a Valley of Tears, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be a Shadow of Death, yet if
God will pleaſe to bring you, and make
it a paſſage to that Happineſs, welcome
Lord. And <hi>I</hi> doubt not but God will
give you an heart to taſte ſome ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and love in this bitter Potion, and
to ſee ſomething of mercy and goodneſs
to you, and ſhew you ſome ſign and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of good, ſo that your ſoul may ſee
that which we have had already of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of (bleſſed be God for it) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
experiences, many expreſſions, not
only in words, nor tears; God hath not
left us without much comfort and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and I hope (my Lord) You that
have given ſo many Evidences to us, I
hope you want none Your ſelf, but that
the Lord will be pleaſed to ſupport You,
and bear up your Spirit, and if there
want Evidence, there is reliance, my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
lies not in my knowing that I ſhall
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97935:90"/>
come to Heaven, and come to Glory but
in my reſting and relying upon him,
when the Anchor of Faith is thrown
out, there may be ſhakings and toſſings,
but there is ſafety; nothing ſhall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
ſafety, although ſomething may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
ſecurity: my ſafety is ſure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I apprehend it not: and what if
I go to God in the dark? What if I come
to him, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did, ſtaggering in
the night? It is a night of trouble, a
night of darkneſs, though I come trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and ſtaggering in this night, yet I
ſhall be ſure to find comfort and fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in him. And the Lord of Heaven
be the ſtrength, ſtay, and ſupport of
Your ſoul, and the Lord furniſh you
with all thoſe Graces which may carry
You into the boſom of the Lord Jeſus,
that when You expire this Life, You may
be able to expire it into him, in whom
You may begin to live to all Eternity,

that (as I ſaid before) I did believe

                        <p>And truly, Sir, ſince that the Death
is violent, I am the leſs troubled with it,

that hath ſhewed us the way, how
and in what manner he hath done it, and
for what cauſe, I am the more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I am the more rejoyced. It is not

his purpoſes and intentions were ſuch, as
a man may not be aſhamed not only to
follow him in the way that was taken
with him, but likewiſe not aſhamed of
his purpoſes, if God had given him
Life.</p>
                        <p>I have often diſputed with him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
many things of this kind, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

and better underſtanding (if God

pleaſure to diſpoſe me this way, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
my Soul to him, with all comfort,
and with all hope, that he hath made
this my end, and this my concluſion, that
though I be low in death, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
this lowneſs ſhall raiſe me to the
higheſt glory for ever.</p>
                        <p>Truly, <hi>I</hi> have not ſaid much in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
to the people, concerning the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Actions that <hi>I</hi> conceive <hi>I</hi> have
done by my Counſels in this Kingdom,
<hi>I</hi> conceive they are well known, it were
ſomething of vanity (methinks,) to take
notice of them here: <hi>I</hi>'le rather die with
them, with the comfort of them in my
own boſom, and that <hi>I</hi> never intended
in this action, or any action that ever <hi>I</hi>
did in my Life, either Malice or Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
or prejudice to any Creature that
lives. For that which concerns my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<hi>I</hi> made my profeſſion before of it,
how <hi>I</hi> was bred, and in what manner <hi>I</hi>
was bred, in a Family that was looked
upon to be no little notorious in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſome Liberties they have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
then to be taken; and truly, there
was ſome mark upon me, as if <hi>I</hi> had ſome
taint of it, even throughout my whole
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97935:92"/>
way that <hi>I</hi> have taken: every body knows
what my Affections have been to many
that have ſuffered, to many that have
been in troubles in this Kingdom, <hi>I</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to relieve them, <hi>I</hi> endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to oblige them, <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo by my Conſcience, <hi>I</hi> thought it by
my Charity, and truly, very much by my
Breeding; God hath now brought me to
the laſt inſtant of my time, all that <hi>I</hi> can
ſay, and all that <hi>I</hi> can adhere unto, is
this; That as <hi>I</hi> am a great ſinner, ſo <hi>I</hi>
have a great Saviour; that as he hath
given me here a Fortune to come publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a ſhew of ſhame in the way of this
Suffering (truly <hi>I</hi> underſtand it not to
be ſo) <hi>I</hi> underſtand it to be a Glory; a
Glory, when <hi>I</hi> conſider who hath gone
before me, and a Glory, when <hi>I</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>I</hi> had no end in it; but what <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be the ſervice of God, the King
and the Kingdom, and therefore my
Heart is not charged much with any
thing in that particular, ſince <hi>I</hi> conceive
God will accept of the intention, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the action ſeems to be. <hi>I</hi> am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to dye, and the Lord receive my Soul;
<hi>I</hi> have no relyance but upon Chriſt: for
my ſelf, I do acknowledge that <hi>I</hi> am the
unworthieſt of ſinners; my Life hath
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97935:92"/>
been a vanity, and a continued ſin, and
God may juſtly bring me to this end, for
the ſins <hi>I</hi> have committed againſt him,
and were there nothing elſe but the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
that <hi>I</hi> have committed in the way
of my Life, <hi>I</hi> look upon this as a great Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of God, to bring me to this Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to bring me to this Puniſhment;
And thoſe Hands that have been moſt
active in it, if any ſuch there hath been, <hi>I</hi>
pray God forgive them; <hi>I</hi> pray God that
there may not be many ſuch Trophies of
their Victories, but that this may be (as <hi>I</hi>
ſaid before) the laſt Shew, that this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhall ſee, of the Blood of Perſons of
Condition, of Perſons of Honour: I might
ſay ſomething of the Way of our Tryal,

you will appear glorious, though

<hi>I deſire not to be found in my own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and when you are cloathed with
another, the Lord will own you, and I
ſhall ſay but thus much: Doubt not that
ever God will deny ſalvation to ſinners,
that come to him, when the end of all
his Death and Sufferings was the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sinners, when as I ſay, the whole
end, and the whole deſign, and the great
work, that God had to do in the world,
by the death of Chriſt, wherein he laid
out all his counſels, and infinite wiſdom,
and mercy, and goodneſs, beyond which
there was a <hi>Non ultra</hi> in Gods thoughts,
when this was the great deſign, and great
end, the ſalvation of ſinners, that poor
Souls ſhould come over to him and live:
certainly when ſinners come he will not
reject, he will not refuſe.</p>
                        <p>And my Lord, do but think of this,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97935:94"/>
the greateſt work that ever was done
in the World, was the Blood of Chriſt
that was ſhed, never any thing like it.
And this blood of Chriſt that was ſhed,
never any thing like it: And this Blood
of Chriſt that was ſhed, was ſhed for
them that come, if not for them, for
none, it was in vain elſe: you ſee the
Devils they are out of capacity of good
by it, the Angels they have no need of
it, wicked men will not come, and there
are but a few that come over, but a few
that come over and ſhould be deny them,
there were no end nor fruit of the Blood
and Sufferings of the Lord Jeſus: and
had your Lordſhip been with Chriſt in
that bloody agony, when he was in that
bloody ſweat, ſweating drops of blood,
if you had asked him, Lord, what art
thou now a doing, art thou not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
an angry God and me together,
art thou not pacifying the Wrath of
God? Art not thou interpoſing thy ſelf
between the Juſtice of God, and my Soul?
Would he not have ſaid, yea? And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then he will not deny it now.</p>
                        <p>My Lord, His paſſions are over, his
compaſſions ſtill remain, and the larger
and greater, becauſe he is gone up into a
higher place, that he may throw down
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97935:94"/>
more abundance of his mercy and grace
upon you, and my Lord, think of that
infinite Love, that abundance of riches
in Chriſt: I am loſt, I am empty, I have
nothing, I am poor, I am ſinful: be it
ſo, as bad as God will make me, and as
vile as I poſſibly can conceive my ſelf, I
am willing to be: but when <hi>I</hi> have ſaid
all, the more <hi>I</hi> advance that Riches,
and Honour that Grace of God. And
why ſhould <hi>I</hi> doubt, when by this he
puts me into a capacity, into a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for him to ſhew me mercy, that by
this <hi>I</hi> may the better advance the Riches
of his Grace, and ſay, Grace, Grace, to
the Lord, to all Eternity, that God
ſhould own ſuch a Creature, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
nothing; and the leſs <hi>I</hi> deſerve,
the more conſpicuous is his Grace: and
this is certain, the Riches of his Grace
he throweth amongſt men, that the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Grace might be given to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
if we can give him but the Glory of
his Grace, we ſhall never doubt to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the Riches of it, and that Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
My Lord, that Fulneſs be your
Comfort, that Fulneſs of Mercy, that
Fulneſs of Love, that Fulneſs of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and Power be now your Riches,
and your only Stay, and the Lord inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

himſelf between God and you, as
your Faith hath indeavoured to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him between God and your ſoul; ſo
<hi>I</hi> doubt not there he ſtands (my Lord)

Happineſs to this Kingdom, to this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

                        <p>The Concluſion that I made
with thoſe that ſent me hither, and are
the Cauſe of this violent Death of mine,
ſhall be the Beginning of what I ſhall
ſay to you: When I made an Addreſs
to them, (which was the laſt) I told
them with much Sincerity, That I would
pray to the <hi>God</hi> of all Mercies, that they
might be Partakers of his ineſtimable
and boundleſs Mercies in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and
truly, I ſtill pray that Prayer: And I
beſeech the <hi>God</hi> of Heaven, forgive any
Injury they have done to me, from my
Soul I wiſh it. And truly, this I tell
you as a Chriſtian, to let you ſee I am
a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But it is neceſſary I ſhould tell you
ſomewhat more, That I am a <hi>Proteſtant:</hi>
And truly, I am a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and very
much in love with the Profeſſion of it,
after the manner as it was eſtabliſhed
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97935:100"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> by the thirty nine Articles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
A bleſſed way of Profeſſion; and ſuch
an one as truly, I never knew none ſo
good.</p>
                        <p>I am ſo far from being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> which
ſome Body have (truly) very unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at ſome time charged me withal, that
truly, I profeſs to you, that though I
love Good Works, and commend Good
Works; yet I hold they have nothing
at all to do in the matter of Salvation.
My Anchor-hold is this; <hi>That Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me, and gave Himſelf for me:</hi> That
is that that I reſt upon.</p>
                        <p>And truly, ſomething I ſhall ſay to
you as a Citizen of the whole World;
and in that Conſideration I am here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to die, truly contrary to the
Law that governs all the World; that
is, the Law of the Sword: I had the
Protection of that for my Life, and the
Honour of it: But truly, I will not
trouble you much with that, becauſe in
another Place I have ſpoken very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and liberally about it. I believe you
will hear by other means, what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I uſed in that Caſe. But truly,
that that is ſtranger, you that are <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-men</hi>
behold here an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> here
before you, and acknowledged a Peer,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97935:101"/>
not condemned to die by any Law of
<hi>England,</hi> not by any Law of <hi>England:</hi>
nay, ſhall I tell you more? (which is
ſtrangeſt of all) contrary to all the Laws
of <hi>England,</hi> that I know of. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I will tell you, in the matter of the
Civil Part of my Death, and the Cauſe
that I have maintained, I die (I take it)
for maintaining the <hi>Fifth Commandment,</hi>
enjoyned by <hi>God</hi> himſelf, which enjoyns
Reverence and Obedience to Parents:
All Divines on all Hands, though they
contradict one another in many ſeveral
Opinions; yet all Divines, on all Hands,
do acknowledge, that here is intended
Magiſtracy and Order: And certainly, I
have obeyed that Magiſtracy, and that
Order, under which I have lived, which
I was bound to obey. And truly, I do
ſay very confidently, That I do die here
for keeping, for obeying that <hi>Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi>
given by <hi>God</hi> himſelf, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with his own Finger.</p>
                        <p>And now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I will take this
Opportunity to tell you, That I cannot
imitate a better, nor a greater Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than his, that ſaid of himſelf, <hi>For ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
an unjuſt Judgment upon another, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was brought to ſuffer by an unjust Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Truly, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> may
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97935:101"/>
may be glorified, that all Men that are
concerned in it, may take the Occaſion
of it, of humble Repentance to <hi>God</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
for it, I do here profeſs to you,
That <hi>I</hi> did give my Vote to that Bill
againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford: I</hi> doubt
not, but <hi>God</hi> Almighty hath waſhed that
away with a more precious Blood, the
Blood of his own Son, and my dear Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And <hi>I</hi> hope he will
waſh it away from all thoſe that are
guilty of it. Truly, this <hi>I</hi> may ſay, <hi>I</hi>
had not the leaſt part nor degree of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
in doing of it. But <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs
again to <hi>God</hi>'s Glory, and the Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mine own Frailty, and the Frailty
of my Nature, that truly it was unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Cowardize, not to reſiſt ſo great
a Torrent, as carried that Buſineſs at
that time. And truly, this <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi>
am moſt guilty of, of not Courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in it; but Malice <hi>I</hi> had none.
But whatſoever it was, <hi>God I</hi> am ſure
hath pardoned it, hath given me the
Aſſurance of it, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> his Blood
hath waſhed it away. And truly, <hi>I</hi> do
from my Soul wiſh, That all Men that
have any Stain by it, may ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and receive a Remiſſion and Pardon
from <hi>God</hi> for it.</p>

                           <pb n="198" facs="tcp:97935:102"/>
And now, Gentlemen, we have had an
Occaſion by this Intimation, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
His Majeſty, our King that laſt was;
and <hi>I</hi> cannot ſpeak of Him, nor think
of it, but truly <hi>I</hi> muſt needs ſay, That
in my Opinion, that have had time
to conſider all the Images of all the
greateſt and vertuouſeſt Princes in the
World; and truly, in my Opinion, there
was not a more vertuous, and more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Prince known in the World, than
our gracious King <hi>Charles</hi> that died laſt.
<hi>God</hi> Almighty preſerve our <hi>King,</hi> that
now is, his Son; <hi>God</hi> ſend him more
Fortunate, and longer days: <hi>God</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
ſo aſſiſt him, that he may exceed
both the Vertues and Sufficiences of his
Father. For certainly, <hi>I</hi> that have been
a Councellor to him; and have lived
long with him, and in a time when Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
is eaſily enough made; for he
was young, (he was about thirteen, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
fifteen, or ſixteen Years of Age)
thoſe Years <hi>I</hi> was with him: Truly, <hi>I</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaw greater Hopes of Vertue in any
young Perſon, than in him; great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
great Underſtanding, great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
much Honour in his Nature;
and truly, a very perfect <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Man
in his Inclination: And <hi>I</hi> pray <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97935:102"/>
him to this Kingdom, and unite
the Kingdoms one unto another, and
ſend a great Happineſs both to You, and
to Him; that he may long live and
reign among you, and that that Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may reign till thy Kingdom come;
that is, while all Temporal Power is
conſummated. I beſeech <hi>God</hi> of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
give much Happineſs to this your
King, and to You that in it ſhall be his
Subjects by the Grace of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Truly, <hi>I</hi> like my <hi>Beginning</hi> ſo well, that
<hi>I</hi> will make my <hi>Concluſion</hi> with it; that is,
That <hi>God</hi> Almighty would confer, of his
infinite and ineſtimable Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to thoſe that are the Cauſers of my
coming hither; <hi>I</hi> pray <hi>God</hi> give them
as much Mercy as their Hearts can
wiſh: And truly, for my part, <hi>I</hi> will
not accuſe any one of them of Malice;
truly, <hi>I</hi> will not: Nay, <hi>I</hi> will not think
there was any Malice in them; what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ends there is, I know not, nor will
<hi>I</hi> examine: But let it be what it will,
from my very Soul <hi>I</hi> forgive them every
one.</p>
                        <p>And ſo the <hi>Lord</hi> of Heaven bleſs you
all; <hi>God</hi> Almighty be infinite in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Mercy to you, and direct you
in thoſe ways of Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
