            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Be not so loath, some good thing I must doe,</l>
               <l>But lay your Torches by, I like not them,</l>
               <l>Come, come, deliuer them vnto your men,</l>
               <l>Giue me your hands, so now sir heere I stand,</l>
               <l>Holding two angrie women in my hand,</l>
               <l>And I must please them both, I could please tone,</l>
               <l>But it is hard when there is two to one,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10935:39"/>
Especially of women, but tis so,</l>
               <l>They shall be pleasd whether they will or no,</l>
               <l>Which will come first? what both giue back, ha, neither?</l>
               <l>Why then yond may helpe that come both together,</l>
               <l>So stand still, stand but a little while,</l>
               <l>And see how I your angers will beguile,</l>
               <l>Well yet there is no hurt, why then let me,</l>
               <l>Ioyne these two hands, and see how theil agree,</l>
               <l>Peace, peace, they crie, looke how they friendly kisse,</l>
               <l>VVell all this while there is no harme in this,</l>
               <l>Are not these two twins? twins should be both alike,</l>

               <l>Iesus these warriours will not offer blowes,</l>
               <l>VVhy then tis strange that you two should be foes,</l>

               <l>Touch lip with lip and they are bound from wrongs,</l>

               <l>Aiest quoth you? well brother if it be,</l>
               <l>I feare twill prooue an earnest vnto me,</l>
               <l>Goose said ye sir? oh that same very name,</l>
               <l>Hath in it much variety of shame,</l>
               <l>Of all the birds that euer yet was seene,</l>
               <l>I would not haue them graze vpon this greene,</l>
               <l>I hope they will not, for this, crop is poore,</l>
               <l>And they may pasture vpon greater store.</l>
               <l>But yet tis pittie that they let them passe,</l>
               <l>And like a Common bite the Muses grasse,</l>
               <l>Yet this I feare if Franke and I should kisse,</l>
               <l>Some creeking goose would chide vs with a hisse,</l>
               <l>I meane not that goose sings it knowes not what.</l>
               <l>Tis not that hisse when one saies hist come hither,</l>
               <l>Nor that same hisse that setteth dogges together,</l>
               <l>Nor that same hisse that by a fire doth stand,</l>
               <l>And hisseth T. or F. vpon the hand,</l>
               <l>But tis a hisse, and Ile vnlace my cote,</l>
               <l>For I should sound sure if I heard that note,</l>
               <l>And then greene Ginger for the greene goose cries,</l>
               <l>Serues not the turne, I turn'd the white of eyes,</l>
               <l>The Rosasolis yet that makes me liue,</l>
               <l>Is fauours that these Gentlemen may giue,</l>
               <l>But if they be displeased, then pleasde am I,</l>
               <l>To yeeld my selfe a hissing death to dye,</l>
               <l>Yet I hope heeres none consents to kill,</l>
               <l>But kindly take the fauour of good will.</l>
               <l>If any thing be in the pen to blame,</l>
               <l>Then here stand I to blush the writers shame.</l>
               <l>If this be bad, he promises a better.</l>
               <l>Trust him, and he will prooue a right true debter.</l>
