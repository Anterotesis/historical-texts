            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

These are therefore to require and command you immediately upon Receipt hereof, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to Suspend him from further Preaching in any Parish Church or Chappel in your Diocess, until he has given Vs Satisfaction, and Our further Pleasure be known herein.

                     <p>Sheweth,</p>
                     <p>THat nothing is so afflictive to Your Petitioner, as his Vnhappiness to have 
Incurred Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Displeasure, which he is so sensible of, that ever
since Your Majesty was pleased to give notice of it, he hath forborn all 
Publick Exercise of his Function, and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues so to do.</p>
                     <p>Your Petitioner can with great Sincerity affirm, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since 
he hath been a Preacher, he hath faithfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to do the best
Service he could in his Place and Station, as well to the late King, 
Your Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as your Majesty, both by Preaching and otherwise.</p>
                     <p>And so far he hath always been from venting any thing in the Pulpit 
tending to Schism or Faction, or any way
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93979:7"/>
to the Disturbance of Your Majesties Government, that he hath upon all
occasions in his Sermons, to the utmost of his Power, set himself against
all sorts of Doctrines and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that look that way: And this he is 
so well assured of, that he cannot but apprehend that his Sermons have been
very much misrepresented to Your Majesty.</p>
                     <p>But if in any Sermon of his, any Words or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions have unwarily slipt
from him, that have been capable of such Constructions, as to give Your 
Majesty Cause of Offence, as he solemnly professes he had no ill Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 
in those Words or Expressions, so he is very sorry for them, and resolves 
for the future to be so careful in the Discharge of his Duty, that Your Majesty 
shall have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe him to be Your most Faithful Subject.</p>
                     <p>And therefore he earnestly Prayeth, that Your Majesty out of Your Royal Grace
and Clemency, would be pleas'd to lay aside the Displeasure You have conceiv'd

of the Clergy enjoy under Your Majesties Gracious Government.</p>

               <speaker>Ld. Ch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, you are not Ignorant, I suppose, of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93979:8"/>
King's Letter which was sent to the Clergy; My Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> has Communicated to you. You are here Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not to have observ'd his Majesty's Commands in the Case of Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> whom you were ordered to Suspend, for going against the Orders of that Letter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B. L.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am much surpriz'd at what your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship tells me, and hope I have not disobeyed the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Your Lordship cannot believe I did this without Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and if my Counsel have mis-led me, I hope my own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Law will plead so far in my Favour, as to render my Fault (if any) very Excusable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, you know <hi>Ignorantia Iuris non Excusat.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B. L.</speaker>
               <p>But if I have not offended willingly, it may palliate at least.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we are not here to discourse, but to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine why you did not obey.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B. L.</speaker>
               <p>I humbly beg a Copy of the Commission, and a Copy of my Charge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch.</speaker>
               <p>Does your Lordship think my Lords are not very well satisfi'd upon what account they sit, and that they have power to judge your Lordship? A Copy is a thing never done; should we grant you a Copy, all that come before us would have the like, for we must do equal Justice to all. Besides, it is to be had at every Coffee-House.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B. L.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, this is a New Commission, I cannot tell how to inform my self whether any thing that relates particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to my Case, may not be found there. It is a Matter of high Concern. Besides, I am here under such Circumstances, as ought to make me very Cautious. I am a Peer, I am a Bishop: I hope your Lordships will take all into Consideration, and at least give me leave to read the Commission.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch.</speaker>
               <p>You need not doubt but your Quality, Station, and Family will be considered by their Lordships; but if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon seeing the Commission, you must withdraw.</p>

               <speaker>B. L.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I must submit; but it will be hard to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my Charge in my head: I may mistake.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch.</speaker>
               <p>It is a short Question, you may easily remember it: Why did you not obey the King's Commands?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B. L.</speaker>
               <p>It is a short Question; but may require a long An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. I must beg time to advise with Counsel, and to have them plead.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the Town is never so empty, but there will be Counsel enough, unless you can be satisfied with none but those that are abroad. But what time would you have?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B. L.</speaker>
               <p>Considering the time, and that there is not one Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian in the Commons, I hope you will give me till towards the <hi>Term.</hi>

               <p>What Answer at present occurs to encounter your Reasons for longer time, is, that the King's Affairs will not suffer long time. But since you propose no less time, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: what think you of a Week?</p>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> attacqu'd with so quick and sudden a return by a Citation, in a matter concerning that Letter which the whole World can bear me witness, I have been this whole Summer endeavouring with all the Power and Skill I had, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force to the strict observation of my Clergy. But before I can offer an Answer to the Question, I beg your Lordships leave to offer my Plea to your Jurisdiction, for I am told it is a Right every one has to make use of, when he finds it for his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. I would not hazard being so impertinent, as to offer any thing upon my own Head; your Lordships gave me time to advise with Counsel, and they that are learned in the Laws of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93979:10"/>
the Land, advise me to plead to your Jurisdiction, and will be ready to argue it.</p>

               <speaker>L. Ch.</speaker>

            <sp>

               <p>My Lords, I shall offer nothing that is undutiful to the King, or disrespectful to your Lordships, and I beseech you to correct and pardon me, if unwittingly any thing should fall from me that is liable to Censure. I am far from disowning any part of the King's Supremacy, I acknowledge it, and am so bound to do in its just Extent over all Persons, and in all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; what I have to offer in Plea to your Jurisdiction is, That I conceive this Commission you act by is not good, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an Act of Parliament, upon which Point I beg my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel may argue.</p>

            </sp>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>London</hi>'s Plea which he would have given in, if the Lords Commissioners would have suffered it to be argued.</p>
            <p>I Henry <hi>Bishop of</hi> London <hi>do declare and acknowledge, that the Kings Majesty is the only Supream Head and Governour of this Realm, and all other his Majesties Dominions and Countries, as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Causes as Temporal. Nevertheless, I the said Bishop by Protestation not acknowledging any just or legal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in your Lordships (otherwise than as by Law I am bound) to question or censure me in any matter or thing Ecclesiastical whatsoever, Do offer and shew to your Lordships, That at the Parliament of King</hi> Charles I. <hi>of blessed Memory, late King of</hi> England, <hi>holden on the</hi> 3. <hi>day of</hi> November, <hi>in the sixteenth Year of his Reign, a certain Act and Statute was made, Entituled, [A Repeal of the branch of a Statute</hi> Primo Elizabethae <hi>concerning Commissioners for Causes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical] setting forth, That in the Parliament holden in the First Year of the Reign of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>there was an Act made and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, Entituled, [An Act restoring to the Crown the ancient Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93979:10"/>
over the State Ecclesiastical and Spiritual.] And abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Foreign Power repugnant to the same. In which Act, among other things, there is contained one Clause, Branch, Article, or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, whereby it was Enacted to this effect, namely, That the said late Queens Highness, her Heirs and Successors, Kings or Queens of this Realm, should have full Power and Authority, by virtue of that Act, by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of</hi> England, <hi>to assign, name, and authorize, when, and as often as her Highness, her Heirs or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors should think meet and convenient, and for such and so long time as should please her Highness, her Heirs or Successors, such person or persons, being natural born Subjects to her Highness, her Heirs or Successors, as her Majesty, her Heirs or Successors should think meet, to exercise, use, occupy, and execute under her Highness, her Heirs and Successors, all manner of Iurisdictions, Priviledges, and Preheminences in any wise touching or concerning any Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction within these her Realms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>or any other her Highnesses Dominions and Countries, and to visit, reform, redress, order, correct, and amend all such Errours, Heresies, Schisms, Abuses, Offences, Contempts, and Enormities whatsoever, which by any manner of Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Power, Authority, or Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, can or may lawfully be reformed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of vertue, and the conservation of the Peace and Vnity of this Realm. And that such person or persons so to be named, assigned, and appointed by her Highness, her Heirs or Successors after the said Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents to him or them made and delivered as aforesaid, should have full Power and Authority by virtue of that Act and of the said Letters Patents under her Highness, her Heirs or Successors, to exercise, use, and execute all the Premises according to the Tenor and Effect of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he said Letters Patents, any matter or cause to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding. And setting forth likewise, that, by the colour of some words in the foresaid branch of the said Act, whereby Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners are authoriz'd to execute their Commission, according to the Tenor and effect of the Kings Letters Patents, and by Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents grounded thereupon; the said Commissioners have, to the great and unsufferable wrong and oppression of the King's Subjects, used to Fine and Imprison them, and to exercise other Authority not belonging to Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction, restor'd by that Act; and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93979:11"/>
divers other great mischiefs and inconveniencies have also ensued to the King's Subjects by occasion of the said branch; and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions issued thereupon, and the Executions thereof; and therefore for the repressing and preventing of the aforesaid abuses, mischiefs, and inconveniencies in time to come, It was by the said Act made at the said Parliament, of the said King</hi> Charles <hi>the First, Enacted, that the aforesaid Branch, Clause, Article, or Sentence contain'd in the said Act of</hi> Primo Elizabethae, <hi>and every Word, Matter, and Thing contain'd in that Branch, Clause, Article, or Sentence, should from thenceforward be repeal'd, annul'd, revoak'd, annihilated, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly made void for ever; any thing in the said Act to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding. And it was thereby also Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, that no Arch Bishop, Bishop, nor Vicar-General, nor any Ordinary whatsoever, nor any other Spiritual or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Iudge, Officer, or Minister of Iustice, nor any other Person or Persons whatsoever, Executing Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Power, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or Iurisdiction, by any Grant, License, or Commission of the King's Majesty, his Heirs or Successours, or by any Power or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity derived from the King, his Heirs or Successours, or otherwise, should from and after the first day of</hi> August, <hi>in the year of our Lord 1641, award, impose, or inflict any Pain, Penalty, Fine, Amerciament, or Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, or other Corporal Punishment upon any of the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for any Contempt, Misdemeanor, Crime, Offence, Matter or Thing whatsoever, belonging to Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Cognisance or Iurisdiction, or shall</hi> ex Officio, <hi>or at the instance or promotion of any other Person whatsoever, urge, enforce, tender, give, or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster unto any Church-Warden, Sides-Man, or other Person whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, any Corporal Oath, whereby he or she shall or may be charg'd or oblig'd to make any presentment of any Crime or Offence, or to confess, or accuse himself or her self of any Crime, Offence, Delinquency, or Misdemeanor, or any other neglect, matter, or thing, whereby, or by reason whereof he or she shall or may be liable or expos'd to any Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or Punishment whatsoever; upon pain and Penalty that every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that shall offend contrary to this Statute, shall forfeit and pay treble damages to every Person thereby-grieved, and the sum of</hi> 1001. <hi>to him or them who shall first demand and sue for the same; which said treble damages, and sum of a</hi> 1001. <hi>shall and may be demanded and receiv'd, and urg'd by action of Debt, Bill, or Plaint
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93979:11"/>
in any Court of Record, wherein no Priviledge, Essoyn, Protection, or Wager of Law shall be admitted or allow'd to the Defendant. And it was thereby further Enacted, That every Person who should once be convicted of any Act or Offence prohibited by that Statute, should for such Act or Offence be from and after such Conviction, utterly disabled to be or continue in any Office or Employment in any Court of Iustice whatsoever, or to exercise or execute any Power, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or Iurisdiction by force of any Commission, or Letters-Patents of the King, his Heirs or Successours. And it was thereby also En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, That from and after the first day of</hi> August, <hi>no new Court should be erected, ordain'd, or appointed, within this Realm of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>or Dominion of</hi> Wales, <hi>which should or might have the like Power, Iurisdiction, or Authority as the said High Commission-Court then had, or pretended to have; but that all and every such Letters-Patents, Commissions and Grants made or to be made by his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, and all Powers and Authorities granted thereby; and all Acts, Sentences, and Decrees, to be made by virtue or colour thereof, should be utterly void and of none effect; which said Act of Parliament, made at the said Parliament of the said King</hi> Charles <hi>the First, I the said Bishop of</hi> London <hi>do Plead, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to and against your Lordships Iurisdiction, and pray your Lordships Iudgment, whether your Lordships will think it fit, or ought to proceed any further herein against me the said Bishop of</hi> London.</p>

               <p>If I am over-rul'd in this, I must beg your Lordships Patience in one Plea more; your Lordships in this Commission, after the general words, are directed to proceed according to the Tenor of the Letters Patents, which say, that you shall first Proceed against all Persons offending, for matters done or to be done, by Censures and other lawful ways; in the next place, you are to enquire of, and search out, and call before you, all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Persons of what Degree or Dignity soever, as shall offend, and them and every of them to punish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I conceive, in the Capacity I am, you are only warranted to Try me for Offences after the Date of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>

                           <hi>I took the best Advice</hi> I <hi>could get, concerning of Doctor Sharp, <hi>and was Inform'd, that the Letter being directed to me, as Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>to Suspend a Person under my Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, I was therein to act as a Iudge, it being a Iudicial Act; and that no Person could by Law be Punish'd by Suspension, before he was call'd, or without being admitted to make his Defence. I thought it therefore my Duty, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with humbly to represent so much to my Lord President, that so I might receive his Majesties further Pleasure in that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Nevertheless, that I might obey his Majesties Commands as far as by Law I could, I did then send for Doctor</hi> Sharp, and acquainted him with his Majesties Displeasure, and the occasion of it, by shewing him his Majesties Letter: But he having never been call'd to answer any such Matter, or make his Defence, and protesting his Innocence, and likewise declaring himself most ready to give his Majesty full Satisfaction therein, in order thereto I advis'd him to forbear Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till he had apply'd himself to his Majesty, and at his request, I made him the Bearer of my Letter to my Lord President, waiting for his Majesties further Orders to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against him Iudicially, in case he should not at that time give his Majesty the Satisfaction requir'd: And the said Doctor</hi> Sharp <hi>hath not since Preach'd within my Diocess.</hi>

               <p>Has your Lordship any more to say?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B. L.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, what I shall say my self will be very short, only a little farther to explain my meaning in this Answer. The words of his Majesties Letter are liable to two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:93979:13"/>The first is a Legal and strict Sence of the word [<hi>Suspend</hi>] I must have Suspended Doctor <hi>Sharp, ab officio,</hi> because Preaching alone does not come under that Censure. In this Sence it was that I understood the King's Letter, and was Advis'd by my Counsel that it was a Judicial Act, and by Consequence could not be comply'd with, unless I had first Cited the Party, and heard the Cause; and in this I should have committed a fault. It is most excusable upon these two accounts: By all the Practice and Rules of Ecclesiastical Laws, the charge of Malice or Wilfulness is taken off from the Party, in case he has this to say for himself, that what he did, was <hi>Iuris Peritorum Consilio quibus cum in hac parte Communicavimus.</hi> Now I consulted with the most proper Person Sir <hi>Tho. Exton</hi> my Chancellour, with whose Advice I wrote my Answer. But in the next place, it is the constant Rule in all the Books, that in case the Prince write to a Judge and this Judge thinks he cannot lawfully obey the Command, he is to <hi>rescribere &amp; reclamare,</hi> and in so doing, <hi>tantum ab-est ut Principi deserviat quod is maxime serviat.</hi> And the Rule goes further, that in case the Prince be not satisfied with the Answer, the Judge is not to apprehend a charge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for his refusal, but has a right to except <hi>Iussio Secunda</hi> by the Prince's Rescript, because in common Equity, no man in such a case is to be Judg'd obstinate before a second refusal. I had no Rescript, but am-taken up at the first rebound.</p>
               <p>The other sense this word [<hi>Suspend</hi>] might be taken in, was at large for [<hi>Silensing.</hi>] In this I confess I did not apprehend it, because my Counsel turn'd my thoughts another way. But to shew that I was resolved to pay all the Duty I could to the King's Letter, which I am advis'd by my Counsel, was as strong Admonition as could be given, considering the Purport of the Letter; and besides, I advis'd him not to preach, till he had endeavoured to know His Majesties further pleasure; which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from a Judge, the Learned in the Laws tell me, is tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to an Admonition, and that if he had not submitted to it, I could have censur'd him for his disobedience; so that if this last was his Majesty's meaning, I have in effect obeyed the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93979:14"/>
Letter, which is all I shall say at present, and beg my Counsel may be heard to clear the matter in point of Law.</p>

               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oldish.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lords, the Question before your Lordships is, whether the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> has been disobedient to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Command? Concerning which, it must be considered,</p>
            </sp>
            <list>
               <item>1<hi>st.</hi> What was Commanded.</item>
               <item>2. What he has done in Obedience to it.</item>
               <item>3. What Judgment ought to have been given by him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>It is apparent by the Letter, that the King did not take Cognizance of the Cause; for the Words are, <hi>being informed that</hi> Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> &amp;c. So that it could not be an absolute Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for that supposes a Proof of the Crime charged upon him. Then let us consider the Words themselves, <hi>That you suspend him from preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, my Lords, we have not such a thing in our Law; so that the meaning must be only silencing of him. Where there is an Absolute Suspension, there ought to have been a Citation, Form of Proceedings, Judgment, and Decree. To Act other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, is contrary to the Law of God, of Nature, and of all Nations, in all Ages, and was never known in the World.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch.</speaker>
               <p>Doctor, I am loth to interrupt you, but I must tell you, this is an unnecessary Harangue; We know that it was not an absolute Suspension. But the Question is, whether the Bishop could Suspend him from preaching.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oldish.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Then, my Lord, I have gain'd that Point. If it were only a silencing of him, the Question is whether the Bishop did not Execute the King's Commands? I think he did it, and in such a Method as is observed in our Courts. When any Eminent Person is accus'd, the Judge sends to him by a Letter, and if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and Complies with the Judges Order, the Law is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93979:14"/>
                  <hi>Iudicium Redditur in invitos non in Volentes.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop did send for Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> shew'd him the King's Letter, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd him not to preach till his Majesty had received satisfaction, in which he promis'd to observe his Lordships Command, and has not preach'd to this day, so that his Majesty's Command was in effect fulfill'd.</p>
               <p>My Lords, there are the like Proceedings in the Common-Law; For if an Attorney takes a Man's word for his appearance, and he doth appear, 'tis the same thing as if he had been arrested, and there he has no Action against the Attorney.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cujus contrarium est Lex.</hi> There lies an Action of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape against the Attorney.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Hedges.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lords, the matter of Fact has been stated. And the Question is, whether the Bishop hath been disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the King's Command? It appears that he has not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause upon Receipt of His Majesty's Letter, he required the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor not to preach, and he hath obeyed him. That which the King Commanded, <hi>viz.</hi> To Suspend him, the Bishop could not do, the Act of Suspension is a Judicial Act; the King writes to him as a Bishop, to Suspend as a Bishop and a Judge, which could not be done before a hearing of the Cause. If a Prince sends to a Person that is not a Judge, but only a Ministerial Officer, that Officer is to execute his Commands; But when the King Commands a Judge, he Commands him to Act as a Judge. This is no light matter which the Dr. is accus'd of, 'tis for preaching Sedition and Rebellion, which requires severe Censure: And if the Bishop as a Judge had Suspended him, he had began at the wrong end, for this had been Judgment before Process: In this case there ought to have been a Citation. Our Books give many instances, which would be too tedious to your Lordships. I will give this one. The Emperour proceeding against the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> upon Information that he had receiv'd; and giving him no Citation; the King appeal'd to the Pope, who declar'd the proceedings to be void, and that it was against the Law of Nature, which is above all Positive Laws, to pass Sentence before Citation. This is the method of procceedings in all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93979:15"/>
Courts, and I humbly conceive it is, and will be the method of this Court; for otherwise the Bishop needed not to have been Cited before you. The Bishop has done what was his Duty; He was bound to return his Reasons to the King why he could not do that which was commanded, and to expect his farther Pleasure; which was done.</p>
               <p>I affirm, if a Prince or a Pope Commands that which is not lawful, it is the Duty of a Judge <hi>rescribere,</hi> which is all he can doe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Brise.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>The Question is <hi>ut Supra,</hi> a Citation is <hi>Iure Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> and can never be taken away by any positive Command or Law whatsoever.</p>
               <p>The Bishop has obey'd the King so far, in that he did <hi>Rescribere, &amp;c.</hi> expecting his Majesties further Pleasure. If the Bishop could have Suspended him, it must have been in <hi>foro</hi>; but in regard 'twas only Silencing him which was requir'd, it might be done in a private Chamber.</p>
               <p>The Advice of the Bishop, is in some Sence an Admonition, which is a Judicial Act, and this was given by the Bishop, and obeyed by the Doctor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Newton.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lords, the Question is <hi>ut Supra,</hi> The Bishop has not been disobedient, as in Nature no Man can be required to do that which is impossible, so no Man can be oblig'd to do an unlawful Act, <hi>id non fit, quod non Legitime fit</hi>: This Rule obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges all Men in the World, in all Places, and at all Times.</p>
               <p>The Charge against the Doctor is of a very high Nature, and he desir'd to be heard before he was Condemn'd. My Lords, the Bishops are <hi>Custodes Canonum,</hi> and therefore must not break them themselves. I affirm, that the Bishop was fo far from being disobedient, that he was obedient to the King. For when he did <hi>Rescribere,</hi> and heard not the further Pleasure of the King returned: He ought to conclude, that the King was satisfied with what he had written, according to his Duty, and that the King had alter'd his Commands. A Citation as your Lordships have heard, is according to all Laws in all Places: In all Judicial Acts, there is something to be done according
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93979:15"/>
to Law, and somewhat according to the Discretion of the Judge. And for that Reason as well as others, the Offender ought to be Cited to appear before him. That which was in the Bishop's Power to do, that he has done, and it was in effect what the King commanded to be done.</p>

               <p>I have but little more to say. I suppose my Counsel have satisfied your Lordships, that in the severest Construction, Malice or wilful Disobedience could not be imputed to me. But as my Lord Chancellor has now explain'd it to Doctor <hi>Oldish,</hi> that the King's meaning was only to [<hi>Silence</hi>] they have made plain to your Lordships, that I have effectually obeyed his Majesties Commands; and if in any Circumstance I have been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I am ready to make reparation by performing that likewise, and to beg his Majesties Pardon.</p>
