            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>MOST Holy and Profitable SAYINGS OF THAT REVEREND DIVINE,
<hi>Doctor Tho. Goodwin.</hi> Who departed this Life, <hi>Feb.</hi> 23. 1679./80.</head>
            <p>WE ſail to Glory, not in the ſalt Sea of our Tears, but in the red Sea of Chriſts precious Blood.</p>
            <p>A ſanctified Heart is better than a ſilver Tongue.</p>
            <p>A Heart full of Graces is better than a Heart full of Notions.</p>
            <p>Notional Knowledge, it may make a Mans Head giddy, but it will never make a Mans Heart holy.</p>
            <p>The Wheat and the Chaff, they may both grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but they ſhall not both lie together.</p>
            <p>In Hell there ſhall not be a Saint amongſt thoſe that are terrified: And in Heaven there ſhall not be a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner amongſt thoſe that are glorified.</p>
            <p>Will you pity a Body that is going to the Block; and will you not pity a Soul that is going to the Pit.</p>
            <p>What a ſad Viſitation is that, where the Black Horſe of Death goeth before, and the Red Horſe of Wrath followeth after.</p>
            <p>A Mans Condition in this Life may be honourable, and yet his State as to another Life may be damnable.</p>
            <p>There cannot be a better Being for us, than for us to be with the beſt of Beings.</p>
            <p>That which makes Heaven ſo full of Joy, is, that it is above all fear: And that which makes Hell ſo full of Horror, is, that it is below all hope.</p>
            <p>To be a Profeſſor of Piety, and a Practiſer of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is an abomination to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Oh! Sin is that Mark at which all the Arrows of Vengeance are ſhot.</p>
            <p>Were it not for Sin, Death had never had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and were it not for Death, Sin would never have had an ending.</p>
            <p>Oh! did Sin bring Sorrow into the world, then let Sorrow carry Sin out of the world.</p>
            <p>Let the Cry of your Prayers out-cry the Cry of your Sins.</p>
            <p>Nothing can quench the fire that Sin hath kindled, but the water which Repentance hath cauſed.</p>
            <p>You that have filled the Book of God with your ſins, ſhould fill the Bottle of God with your Tears.</p>
            <p>He can never truly reliſh the ſweetneſs of Gods mercy, who never taſted the bitterneſs of his own Miſery.</p>
            <p>None can promiſe us better than Chriſt can, and none can threaten us worſe than Chriſt can.</p>
            <p>Can any Man promiſe us any thing better than Heaven? Or, Can any Man threaten us with any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thing worſe than Hell?</p>
            <p>Heaven is promiſed to thoſe that love him, and Hell is to be the Portion of thoſe that hate him.</p>
            <p>To live without fear of Death is to dye living, to labour not to dye, is labour in vain.</p>
            <p>Men are afraid to dye in ſuch and ſuch ſins, but not afraid to live in ſuch and ſuch ſins.</p>
            <p>Oh the Hell of horrours and terrors that attend thoſe Souls, that have their greateſt work to do when they come to Die.</p>
            <p>Therefore as you would be happy in Death, and everlaſtingly bleſſed after Death, prepare and fit your ſelves for Death.</p>
            <p>Did Chriſt Die for us, that we might live with him: And ſhall not we deſire to Die, and be with him.</p>
            <p>A Believers Dying day is his Crowning day.</p>
            <p>God protects Men when they are in his way, but not out of his way. Sin is never at a higher flood, than when Grace is at a low Ebb.</p>
            <p>Though the Churches Enemies may be Waves to toſs her, yet they ſhall never be Rocks to ſplit her.</p>
            <p>It is not a time for Sions Sons to be Rejoycing, when their Mother is Mourning.</p>
            <p>When the Churches Adverſaries make long Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes upon her Back, we ſhould caſt in the Seed of Tears.</p>
            <p>Many inſtead of ſympathiſeing with Believers in their Miſery, they are cenſuring of them for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
            <p>True love to Chriſt can walk on the Water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drowning, and lie on the Fire without burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>How ſhall we land at the Heaven of Reſt, if we are not toſſed upon the Sea of Trouble.</p>
            <p>A Saint of God lives above the love of Life, and fears not the terror of Death.</p>
            <p>None are ſo welcome to that Spiritual <hi>Canaan,</hi> as thoſe that ſwim to it through the Red Sea of their own Blood.</p>
            <p>Saints are not ſo much afraid of ſuffering, as they are of ſinning; in ſuffering the offence is done to us, but in ſinning the offence is done to God.</p>
