            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BEfore theſe ſhall come to your Lordſhips hands, I make
no doubt but Maſter <hi>Nichols</hi> of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
hath made both Houſes a Relation of what hath
paſſed here, ſince I received His Majeſties Letters for
the diſcharging me of the Command of the Fleet wherewith I
was intruſted; how I called a Councell of War, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with His Majeſties Letters, and likewiſe with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Parliament ſent from the Houſes, for me to continue
my Charge; I confeſſe it was a great ſtreight that I was put in
between two Commands that have ſo much power over me,
But when I conſider the great care which I have ever ſeen in the
Parliaments of the Kingdom, for the good and ſafety of the
King and Kingdom, and every mans particular in them; and
that they are that great Councell by whoſe Authority the Kings
of <hi>England</hi> have ever ſpoken to their Subjects. And likewiſe,
that the truſt of this Fleet for the defence of His Majeſty and the
Kingdomes, was committed to me by them, and know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of my own heart to His Majeſty and Parliament, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
not to deſert that Charge committed to my truſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God (bleſſed be his name for it) hath made me hitherto ſo
ſucceſsfull, but to continue it untill I ſhall be revoked by that
Authority that hath entruſted me with it, which having declared
to my Captains at the Councell of War, all of them unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65641:3"/>
and cheerfully took the ſame reſolution, excepting five,
which was the Rear-Admirall Captain <hi>Fogge,</hi> Captain <hi>Burley,</hi>
Captain <hi>Slingsby,</hi> and Captain <hi>Wake;</hi> a<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uthority over them, and
got together round that night to make their defence againſt me,
onely Captain <hi>Burley</hi> came in and ſubmitted to me; whereupon
in the morning I waighed my Anchors, and cauſed the reſt of
my <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ips ſo to do, and came to an Anchor round about them, and
beſieged them, and when I had made all things ready, I ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
them; Sir <hi>Iohn Menues</hi> and Captain <hi>Fogge</hi> came in to
me, out Captain <hi>Slingsby</hi> and Captain <hi>Wake</hi> ſtood out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I let flye a Gun over them, and ſent them word I had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up the Glaſſe upon them, if in that ſpace they came not in,
they muſt look for me aboard them, I ſent to them by my Boat,
and moſt of the Boats in the Fleet; their anſwer was ſo perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory,
that my Maſters and Saylers grew ſo impatient on them,
that although they had no Arms in their Boat at all, yet God
gave them ſuch courage and reſolution, as in a moment they
entred them, took hold on their ſhroud, and ſeized upon theſe
Captains being armed with their Piſtols and Swords, and ſtruck
their Yards and Top-maſts, and brought them both to me, the
like courage and reſolution was never ſeen amongſt unarmed
men, ſo as all was ended without effuſion of blood, which I
muſt attribute to the great God of heaven and earth onely, who
in the moment that I was ready to give fire on them, put ſuch
courage into our men to act it, and ſo ſaved much blood. I hope
the Parliament will think of ſome courſe for all our Indempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and eſpecially for the Officers of the Navie, my Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
a very able and good man; for my ſelf, I doubt not but
they that put me in this imployment, will preſerve me for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them faithfully.</p>
            <p>I ſend your Lordſhip herewith incloſed a Letter to Captain
<hi>Wheeler</hi> Captain of the <hi>Greybound.</hi> I beſeech your Lordſhip be
a means that ſome money may be ſent us, for it hath been often
promiſed, but we hear not of it; the weather continuing ſtormy
ſo long together, that we ſpend our Maſts and Top-Maſts, or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65641:3"/>
ſome detriment or other befals us daily, ſo that we are in great
extremity for want of money.</p>
            <p>Thus, having nothing elſe to trouble your Lordſhip, onely that
you will be pleaſed to acquaint the Parliament of our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

            </opener>
            <p>I Am ſorry it was my ill hap to be employed from aboard
of your Ship when you tooke your leave of my Lord, for
I was then employed by his Lordſhip to thoſe refractory
perſons with a ſecond ſummons unto them to come aboard
his Lordſhip; all of them that I ſpake with uſed me civilly, and
gave me a reaſonable ſatisfaction, that they would attend my
Lord within few houres, which they made good; but Captaine
<hi>Slingſby</hi> uſed other language, that he would live and die in his
Ship, and that he made a great deale of difference between <hi>Iohn
Brown</hi> and <hi>Charles Rex:</hi> I replyed unto him that <hi>Iohn Brown</hi>
did write his name there by the authority not only of <hi>Charles
Rex,</hi> as he tearmed it, but that he had alſo the Great Seal of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
for it, beſides the authority of the Peers and Commons of
this Kingdom, I deſired him that I might ſee the Kings Letter
which he had; he anſwered me, that he had received none, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I demanded of him by what colour he could refuſe to obey
my Lord: I having then ſhewed him the Ordinance of both
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65641:4"/>
Houſes of Parliament; his anſwer unto me againe was, that by
all the Laws that he had read he could not find that an Ordinance
of Parliament was Law; and that it wat ſufficient for him, that
he had ſeen the Kings Letters to others in the Fleet, by which he
did underſtand His Majeſties pleaſure, and ſhould be a ſufficient
warrant for him; Captaine <hi>Burley</hi> Captaine of the Antilop did
promiſe me to ſubmit himſelf forthwith to my Lord, and writ
his letters by me to that effect, and indeed he durſt do no other
wayes, for the Muſter, the Officers, and all the company of the
ſaid Ship would have caſt him over board if he had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
for they were unanimouſly for my Lord, whereupon his
Lordſhip did ſend the Captaine of his own Ship for him, and
he came with him immediately to my Lord; the next morning
my Lord Commanded His Anchors to be weighed, and came
very neer thoſe foure Ships that ſtood out, and Commanded the
reſt of His ſhips to do the like and ſo theſe four ſhips were cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſurrounded by the whole Fleet: Whereupon Sir <hi>Iohn Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues</hi>
the Rear-Admirall, and Captain <hi>Fog</hi> Captaine of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Reformation came aboard unto my Lord according to
their promiſe unto me over night, and ſubmitted themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Lordſhip; whereupon his Lordſhip called a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
War of all the Captains and Maſters, as the day before when
you were there, and then it was reſolved that they would turne
up the glaſſe, and if theſe two Ships would not yeeld obedience
unto his Lordſhip within that time, they would board them. In
the meane time, the Vice Admirall Captaine <hi>Butler</hi> who is a
moſt diſcreet and reſolute gentleman, made this propoſition to
my Lord and the Councell of War, that all the Maſters that
were there ſhould take their Boats all unarmed and go and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
them once more, and to let them know that the glaſſe was
turned upon them. Captaine <hi>Slingſby</hi> who they firſt ſummo'nd,
and Maſter <hi>Hadock</hi> Maſter of the Victory the Rear-Admirall
would not brook to heare the language from a Captaine to their
Admirall, entred the Ship immediatly, and Captaine <hi>Slingsby</hi>
came forth upon the Deck, and preſented a Piſtoll at his breaſt,
but he layd hold of it before he could diſcharge it, ſo all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65641:4"/>
men did board him alſo,<note place="margin">Theſe 2 Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Slingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and Wake, are both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners aboard ſome of the Shipps here, and there my Lord will keepe them untill he doth hear from both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and did ſtrike his top-maſts and
let fall his yards, and ſo they took him away in their Boates, and
went from him to the Expedition where Captaine <hi>Wake</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
and all theſe naked men enter'd a board of him preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſtrook his yards and Top-maſts, and took him likewiſe,
and ſo brought them both a board without any effuſion of bloud,
God be praiſed for it, ſo that now I hope my Lord hath weeded
away thoſe ill members that would make a deviſion between the
King and His Parliament here at Sea: We have too many of
them on ſhoare, and therefore we need the leſſe of them at Sea.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but you and the reſt of the diſcreet members of
Yonr Houſe of Commons will take notice of the reſolution of
thoſe Sea men that ſtands ſo unanimouſly for the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>The laſt night Sir <hi>Iohn Penington</hi> came to <hi>Deal</hi> with between
30 and 2 Cavaliers in his company as the report goes, Captaine
<hi>Edwin Sands</hi> who lives withins 2 mile of <hi>Deal,</hi> hearing of Sir
<hi>Iohns</hi> coming there in that poſture, did ſummon the Countreys
thereabouts to watch all night and came himſelfe between one
and two in the morning aboard my Lords Ship to acquaint His
Lordſhip that Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> was there with that Company, and ſaid
that if he did but offer the leaſt breach of the Peace he would
raiſe the Countrey upon him, for he is one of the Deputy Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,
preſented by the Earle of <hi>Leiſter</hi> to Your Houſe for the
County of <hi>Kent;</hi> but I believe he hath no Commiſſion from His
Lordſhip nor any Order from the Houſe to Act any thing for the
good of the King Parliament and Kingdom, I hope that you and
the reſt of the diſcreet members of Your Houſe of Commons
will not onely returne him thanks but give him authority to have
care of his Countey. And ſo this is all that hath paſſed ſince you
have been here: And craving your pardon for being thus tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
I take my leave and reſt.</p>
