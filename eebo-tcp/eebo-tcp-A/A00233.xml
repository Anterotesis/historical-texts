            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Or haue any such offences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them presented to the Chancellor, Archdeacon, Commissary, Officiall, or any other vsing Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction within this Diocesse, beene suppressed, or left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished, for bribe, reward, pleasure, friendship, feare, or any other partiall respect?</p>
               <p n="4">4 Are any Assemblies called Uestry-méetings, held in your Parish? when, and how often are they? In what place, and by whom? Hath any thing (that you haue heard of) been proposed, treated, or concluded therein, touching the diuine Seruice, or the doctrine and discipline of the Church? Or any thing medled with, for the gouernment of the Church or Parish, which belongs to the Ecclesiasticall cognition and Iurisdiction?</p>
               <p n="5">5 Doth the Arch-deacon once in thrée yéeres, visit and suruey your Church, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the repaires of the same, and vpon any defect found, hath he made certificate of it, as far as you know or haue heard?</p>

And doth the Chancellor, Arch-deacon, Commissary, or Officiall, or any other Minister of the Court, exact or extort any other greater fées or sums of money, than in the said Tables are contained?</p>
               <p n="7">7 Doth any Arch-deacon, Officiall, or Surrogate vnder him, make commutation of any penance; or doth the Chancellor or any Commissary, or any Surrogate vnder any, commute or change any penance or corporall punishment, for any money, without the consent of the Bishop?

               <p n="8">8 Doth the Chancellor, Arch-deacon, Commissary, or Officiall, or any other person vsing Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, speed any act in any cause, priuately of themselues, and not in the presence of some publike Notary or Actuary?</p>
               <p n="9">9 Is the number of Apparitors increased in this Diocesse? And wherein, and in what manner is the Countrey ouer-burthened or grieued by them? Hath any of them vnder pretence of authority, cited or summoned any person vnlawfully; or hath any of them taken any reward for the concealing of any offence or sin, or that the offenders might escape punishment? Who be they that haue so done? Or doe any of them take any fées that are not vsuall? Haue they threatned any to prosecute them, if they had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward giuen them? Or do any of them cause any party to appeare in any Ecclesiasticall Court within this Diocesse, without a citation first obtained from the Iudge of the Court?</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb facs="tcp:23417:10"/>10 Hath any Ecclesiasticall Iudge or Officer whatsoeuer, Aduocate, Registrer, Procter, Clerke, or other such Ministers, any way abused themselues in their Offices, contrary to the Lawes and Canons in that behalfe prouided?</p>

And how haue the same béene performed or obserued by the Minister or any other of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, whom they concerne?</p>
               <p n="12">12 Lastly, haue you and euery of you, by your selues, read, or haue caused to be read to you, all these Articles? Haue you well examined and inquired into euery particular therein intended? Haue you sincerely, vprightly, &amp; without any partiall affection or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealement, presented and made knowne all and euery of the offenders in any of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, either as they are taken in truth to be, or by common fame reported?</p>
               <p>If you know any other matter of Ecclesiasticall cognisance, worthy the presentment in your iudgement and fit to be reformed by Ecclesiasticall censure, though it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in these Articles, yet you shall likewise present the same by vertue of your oaths.</p>
               <p>The Minister also of euery Parish may and ought to ioyne with the Church-wardens, or other Sworne-men, for the presenting of offences; and if they be so irreligious as not to do it, the Minister of himselfe may &amp; ought to present the offences, or the Church-wardens and Quest-men, for not presenting, and is required in his Canonicall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence so to doe.</p>
               <p>There must be distinct answer made to euery Article, and to euery branch thereof, as far as they know, or haue heard of any offence.</p>
               <p>And if (their Oath and all this aduertisement notwithstanding) any Church-wardens or other Sworne-men, shall follow the customary manner, and be carelesse in inquiring and presenting as they ought, then shall they not be able hereafter to say, that they had not faire warning to the contrary giuen them in the spirit of meeknesse; or to complaine that they are hardly dealt with, if (vpon information and proofe otherwise had) they be called to answer their willfull periury, in some other course of iustice, for neglecting to inquire and present to all the particulars herein proposed?</p>
               <p>And to the intent that all things aboue mentioned may (by the helpe of God) as well be kept, as set in good order, the Chancellor of the Diocesse, and all the Commissaries are hereby required, that so far as to them in their seuerall places it shall appertaine, when the Synods and Generals are holden respectiuely, they do faithfuly inquire after all these things, &amp; in all places of their Iurisdictions exact a due obseruance of the same.</p>
               <p>
