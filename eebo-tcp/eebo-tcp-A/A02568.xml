            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I call heauen and earth to record against you this day, that if you relent, or answere not, your perishing is wilfull. We may pitty your weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but God shall plague your Apostacy; if you had beene bred in blindnes, your ignorance had beene but lamentable, now your choice and loue of darkenes is feareful and desperate. Alas you can not be condemned without our sorrow &amp; shame: What should we do?

Heare this yet (you weake Reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) if there be any care left in you of that soule which you haue thus prostituted to errour; if you haue any regard to that God whose simple truth you haue contemned and forsaken; what is this that hath driuen you from vs, allured you to them?

Let all indif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferent tongues say, whether that very See where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your faith depends, euen within the smoake of his Holines, be not (for vitiousnes) the sinke of the world; we may condemne our selues, their liues shall iustifie vs: But you lift not to looke so farre; you see their liues at home, you see ours: The Comparison is not equall; they take this for the time of their persecution; we of our prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The stubbornest Israelite, and the most god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Marriner could call vpon God in his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: we are all worse with libertie: Looke backe and see how they liued in former times while they prospered, No Turks (saith <hi>Erasmus</hi>) more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominably: thogh now at the worst, how many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Professors might you finde, which would scorn that the most strict Hermite, or austere Cappu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, should go before them in a gratious life, and in true mortification? euen amongst twelue, there will be one diuell: I wish they were so good that we might emulate them: but for my part, <hi>I</hi> neuer

And now you doe well to shift off this blame to others sins, which haue most cause to accuse your owne.</p>
            <p>From manners to looke towards our Doctrine: the noueltie of our Religion (you say) hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged you: theirs hath drawne you with the reuerence of her age.

my owne, forgetting the measure of a Praeface, I would passe through euerie point of difference betwixt vs, and let you see in all particulars, which is the old way; and make you know, that your Popish Religion doth but put on a borrowed visor of grauitie vpon this Stage, to out-face true antiquitie. Yet least you should complaine of words, let me without your tediousnes haue leaue but to instance in the first of all Controuersies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs; offering the same proofe in al, which you shall see performed in one.

            <p>There is no so great hardnesse in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to come to those things which are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to saluation, saith <hi>Austen</hi>: In those things which are openly layd downe in Scripture, are found all those things which containe our faith and rules for our life, saith the same Father; who yet againe also saith thus: The spirit of God hath Royally and wholsomely tempered the

            <p>And because <hi>Bellarmine</hi> takes exception at this (<hi>Feré Scarce</hi>) compare this place with the former; and with that which he hath in his third, Epistle thus:<note place="margin">Aug.

opinions. The first of <hi>Albertus Pighius,</hi> 4. booke of Eccles.

The second of <hi>Io. de Turrecremata,</hi> 4. B. part 2. c. 20. that the Pope, in that he fals into an heresie, though inward and secret, is without the Church and deposed of God; and therefore that he may be iudged, that is declared to be deposed (<hi>de facto</hi>) if hee yet refuse to yeelde. But this opinion I cannot allow. The third is in another extreame, that the Pope neyther for secret nor manifest heresie is, or can be deposed: This <hi>Io. Turrecremata</hi> in the place forecited confuteth; and indeed it is an opinion very improbable. The fourth is <hi>Caietanes</hi> in his Tract of the authority of the Pope and the Councel, ch. 20. and 21. That a Pope which is manifestly hereticall, is not (<hi>ipso facto</hi>) deposed, but may and ought to be deposed by the Church: which opinion in my iudgement cannot be defended.

and his Master the Cardinall of Florence, and <hi>Abulensis</hi> in <hi>cap.</hi> 18. of <hi>Matthew, q.</hi> 108. This opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath two grounds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the Pope is not properly the head of the whole Church, gathered together.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That the supreame power of the Church is as well in the Councell, as in the Pope; but in the Councell principally, immediately, and immoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably: And in the defence of this point, these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors againe differ from themselues, whiles some hold this power formally and subiectiuely in the Pope; and finally in the Church. Others will haue it formally and principally in the Church; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally in the Pope.</p>
                     <p>Second opinion is of some Canonists, which will haue the Pope aboue the Councell, and that he cannot vpon constraint be iudged by any; but that he may subiect himselfe (if he will) to the Councell. So teacheth the <hi>Glosse.</hi> in <hi>Canon. Nossi, &amp;c.</hi>

The second is, <hi>Bonauentures</hi> opinion, who placeth freewill in a certaine naturall habite, arising from reason and will (vpon 2. Sent. Dist. 23. art. 1.) The third is <hi>Albertus</hi> opinion, that freewill it is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the soule, perfected by a naturall habite. The fourth, that freewill is an vniuersal power, or faculty, conteining vnder it all the powers of the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and sensitiue soule. This opinion is reported

Sum. q. 74. &amp;c.) The sixt is <hi>Durandus</hi> (vpon 2. Sent. d. 24. q. 3.) who teaches, that freewill is the very power of reason and will, but more especially of reason. The seuenth is the opinion of <hi>Henricus</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> (in 2. Sent. dist. 25.) who hold, that freewill is but one particular faculty, euen the will it selfe; and that it is so free, that it doth not depend so much as vpon the practicall Iudgement of reason.
