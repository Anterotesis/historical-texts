            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere is nothing more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er World then <hi>Precious Stones,</hi> ſeeing they are the Starres of the Earth, and ſhine in in competition with thoſe of the Firmament, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:56423:3"/>
with them for ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, beauty, and glory. Nature produceth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more rich, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confeſſeth it, in her moſt careful laying them up and hiding them in her private Cabinets and Repoſitories in the inner parts of the Earth, ſo that they are not eaſie to be come by; but their value and price make them worth the ſearching for, even through the
<pb facs="tcp:56423:3"/>
bowels of the World. Amongſt theſe the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond very well deſerveth the firſt place, and ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all in brightneſs and hardneſs, and cannot be wrought upon but by it ſelf; the Blood of a Goat, contrary to the Opinion of the Ancients, having no power at all over it. The <hi>Ruby,</hi> whoſe lively Colour, and whoſe Fire, pierceth the Darkneſs of the Night, comes next
<pb facs="tcp:56423:4"/>
the <hi>Diamond,</hi> and there be divers ſorts of them. The <hi>Emerald</hi> with its lovely green delights our ſight: After theſe come the <hi>Amethyst,</hi> the <hi>Saphyr,</hi> the <hi>Turcois, Sardonix, Chryſolite, Hyacinth, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pale,</hi> and others which deſerve a particular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Sea hath likewiſe her riches as well as the Earth, ſhe gives us <hi>Pearl, Coral, Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris,</hi> and <hi>Yellow,</hi> all which
<pb facs="tcp:56423:4"/>
ſerve for Ornament, and are of conſiderable uſe in Phyſick. The Beaſt alſo do encloſe riches in their bowels, and the <hi>Bezoar</hi> for its great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it receiveth, may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well be ranked with <hi>Precious Stones. Indico, Silks, Sal Armoniac, Gum Lacca, Salpeter,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like things, are not the leaſt Cauſes of Admiration, <hi>Metals,</hi> and chiefly <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56423:5"/>
currant now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes in moſt parts of the World, the repoſe and torment of Mortals, their evil and welfare do hold likewiſe a conſiderable place amongſt the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Nature, and ſhould make us ſo much the more admire our Creator.</p>
            <p>We have divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors both Ancient and Modern, who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the nature of all
<pb facs="tcp:56423:5"/>
theſe things, of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and uſe. But I have known none who have taken the care to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve exactly either the places whence they draw them, or how they are diſcovered, or their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or how they are prepared by any infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule; of <hi>Diamonds, Pearls,</hi> and <hi>Rubies,</hi> in proportion to their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and weight, which I find in my Opinion ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:56423:6"/>
worthy the inquiry of the Curious: for if we take delight to obſerve the ſituation of the Stars, and ſeek out the ſource of a River, I find no leſs pleaſure to diſcover a Mine, to trace its Veins, and to know preciſely thoſe places of the Earth where the <hi>Diamonds</hi> are found, and where they fiſh for <hi>Pearl;</hi> and this is that which this Hiſtory doth diſcover: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb facs="tcp:56423:6"/>
the <hi>Diamond</hi> is only produced in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that but in a little corner of it; the <hi>Ruby</hi> in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on the other ſide <hi>Ganges,</hi> little frequented by <hi>Europoeans;</hi> the <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi> in <hi>Peru</hi> a Region of <hi>America;</hi> the <hi>Turcois</hi> in <hi>Perſia;</hi> the <hi>Pearl</hi> only in a few Seas of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>VVeſt;</hi> the <hi>Coral</hi> in the <hi>Streights; Yellow Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> upon the Coaſts of <hi>Pruſsia;</hi> the true <hi>Bezoar</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56423:7"/>
only in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and ſo of the reſt. In all theſe Inquiries I have laboured upon very good Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and the neareſt Relations of the moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Travellers of our Time; and this Work ought ſo much the rather to be received, by how much it ſeems to be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and ſhews the ways to thoſe precious Mines of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which hitherto have not been
<pb facs="tcp:56423:7"/>
well known, and of thoſe fertil Regions into which our moſt Powerful King hath a deſire to eſtabliſh Commerce, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and glory of his Subjects.</p>

is pure, and hath no mixture or tincture of other Earth, as in other places.</p>
            <p>Theſe Stones are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered till after the Waters which fall like huge Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from the Mountains, are all paſſed, and men have much to do to attain them, ſince few perſons go to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick in this Iſle; and foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Inhabitants do fall upon Strangers who come aſhore, unleſs it be by a particular favour. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, the Queen does rarely permit any to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport them; and ſo ſoon as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56423:12"/>
ever any one hath found one of them they are obliged to bring it to her. Yet for all that they paſs up and down, and now and then the Hollanders buy them in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia.</hi> Some few are found there, but the largeſt do not exceed five Carats, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the year 1648, there was one to be ſold in <hi>Batavia</hi> of 22 Carats.</p>
            <p>I have made mention of the Queen of <hi>Borneo,</hi> and not of the King, becauſe that the Iſle is alwayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by a Woman, for that People, who will

            <p>The ſecond River is in the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala,</hi> and is called <hi>Nage,</hi> by the Name of a great Town, the Seat of a Prince, equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Ougoulin, Pepeli,</hi> and <hi>Balacor,</hi> fifteen dayes journey from all three. This
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56423:13"/>
Province hath a <hi>Raja,</hi> or a Duke in our Language, who is an Idolater, as are all his Subjects. This <hi>Raja,</hi> as alſo the Kings of <hi>Viſapour</hi> and <hi>Golconda,</hi> are Tributaries to the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> and have been his Subjects, but took occaſion to revolt from him, whil'ſt they ſaw him buſied againſt the Tartars. 'Tis from hence that the three Mines of Diamonds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall ſpeak being found in the Countries of theſe Princes, are ordinarily ſaid to be found in the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Great Mogol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:56423:13"/>Theſe Diamonds then are diſcovered in the Sand of a River, at the bottom and upon the Banks, after that the great Floods are paſſed, juſt as in the River of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo.</hi> They are fair, for the moſt part pointed, brisk, high, bright and large, and what we call now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days of the Old Rock. But they are hard to come by, becauſe the River affords but very few, and the Iuha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants hold them at an high rate; and that which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them ſtill more rare, is the perfidiouſneſs of thoſe

who ſell them, who lay wait in the Woods for the Merchants who buy them, and fall upon them. Beſides that, the Prince doth cruelly tyrannize over the poor people who come to ſearch for them. In the year 1657 <hi>L'Eſcot</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> ventured to go thither, by reaſon that he had learned that the <hi>Raja</hi> had a Diamond of 42 Carats, he was courteouſly received by the Prince, who ſhewed it to him and had a mind to ſell it him, upon condition that <hi>L'Eſcot</hi> would pay for it in ready money: but the

 and ſetting the currant price upon each Stone they have bought, do divide the profit of it amongſt them, and ſell it all again to the great Merchants, who by little and little make large Collections. They match the Waters, and mix therewith alwayes ſome Stone that has a point or flaw, which they cannot remove. They put their whole confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Strangers, eſpecially the <hi>Francks,</hi> whereof very few come thither, and place ſuch confidence in their faith, that they leave them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times great quantities of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds

            <p>The ſecond Mine is called <hi>Coullour</hi> in the Perſian Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the Idolaters of the Countrey call it <hi>Gany.</hi> This is a large Town, near a great River, and they dig from the River to a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain about two Leagues from thence, and in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it ſelf. This Mine hath
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56423:18"/>
been diſcovered but within 50 or 60 years, and is the place where they find the moſt part of the great Stones, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before that time they rarely met with any above twelve Carrats; but that at this day ſome are to be ſeen of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, an hundred, and of two hundred Carrats, <hi>Mirgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mola</hi> Chief Miniſter of State, and General of the Armies of the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> a man of great parts, much believed of his Maſter, who gave him the Title of Prince of Princes, though at length he proved a Traitor, preſented the <hi>Great</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:56423:19"/>
               <hi>Mogol,</hi> to whoſe ſide he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a vaſt Stone of Nine hundred Carrats in weight: yet being full of flaws, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to 300 by <hi>Hortenſius</hi> a Venetian Lapidary, who cut it, but could not do it ſo well, but there remained a flaw in it, which makes it ſomething unhandſom. 'Tis alſo to be obſerved, that juſt as at the Mine of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> the Stones in this alſo do partake of the quality of the Earth from whence they are brought; ſo that if the Earth be marſhy and moiſt, the Stone inclines to black; if it be reddiſh, the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56423:19"/>
Stone inclines to be red; for from the Town to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there is great difference of Mould: and upon the greateſt part of theſe Stones, after they are cut, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears alwayes as it were a piece of greaſe, which makes you ever and anon put your hand to your Handkerchief to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wipe it off. We will obſerve by the way that whereas we make uſe of the day to examine rough Stones, and to judge well of their water, and of the points that may be found therein, the Inhabitants of the Countrey make uſe of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56423:20"/>
night, and in an hole which they make in the Wall a foot ſquare, where they put a Lamp with a great Match, holding the Stone in their Fingers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Eyes and the Lamp, they make an eſtimate of the water and clearneſs of the Diamond. We muſt not forget that the Celeſtial water (as they call it) is of all waters for a Diamond moſt unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and that it is impoſſible to know it ſo long as the Stone is rough; but after that it is a little diſcovered upon the Wheel, the infallible ſecret to judge well of its water, is to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56423:20"/>
carry it under a Shady Tree, for under its green ſhade you may eaſily diſcover if it be blew. Formerly there have been reckoned at this Mine Sixty thouſand Miners and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but in the year 1660 there was not a Stone ſcarce worth looking upon, and not above Three thouſand Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Mines, all the reſt being dead with hunger and miſery; for each Miner has but Five Crowns a year, and they are certainly the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people upon Earth. The Land is alſo very barren, and if it could but produce Pulſe, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56423:21"/>
people would not trouble themſelves to gather Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. Thoſe who pay the Miners, make them work as much as they pleaſe, and take as much as they pleaſe of the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without ſearching it; but after they have begun to ſearch into it, they owe to the King a Pagode, which is worth two Crowns of our Money, for the whole time till they ceaſe to work.</p>
            <p>The Third and laſt Mine was diſcovered in the year 1448, two days journey from <hi>Raolconda,</hi> and the place is called <hi>Gazerpoli;</hi> the Stones
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56423:21"/>
there are very clear and of a good water, but cannot be ground but with the Stones of the ſame Mine: Otherwiſe, if they ſhould make uſe of Stones of another Mine, theſe laſt would be bruiſed: They are likewiſe apt to break upon the Wheel, and they who are not vers'd in the knowledge of Stones, may eaſily be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in them. A <hi>Portuguefe</hi> retiring to <hi>Venice,</hi> was deſired, paſſing by <hi>Legorn,</hi> to ſell one of thoſe Stones which he had, for which they offered him Twelve thouſand Crowns; he would not part with it at
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56423:22"/>
that rate, and bringing it to <hi>Venice</hi> to get it cut, it broke upon the Wheel into fifteen or twenty pieces.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe two Rivers and three Mines, there be alſo ſome other Mines towards the Cape of <hi>Comorin,</hi> of which I will make mention in a few words. In the year 1652 the <hi>Nababe,</hi> who is as the Grand Viſier in <hi>Turkey,</hi> the <hi>Etmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doulet</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and Conſtable in <hi>France,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimola</hi> of whom I ſpoke even now, was at the Siege of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decote,</hi> a very ſtrong place in the Province of <hi>Carnatica,</hi> by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56423:22"/>
reaſon of its ſituation; which he took notwithſtanding in two Moneths time. There were ſome French in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, yet more Engliſh and Hollanders, who had deſerted their Colours and come over to him, all able Gunners; the poor wretches of the Countrey having never heard the noiſe of theſe Engins, were quite ſurpris'd at it, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themſelves forthwith to their diſcretion. <hi>Indecote</hi> is 35 days journey from <hi>Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipatan,</hi> inclining towards the Cape of <hi>Comorine,</hi> and 16 from <hi>Golconda.</hi> This is one
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56423:23"/>
of the faireſt and beſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of all the <hi>Indies,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where all the Countrey is green, full of Rivers and Lakes, to water the Land where need requires. It was during this Siege that they brought to <hi>Nababe</hi> a great number of Diamonds of the ſix Mines he had cauſed to be digged towards the Cape of <hi>Comorin:</hi> yet there was ne're a Stone of a good water, they were either yellow or black: and after that <hi>Nababe</hi> had viewed them, he forbad them to dig any more, and gave order that theſe people
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56423:23"/>
ſhould return to their labour, by which they brought more profit to the King then by working in the Mines; being they found not one good Stone there.</p>
            <p>2. I come now to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of finding the Diamond, and eſpecially how it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Mine of <hi>Coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</hi> The Miners ſink a Pit of about fifteen or twenty foot ſquare, and throw the Earth about it upon a clean place, almoſt of the ſame largeneſs, raiſing a little wall of a foot and half, to keep
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56423:24"/>
up the earth and water which they caſt in there; after this they waſh and ſtamp and tread the earth with their feet in two or three waters, to the end that all the fat and muddy earth may run through the holes made in the wall, and that there remain nothing but ſand. The ſand being dry, they beat it with Peſtles of Wood, that they may better perceive and diſcover the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; heretofore they made uſe of Inſtruments of Stone, but they left them ſo ſoon as ever they were perceived to cauſe flaws in the Diamonds.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56423:24"/>
At length they ſit them down all on a row upon the earth in the poſture of Taylors, and ſeek out with all acurateneſs the Stones amongſt the ſand. Whil'ſt they be at this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, ſeveral Commiſſioners ſtand up with their eyes fixed upon the Workmen, for fear leaſt when they find a Stone, they ſhould ſwallow it cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly down. When a Miner has found a big one, he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Maſter, who ſet him on work, to receive his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for it, which is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a piece of Linnen of a Crown value.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56423:25"/>3. We are now to touch upon the price of Diamonds in proportion to their weight, which is not the leaſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable article of this Chapter; and although ſome have writ copiouſly of this Subject, and ſet down what Rules ought to be obſerved, yet here I alſo preſent a very eaſie and moſt certain one in favour of the curious.</p>
            <p>Some imagine that the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Merchants who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Workmen in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Mines, are ignorant o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> theſe Rules, as alſo of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick, but without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56423:25"/>
for on the contrary they are ſo experienced therein, that having the Rules alwayes in their head, there is not the leaſt young boy of fifteen years of age who is not able to give an account on the ſudden, without Pen or Paper, of the moſt difficult queſtion that can be put to him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, as it is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to judge of the water of a Stone, and of the points and flaws that may be found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, when it is rough than when it is wrought, theſe Indians ſhew themſelves much more knowing than we, to know
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56423:26"/>
the price of any Stone what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, which they are able to tell preſently, by calculating with themſelves without Pen or Chalk, which is enough to make their ſagacity to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired; this is then the Rule they make uſe of as well as we, They take a Stone of 10 Carats, which they multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by the number of 10, the Product whereof is 100. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they conſider the Stone, whether it be clean and perfect, or if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny defect in it; if it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſay they, if we had one Stone perfect of one Carat
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56423:26"/>
onely in weight, it would be worth for example according to its perfection, from 40 to 60 Crowns: If the water of it be not good, or if there be any flaw or ice, in a Stone of one Carat of the ſame nature, it would not be worth for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample above from 10 to 30 Crowns; then they multiply again the aforeſaid product of 100, by ſo much as they judge the Carat worth, and that which is the product of this, is the price of the Stone propoſed. Let this then be the example of a perfect Stone of 10 Carats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the rate of 60 Crowns the Carat.</p>
            <p>

            <p>This an example of a Stone of 15, which may have ſome imperfection, at 20 Crowns the Carat.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:56423:27"/>The Indians have the ſame Rule, onely they tranſpoſe the multiplication; for they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply firſt of all the price of a Carat of the Stone propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the number of Carats it weighs, and the product a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the number of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Carats. Let this be the Example following.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56423:30"/>
our Money; as for the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godes</hi> there be two ſorts of them, the new and the old; the new are worth three <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi> and an half, and the old a <hi>Roupie</hi> more. In the Realm of <hi>Bengala,</hi> in the Countrey of the <hi>Raja,</hi> being they are Tributaties to the <hi>Grand Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol,</hi> Payments are made in <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies.</hi> At the two Mines that are upon the Lands of the King of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> about <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olconda,</hi> payment is made in new <hi>Pagodes,</hi> which the King gets ſtamped, becauſe although he be tributary to the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> he cauſeth his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56423:31"/>
to be coyned, a Priviledge which he hath above the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. Theſe <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godes</hi> riſe and fall according to the courſe of Trade, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Merchants do bargain with the Princes and Governors. At the Mine of <hi>Coullour</hi> or <hi>Gani,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> payment is made after the ſame manner in new <hi>Pagodes,</hi> which are valued as thoſe of the King of <hi>Viſapour;</hi> but they muſt ſometimes be bought from 1 to 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> more, the reaſon is becauſe they are of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56423:31"/>
the beſt Gold, and they will have none but ſuch. Theſe <hi>Pagodes</hi> are coyn'd by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh and Hollanders, who have had the Priviledge from the King by grant or by force, I know not; now thoſe of the Hollanders being fairer than thoſe of the Engliſh, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners love them better than the others; which is the reaſon why they are bought for more by 1 or 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> yet being the Merchants are aware of this falſe opinion they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by, and becauſe theſe people at the Mines are rude and ſavage, and that at
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56423:32"/>
the beſt the ways are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dangerous from <hi>Golconda</hi> to the Mine, they ſtay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at <hi>Golconda,</hi> where the Merchants who cauſe them to dig, have their Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and whither they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſend the Diamonds, which are to be paid for at ſuch time in old <hi>Pagodes</hi> ſtampt long ſince with the Coyn of divers Princes who reigned in the <hi>Indies</hi> before the Mahumetans took footing there. Now theſe old <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godes</hi> are worth as (I ſaid) four <hi>Roupies</hi> and an half, a <hi>Roupie</hi> more than the new; which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56423:32"/>
comes to ſix pence of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney more than a Ducat, though there be no more Gold in them than in the new ones, and weigh no more: the which might adminiſter cauſe of wonder, if we did not know the reaſon, which is this, that the <hi>Cherafs</hi> or <hi>Money-Changers,</hi> to oblige the King not to get them coyned over again, give him a great ſum yearly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they draw from thence a conſiderable benefit; for the Merchants do not receive any of theſe <hi>Pagodes,</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one of theſe <hi>Money-Changers</hi> to examine them,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56423:33"/>
ſome of them being defaced, others of low rate, others which are not weight; and there ought to be allowed a quarter <hi>per cent.</hi> for what they want. When you pay the Miners, they receive not your <hi>Pagodes,</hi> but in preſence alſo of the <hi>Changer,</hi> who certifies them of what is good or bad, and he again allows his quarter <hi>per cent.</hi> But to diſpatch the ſooner, when they would make any payment that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, as a thouſand o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> right, puts them up in a little
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56423:33"/>
Bag, with a Bill of its mark, and when you would pay the Miner, you carry them to the <hi>Cheraf,</hi> together with the Bag, and finding its mark entire, he aſſures the Miner that he hath examined the whole, and that he will be reſponſible for what is not good. Now as for <hi>Roupies,</hi> they take indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently thoſe of the <hi>Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol,</hi> and thoſe of the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> becauſe thoſe which the King cauſes to be ſtamped, are to be acccording to the <hi>Great Mogol</hi>'s Coyn, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon between them. And to ſhew you that theſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56423:34"/>
               <hi>Indians</hi> have more wit and more ſubtilty than any one would think, the <hi>Pagodes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little pieces of thick Gold, of the bigneſs onely of the nail of the little finger, and it being upon that account im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to clip them, they have the art to make little holes in them round about, from whence they may get two or three pence of the powder of Gold, after which they beat them down again handſomely, that it may not appear that any one has touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Moreover, when you buy any thing in a Village,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56423:34"/>
or when you paſs a River, if you give them a <hi>Roupy,</hi> they preſently kindle a fire, and having caſt it into it, if it cometh out white, they take it, if it cometh out black, they reſtore it to you again; for all the Coyn in the <hi>Indies</hi> is without Allay, and if any of it be brought thither out of <hi>Europe,</hi> it muſt be carried to the Mint to be new coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We muſt adde, that thoſe people are deceived, who do imagine that it ſufficeth to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Looking-Glaſſes to the Mines, or Tobacco and ſuch like Toyes, to truck them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56423:35"/>
for Diamonds; our Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers find the quite contrary, and they deſire there the beſt and faireſt Gold.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is a thing unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, that as Gold is the moſt heavy and richeſt of all Metals, ſo is the Diamond the moſt hard and moſt precious of all Stones; and it is a <hi>Vulgar Error</hi> of Ancient Authors, to believe that the Diamond may be ſoftened by the Blood of a Bull; which is contrary to the experience of Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries.</p>
            <p>To conclude, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get nothing in this Chapter,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56423:35"/>
'tis to be obſerved, That the Diamond in the Miners Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is called <hi>Iri,</hi> and in Turkiſh, Perſian, and Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, 'tis called <hi>Almas,</hi> but in all the Languages of <hi>Europe</hi> there is no other Name beſides <hi>Diamond.</hi> I come to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Stones, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Ruby and the <hi>Emerauld,</hi> which hold amongſt Jewels a very conſiderable place.</p>

Lions, Tygers, and Elephants, and in a word it is one of the pooreſt Countreys in the World.

            <p>The ſecond place of the <hi>Indies</hi> from whence they bring Stones of Colour, is in a great River of the Iſle <hi>Ceylon;</hi> they are found in the ſand at low water, three or four moneths after the rains have paſt, and the poor people are employed in ſeeking for them. The Stones which they ordinarily
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56423:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
find there are clear, more lively than thoſe of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and of a very high colour, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Topaz.</hi> As for Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats and Chryſtal they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> find a great quantity of them. At ſuch time as Don <hi>Philippo Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carini</hi> was Governour of thoſe places which the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> had in the Iſle of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> the Chief of which was <hi>Columbo,</hi> he who ſince was Vice-Roy of <hi>Goa,</hi> he cauſed all the Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables of a Chamber to be made of Chryſtal, <hi>viz.</hi> Bed, Chairs, Table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cabinet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true that in <hi>Europe</hi> there are alſo two other places
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56423:39"/>
from which they bring Stones of Colour, that is to ſay, from <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungaria;</hi> from this they bring <hi>Opales,</hi> and in the other there be <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi> which they take out of the middle of certain Flints after they be broken; theſe Flints are like to the Stones of Fire-locks inclining towards red, ſome as big as the fiſt, ſome leſs; but many of them may be broken before you find one <hi>Rubie.</hi> When the Son of the Emperour <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> 2. was crowned King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> General <hi>Walleſtein</hi> preſented the Governour of

            <p>The curious Reader will not find it tedious, to know fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from whence they fetch the <hi>Lapis</hi> and <hi>Granate,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell the reaſon why they have given the Name of <hi>Syrien</hi> to this, ſeeing it was never found in <hi>Syria,</hi> but far from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56423:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thence thirty days journey from <hi>Labor</hi> to the North Eaſt, in the Countrey of a <hi>Raja,</hi> who depends neither of the <hi>Great Mogol</hi> nor of the <hi>Tartar,</hi> in a Mountain, the Southern part whereof produceth Gold; that which reſpects the North, produces the <hi>Granat,</hi> and the Eaſt part affordeth the <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> for the <hi>Turkoiſe</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knoweth that it is found in <hi>Perſia</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Chamaquay,</hi> the chief place whereof is <hi>Maſchec,</hi> to the North of <hi>Hiſpaham,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Candahar.</hi> There are there two Mines, one they call

the <hi>Old Rock,</hi> the other the <hi>New;</hi> thoſe of the <hi>New</hi> are but of a bad blew, inclining to white, and little eſteemed, and it is free for any man to take as many of them as he pleaſeth. But the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſome years ſince forbad the digging in the <hi>Old</hi> for any beſides himſelf, becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Goldſmiths but ſuch who work in thread, and are wholly ignorant how to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel upon Gold, as people who know neither the deſign nor manner of it, they make uſe for the garniſhing of their Swords and Ponyards and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56423:41"/>
other Works of theſe Turkoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, inſtead of enamel, and cauſe them to be cut and ſet in the Bearit of Rings, according to the Flowers and other Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures that do beſt pleaſe him. This ſheweth well enough and is elaborate, but without any curious Deſign.</p>
            <p>'Tis an ancient error of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to believe that the <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld</hi> is found in the Eaſt, and becauſe before the diſcovery of the <hi>West Indies</hi> none could gueſs otherwiſe of it, ſtill to this day the greateſt part of Jewellers and Goldſmiths, ſo ſoon as ever they ſpy an <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld</hi>

of an high colour incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to black, are wont to ſay it is an <hi>Oriental Emerald;</hi> wherein they are altogether miſtaken, ſince that the <hi>Eaſt</hi> never produced any ſuch. I grant that before the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>America,</hi> the <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds</hi> were brought from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> but they came from the ſource of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> from the Realm of <hi>Peru.</hi> For theſe people before we knew them, did traffick in all the <hi>Molucco Iſlands,</hi> whither they brought Gold and Silver, yet more Silver than Gold, being that there is more profit in the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56423:42"/>
one than in the other, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Gold Mines that are found in the Eaſtern Parts. Still to this day the ſame Trade continues, and thoſe of <hi>Peru</hi> paſs yearly to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippine Iſles</hi> with two or three Veſſels, whither they bring nothing but Gold and a ſmall quantity of <hi>Emeralds;</hi> and as for the <hi>Emeralds,</hi> within this few years they have left carrying any thither, but ſend them all into <hi>Europe.</hi> In the year 1660 they afforded them in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> for more than twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi> cheaper than they were valued at in <hi>France.</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:56423:42"/>
Theſe <hi>Americans</hi> being come aſhore in the <hi>Philippines,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Bengala, Arachan, Pegu, Goa,</hi> and other places, bring thither all ſorts of Linnen and a number of Cut Stones, as Diamonds and Rubies, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with divers Works of Gold, Stuffs of Silk and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Tapeſtry.</p>
            <p>But 'tis to be obſerved, that they can ſell nothing directly to thoſe of <hi>Peru,</hi> but to ſuch who reſide in <hi>Manilla</hi> they can, and theſe again retail them to the <hi>Americans;</hi> nay if any one obtain permiſſion to return from <hi>Goa</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56423:43"/>
the way of the South Sea, he will be forc'd to put out his money to intereſt at fourſcore or an hundred <hi>per Cent.</hi> to the <hi>Philippines,</hi> without being able to buy any thing, and to do with it after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the <hi>Philippines</hi> to <hi>New Spain.</hi> Now this was the way of trafficking for <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds</hi> before the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> were found out, they came into <hi>Europe</hi> onely by this way and vaſt compaſs.

common; and I will relate to you a Story upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the <hi>Indies,</hi> a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard was in <hi>Italy,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of a Lapidary the price of an <hi>Emerald,</hi> which he ſhewed him, he conſidering it very well, and finding it a goodly one, told him it was worth a hundred Ducats: Whereupon the Spaniard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very glad, carried him to his Lodgings, and ſhewed him a Cabinet full of them. The Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, who ſaw ſo great a number of theſe <hi>Emeralds,</hi> told him that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56423:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as for thoſe they were well worth Crowns apiece. Thus it fares with all things which the abundance makes cheap, and whereto rarity adds a price. <hi>Pliny</hi> amongſt divers excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the <hi>Emerald,</hi> ſays, that there is nothing more delightful nor recreative to the ſight; and reporteth that <hi>Laelia</hi> a Roman Dame had Head-Cloaths and a Gown embroidered with <hi>Pearls</hi> and <hi>Emeralds,</hi> in which ſhe laid out to the value of Four hundred thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats. But ſhe might have had as many now-a-dayes for leſs than half the Money. Many
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56423:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are found in ſeveral places of <hi>America,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Mexico,</hi> who eſteemed them very much, were uſually wont to pierce their Noſtrils, and there to hang an excellent <hi>Emerald;</hi> they put them alſo upon the Faces of their Idols. The places where they have found them, and where ſtill to this day they find the great. abundance, is the New King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> near to <hi>Manta</hi> and <hi>Portviel,</hi> there is towards that place a Territory called, <hi>The Land of Emeralds,</hi> by reaſon of the great number known to be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56423:46"/>
found there; but hitherto this Region has not been fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Emerald</hi> is bred in Quarries, juſt as the <hi>Chryſtal,</hi> and runs along, as it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Vein, and grows finer and finer, or thicker and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by degrees.</p>
            <p>We ſee ſome half white and half green, ſome all white, ſome quite green and moſt perfect; ſome we may ſee of the bigneſs of a Nut and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet none come near the bigneſs and figure of the Plate or Jewel which is at <hi>Genoua,</hi> unleſs we believe <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56423:47"/>
who allows four Ells in length and three in breadth to the <hi>Emerald,</hi> which the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> preſented to the King of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> And who doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther report that there was in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guglia</hi> Needle or Pyramid, made of four Stones of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merald,</hi> forty Cubits long, and in ſome places four Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits broad; and that at his time there was at <hi>Tyre</hi> in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Hercules</hi> a great Pillar of <hi>Emerald,</hi> perhaps it was nothing elſe but a Green Stone that was a Baſtard <hi>Emerald,</hi> to which they gave this Name
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56423:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
falſly: As ſome ſay that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pillars of the Cathedral Church of <hi>Cordoua</hi> are of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merald</hi> Stones, and were put there ſince the time it ſerved inſtead of a Mosk to the Kings of the Moors, who reigned in thoſe places. In the Fleet which came from the the <hi>Indies</hi> in the year 1587, there were two great Cheſts of <hi>Emeralds,</hi> from whence we may judge of the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity which is found in <hi>America.</hi> In a word, as there is nothing but the rarity that gives value to things, ſo the price of the <hi>Emerald</hi> would be much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56423:48"/>

the moſt Celeſtial Vertues and Qualities which Phyſick was ever able to boaſt of, and whereof ſhe makes uſe for a Sovereign Remedy: yet for all that all the World does not agree as to this with the Ancient Naturaliſts, and the ſequel of this Diſcourſe will make appear that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſome things.</p>
            <p>But before we ſpeak of the manner how they fiſh for <hi>Pearl</hi> and of their different Qualities, we muſt make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the divers places of the World where they are found.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:56423:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>Firſt of all then they have diſcovered four Fiſhing Places for <hi>Pearl</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the moſt conſiderable is performed in the Iſle of <hi>Bahren</hi> in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Golph;</hi> the which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the Sophy of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who receives thence a great Revenue. While the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals were Maſters of <hi>Ormus</hi> and <hi>Maſcati,</hi> every Veſſel which went to fiſh was obliged to take a Paſsport from them at a dear rate; and they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained alwayes five or ſix ſmall Galleys in the Gulph, to ſink thoſe Barks which took no Paſports; but at preſent they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56423:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have no farther power upon thoſe Coaſts, and each Fiſher payeth to the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> not above one third of what they gave to the Portugals.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Fiſhing is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt <hi>Bahren</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>Arabia Foelix,</hi> near to the City of <hi>Catif,</hi> which belongeth to an Arabian Prince who commandeth that Province. The moſt part of the <hi>Pearls</hi> which are fiſhed in theſe two places, are carried into <hi>India,</hi> becauſe that the Indians are not ſo hard, but give a better price for them than we; they are therefore
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56423:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
carried thither, the unequal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as the round, the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as well as the white; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one according to its rate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome of them alſo are ſold at <hi>Balſora,</hi> and thoſe which are tranſported into <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> are ſold at <hi>Bandar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congue</hi> two dayes journey from <hi>Ormus.</hi> They fiſh twice in a year in the Moneths of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> and in the Moneths of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September;</hi> the depth where they fiſh is from four to twelve fathoms, and the deeper the Oiſter is found, the <hi>Pearls</hi> are the whiter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the water is not ſo hot
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56423:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there, the Sun not being able to penetrate ſo deep.</p>
            <p>The third fiſhing is by the Iſle of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> at a place which is called <hi>Manar;</hi> the <hi>Pearls</hi> which are found there, are of a good water but ſmall, and the greateſt do not ſurpaſs two Carrats, and it is ſeldom that they are found of that weight, but in recompence of this there is great quantity of Seed Pearl fit to powder.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Fiſhing in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> is at <hi>Japan;</hi> the <hi>Pearls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> there are of a water white enough and heavy, but unequal: thoſe of <hi>Japan</hi> ſell

them all to the <hi>Holland</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for they make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as I ſhall let you know in order, of any Jewel.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>West</hi> are diſcovered five <hi>Pearl</hi> Fiſhings, the firſt is in the Iſland <hi>Margarita</hi> two and twenty leagues from the firm land; this Iſle is thirty five leagues about and hath a good Haven towards the North; at the Eaſt point it is all encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with rocks: it is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough, but there is want of water: and the inhabitants go up into the Countrey to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves with it, yet there are great ſtore of Cattel,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56423:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and it beareth Maize and other things neceſſary for thoſe who live there.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Fiſhing was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the year 1496, by the Iſle of <hi>Cubagua,</hi> a league from the former, in the <hi>Gulph</hi> of <hi>Mexico;</hi> it is in ten degrees and an half of Northern Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, an hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Leagues from St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo</hi> in <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and an hundred from <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> one of the <hi>Careeby Iſlands,</hi> and four Leagues from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Aria,</hi> which is part of the Continent; it is much leſs than <hi>Margarita,</hi> without
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56423:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Cattel or any other thing which may ſerve for the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man; particularly it wanteth water, but the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are furniſhed from the Continent, from a River cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Comana,</hi> ſeven Leagues from <hi>New Cadis.</hi> This Iſland <hi>Cubagua</hi> was diſcovered by that famous Genoueſe <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Columbus,</hi> who having perceived a ſmall Boat with ſome Fiſhers in it, and a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had three rows of fair <hi>Pearl</hi> about her Neck, ſaid to his Companions, That he thanked God he had now diſcovered the moſt rich
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56423:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Countrey in the World. He broke an Earthen Plate of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Colours, and for a piece or two of it this Woman gave him very willingly a row of theſe <hi>Pearls,</hi> and for another Plate he received many others, and I darned of the <hi>Indians</hi> the place and manner of their Fiſhing for <hi>Pearls.</hi>

            <p>The third is at <hi>Comana,</hi> near the Continent.</p>
            <p>The fourth is called <hi>Coma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagote,</hi> twelve Leagues from the former.</p>
            <p>The fifth and laſt is at the Iſle of St. <hi>Martha,</hi> threeſcore Leagues from the River <hi>La Hache<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56423:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>All the <hi>Pearls</hi> of theſe five Fiſhings are of a white wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, weak, dry, faint, milky, or leady; not but that they find ſome fair ones, but they have not ſo live a water as thoſe of the <hi>East;</hi> in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence they are great ones, in weight from eighteen to forty two Carrats, and are almoſt all of the ſhape of a Pear.</p>
            <p>Theſe Five Fiſhings of which I have ſpoken, are all in the <hi>North Sea,</hi> but they find alſo great quantities in the <hi>South Sea</hi> near to <hi>Panama,</hi> they are long rather than round, but not ſo fair as the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56423:54"/>
other, and ordinarily are ſomewhat black; for the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> opened the Oyſter by Fire, till <hi>Vaſques Nugnez</hi> taught the Cacique to open them without it; and ſince they find the <hi>Pearls</hi> whiter. Experience teacheth us that Oyſters change their places as well as other Fiſh, and that they paſs ſometimes to one ſide of the Iſland and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the other.</p>
            <p>It is is a conſiderable curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to know how they fiſh for <hi>Pearls,</hi> ſeven, eight, or nine men at moſt go in one Bark, two of which deſcend to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56423:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bottom of the Sea, ſix, nine, or twelve fathoms doep. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Iſles of <hi>Margarita</hi> and <hi>Cubagua,</hi> the water is very cold, but the greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in fiſhing, is holding the breath under water, ſometimes a quarter of an hour or long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and that theſe poor Slaves may the better endure it, they feed them with dry meats and in a little quantity, avarice putting them upon theſe abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences; but beſides this, they uſe other expedients, they put upon their Noſe little Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers made of Buffalo's Horn, which ſtoppeth their Noſtrils:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56423:55"/>
they ſtuffe their Ears with Cotton Wool. Others hold Oil in their Mouths, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who cannot hold their breath long. Others hold their Mouth under their Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and after that manner breath two or three times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water. There is a Sack of Stones or Sand tied to each of their Feet, to make them ſink ſtrait to the bottom, and another Bag tied about their Waſte, to put their Oyſters in; there is a Cord faſtened under their Arm-pits, held by them who remain in the Boat, and they under water hold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56423:55"/>
Cord in their hands, which they draw, to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to thoſe in the Boat, that they can now hold their breath no longer, and that they muſt draw them up quickly.</p>
            <p>When they have found a thouſand or two of theſe Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they ſell them at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, without knowing what is within them, the Meat of the Oyſter is without reliſh, and of very ill digeſtion; and is ſo far from being ſo good to eat as the meat of our Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> that the very Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men diſdain them, and ſeldom
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56423:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eat any of them. <hi>Acoſta</hi> in the Fourth Book of his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, glorieth that he had eat of theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Oyſters; and found <hi>Pearls</hi> in the middle of them. When the night cometh, the Fiſhermen retire to the Iſland, and carry the Oyſters home to him who employeth them. Upon the opening they find in ſome none, in others from one to ſix <hi>Pearls</hi> more or leſs, and in ſome great number of grains, which we call Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearl. Theſe Oyſter-ſhels are within of a lively colour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an Azure, they make Spoons of them and other
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56423:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Toys, ſuch as we call <hi>Mother of Pearl.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pearls</hi> are of very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent forms, bigneſs, figure, colour, and poliſh, and differ alſo much in their price.</p>
            <p>It was an error of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, as of <hi>Iſidorus</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Magnus,</hi> to believe that the <hi>Pearl</hi> was bred by the dew of heaven, ſeeing that they are fiſhed out of the Sea ſo deep, as twelve fathoms; as alſo to think that there is but one found in an Oyſter, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in ſome there are five or ſix, in which <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeth with them, while he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56423:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
relateth what <hi>Aelius Stilo</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; how that in the war of <hi>Jugurtha</hi> they gave the Name of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niones</hi> to all great <hi>Pearls;</hi> and that he had ſeen four or five in one Oyſter. It is true, that ſeldom two of the ſame form, greatneſs, and colour, are found in the ſame Oyſter; and for this reaſon, as the ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, the Romans called them <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niones.</hi> When it happeneth that two are found which reſemble one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other perfectly, it encreaſeth their price very much; and it may be thoſe two famous ones of the Queen <hi>Cleopatra</hi> were
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56423:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this ſort; each of which were valued at an hundred thouſand Ducats: with one of theſe that prodigal Princeſſe won the wager ſhe laid with <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> that ſhe would ſpend above an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ducats at one Supper; ſhe diſſolved it in Vinegar and drank it off at the latter end of Supper; the other was cut into two pieces and carried to <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the Statua of <hi>Venus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pearls</hi> of thoſe Oyſters which ſtick to the Rocks, are greater than thoſe which are in the Sand or Mudde; and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56423:58"/>
thoſe which are found in the Mudde incline ſomewhat to a dark colour; for the reſt, as the <hi>Pearl</hi> ſeemeth to depend on the air as well as the water, if in that time when the Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter breedeth the <hi>Pearl,</hi> the air be cloudy, it inclineth to be black; if the sky be clear, it is the whiter. The <hi>Pearls</hi> grow by little and little in an Oyſter, as the Eggs in a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, ſo that the greateſt come forward towards the orifice or opening, while the ſmall ones remain at the bottom, until they are brought to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And laſtly, the <hi>Pearls</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:56423:58"/>
grow old and wrinkled, and by conſequence become leſs beautiful, by loſing of their luſtre.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of CORALL.</head>
            <p>ALthough that <hi>Corall</hi> and <hi>Yellow Amber</hi> are not ranked amongſt <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi> yet they very well deſerve a place in this Hiſtory, becauſe both of them have ſomething admirable in them, and ſerve for Ornament, nay ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have the ſame eſteem for theſe as we have for <hi>Pearls</hi> and <hi>Diamonds.</hi> There will then be three things to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this Chapter, the Places
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56423:60"/>
where they fiſh for the <hi>Coral,</hi> the manner how they fiſh, and the Countreys where it is ſold at the beſt rates.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There are three Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for <hi>Coral</hi> upon the Coaſts of <hi>Corſica</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> one called <hi>Argueil,</hi> which is the beſt and faireſt; the ſecond called <hi>Baza,</hi> the third is near to the Iſland of <hi>St. Peter.</hi> That which groweth upon the Coaſt of <hi>Corſica</hi> is of the faireſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and longeſt. Upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africa</hi> there are two other Fiſhings, that near to the Baſtion of <hi>France</hi> and that of <hi>Tabarca.</hi> The <hi>Coral</hi> of this is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56423:61"/>
big enough and long, but of a pale colour. There is another Fiſhing upon the Coaſt of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> near to <hi>Drepanum,</hi> the <hi>Coral</hi> of which is ſmall, but of a very good colour. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other on the Coaſt of <hi>Catania,</hi> by Cape <hi>Quiers,</hi> where the <hi>Coral</hi> is thick and of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent colour, but the Branches are very ſhort. There is alſo another Fiſhing in the Iſle of <hi>Majorca,</hi> where the <hi>Coral</hi> is of the ſame nature with that of <hi>Corſica,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Coral,</hi> if not onely, is chiefly found in the <hi>Mediterranean Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:56423:61"/>Let us now come to the manner of Fiſhing for it: The <hi>Coral</hi> groweth under hollow Rocks, at the foot of which the Sea is deep, ſo that the Fiſhers proceed thus: They faſten croſs-wiſe two great Pieces of Timber, and place a great Piece of Lead in the middle, to make them ſink; afterwards they tie Hemp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Timber, and wreath it about negligently to the thickneſs of an Inch; they tie to the Wood two Ropes, one hangeth at the Prow and the other at the Poop of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; and ſo as they run along
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56423:62"/>
by the Rocks, they let go the Wood, and the Hemp wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf about the <hi>Coral.</hi> There is need many times of fifteen or twenty Boats to draw up the Pieces of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but by plucking up the <hi>Coral</hi> thus by force, there falleth as much into the Sea as can be drawn out; and the bottom being ordinarily of Ouſe or Mudde, the <hi>Coral</hi> is corroded continually, as if it were worm-eaten; ſo that the ſooner it is drawn up, the leſs waſte is made of it: ſome think <hi>Coral</hi> to be ſoft under water, though it be really
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56423:62"/>
hard; yet true it is that at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moneths of the year there is drawn from the end of the branch by preſſing it, a kind of Milk, like that out of a Womans Breaſt, which may very well be the ſeed of the Coral, the which falling upon ſomething or other in the Sea, accidentally produceth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther branch of <hi>Coral,</hi> as it hath been really found upon a Skull and upon the Blade of a Sword.</p>
            <p>The Fiſhing of <hi>Coral</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from the beginning of <hi>April</hi> to the end of <hi>July,</hi> and commonly two hundred Barks
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56423:63"/>
and upwards are employed to that effect, ſeven men and a boy in each. They are built all along the Coaſt of <hi>Genoa,</hi> are very light, and bear ſo great ſail, that no Men of War can bear up with them; and it is by this means they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the Corſairs. The Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is performed forty miles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Shore, over againſt certain Capes that jet out; where they preſume there is Rocks under water. There was lately to be ſeen at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> in a Shop where they deal in <hi>Coral,</hi> a piece of the bigneſs of ones Fiſt, which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56423:63"/>
they cut in two, becauſe it was ſomewhat worm-eaten, and there was found within it a Worm which ſtirred, and lived ſome moneths, being put again into its hole. 'Tis obſervable that round about ſome branches of <hi>Coral</hi> there is bred as it were a Sponge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling Cells, wherein there lie ſmall Worms like Bees, ſo much Nature pleaſes her ſelf in the diverſity of her producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>We muſt finiſh this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a pretty curious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Thoſe of <hi>Japan</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all the reſt of the World,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56423:64"/>
make no account of Pearls or Precious Stones, and all their Jewels conſiſt in a grain of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> Now as they carry by their ſides a great Bag, ſuch as our Mechanicks wear, ſo is he the beſt man, that hath the biggeſt grain of <hi>Coral</hi> to ſlip in his Purſe String of Silk; and to him who can bring them one of the bigneſs of an Egge, they will not onely give a thouſand Crowns, but fifteen or twenty thouſand, or whatſoever he ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

            <p>
               <hi>YEllow</hi> and <hi>White Amber</hi> are found no where in abundance, but only upon
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56423:65"/>
the Banks of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> the Sea throwing it up time after time at certain Winds. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> lets out all theſe Coaſts, and the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers do there maintain Guards, who lie all along the Coaſt, to the end none may take it away, which is very Criminal; the Sea caſts up the <hi>Amber</hi> ſometimes on one ſide ſometimes on the other.</p>
            <p>As I have made an Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Coral,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Japan,</hi> ſo I muſt make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Amber</hi> in reſpect of <hi>China.</hi> When any great Lord makes a conſiderable Feaſt,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56423:65"/>
to ſhew his magnificence and ſplendour, at the cloſe of the Feaſt they bring into the Hall three or four Perfuming Pots, upon which they throw a large quantity of <hi>Amber,</hi> ſometimes to the value of a thouſand Crowns and upwards; ſeeing the more there is burnt of it, ſo much the greater ſplendor it adds to him who treats. Beſides they make uſe of it after this manner, becauſe <hi>Amber</hi> thrown into the Fire, giveth a certain Smell which is not unpleaſant, and becauſe the Flame excels all other Flames. Hence it is that <hi>Amber</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:56423:66"/>
is one of the beſt Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that one can bring into <hi>China,</hi> and whereof the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Company does reſerve to themſelves the particular Commerce, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to buy of them in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of Metals, Amber-gris, Bezoar, Indico, and other rich Productions of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ALthough nothing that appears in this Title may come into the Liſt of Jewels, any more than <hi>Yellow Amber</hi> or <hi>Coral;</hi> yet I may touch upon them as things the moſt precious which we receive from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>West.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Metals are like Plants hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Bowels of the Earth,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56423:67"/>
and there is ſome reſemblance between them in the manner of their production. Minerals. have branches and a trunck from whence they grow, and great and ſmall Veins, which are bound together, and do ſeem to imitate Vegetables. Theſe Minerals are produced by the vertue and force of the Sun and the other Planets, and in a long ſpace of time are increaſed and multiplied in theſe obſcure Caverns; but there is this difference in the Earth which brings forth Plants, and that which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Minerals, that this is fat
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56423:67"/>
and fertile, for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that which it ſendeth forth; but on the contrary the other is rude and barren, like the matter which it generates within. Metals were created for the uſe of Phyſick, for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture, and for the Defence and Ornament of Man, not to ſpeak of the Species of Gold and Silver, ſo neceſſary to the entertaining of Society and Commerce: Upon which one underſtanding enough ſaid, <hi>That as a Father giveth a great Portion to his Daughter, by that means to provide her a more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Match, ſo God hath</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:56423:68"/>
               <hi>given to the Earth great riches in Mines, to the end that Men might enquire into her with the greater care. Iron, Lead, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Tinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> are found in ſo many places of the Earth, that the <hi>Americans,</hi> who have divers Mines of them, neglect to dig them; I will not give theſe therefore any place in this diſcourſe, and will content my ſelf to ſay onely this, that there is great quantity of <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> in <hi>Sweden,</hi> that the beſt <hi>Tinne</hi> is brought out of <hi>Cornwal</hi> in the Weſt of <hi>England;</hi> and that the <hi>Peruvians</hi> make uſe of no other <hi>Lead, Iron,</hi> or <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:56423:68"/>
but what is brought them out of <hi>Europe,</hi> although they have Mines of their own. I will ſpeak therefore onely of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> which are the moſt pretious of all Metals, and of <hi>Quickſilver,</hi> which ſerveth to refine them both. <hi>Gold</hi> is the richeſt of all Metals, the heavieſt and moſt malleable, that is to ſay, that ſuffers it ſelf to be extended the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hammer, and from all time Men have ſought and loved the enjoyment of it. It is found in <hi>Aſia</hi> in the Sand of divers Rivers, and for this <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> and <hi>Pactolus</hi> have been
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56423:69"/>
rendred famous in Hiſtory; and not to ſpeak of <hi>Tagus</hi> and other Rivers of <hi>Europe,</hi> which carry <hi>Gold;</hi> the <hi>Arva,</hi> which falleth from the Mountains of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and joyneth with the <hi>Rhone</hi> near <hi>Geneva,</hi> furniſheth <hi>Gold</hi> enough to recompence the pains of thoſe who ſearch for it; but the abundance of <hi>Gold</hi> is found in Mines, and theſe Mines are not every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, we have diſcovered but few in <hi>Europe; Scotland</hi> hath ſome, and <hi>Sileſia</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia,</hi> but they do not very much enrich their Maſters: let us conſider therefore the Mines
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56423:69"/>
of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> and particularly of the Iſle of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra,</hi> which the Ancients cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Cherſoneſus</hi> of <hi>Gold.</hi> We may mention alſo the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Mines of <hi>Potoſi,</hi> which celebrate <hi>Peru</hi> above all the Regions of the Earth, and where ſo many Slaves are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; for the Mines of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there are divers of them in <hi>Europe,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Saxony;</hi> there are of them alſo in <hi>Aſia,</hi> but the Mines which are the moſt famous of all are in a Mountain of <hi>Peru,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the <hi>Ynca</hi>'s before the arrival of the Spaniards. This
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56423:70"/>
Mine is ſo rich, that the Mine which <hi>Hannibal</hi> found in the <hi>Pyrenaean Hills,</hi> out of which, as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, every day was drawn three hundred pounds of Silver, cannot be compared to it; the deſcription of this at large is to be ſeen in <hi>Joſephus Acoſta</hi> his <hi>Natural Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Indies;</hi> and for the manner of refining Metals, ſo many have written, that I may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from deſcribing it: there reſteth therefore no more but <hi>Quickſilver,</hi> which is found in a certain Vermillion Stone, great quantity of it cometh from the Mountain of <hi>Guan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavilca,</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:56423:70"/>
near to the City of <hi>Guamagua</hi> in <hi>Peru;</hi> out of which they draw every year eight thouſand Quintals of <hi>Quickſilver;</hi> there are alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Mines of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> but the Inhabitants neglect to work them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelves with thoſe which they have in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amber-gris</hi> is a Medicinal Liquor, full as odoriferous as the true Balme, but thicker na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and is brought into a Paſte of a hot and good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume, which may be applied to wounds; it cometh not onely out of the <hi>East-Indies</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:56423:71"/>
but <hi>New Spain</hi> doth alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, and the Sea caſteth it up upon the Coaſt of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bezoar</hi> that famous Stone ſo well known in Phyſick, is found five dayes journey from <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda,</hi> towards the Eaſt of <hi>Summer</hi> in the Province of <hi>Renquery,</hi> and is ingendred in the Paunch of Goats, ſome of which have twelve Stones in them. The Inhabitants of the Countrey eaſily know how many Stones the Goat hath in his body by this means, they ſtroak the belly of the Goat with their hands and rub it, till
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56423:71"/>
the <hi>Bezoars</hi> come all to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Paunch, and then they may be felt and counted like little Stones in a Bag. They ſell them by weight, the bigger the Stone the dearer. In the year 1660 there were ſold of them to the value of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Francks, and the greateſt part fell to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh; there come alſo <hi>Bezoar Stones</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>Macaſſar</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Celebes,</hi> at five degrees of Southern La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, near the <hi>Molucka</hi>'s, but they are found in the bodies of Apes, and are not ſo large as thoſe of <hi>Golconda.</hi>

               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:56423:72"/>
               <hi>Indico,</hi> which is made uſe of for the moſt rich Colours, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from a Tree which is planted every year after the rains are paſſed, and when it is grown to the height of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two and three foot, they cut it at half a foot from the ground, and then take that which is cut and put it into great Pits with Lime, which becometh ſo hard, that the Pits ſeem to be but one piece of Marble. Theſe Pits are ordinarily about fourſcore Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about, they fill them half or a little more with water, and then continue to fill them with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56423:72"/>
the green of this Tree, and every day ſtir the whole till it ſettleth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh like to mudde or clay, or clay mixed with water; afterwards they let the whole ſtand for ſome dayes, and then let out the water of the Pits. When all the water is out, they take the mudde or ſettlement in their hands, and having ſteeped it in Oil, they form great or ſmall pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to their fancy, and drie them in the Sun. To deceive the Merchant, they ſet them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to dry upon the ſand, that ſo the ſand ſticking to them, they may weigh the heavier; but they pay well for it, when this deceit cometh to the knowledge of the Governour. This Tree is cut three times, but the oftner it is cut the <hi>Indico</hi> becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of leſs value, and there is more than twenty in the hundred diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the price, the latter giving
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56423:73"/>
not ſo much colour as the firſt. The beſt <hi>Indico</hi> cometh from <hi>Biana,</hi> from <hi>Indoua,</hi> and from <hi>Corſa,</hi> three Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages at a day or a day and halfs jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Agra,</hi> and it is that which is made up into Balls. Eight dayes journey from <hi>Surat</hi> and two leagues from <hi>Amadabat,</hi> there is a Village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sarqueſse,</hi> from whence the flat <hi>dico</hi> cometh; there groweth alſo <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico</hi> of the ſame nature with the laſt, and near the ſame price, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Golconda:</hi> it is alſo brought out of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> from the Iſles of <hi>Antilles,</hi> where they make it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much after the ſame manner as in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saltpeter</hi> cometh in great quantity from <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Patena,</hi> from whence it is brought twenty dayes journey down the <hi>Ganges,</hi> to a place where the Engliſh and Holland Merchants come to lade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:56423:73"/>Great quantity of <hi>Silk</hi> cometh from <hi>Bengala</hi> and thereabouts, which is the beſt Countrey of <hi>India,</hi> there cometh alſo great abundance from the Province of <hi>Gillon</hi> or ancient <hi>Hircania</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and from <hi>Sicily.</hi>

               <hi>Gumme Lacca</hi> is brought from the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala,</hi> but the beſt cometh out of <hi>Pegu.</hi> A ſort of Ants carry this Gumme and faſten it about wild Shrubs, from whence is made great quantity of Wax.</p>
