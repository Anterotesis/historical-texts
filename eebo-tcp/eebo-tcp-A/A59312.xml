            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SCriblers of my Profeſſion, pay ſo natural a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to Greatneſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that the leaſt dawn of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation from an Eminent Perſonage, fires 'em with a more than ordinary Aſſurance, and is Armour ſufficient againſt the Cenſure of the World. This, my Lord, has enboldened me to that height, that I can confidently ſcorn the malicious Critick on the one ſide, and the revenging Jeſuit on the other: for what blinded Bigot will dare ſhew his miſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when your Lordſhip's Name (the greateſt Charm againſt all their Sorceries) appears to own me? Your Lorſhip's Name, which muſt bloſſom on the Records of our lateſt Poſterity. It would be needleſs in me, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how well your Lordſhip has deſerved in <hi>England</hi>; it is a Theam, of which the moſt ignorant of the <hi>Orcades</hi> are full, and which the moſt envious of the Court muſt acknowledge. <hi>England,</hi> in its greateſt Exigence, has
<pb facs="tcp:93107:3"/>
found your Lordſhip its faſteſt Friend, and at that time too when honeſt actions were perform'd in danger, when the ſword of <hi>Damocles</hi> hung over the heads of the moſt zealous Proteſtants. But 'tis not enough that the world acknowledges your Lordſhip the greateſt of States-men, unleſs it does your Merit that juſtice, to own you the bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and the loyalleſt too: for State-policy is of that comprehenſive quality, and includes ſuch Motions of that ſtrangely-diſtant Latitude, that I can onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to the Poets God of Fire; it either refines the Oar, and mints the very Gold that adorns the ſhining Palaces of Kings, or forges out the Thunder that deſtroys 'em. Nay, too often that very Policy that has the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt face of Allegiance, whoſe Counſels ſhould be a Guide and Light to Majeſty, (for without derogation to the Divinity of a Crown, Kings are ſometimes but Men) is but the meer Exhalation of Greatneſs, a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour which the Breath of Soveraignty raiſes higher or lower, whilſt (like the Cloud that either rains, hails, or ſnows) it either cools or warms but with the Air it meets with. And thus the States-man that ſhould be the Counſellour, is but the Eccho of Power, rather the Miniſter of his Prince's Pleaſure than Glory; and ſo little executes the great Office he undertakes, that he is ſcarce the ſhadow of what he repreſents. But all ſuch flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mercenary ſervice, your Lordſhip's braver Soul abhors, whilſt your undaunted Councels are unſhockt by Frowns, and unbribed by Honours. Our <hi>England</hi> has in one circumſtance the fate of <hi>Troy</hi>; our Eſtabliſht Religion is our true <hi>Palladium</hi>; and whilſt that is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we are invincible, unhurt by all the Hoſtility of the
<pb facs="tcp:93107:3"/>
world; but that once gone, our ruin'd <hi>Troynovant</hi> is but an univerſal Conflagration: and he that like your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip moſt ſtudies to ſecure that <hi>Palladium,</hi> maintains the brighteſt Jewel in his Princes Crown, and is both his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign's beſt Subject, and his Countries trueſt and faithfulleſt Champion.</p>
            <p>Thus whilſt there is that Party for whoſe Defeat your Lordſhip has ſo ſtrenuouſly and ſo juſtly labour'd, you have onely acted as an Engliſh Patriot: Your unfathom'd Depths foreſaw the dangerous Faction, no leſs threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than a growing <hi>Phaeton</hi>; and in your Lordſhips vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and indefatigable oppoſition, your very Enemies, if they will take leiſure to think, muſt with ſhame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your Memorable and Loyal Councels have with a plain and unclouded Aſpect ſo much tended to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and eternal preſervation of Peace, that all men of ſenſe muſt plainly ſee you would rather ſide with a counſelling <hi>Phoebus,</hi> than a deſtroying <hi>Jupiter</hi>; would rather by your timely advice prevent the Combuſtion of a world, than call down Thunder too late to puniſh the Incendiaries.</p>
            <p>Thus your Lordſhip's unwearied Service to your King and Country, muſt undoubtedly ſpring from an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Principle of Loyalty: and as no little Argument for it, If Loyalty were ever truely generous, 'tis in your Lordſhip; for with the Philoſophers deſcription of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, 'tis alone its own Reward.</p>
            <p>And now I cannot but reflect on your Lordſhips numerous Enemies, nor better rank 'em than under theſe three Files.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93107:4"/>The firſt, the Romiſh Zealot, a certain kind of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Devote, to whom the very Fundamentals of his Religion are as unintelligible as the Language his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are in. 'Tis true, <hi>Rome</hi> has a wiſer ſort of Diſciples, of which is the perſon of Senſe and Quality; but then conſidering ten to one his Anceſtors were all of his opinion, he thinks it inconſiſtent with his glory either to examine or alter his Faith on any Terms, leſt in ſo doing he ſhould in effect call his Forefathers all Fools, and give his whole Generation the Lye. And thus by a certain kind of wilde Iriſh Honour, who draw with their Horſes tails for the reputation of their Grand-ſires; their infatuated Zeal is entayled upon 'em, and they hold their Titles by no other Tenure.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort is the ambitious Libertine, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſides with the Riſing Party; who tho indeed he is of no Faith at all, yet appears as zealous for a Religion of Quality, as a Spaniſh Jew at Maſs, and rather than ſtand out when his Intereſt is at ſtake, would e'en turn Mahometan, and almoſt circumciſe to be Great.</p>
            <p>The laſt Claſs is a ſort of People of neither Birth, Principles, nor Eſtates; a kind of indigent Bullies, who in all Companies run down Religion and Property, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have neither Conſcience nor Lands to loſe; and therefore are for Change at any Rate, and deſire Tumults onely to ſcramble for Bread.</p>
            <p>If theſe are your Lordſhips Enemies, I will not be ſo
<pb facs="tcp:93107:4"/>
impertinent as to tell the world who are your Friends: But to excuſe all the Diſcouragements you meet, if your Lordſhip's Truth and Deſert are not always proſperous, 'tis onely where your Oracles have had the fate of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying <hi>Caſſandra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, encouraged or depreſs'd, your Lordſhip preſerves an equal Serenity of Minde; and whereas the Malice of your Adverſaries would caſt an Aſperſion on your glorious Toyls, by ſaying your Zeal's too violent; your Lordſhip may juſtly make this Anſwer, That your Vehemence, like the fire in the Flint, never ſparkled till it was ſtruck from you, and that too by the ſevereſt Stroke, that all good men ſhould moſt ſenſibly feel, your Countries imminent Danger. Nor is your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Scrutiny into Reaſons, Policies, Men, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the whole Fatigue of your Soul; for to draw the true portraict of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> he is a perfect Character between the reſtleſs <hi>Alexander</hi> and the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len <hi>Diogenes</hi>; you want the head-long Ambition of the firſt, and the Moroſeneſs of the laſt; and between 'em both, at once you ſtudy and enjoy the world.</p>
            <p>And if amidſt your more ſerious Affairs, ſo mean a Trifle as a Play may intrude under your Lordſhip's Roof, this, of all Poems, may moſt preſume; for 'tis your Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and owes its very being to your Lordſhip: for as Plays and Poetry ſhould make the diſcountenancing of the greateſt Vices their chiefeſt Theme, 'tis your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's unmasking of <hi>Rome</hi> that gave me the Light to chuſe my Story: And 'tis by your Lordſhip's influence
<pb facs="tcp:93107:5"/>
too that it now appears in publick: for had not your Lordſhip been an Engliſh <hi>Cicero,</hi> and by your timely Wiſdom and Eloquence ſtood up in your Countries Deliverance, by this time perhaps our <hi>Catalines</hi> had been victorious; and then the melancholy Muſes muſt have cryed,
<q>Inter Arma ſilent Artes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Or if at laſt the Theatre had e're revived again, this prophane Heretical Play muſt never have dared to have looked Light i'th' face.</p>
            <p>But if any of my Critical Readers ſhould tell me that I have laid more to the charge of my Petticoat-Pope than Story will warrant; if ſuch an Objection be, I have onely this way to make my Excuſe, and rectifie my Miſtake; that is, by begging her Succeſſors to ſhare it amongſt 'em: for there have been Birds enough of that Feather through all Ages, to challenge all the borrow'd Plumes I have given her, were they ten times as many as they are.</p>
            <p>But now, as I am a Stranger to your Lordſhip, ſhould your Lordſhip ask who this bold Preſumer is that lays this Poem at your feet; I am a Thing ſo nameleſs, and ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that I can onely deſcribe my ſelf by Negatives. And firſt, I am no Temporizer, as your Lordſhip may believe by the choice of my Subject: next, I am no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician; for that Scribler muſt have no proſpect to his Intereſt, who dares affront ſo numerous a Party that are
<pb facs="tcp:93107:5"/>
ſo powerful a Support of the Stage: and laſtly, I am no Hypocrite; for I write as I think: nor am I like <hi>Clod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate</hi>'s Fidler, that ſings againſt his Conſcience.</p>
            <p>I believe this plain dealing may have gain'd me a great many Enemies; but I cannot be concern'd at their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, ſince it gives me the glory of publiſhing my ſelf,</p>
