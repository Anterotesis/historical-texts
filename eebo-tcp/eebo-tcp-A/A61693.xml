            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A <hi>Word</hi> to the <hi>Well-Inclin'd</hi> OF ALL PERSWASIONS. Together with A Coppy of a Letter from <hi>William Penn</hi> to <hi>George Keith,</hi> upon his Arbitrary Summons and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Proceedings, at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> against the People Called <hi>Quakers.</hi>

            <div type="text">
               <opener>THis following Paper is intended for an Answer to <hi>George Keith</hi>'s Notice of another Meeting at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> the 21. of the Month call'd <hi>April,</hi> 1698.</opener>
               <p>We hope that the Wise and Judicious of all Perswasions, will both Approve our past Absence from such sort of Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and our not Bowing to the like Proceedings, since their Tendency being rather to <hi>Prophane</hi> than to Promote <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which ought to be the Chief End of all Truly Religious Assemblies: Which being said, as an <hi>Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to them that Read this Paper, we now apply our selves to you chiefly, that frequent <hi>Turners-Hall</hi> on these Occasions; since 'tis for your Sakes that we are Concern'd, to take this Publick Notice of what is done there; that it may appear to you, and such as may yet have a better Opinion of <hi>G. K.</hi> than he deserves, that we are in the Right, not to gratifie him in complying with such Publick Meetings of <hi>Strife</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62154:2"/>
                  <hi>Confusion.</hi> And we must tell you freely, if you have any Just and Serious Regard for the Honour of Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, we cannot see how you can do less than <hi>Discourage</hi> them, instead of Censuring us for declining them, and that for these Reasons following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That such Meetings are rarely to Edification, when even That is intended: But these are manifestly for <hi>Abuse,</hi> and to stir up <hi>Levity</hi> and <hi>Prejudice</hi> against us; and look more like a <hi>Bartholomew-Fair,</hi> or Stages of <hi>Buffoonry,</hi> than Religious Assemblies; and as such, are understood and disown'd by Impartial and Sober People.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is at the Instigation of a Man, who hath, of late, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out Revilings and Threatnings against us, since his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from his Ancient Principles, Practice, and Society, and is now become, not only Ungrateful, but <hi>Rude</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,</hi> as we have manifested in our Printed Answers to him, Unanswered by him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He began with <hi>Printing,</hi> and there we have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from step to step hitherto, leaving nothing material Unanswered, which we take to be the fairer, more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, and edyfying Method.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He is a <hi>Stray</hi> to this Day, that no known Religious Party Owns or lays Claim to, that we know of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of W<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight enough for our Notice, after the <hi>Long-Suffering</hi> and <hi>Kind-Treatment</hi> we have exprest towards him, the <hi>Persecution</hi> we have suffered from him, and the many Books that have been written in Answer to his repeated and new-vampt Cavils against us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His Offers were not, nor now is, for Meeting <hi>by Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both Sides,</hi> but for one upon his own Terms: He must <hi>Summons, Dictate</hi> and <hi>Impose, Time, Place, Matter,</hi> and Judges also, or it will not do with him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There could be no Reasonable and Just End proposed for such Meetings that might induce our Compliance, all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62154:2"/>
Circumstances considered, since there was no Intimation of any Persons to be there, whose <hi>Tender Consciences</hi> wanted Satisfaction from us. And as for the Vindication of our selves from such Exceptions as are made against us, it hath been fully done already in our <hi>Printed Answers</hi> to him. Wherefore it must only have been to have gratified the <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Levity</hi> of <hi>G. K.</hi> and a few other Prejudicate Persons: And we Value <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>Publick Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Reputations</hi> at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother rate, than to expose them after such an Ill and Trival manner.</p>
               <p>But yet again, that you may farther see what a Man <hi>G. K.</hi> is, and how little reason we have to take any more Notice of him, we Intreat you weigh these following Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no need that we Defend our selves against his Charges and Exceptions, since himself has so often, and so well done it, when made by other Enemies. Pray see his Books, <hi>i. e. Immediate Revelation,</hi> &amp;c. those against <hi>R. Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Scholars of</hi> Aberdeen, <hi>Baptists of</hi> London, and <hi>Priests and Professors of</hi> New-England and others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as he hath repeatedly Vindicated our Doctrines as <hi>Scriptural, Primitive,</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi>; so has he Pledged his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sense</hi> to Vouch for us as the People of God; at divers times pleading his <hi>Inward Sense of God's presence with him,</hi> in maintaining our Religion as Christian, and us as True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, in walking up to it. After which, <hi>what is to be said for such a Man, or what-more against him,</hi> with respect to his present Practices; For what greater Evidence of Union, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Concurrence can any Man give, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, from an <hi>Inward Sense, given</hi> (as he said) <hi>by the Spirit of God, that we are the People of God</hi>; Which he hath often affirmed. And what greater Levity and Enmity, than to run <hi>Counter</hi> to us, and to <hi>Rally</hi> and <hi>Excite</hi> all sorts of Enemies against us, for only believing and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62154:3"/>
adhering to the <hi>same</hi> Principles, and Preaching the <hi>same,</hi> and <hi>no other</hi> Doctrines, than such as we <hi>Believed</hi> and <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> when he declared he had that <hi>Unity</hi> with us, and <hi>Inward Evidence</hi> for us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He has Endeavoured to render us as a People <hi>Divided,</hi> and as if the better part of us were with him, that he might expose them, the more, he chiefly strikes at, while he is Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from us, for we know not of <hi>one</hi> in the Three Kingdoms, that was accounted in Unity with us at the time of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>England,</hi> (which is now about Four Years) that does adhere to him; notwithstanding the Clamour and Noise he has made, and the Dust he has raised to cloud the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Profession.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He Insinuates <hi>Mighty New Discoveries,</hi> to Vilifie and Debase others, and as such his Work is Entertained and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by some Busie and Restless Adversaries; whereas in reality he is chiefly a <hi>Copy,</hi> not an <hi>Original,</hi> in that he says little material, but what has been said already by other Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Adversaries, many Years ago, and as often particularly Answered: So that here is in substance, <hi>no new thing,</hi> but what our Bitter Opposers threw at us above Twenty Years past, and which is now lick'd up by <hi>G. K.</hi> and again spit out at us to his own Shame and Confusion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But it seems the <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> of this Pretended New Discovery, has been his <hi>Antiquity</hi> amongst us, which we say is the Aggravation of his Folly or Insincerity: For no Man of Common Sense can think, that one of his Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Learning and Religion, should be <hi>Thirty Years,</hi> in finding out what the <hi>Quakers were,</hi> or whether <hi>himself was a Quaker:</hi> Nor is it probable, <hi>That any Man in his right Mind, would Imbrace so Decry'd, so Despis'd, and so Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a Perswasion,</hi> as the World knows ours has been, and yet be <hi>Ignorant of what he Ioined with, Preached up, Writ and Suffered for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62154:3"/>6. The Two Persons Living, whom he mostly Vilifies, <hi>viz. G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> were his <hi>Orthodox Christians,</hi> and <hi>Dear Brethren,</hi> about Five Years past in <hi>America,</hi> and then and there he urged the <hi>Orthodoxy of their Writings,</hi> to Justifie himself; though now he perversly pretends to prove the same <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> Antichristian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wonder not therefore, Reader, if we think not this Man upon Equal Terms with us, or our selves under the like Obligations to him, that we might be towards a fair Adversary, who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our many Meetings with him, Patience towards him, and Pity for him, hath turned the Deaf Ear, and suffered his Pride, Passion, and Revenge, not only to render Fruitless all our Christian Endeavours towards him, but to become the <hi>Epitomy</hi> and very <hi>Common-place</hi> of all the Malice of our preceding Adversaries.</p>
               <p>We pray God Almighty, to make him truly sensible of that <hi>fearful Lapse</hi> he is under, and of that <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> that has wrought in him, to the Overthrow of the Good State of Mind he once knew amongst us; and which he hath (since this grievous Revolt) acknowledged he once Enjoyed in Fellowship with us, that so he may Repent, and receive Forgiveness for his Foul Prevarications, both with God and Man.</p>

                  </gap>me Surprise, thou should'st be unwilling, after thy many Summons and Challenges, to meet me at a Select Meeting in my particular Case, when thou seemest by thy General Letter, to propose a Select one for us All, that thou hast Summoned to appear at <hi>Turners-Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Excuse thou givest, Looks to me not so Candid as might have been expected from a Man of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, since what Injury thou supposest I have done, might by the Report of such a Meeting have been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, as Credibly as if a greater Number of Witnesses. For if thou art only to be Righted, as publickly as thou thinkest thou wert wronged, no less Number than what was there, if any other Persons, or Place ought to satisfie thee. But when thou callest to mind how publickly thou hast Staged and Condemned us, for the worst of Hereticks, without any Limitation of Number, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Qualifications of Persons, or our Consent at all to such a Meeting, Citing us, Arraigning and Condemning us not only Arbitrarily, but without a Copy of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment; naming to us neither the Subject of thy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, nor the Books out of which thou takest them, and less, the Passages attack'd and oppugn'd by thee. But that which augments my Wonder, is, That for all the Wrongs, thou hast or may'st Commit against me, thou thinkest I ought to be satisfied with a Select Meeting of equal Choice, in order to Right me. Now I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62154:4"/>
why it is not as Reasonable for me to propose a Select Meeting, equally Chosen, in order to hear thy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions against me, as for thee to propose such an one, after thou hast, in my Opinion, Injured me, in order to make me Satisfaction? Is not Prevention better than the Difficulty of a Cure. But, would'st thou be willing we should chuse <hi>Arbitrators</hi> (as thou callest them) for thee, as thou hast done for us? Or, would'st thou think us equal and fair (if we were to chuse) to pick out those that have pre-judg'd thy Case? That believe thee Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and that are of a Church that has persecuted thee, and who are of the Sentiment, if not of the Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, that the Rattle-Snake Man is towards us. But by thy last Letter it seems to me, as if thou didst design not to have us present; and indeed in thy former Letters also, by making the Conditions so unequal; or, rather, in allowing us none at all, and so putting us beyond a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of complying with thee. For who was ever thought a fair Adversary, that refused the Persons charged any share about Time, Place, or Auditory? Or, a Copy of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be exhibited against them? Should we treat all sorts of Adversaries at this Rate, and every Party of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants one another, that have Differences, and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies about them; what a state of Confusion and Strife, as well as Injustice, would the Nation be in? But, I fear, thou car'st not what thou dost, to be revenged upon some of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>; and, indeed, upon all of them, and their Profession too, for their sakes, because they could not dissemble with their own Consciences, in wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at thy Proceedings; so unlike thy former Principles and Conduct, when thou wert as good a Man, and as much thy self, as thou hast been since every jot. O, <hi>George Keith!</hi> 'tis hard for thee to kick against all these Pricks! The Lord give thee Repentance, that through a deep and

effectual Sorrow, thou may'st be forgiven thy very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Offences, and be restored to the Flock of God, that thou art so sadly gone astray from, if not too late. This is the fervent Desire of (I think, I may say) the most evilly entreated of all thy old Friends, and yet thy well-wishing Friend for all that,</p>
