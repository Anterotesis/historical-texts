            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p n="7">7 He setteth down certaine other spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Duties to be obserued in warre. 1. That no souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be admitted to fight with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, but being first solemnly sworn. This he sheweth by the authoritie of Cato, writing to Pompilius the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, vnder whom his sonne was a young souldier:



<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8405:51"/>
That, whereas hee had heard, that hee had dismissed his sonne, vpon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of dismissing that band <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> hee was; hee should not suffer him to remaine in the armie much less to fight, vnlesse hee sware him againe; Because hee beeing discharged of his former oth might not lawfully fight, vnlesse hee was sworne againe.</p>
                  <p>Also by another Letter of his, to his sonne; That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as



<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8405:51"/>
he heard that he being then a sould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ier in the Persian wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> was discharged by the Consull, hee should not enter the battel to fight: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him who was not a souldier, to fight with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie; signifying that none indeede were souldiers but those which stoode sworne.</p>
                  <p>A second is, that there bee as much mildenesse shewed to the enemy as may be.</p>
                  <p>This he proueth by the example of their auncestours; who gaue to the enemie the fairest name they could: as by calling him who was properly <hi>perdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

a stranger or forener, according to the auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome; so mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the hainousnes of the thing by the mildenesse of the word.</p>
                  <p>This hee proueth moreouer by the lawes of the twelue tables wherein the obstinate enemy is vsually called <hi>hostis,</hi> intimating a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>Although he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that through processe of time the word <hi>hostis</hi> is vsed properly for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen enemie, who proudly beateth armes against vs.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:8405:52"/>A third Dutie is, That when the war is onely for soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie and glory; as there must bee the same iust causes of war, mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: so that warre must be made with as little cruelty as may be.</p>
                  <p>This he illustrateth 1. by an argument from the like, taken from the manner of



<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8405:53"/>
our contention in ciuill matters. That is in ciuill strife wee deale one way with an enemie, with whom we contend for life &amp; honestie; and another way with a competitour who contendeth with vs onely for honour &amp; dignity: so must it be in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like matters.</p>
                  <p>After, hee further manifesteth it by particular exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples: As by the warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Celtibers &amp; Cimbrians, which was as against ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for life: and contrarily against the Latines, Sabines Samnites, Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineans &amp; Pyrrhus for the empire only wherein they dealt fairer, though some of these enemies were truce breakers and too cruell.</p>

                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:8405:53"/>Thirdly, he sheweth it by a noble saying of Pyrrhus, about the restoring of pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>That he sought not golde but victorie; neither would bee ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>

                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:8405:54"/>So that hee who should win it by the sword should weare it, with as harty good will as the great Gods gaue it. This he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for a princely saying, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming one desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from Achilles. A fourth precept is, That the verie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate souldiers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their word to the enemy, though they promised, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inforced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the times and straights whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they were driuen. This ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> declareth also by examples; first of Regulus a worthy Roman:



<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8405:54"/>
who in the first Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nike war, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner by the Carthagineans, and by them sent to Rome about the ex changing prisoners, hauing sworne that he would returne vnlesse he obtained the exchange of them; hee both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the matter [as inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious] and chused rather to returne to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to endure any punishment (thogh he was much staied by his friends) then to breake his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise giuen to them.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:8405:55"/>The second exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of Rome: who fined all those tenne at an yearely fine, during their liues, who had falsified their othes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they had bound themselues to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball the enemy that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they obtained the ransoming of certaine prisoners at Rome. And so dealt they likewise with one other, who deluded the oth which hee had taken, by a kinde of equiuocating, so i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining himselfe free. For he hauing sworne to returne; so soone as euer hee was gotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the campe, he returned presently, as if hee had forgot



<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8405:55"/>
something: &amp; then getting himself out of the campe again, he thought himself quit from his oth; as hee seemed in words, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hee was not.</p>
                  <p>Which Tully proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by a generall rule for all promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</p>
                  <p>That the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not the bare words, is euer to be respected therein. A fift precept is this, That there be euer kept a speciall hatred of treachery. This hee teacheth by a notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of iustice euen towards the enemy and against such dealing: That when as a runnagate from Pyrrhus had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the Senate to poison him; the



<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8405:56"/>
Senate sent the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor back to Pyrrhus signifying his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie: Thereby shewing their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of such a fact, though against an enemie both migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and mouing war vnprouoked.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre he hath spoken of warlike Duties.</p>

                  <p>Concerning the second caution, <hi>viz.</hi> That our bountie bee not aboue our abilitie, hee giueth these reasons of it:

1. Because such as will giue beyonde their abilitie, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to their next of kin: for that they conuey those riches to strangers, which it were more reason, should bee dealt &amp; left to their kinsfolkes.</p>

                  <p>This hee prooueth by an argument from the lesse, thus; That howsoeuer our parents are dear vnto vs, and so our kinsfolkes &amp; fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, yet our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie alone contains in it selfe the loues of all these, and therefore ought to be dearer to vs then all these.

                  <p>And thereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth first, that no man euer attained the praise of true fortitude by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie or naughtie dealing: for that nothing can be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest which is not iust.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a worthy say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Platoes to this end;</p>
                  <p>That as knowledg seuered from iustice is rather called sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tletie then wisdom; so a courage, thogh forward to perils,



<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8405:78"/>
yet if it be set on for greedinesse of gain or other priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, and not for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good, ought rather to be tearmed audacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse then valour.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly thereon exhorteth all who would be truely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous, to be good men and of plaine hearts, louers of truth, and free from all deceipt; because these vertues right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserue the praise of iustice.</p>

                  <p>But yet he teacheth that the harder it is for such valorous mindes to bee iust, the more excellent it is in them who attaine it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth heerupon that they onely are to be accounted valorous, not who do wrong to any; but they who saue others from wrong.</p>

                  <p>Heere Tully noteth wherein a valiant minde is discerned: to wit, in two things especially. The first whereof is, in despising outward

things. When as a man is perswaded that hee ought nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to admire, not so much as to wish any thing but that which is honest and comely: nor yet to yeeld either to man or passion of mind or to fortune, but onely to right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>The second is, that when a man is thus disposed in minde, he vndertake the atchieuing of great enterprises, &amp; those such as may bee most profitable; but very hard and full of trauell and danger, both vnto life, and other things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the com fort therof.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:8405:81"/>Now, hee sheweth that all the glorie, honour and profit arising of these two things, is in this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them: but the cause and means of making wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>thie men, is in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the despising of all outward things, as riches &amp; honours, is the way to make excellent courages.</p>
                  <p>This againe he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to appeare in these two things: First, if a man iudge that thing onely to bee good which is honest; and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he be free from all passion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse of mind.</p>
                  <p>Because this is, first, to be accounted the



<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8405:82"/>
true property of a valiant minde; not onely to set light by those outward things, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this declareth a valiant courage and rare constancie, for a man so to beare the hardest &amp; bitterest things that can fall out in this life, bee they neuer so many, as that hee neuer swarue one iot from the state &amp; order of nature; nor from the dignitie of a wise man, to doe any thing against either of these.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:8405:82"/>And this againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not meete that hee should bee ouercomne by any inordinate desire, who cannot bee ouercome by feare; much lesse be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by pleasure, who hath shewed himselfe vnconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by any trauel.</p>
                  <p>Therefore hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that these things are carefully to be shunned of a valiant man; &amp; also that couetousnesse of money is chiefly to bee eschewed of him. Because there is no such signe of a base minde, as to loue riches; &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily nothing more noble, then to despise money if a

man haue it not; &amp; if he haue it, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe it in bounty and in liberalitie.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, that he is to beware of a desire of glory: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that plucketh from him freedom of minde, for which all noble spirits ought chiefly to contend.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that he do not proudly seeke for soueraintie; but sometimes not to receiue it being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, otherwhile to giue it ouer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that hee labour to bee free from all perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of minde, as namely desire, fear,

                  <p>And for these two sorts hee declareth that neither of their opinions are vtterly to be despised.</p>
                  <p>First, because the life of tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Moreouer, hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the priuate life may be borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; because bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wits they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the studie of learning.</p>

                     </gap>e those things which most men so admire, as namely rule &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy; hee shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that hee taketh it to bee not onely no commendation to them, but a fault in them: for that howsoeuer their iudgement may seeme not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together disallowed for despising glory, yet they may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bee thought to feare the troubles and griefes which



<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8405:86"/>
follow such cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as a certaine reproach and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
                  <p>And then giueth the reason heereof; because some are of such a disposition, as that they agree not with themselues in contrary matters: as, who seuerely contemning plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, cannot yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure griefe; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising glory, are yet ouercomn with infamy.</p>
                  <p>And therefore hee teacheth that such men who haue the best helpes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch of businesses



<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8405:86"/>
are rather to sue for offices, that they may serue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies and excuses set aside.</p>
                  <p>Because otherwise neither can the state bee gouer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Moreouer, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that all such as take vpon them any gouernment in the common weale, are to despise worldly things, and to seeke after quietnesse of minde and security, as well as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, or more, if that they will not bee ouermuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with cares, but liue with graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and constancie.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:8405:87"/>And thereunto they must striue more earnestly, because the fewer things of the world the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers haue to lose, the more easie is it, to despise it; and also for that they doe not stand in neede of so many things, as the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate &amp; great man, neither can fall so grieuously whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer aduersity doth betide.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, because such great comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>That it is such a comlinesse as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of man in all things; wherein his nature differreth from other liuing creatures.</p>

                  <p>That the philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did take these things so, he proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the Poets in that comlinesse which they follow:</p>

                  <p>Also the reason why they obserue this decorum is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they iudge by the persons what is comely for euerie one.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the work of nature it selfe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath giuen man a personage of great excellencie &amp; preheminence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures.</p>

                  <p>Heer he sheweth the meanes how we may keepe a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in our play and sports. And this point hee teacheth to belong to euery question of Dutie. The first meanes is this; By hauing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore in minde, how far the nature of man exceedeth the nature of beasts. Which he teacheth to appeare heerein especially, for that they perceiue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but pleasure, &amp; are carried there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto



<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8405:119"/>
with all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily the minde of man is nourished by learning, and is euer searching out some matter by meditating and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming something of more worth; and is euermore led with a delight of seeing or hearing some great matter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> there be any one who is by nature more inclined to pleasure (if hee bee not a verie beast as some such beasts there are who are not men in deede but onely in name)



<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8405:120"/>
although hee bee sometimes too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleasures, yet for verie shame hee will hide and dissemble his ouerlonging desire after the same Whereby he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that it is most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, that verie nature teaches, that the pleasures of the bodie are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of man.</p>
                  <p>A second means, to keepe a measure in our pleasures, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we bee too much giuen therto, is; So to moderate our diet and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, as that wee vse them onely so, as they may bee best



<pb n="217" facs="tcp:8405:120"/>
for our health and strength, and not for voluptuousness. A third meanes is, by considering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and dignitie there is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man: by the due meditation whereof, wee shall see plainely, how vnbeseeming it is for man to lauish out all riotously, &amp; to liue deliciously &amp; wantonly; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, how comly it is to liue frugally, continently, sagely and soberly.</p>

                  <p>This also he vrgeth by a reason taken from players; Lest they should seeme to haue more discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heerein then wee.</p>
                  <p>Because they chufe not the best inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to act; but those that are fittest for them, in regard of their pronuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                  <p>

                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:8405:156"/>And first, for the house of a Prince or an honourable man, he giueth this precept, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh for the frame and forme of it, it must be fitted espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially according to the end of it, which is chiefly the vse thereof: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that there must be a due respect had, to the state and comlinesse of it, meet for the place and honour of the owner.</p>
                  <p>This hee sheweth, 1. By the example of Kn. Octauius, the first that was Consull of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie: who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a goodly house which he had built in the palace, yet such as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting him, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, not onely to haue receiued much honour, but also through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

                     </gap>e, but also shame and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie in the end, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee was not able to maintaine it.</p>
                  <p>And therefore heer he giueth two rules to this purpose.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a mans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is to be set out



<pb n="280" facs="tcp:8405:157"/>
by his house, and not to bee wholly sought from his house.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the maister is not to looke to be graced by his house, but his house by him.</p>
                  <p>A second precept for such buildings is this, That a man therein haue regard not only of himself, but also of others.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in great mens houses into which many strangers are to bee receiued, &amp; a great number of all sorts to bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there must bee speciall prouision for conuenient roome, so as it may bee large enough, and the owner able to main tain the port<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it may euer be wel fild; for that otherwise a large house may proue a disgrace



<pb n="281" facs="tcp:8405:157"/>
to the maister if it come to be solitary, especially if it was euer well filled by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother maister.</p>
                  <p>This disgrace hee exaggerates by the odious speeches of the passers by, as might be truly veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of many in his daies.</p>
                  <p>A third precept is, that in such buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings a measure be kept for sumptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:8405:158"/>Because thereby o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise ariseth much euill, euen by the example. The reason is: for that verie many do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly imitate the workes of princes chiefly, in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, although they neuer regarde their vertues.</p>
                  <p>This he instanceth in L. Lucullus a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular man for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: yet none imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in that; but verie many in the sumptuousnesse of his man our places. And therefore hee concludeth, that in all these things a measure is to bee kept, and all to bee reduced thereunto: and finally that that same mediocritie is to be referred to the common vse and ornament of life.</p>

                  <p>And first hee reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vp sundry of those kindes which are disallowed as base and odious: As, 1. The trades and gaines of tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farmers &amp; vsurers.</p>

because that in truth, the shop can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue, in it, any thing beseeming an ingenuous or free man.</p>

                     </gap>s from the necessitie of humane societie, from which the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Iustice doe proceede. Which societie he sheweth to be so necessarie, That if a wise man should happen on such a life, that hee

should be inriched with all abundance of good things, and should haue both abilitie &amp; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all things worthy the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of mortall man; yet if his soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarinesse, should be such that hee could not see a man, hee would wish much rather to die then to liue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wisedome which is called in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This wisedome he sheweth to bee the princesse of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and distinct from that which is called in Latine <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia,</hi> &amp; in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

is defined thus, <hi>viz</hi> A knowledge of things, meet to bee desired or eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</p>
                  <p>Where as this wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome called <hi>sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> is the knowledg of diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is contained the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munity of Gods and men, and their societie amongst themselues.</p>
                  <p>Whence hee reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thus:</p>
                  <p>If that vertue of wisdom from which these duties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed be the greatest and as it were the princesse of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that then these duties flowing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it must needs be the greatest also. And that they doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede hence, hee proueth further; for that the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and knowledge of nature is mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med



<pb n="308" facs="tcp:8405:171"/>
and vnperfect, if no performance of deeds follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Thirdly, he proueth it by the examples of the best disposed men; who vse to cast aside all duties of getting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whatsoeuer, that they may helpe their countrie in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extreame perill. For example, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this question, who there is so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously set in sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out the nature of things, if tidings should be brought him of a suddaine,



<pb n="309" facs="tcp:8405:171"/>
of some great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent perill of his countrie, which hee might bee able to preuent; though he were contemplating matters most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of all other to be knowne, which would not yet cast aside all those stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: yea although hee thought hee should bee able by his searching, to number the starres, and to measure the greatnesse of the world.</p>
                  <p>And moreouer, for that hee would not onely doe this for his countrie, but euen in the verie cause of the perill of his parents, or friendes. Whence he concludeth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently againe, that



<pb n="310" facs="tcp:8405:172"/>
the duties of Iustice appertaining to the profit of mankinde, then which nothing can bee dearer vnto vs, are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before duties of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demonstrateth it by other generall ensamples in this kind. As,</p>
                  <p>First, in that they whose studies and whole life haue bin spent in seeking out the knowledge of things, yet haue not withdrawne themselues from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuouring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>increase the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of men. As those who haue instructed many, to make them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter citizens, &amp; more profitable to the



<pb n="311" facs="tcp:8405:172"/>
commonweales. Of this sort hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth sundrie ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of Lysias the Pithagorean philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, who instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Epaminondas of Thebes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of Plato, who taught Dion the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racusian, and many other haue done the like.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hee sheweth for himselfe, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer benefit hee had brought to the commonweale (if he had brought any at all) he had attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto it by bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by teachers, and so furnished with learning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that such doe not onely instruct them that are desirous of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whilst they



<pb n="312" facs="tcp:8405:173"/>
are aliue and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with them; but they also effect the same euen after their death much more effectually, by the monuments of their learning left behinde them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in that they omit no point which might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the lawes, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes &amp; discipline of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale: so that they may seeme to haue imployed all their leasure for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of posteritie.</p>
                  <p>Thus hee sheweth, that they being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the studies of learning, bestowed all their wisedome and vnderstanding for the good of the commonweale, and so did euer preferre duties belonging to the societie of men.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:8405:173"/>Fourthly, he proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That for this cause alone it is bet ter to speake copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, so it be wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then to meditate most wittily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vtterance.</p>
                  <p>Because meditation serueth only within ones selfe, but elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence serueth for the good of all with whom we conuerse, and many others. Fiftly, because wee could not deuise nor effect matters sowel alone as with others. This hee proueth by a fit si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude taken from Bees: That as they swarme together, not to the ende to make combs, but being thus swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming by nature doe make their combs more ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ily; euen so and much more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, men being of a



<pb n="314" facs="tcp:8405:174"/>
sociable nature, do vse their cunning in doing and deuising much the better &amp; more speedily.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, in that know ledge separate from iustice or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth fruitlesse and barren. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise fortitude or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour separate from humane societie &amp; friendship, <hi>viz</hi> if it be not vsed for the good of others, is nothing else but sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagenesse &amp; cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, Duties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the societie of men to



<pb n="315" facs="tcp:8405:174"/>
bee far greater then the studies of know ledge.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he answereth an obiection of som, who affirmed, that wee vse duties appertaining to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, for our owne necessitie (for that wee could not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nor attain with out others, those things which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might desire) &amp; not for the good of others.</p>
                  <p>Wherevnto hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres; That if this were true, then if a man had all things necessary for liuing, ministred (as it were) by the grace of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any labour or helpe of others; if the same man were of a good wit, hee omitting all other businesse would



<pb n="316" facs="tcp:8405:175"/>
wholy imploy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in knowledge and science.</p>
                  <p>But he teacheth that this is false; Because euen such a man would still flie soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarinesse, and seeke some companion for his studies, and would desire still both to teach and learne, to heare and speake.</p>
                  <p>And therefore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all these grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds he concludeth this point, That euerie dutie which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the main tenance of humane societie, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before such as consist in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and science.</p>

Whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, that hee thinketh not so; and giueth his reason, for that there are some things partly so dishonest partly so hainous, that a wise man would not doe them, no not for the preseruing of his countrie. Of this sort hee sayth, that Possidonius hath gathered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: certaine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are so odious that they are shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full



<pb n="318" facs="tcp:8405:176"/>
to be vttered. Now, these hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that a wise man ought not to vndertake, no not for the cause of the commonweale, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that indeede the commonweale would haue them vndertaken for her cause. But for these he sheweth that ther cannot befall any time wherein it can concerne the good of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal for a wise man to doe any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all these, he concludeth this point concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the choosing of duties;</p>
                  <p>That euermore such duties be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the good of others; And that wise performance of our actions will

                  <p>Lastly, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this whole treatise, &amp; the right performance and preferring of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hee aduiseth to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that which was taught before; That in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon societie, there are degrees of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereby it may be best vnderstood what duties are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed first and chiefely.</p>
