            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If the industry we expect from them meet not with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable zeal in all true Protestants, it will not be hard to conjecture the success of a vigorous and industrious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque, and a faint and negligent defence. And therefore I think it cannot be unseasonable to offer a few motives to the stirring up the zeal, and awakening the prudence of all such Protestants as fear God, and love the King, the Church, or themselves, as well as to arm them with some Arguments for their own confirmation in the grounds of Protestancy, in opposition to Popery.</p>

            <p>The difference between our case and that of our fellow Christians who suffer with us is only this; that they are shut out from Heaven as far as the Popes Censures can do it, for they know not what, many of them, even Millions in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter parts having never so much as heard of him, or his pretensions, whereas we know them too well by woful Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>

Indeed no price can be too great for Peace, but only Truth; the which we may not part with for all the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charms of Charity and Love: and God knows, in the present case 'tis evident, that the excuses which are fram'd in the Romanists behalf are short and frivolous; nor besides can any man be esteem'd a Roman Catholic by admitting the Doctrines of that Church in his own private or some more probable Doctors, but in the public sense.

how well our property and interest in our estates will stand secur'd: And though when Princes are upon their good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, to be disseized of their dominions, whenever they offend his Holiness of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pesant or the Gentleman have no great reason to expect indemnity: yet should the Farm or Mannor house be too low a mark for the Roman Thunderer to level at, 'tis not to be imagined the Lord Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots and the Lands of all religious houses will be past by as trifles. The Church is ever a Minor, and cannot be prescribed against by time, or barred in her claims, and our holy Father out of his Paternal care will find himself concern'd to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Orphan committed to his trust.

            <p>So that Vice being brought to this easie rate, besides all other misadventures, unless we will stand for the honour of being Cuckolds, and have our Posterity share the Title which is Proverbial in Popish Countrys, to be <hi>fils de Prestre</hi>; it will concern us to look about us, while 'tis time, and prevent these vile dishonours which are preparing for us. If it shall be said, that 'tis not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men should pervert so sacred an action, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Confessions to those purposes of villany that are suggested. I answer first, That we may without breach of charity suppose that thing possibly to be done, which is notoriously known to have been done: as also, that the horrour of the crime is competently allayed by their Doctrine, who think only marriage, and not<note n="e" place="margin">

After all this there still remains a farther reason why we should resist the growth of Popery, even the most pressing that can be urged, <hi>Self-preservation,</hi> to avoid Imprisonment and Inquisition, Fire and Fagot, Massacres, Racks, and Gibbets, the known Methods by which the Romanists support their Cause, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their Faith.

            <p>Nor let any man be so fond to hope for better terms, or Liberty of Conscience, if Popery should now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. Let us look into the world, and we shall see on all hands, that nothing is any where suffered to grow either under or near that Sect. Where Protestantism has been so strongly fix'd as not to be batter'd down at once, it has by degrees been perpetually undermin'd: witness the Proceedings against them in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> and several parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> the late Persecutions in the Vallies of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the methods used in <hi>France</hi> to demolish their Temples, and disable from Employments, and almost exclude them from common Trades. I need not enquire what is now done in <hi>Vtrecht</hi> and other acquisitions of the <hi>French</hi> upon the <hi>Hollander</hi>; this we are sure of; Whatever Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are, or can be made of favour and compliance, 'tis somewhat more than a probable<note n="l" place="margin">

The Jesuited Romanist is at large by Equivocations to say any thing, and by directing of Intention to do any thing: they can with a very good conscience dissemble their own, and pretend to the Protestant Profession, come to the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heathen Idolaters, and that from express Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from his Holiness Pope <hi>Clem.</hi> VIII. upon account of which <hi>We may,</hi> says<note n="m" place="margin">

To close up all that has been said; from uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Testimonies and Proofs, we have seen the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which Popery has either heretofore or may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after have amongst us in all the great concerns of our Religion, our Prince, our Laws, our Property, our Country, our Families and Lives; and found it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently destructive unto all: the inference from whence can be no other, but that if we have any love of our Religion, any abhorrence of the grossest Superstition, Error or Idolatry, any regard for the safety of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, any care of our Laws or our Estates, any concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the strength, the wealth or numbers of our Nation; any desire to hold the Freedom of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, the Virtue and the Honour of our Families; and lastly, any care of Self-preservation, to escape Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres, and the utmost rage of Persecution; it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoove us to beware of the prevailing of that Sect, in whose Successes we have reason to expect to forfeit all these Interests, perish our selves, and bequeath Idolatry and Beggary and Servitude to our Posterity.</p>
