         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Paſsion of Chriſt, and the Benefit thereof; theſe two are the ſubject matter of this Chapter: The Benefit thereof is partly to others, and partly to himſelf: <hi>To himſelf,</hi> that is ſet down <hi>ver. 12.

That word <hi>Becauſe</hi> is a trouble to Interpreters, how to depend the latter clauſe of that Verſe upon the former. <hi>Vatablus</hi> ſaw, and cuts the knot rather then unties it.

Becauſe he had done no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, neither was any deceit in his mouth; yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him [He hath put him to grief] 10. When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin;</hi> Or, <hi>When his ſoul ſhall make an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his Seed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> Inaſmuch as notwithſtanding he was altogether innocent, yet he did patiently ſubmit himſelf to bear whatſoever the Lord would lay upon him for the Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans ſin; that therefore upon his Death he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive full ſatisfaction both in reſpect of himſelf and thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe cauſe he had undertaken. Thus I, but let the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed judge.</p>
            <p>In the words of <hi>ver. 11.</hi> we have a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> and its <hi>Confirmation:</hi> In the Propoſition, beſides the <hi>Agent</hi> who is by God here term'd, a <hi>Servant,</hi> a <hi>Righteous Servant,</hi> we have three things not to be ſo lightly paſſed over: <hi>1.</hi> Act, in the word, <hi>Shall juſtifie: 2.</hi> Object, <hi>Many: 3.</hi> The Medium, <hi>By his knowledge.</hi> Of which ſomewhat more largely, and yet only in reference to what juſt hints the words may give to the Examination of ſome poſitions of the <hi>Antinomians;</hi> a Sect, and a ſort of men lately ſtart up, whom Satan doth make uſe of to be his Proctors of Prophaneneſs, and the Abbettors of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and licentious Libertiniſm. But to the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By his knowledge—</hi>The <hi>Medium</hi> ſtands firſt in the Text, and if you will, let us firſt begin with it. <hi>By his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg—</hi>And what is that? To make way for Anſwer, I lay down this, That the pronoun <hi>His</hi> muſt be paſsive, like that in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113960:4"/>
               <hi>Pſal. 90. 11. Thy fear,</hi> i. e. The fear of thee, to note the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject not the ſubject, as there of Fear, ſo here of Knowledge; <hi>Scientia ſui,</hi> By the knowledge of him, as <hi>Pagnin, Vata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blus</hi> and <hi>Tremelius.</hi> Farther we cannot go, till firſt we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what it is to juſtifie.</p>
            <p>To <hi>juſtifie,</hi> in the Text of Scripture, doth ſometime ſignifie, <hi>To endeavor the juſtification</hi> of a ſinner, by acquainting him with the way and mean thereof, as <hi>Dan. 12. 3.</hi> Sometime <hi>To effect it,</hi> by acquitting the party accuſed from the Crime and Accuſation, which in this work of Juſtification is ſtill preſuppoſed: Whether of theſe two (other I let paſs, as not ſo applicable to this Text) whether of them, I ſay, is moſt proper to the Text, will appear by the Confirmation when we come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Onwards we make uſe of it, to enquire farther into the <hi>Medium,</hi> what is meant by <hi>His knowledge;</hi> For anſwerable to theſe two, the word, <hi>His knowledge,</hi> may import; <hi>1. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium Revelationis,</hi> That Doctrine by which Chriſt doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the way of Juſtification. <hi>2. Medium Operationis,</hi> That Grace by which Chriſt doth fit man for the benefit of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Medium Revelationis,</hi> ſo the Concluſion is, <hi>The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is that word of Truth that rightly enformeth us in the way and maner of Juſtification:</hi> The Goſpel, <hi>i. e.</hi> that part of holy Writ which teacheth us the knowledge of Chriſt, of his Perſon, of his Office, the Covenant of Grace, and the condition required: The Goſpel oppoſed to the Law, <hi>q. d. Not by the Law,</hi> but by the Goſpel and the Doctrine of Grace, ſhall Chriſt propound and acquaint mankinde with the way of gaining their Juſtification: <hi>Not by the Law;</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſt and this not in general, as comprehending the writings of the Old Teſtament; but in ſpecial, as importing <hi>the Law of Moſes;</hi> and this conſidered as the <hi>condition</hi> of that Covenant
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113960:5"/>
made with Iſrael; <hi>Not the Law of Moſes,</hi> but the Goſpel of Chriſt is the mean of Revelation; acquainting man with the way of obtaining his Juſtification. What then? Is this Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> all of it altogether aboliſhed? Is it of no uſe and ſervice to the Church of God, to Believers now in the Conſtitution of the Church of Chriſt? Some there be that would have it ſo, whoſe main endeavor is to caſt the Doctrine of it out of the Church, and the care thereof out of the Conſcience of the Chriſtian; neither the Precepts thereof alowed to binde men, nor the Motives thereof to draw men to the Duties of Holineſs: See their Arguments examined, <hi>Chap. 1. and 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>medium Operationis;</hi> and then the Concluſion will be, <hi>That Faith in Chriſt is the way and mean of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> Faith, I ſay, and not Works: Faith not unfitly termed the Knowledge of Chriſt, becauſe this alone is that which doth rightly know Chriſt, the fulneſs of his Merits and Graces: None but the Believer doth acknowledge Chriſt, nay none but he doth rightly, fully and perfectly know him. Faith is both the Daughter and the Mother of this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the knowledge of Chriſt: The <hi>Daughter,</hi> for Faith cannot lodge in an ignorant Soul; The <hi>Mother,</hi> for it lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on to perfection of knowledge. This Faith is the mean; by it ſhall Chriſt work in the heart of the Believer, and diſpoſe it for Juſtification. <hi>Not by the works of mans Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but by Faith in Chriſt is man juſtified:</hi> How ſo? Becauſe it is <hi>Medium Recipiens,</hi> as the hand or mouth of the Soul, to receive that Spiritual Food and Phyſick that doth feed and cure the Soul: It receiveth Chriſt and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his Merits and Graces for the good of the Believer. The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is not unfitly compared to Food and Phyſick, to a Garment and Plaiſter, which do no good but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113960:5"/>
in the way of Application, if not applied, no good by them: Theſe are received by the hand or by the mouth, and this is the work of Faith; and by Faith we are ſaid to be juſtified, as by the hand the Body is fed and clothed, <hi>viz.</hi> Inſtrumentally. Upon this ground we conceive it, <hi>That in order of nature, juſtification cannot be conſidered as going before the habit, yea the act of Faith;</hi> but rather, that Faith hath the leading hand, and the precedency of Conſideration: St. <hi>Peter</hi> termeth <hi>Salvation the end of our Faith, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>1. 9.</hi> By this end meaneth he, only the conſequent benefit which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth upon it, or rather the end intended and aimed at in believing: Doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preſcribe it to the Jaylor as a mean to bring about the end? <hi>Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Acts <hi>16. 31.</hi> Doth he not ſhew the ground and reaſon of it, <hi>Gal. 2. 16. We knowing that a man is not juſtified but by Faith in Chriſt—even we have believed, q. d.</hi> we have applied our ſelves to the uſe of the means that we might obtain the end: If Faith be as a mean to the end, then is it not to be conſidered as following, but as foregoing the benefit of our Juſtification. Plauſible Arguments are aleaged to overthrow this Truth, but their weight and worth is more in ſhew then in ſubſtance; See them examined, <hi>Chap. 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Act expreſsing the benefit obtained by Faith, we may not paſs by the <hi>Tenſe</hi> of the Verb, but by occaſion of it (as Doctor <hi>Criſp</hi> upon the like occaſion, ſee his Sermons on <hi>Iſa. 53. 6.)</hi> enquire into the Time, when it is that this Act is done: The Tenſe of the Verb is future, <hi>He ſhall juſtifie—</hi>Future it was then, when the Prophet ſpake this; Whether future ſtill, is a Queſtion; Or if not, when it was to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, whether all at once diſpatched: The farther explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, ſee in <hi>Chap. 4.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:113960:6"/>
The <hi>Object</hi> remaineth; This is in the word <hi>Many:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not all, but only a number:</hi> There be who teach that All ſhall be ſaved; a point well pleaſing to fleſh and blood: If a man might live as he liſt, abuſe his Eye and Ear, his Hand and Tongue, yea his Hand and his Heart, his Body and Soul to the ſervice of Sin and Satan, and yet hope for Salvation by Chriſt: But this may not be, it is not <hi>All,</hi> but <hi>Many;</hi> All ſhall not be juſtified by Chriſt, nor ſaved by him. Not through any defect of the means; the Merit of Chriſt is ſufficient to ſave all: The Goſpel doth call and invite all; and no doubt but whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved: But it cometh to paſs through the ill-diſpoſition and negligence of man left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who regardeth not to perform the condition required. By the Ordinance of God, in whoſe hand (as ſay our Divines) Chriſt hath left the diſpoſing of his Merit, it is appointed, That the Merit of Chriſt ſhall not be diſpenſed to mankinde, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a condition; and without the performance of that condition it is not beſtowed upon any: Now mankinde left to themſelves are negligent and careleſs to look to that condition, and ſo through their own ill-deſerts are excluded from the benefit of Chriſts Death and Paſsion. So then, it is not <hi>All,</hi> but only <hi>Many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> If not all, <hi>How then ſhall any one know whether his part and portion be in that Many,</hi> or not? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Surely (ſay we) by the work of Grace in the heart, by the Spirit of Sanctification, which doth always go along with the Spirit of Adoption, and the work of Juſtification. This hath paſſed for a Truth, without any oppoſition, till of late; The Antinomians cannot away with <hi>inherent Qualifications,</hi> No certainty can be gathered from the, ſay theſe men: Againſt whom, ſee the Ancient Truth maintained, and the New way convinced of inſufficiency, <hi>Chap. 5.</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:113960:6"/>
               <hi>For he ſhall bear their iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Confirmation of the Propoſition, <hi>He ſhall juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,</hi> becauſe <hi>He ſhall bea—</hi>By <hi>bearing iniquities</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, Suffering the puniſhment due to their ſin, as a Sacrifice to make an Atonement; to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, and ſo to take away the ſin of man. Hence then we ſee that Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is tranſacted by Chriſt, and he is ſaid to juſtifie many; Not by the way of Inſtruction, as ſay the Socinians, <hi>viz.</hi> Propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the Covenant of Grace, in which is contained the way and maner of Juſtification: In this ſenſe the Apoſtles (to ſay nothing of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets) might be ſaid to juſtifie many; inaſmuch as they had an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervice in publiſhing the Goſpel to the world; but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Chriſt had no partners in the Juſtification of theſe many: So then, not by the Inſtruction is it, but by the way of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance and Abſolution.</p>
            <p>This is plain; but that is farther to be enquired, <hi>How co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſin to trouble and vex the conſcience, if it be taken away?</hi> Hath Chriſt born, yea born away (for ſo we underſtand the word <hi>bear;</hi> he doth not only <hi>ferre,</hi> but <hi>auferre,</hi> ſo bear them as to bear them away) Hath Chriſt born them away, and are they brought back again? Here again we muſt Conflict with theſe Antinomians; Old Truths do not pleaſe them, they have a New way for this alſo; the unſufficiency whereof, together with the right way of ſatisfying the Conſcience, and taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſcruple of ſin, ſee fully explicated, <hi>Chap. 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to this Method have I finiſhed my Meditations upon this Text of Scripture, choſen of purpoſe to examine the Truth or Falſhood of ſome Points of Antinomianiſm: An Enterpriſe, to which, I confeſs, I had bound my ſelf by Vow and Promiſe made to God in the day of ſome diſtreſs which had befaln me: To the performance of which Vow, I was engaged,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113960:7"/>
by obtaining at the hand of God the gracious grant of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which with all thankfulneſs I do acknowledge, and by mine experience can witneſs, That an holy and religious Vow is a ready mean to obtain of God the gracious grant of our juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Holy and Religious I account that which is framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Religion: One ſpecial Rule of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, That each Chriſtian in his place and calling do ſet himſelf, with the beſt of his abilities, to that work which the preſent times may ſhew to be moſt neceſſary for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods glory.</p>
            <p>I in my place of the Miniſtery, what could I do rather, or more tending to this end, then to ſet my ſelf to oppoſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Errors which darken the Truth of God, and defile the Purity of our holy Profeſsion. This Error of Antinomianiſm I cheſe to deal in, becauſe I conceived it one of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Doctrines that are broached in theſe days. Satan doth never more harm, then when he is transformed into an Angel of Light: Nor is any Error more dangerous, then that by which Chriſtian Liberty is uſed as an occaſion to the Fleſh, by which the care and conſcience of the Law, the Rule of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is weakned and worn away; by which the Soul and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſteeled and ſtiffned againſt the ſenſe and remorſe of ſin and ſinfulneſs.</p>
            <p>In this I have done what I could; If not with ſtrength enough to convince, or cleerneſs enough to perſwade, yet with a ſincere heart, and a deſire to do good, God is my witneſs: And I bleſs God, both for his Aſsiſtance enabling me to do what I have done, and alſo for thoſe bleſſed opportunities which his Providence hath afforded me to do mine endeavor in the courſe of my Miniſtery, to ſet forth the Truth of God, and to ſeek the glory of his Name.</p>

The <hi>Antixomian</hi> (this name is given him for that he oppoſeth the Preaching and preſſing of the Law) he I ſay buildeth upon theſe and the like Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. &amp; 7. 4. &amp; 10. 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. &amp; 5. 1. whence they argue to this effect; <hi>If Believers be not under the Law, nay if dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt, and ſo delivered from the Law, whereupon Chriſt is termed the end of the Law; Then to call them back again to the Law and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion thereof, is to draw them from Chriſt and from that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which Chriſt hath purchaſed for them; whereas the Apoſtle doth charge the</hi> Galatians <hi>to ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free, and not to ſuffer themſelves to be again entangled in the yoke of Bondage:</hi> Thus they; as I finde by that Book of <hi>Ro: Town,</hi> Intituled, <hi>The Aſſertion of Grace,</hi> or <hi>A 'Defence of the Doctrine of free Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For clearing of this, our Divines diſtinguiſh; The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered to the Church of Iſrael was partly <hi>Moral,</hi> partly <hi>Ceremonial: Moral,</hi> ſo called, becauſe it was the Rule of good maners toward God and toward man; And it is to be conſidered either in reſpect of the <hi>Subſtance</hi> or the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</hi> In reſpect of the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> it is the comprehenſion of thoſe Duties of Holineſs which God had either <hi>imprinted</hi> in the heart, or <hi>revealed</hi> to the ear of <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity in that Age of the Church which lived before the writing of the Law. And ſo it is the Doctrine of Good and Evil; of <hi>Good,</hi> and ſo the Rule of an holy life; of <hi>Evil,</hi> and ſo the revealer of Sin and Tranſgreſſion: This was the ſubſtance of that which we call the Moral Law. The <hi>Circumſtance</hi> of it was, That it was made the condition of a Covenant for Life and Salvation, and ſo required of all them that were under the Covenant, and expected life and ſalvation by it; of them I ſay it required complete and perfect obedience, otherwiſe no hope to obtain their expectation: Nay more, it exacted this obedience under a Curſe; ſo that in caſe of diſobedience, not only ſhall they fail of Life, but come under the condemnation of Death; and this was that that proved the ruine of man. In the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of Iſrael, the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law was added: This ſet down that Form of Worſhip and Service of God, in the right obſervation whereof they might finde both <hi>Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:113960:8"/>
of their Offences, and <hi>Acceptation</hi> of their Obedience. This conſiſted in many Rites and Ceremonies, Sacrifices and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, all limited to the obſervation of <hi>Times</hi> when, of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> where, and of <hi>Perſons</hi> by whom theſe were to be performed <hi>[ex. gr.</hi> No Sacrifice might be offered but upon one Altar; Nor by any perſon but by one of the Family of <hi>Aaron;</hi> No Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion but upon the Eighth day; Nor Paſsover eaten but on the Fourteenth of the firſt or ſecond Moneth, and this no where but at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> Three times a year muſt every Male appear before the Lord, and every Woman at her Purification make a journey thither] ſo that this became a yoke of Bondage to the Church of Iſrael, eſpecially in the latter Age thereof, when they of that Nation were ſcattered among the Heathen, and lived in places far remote from the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> This then is the yoke of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; No hope to eſcape the Curſe of the Moral Law, but by thoſe expiations preſcribed in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law: No hope of acceptance in what they endeavored in the way of Obedience, except they attend upon, and ſeek it in thoſe ſervices appointed: No nor thoſe ſervices accepted, but in a moſt exact obſervation of all the circumſtances which the Law ſet down. From this yoke it is which Chriſt by his death hath freed the Chriſtian: And in this liberty it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have have them ſtand faſt, that they be not entangled again in that former yoke of Bondage.</p>
               <p>So then the <hi>Ceremonies of Moſes Law</hi> are quite taken away by Chriſt, the Sacrifice of whoſe Death is become the only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for all Tranſgreſſions, and the only way and mean of Acceptation in the performance of all duties whatſoever; Yea, the <hi>Moral part</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law is taken away, in reſpect of the circumſtance thereof, it is no more the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for Life and Death: Not <hi>of life,</hi> and ſo Juſtification may be had without it: Not <hi>of death,</hi> and ſo no fear of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by it; provided alway, that by Faith men lay hold upon Chriſt, keep cloſe to him, and walk according to thoſe Rules of Holineſs that he hath preſcribed; for in ſo doing we obtain what the Law promiſed, Life and Salvation: By him we eſcape what the Law threatned, Death and Condemnation: So then, though the Law be taken away in reſpect of this <hi>Circumſtantial</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:113960:9"/>
uſe thereof, as a condition; yet not in reſpect of that <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> as the Doctrine and Direction of Good and Evil: Nay in this reſpect it is reaſſumed and re-eſtabliſhed by Chriſt. In the former conſideration of it, it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Romans</hi> 10. 4. <hi>That Chriſt is the end of the Law, i. e.</hi> he hath done that for man which the Law would but could not: The Law would bring man to life and ſalvation; This is the primary end and intention of it, but the Law could not in reſpect of mans weakneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. This Chriſt hath done, and ſo is become the end of the Law, for Righteouſneſs and Juſtification to every one that believeth. In the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial conſideration of the Law it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Ye are not under the Law;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. <hi>We are dead to the Law,</hi> and ſo delivered from it, <hi>viz.</hi> as it was the condition of the Covenant: And that this is the meaning of it, is plain by this, That it is ſet down as a reaſon to prove that ſin ſhall not have dominion over us, <hi>viz.</hi> to binde us to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in caſe of defectiveneſs and failings; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye are not under the Law but under Grace;</hi> not under that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of full and perfect Obedience, in which if any defects were found, ſin did preſently dominier and threaten death: But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a condition, in which not only ſincerity of obedience is accepted, though it be imperfect, but alſo help and aſſiſtance in doing the Duties is afforded: So that with much cheerfulneſs may we ſtrive againſt the raign of Sin, and that over-maſterful ſway which heretofore it had in us and over us. Yet this doth not prove but that ſtill we are under the Doctrine and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Law for Duties of Holineſs; Yea, thoſe duties which by the grace of Chriſts Spirit we are enabled to perform (for this muſt be acknowledged, That though the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth many Duties of Holineſs and Sanctification, yet is it only the Spirit of Chriſt which enableth us to perform them) theſe I ſay are juſtly termed the Works of the Law, becauſe done in relation to the Law, though not in the capacity of a condition, as in the Covenant of Works, yet in the capacity of a Rule and Square of Direction, and a Duty of Holineſs.</p>

either the Law is abrogated even in reſpect of the Works thereof, or elſe neither is the Curſe abrogated; if Chriſtians be tyed to the Works, they are not freed from the Curſe.

Is it to take directions from the Law for our ways and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Is it to yield obedience to the Law? No: It is to ſeek Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Salvation by the merit of Works done in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law: This is plain to him that readeth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Verſes, to <hi>be of Faith</hi> is to ſeek Salvation by the Goſpel, <hi>i. e.</hi> by believing in Chriſt; and ſo, <hi>To be of the Works of the Law</hi> is to ſeek ſalvation by them: Now then, ſuch who will ſeek ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe, ſaith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> Good reaſon, becauſe they cannot ſatisfie the perfection of the Law; And he that will challenge any thing in the way of Iuſtice, muſt be content to ſuffer the penalty if he come ſhort of the perfection which the Rule requireth.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> Nay, but ſay they, <hi>The Law is not made for a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man:</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. conſequently belongs not to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever who is juſtified by Faith in Chriſt; And, the Believer indeed is juſtified, but not a righteous man, not in that ſenſe of the word in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth uſe it in that Text: The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man is there oppoſed to the lawleſs and diſobedient, and ſo muſt be underſtood of one that ſeeketh to conform himſelf and all his actions to the Rule of the Law; for ſuch a man the Law is not made: <hi>The Law,</hi> what is that? The Rule of the Law? No, but the threatning of the Law, the Curſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: This is not made for the Righteous, and ſo ought not to be applied againſt him, but againſt the <hi>lawleſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient,</hi> againſt them that will walk without Law, and boldly bear themſelves in the diſobedience of the Law; Againſt theſe is the Law made, and againſt them are the threatnings and curſes of the Law to be applyed: This is the right uſe of the Law, <hi>The which</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) is good if a man uſe it lawfully, i. e.</hi> if he do not abuſe it by miſ-application. Now then, though St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Law is not made for a Righteous man;</hi> yet ſaith he not, It is not made for a juſtified perſon; Nor doth he ſay, The Law is of no uſe for a Righteous man: It is

not a Iudge to curſe and condemn him; but is it not a Teacher to inſtruct him, a Counſellor to direct him? Is it not a Guide to conduct him, a Goad to quicken him and put him on if he ſlacken his pace in the path of Holineſs? Doubtleſs it is: Was it not uſeful, yea needful for <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe though a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man? So then, I hold it a manifeſt truth, That though the Believer by his Juſtification and Adoption be freed from the Curſe of the Law, yet not from the Counſel and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of that Law.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> It is Replyed, That to <hi>Juſtifie and Condemn</hi> are as proper to the Law as to <hi>Counſel or Command:</hi> If the Law may not command <hi>ſub paenâ,</hi> nor condemn <hi>proculpâ,</hi> then doth it ceaſe to be a Law, nor hath it any binding power at all. I anſwer, That to juſtifie and condemn are indeed as proper to the Law as to counſel and command, while the Law ſtandeth as a condition of life and ſalvation; but in that ſenſe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it abrogated, yet is not the binding power of it ceaſed; ſtill are we bound to walk in obedience to it, becauſe it is enjoyned as the Commandment of him who hath redeemed us from the Curſe thereof: Nay, I adde this further, That we are bound to walk by the direction of the Law, not only <hi>ex debito gratitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis,</hi> in the way of thankfulneſs, but alſo <hi>ex obligatione peccati,</hi> to decline the guilt of ſin; Sinful it is in the juſtified perſon to neglect the counſel and command of the Law.</p>
               <p>I would gladly ask theſe men, Whether the juſtified perſon be exempt from ſinning, yea or not? I finde it charged upon them, That no action of a Believer after his Iuſtification is ſin; and I perceive that they do ſhift and ſhuffle in the buſineſs: The Queſtion is not, Whether the ſin of the juſtified perſon ſhall be charged upon him to endanger his ſalvation, but <hi>Whether the act be ſin in him or not;</hi> Whether his Iuſtification do bring with it ſuch a charter of priviledge and prerogative as doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt him from committing ſin; I confeſs the Text of St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9.

May we not rather hereupon conclude in the words of St. <hi>John, If we ſay that we have not ſinned, we make him</hi> (Chriſt in that Form of Prayer) <hi>a lyar, and his word is not in us:</hi> So that upon neceſſity that other Text which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to croſs the current of the Scripture, and ſaith of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, <hi>That he ſinneth not,</hi> muſt be underſtood as ſome do underſtand that of <hi>Balaam, He hath not beheld iniquity in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> Numb. 23. 21. not of any at all, but of ſome particular ſin. The Text of <hi>Balaam</hi> (ſay ſome) hath particular relation to the ſin of Idolatry, from which Iſrael at that time was free, though not long after entangled by the counſel of <hi>Balaam;</hi> And the Text of St. <hi>John</hi> hath an eye to preſumptuous ſin, or rather to the ſin of total and final Apoſtacy, the ſin unto death, from which the Regenerate is preſerved by that <hi>ſeed of God</hi> which remaineth in him; from this ſin, I grant, he is preſerved, and in this reſpect <hi>he ſinneth not:</hi> Not ſo in reſpect of other ſins; witneſs not only the Adultery of <hi>David,</hi> which diſpleaſed the Lord, or the act of <hi>Peter</hi> denying his Lord and Maſter, in which his Faith was next door to failing, and called for the Prayer of Chriſt to preſerve him: Theſe you will ſay were before the Paſſion of Chriſt; but witneſs that faultering of <hi>Peter,</hi> and diſſimulation of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> for which St. <hi>Paul</hi> did openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p>Well then, if it be granted, That the juſtified perſon may ſin, yea and doth ſin, there muſt then be a Law of Holineſs, which ſhall binde him to carefulneſs in ſuch and ſuch particulars, for where there is no Law there is no Tranſgreſſion; nor can any man be concluded a ſinner in caſe of negligence, where there is no bond of duty.

Even in Paradice God appointed an Eternal precept of obedience for tryal, beſide that Law and Light of Nature which was written in <hi>Adams</hi> heart. Much more needful is it now.

Theſe men, though they do not plainly ſpeak out their meaning, yet would have us to underſtand them, that the Spirit did by Enthuſiaſms and Revelations move them and guide them ſo infallibly, that they need not the Scripture, nor the inſtruction of the Miniſtry: which, what is it elſe but to revive and call up again that abomination of the Familiſts, long ſince condemned to Hell, the place of its juſt deſert: Juſt, I ſay, for take away the written Word of God, and then every fancy of a dreaming Elder and doting Siſter, ſhall be the Rule of mens godly converſations.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Touching the Motives of the Law, whether theſe alſo be aboliſhed: So that to propoſe the expectation of reward, as an invitation to good works, and to deter men from ſin by the fear of puniſhment, be altogether inconſiſtent with the Doctrine of Grace.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOt only the precepts of the Law are bequarrelled by thoſe men, but alſo the Arguments of perſwaſion. <hi>In doing good-works and living a godly and holy life, we muſt not at all look to any Reward from God: But muſt do good works meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reference to Gods Glory and the good of others. Otherwiſe our ſervice will be meerly mercenary.</hi> Grant indeed that we muſt do good works for theſe ends: Grant alſo, That in the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe ends there is a full Satisfaction to a Godly and a Gracious Heart. And yet, why may we not encourage our ſelves to cheerfulneſs in our Obedience, by having an eye to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Reward which God hath gromiſed; Doth not the Scripture propound a Reward for our encouragement; And why doth the Scripture propound it, but that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and by believing be put forward to work cheerfully; Is it not ſet down as an act of <hi>Moſes</hi> Faith, and a point of his praiſe, <hi>That he had an eye to the Recompence of Reward,</hi> Heb. 11. 25. Doth not the ſame Apoſtle ſhew this, That our bleſſed Saviour, by the Joy that was ſet before Him, did ſtir up himſelf to go on cheerfully to the end of his undertakings, Heb. 12. 2. Nay, is not this in part acknowledged by Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> he having ſet down this for a Doctrine, <hi>That the laying of ſin upon Chriſt is the Lords own Act:</hi> giveth this reaſon for it, <hi>Becauſe none elſe could give to Chriſt a proportionable reward;</hi> And Chriſt had an eye to ſome good conſideration, and for the proof of this he citeth <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>And God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to put him on propoundeth rewards unto him, &amp;c.</hi> Now then if thus it was with Chriſt, why may it not be lawful for the Chriſtian to help his weakneſs, by having an eye to the recompence of reward?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113960:12"/>
Will they ſay, that <hi>this ſevice is mercenary?</hi> So they do indeed, but without any juſt reaſon; mercenary ſervice is commonly meaſured by carthly profits and preferments; when a man ſo looketh at them, that where there is no hope of ſuch a reward, he doth let fall the duty to which he is called. <hi>Self-ſeeking</hi> is then unlawful and ſinful, when <hi>Self</hi> is the ultimate end of our deſire. But he that in feeking the good of his body and ſoul ſerveth Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo deſireth his own good that he may ſerve Chriſt, is acceptable to God and approved of man.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, Why are we blamed for preſſing men to holineſs, and encouraging them in it by putting them in minde of that reward which is provided? Theſe men flye out upon ſuch exhortations: <hi>This is not to preach Free-grace, this is to bring in Popery, and to teach men to hang their Salvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their merits, to expect their reward for their Works ſake.</hi> No ſuch matter, it is not Popery to preach the expectation of a reward upon the conſcionable performance of duties enjoyned: If it be, ſurely Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught ſo before us; If we have not them for our Preſidents let us be condemned. For why? doth not our Saviour mention that greatneſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as a Motive to patience in perſecution, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 12. To love our Enemies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 46. To faſt and pray in ſecret, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 6. 18. Doth our Saviour herein teach Popery, or doth he croſs the Doctrine of Free grace and Juſtification without Merits?

               <p>They Reply, That <hi>Divines do grant the reward is to be eyed as an encouragement; But it is promiſed to the worker, not to the work:</hi> We do not ſtumble at this, nor ſtick upon it, nay we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe hereunto; but they adde, <hi>It is due for his Faiths ſake before he performed any thing:</hi> I demand, whether this do not

ſeem to be againſt all reaſon: Due it is to the worker, but yet in relation to his work; Due unto him for his Faiths ſake, but not before he perform any thing: No, he muſt work, and then by Faith lay hold upon the Promiſe: His Faith <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="4 letters">

As one working and walking as becometh a Chriſtian: He muſt be in the Vine, and he muſt bear Fruit; If either of theſe be wanting he may fail: If an Heathen did the ſame work it would not avail him; The Promiſe is made to the worker, not to the work: If any Chriſtian do neglect this work, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect this reward. The Promiſe is to the worker, yet in relation <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o his work. Deny this, and you deny the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of manſions and different degrees of Glory whereof out Divines do ſpeak, out of theſe Texts, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 41. I cannot tell, but I think I am not far wide in my conjecture: Theſe men do make ſo much of their Faith, as if that alone might do all both in Iuſtification and Sanctification: And as by Faith they muſt lay hold upon Chriſts Righteouſneſs for juſtification, ſo to ſave themſelves a labor of working out their ſalvation by duties of holineſs, they will by Faith alſo lay claim to the Holineſs of Chriſt for their ſanctification: And ſo the ſanct fication of a Chriſtian, ſhall be nothing elſe but the <hi>Imputation of Christs Holineſs</hi> to him, not any quality at all infuſed into him, or inherent in him. And if ſo, what ſhall be the meaning of theſe Texts, <hi>Be ye holy in all maner of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: Be ye perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect: Grow in grace: Work out your ſalvation: Adde to your Faith vertue, to vertue knowledge, &amp;c.</hi> Note that Text, I beſeech you, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> doth not lay all the load upon Faith; Nor ſo urge it, as if it alone might do all: No, but he would have all vertues and fruits of the Spirit joyned with it.</p>
               <p>Theſe men do quarrel us for preſſing good works, as if with the Papiſts we did teach men to ſeek life and Salvation by their works: But I fear their drift is to baniſh out of the Church all care of Holy duties, all care of Repentance and new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Did they preſs theſe at all, we ſhould the leſs ſcruple at the motives; though there is no reaſon, why we ſhould caſt a way
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113960:13"/>
ſuch motives, as the Scripture hath appointed for that purpoſe; why ſhould we think our ſelves wiſer herein then God, or better acquainted with our own ſtrength then he? as if we could walk without that ſtuff which he hath provided for us. But we can not finde them reaching any neceſſity of theſe duties at all. And for their Diſciples, we finde ſome of them caſting away all care of duties, yea and diſputing againſt them: No conſcience made of Sanctifying the Lords day in publique: No care of family duties in private: plain neglect, yea oppoſition of days and times of Eaſting and Humiliation: No neceſſity of Repentance and ſorrow ſon Sin. And certainly where there is ſo little reſpect had to the Duties of Piety, it may well be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there is not overmuch care of Juſtice and Honeſty.</p>
               <p>Now for that other motive of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Threatning of danger in caſe of negligence and diſobedience: They ſay, <hi>Since all do grant, that the curſe of the Law is abrogated, why ſhould Chriſtians be terrified with it; Is not this to call them back to the yoke of Bondage?</hi> Surely no, Except they will ſay that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did ſo: we walk in their ſteps, ſo that either they muſt acquit us or condemn them. See for this that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 25. 29. &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 15. and 7. 1. Doth it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by theſe Texts, that our Saviour hath renewed the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Law to make men cautelous and conſcientious in their duties: Do not the Apoſtles tread in the ſame ſteps? Other Arguments, I grant, are more frequent, yet otherwhiles we finde them propounding the danger of Sin: See theſe Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. &amp; 8. 13. &amp; 13. 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 17. &amp; 6, 9. &amp; 9. 16. &amp; 11. 29. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21. &amp; 6. 8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 8. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>James</hi> 5. 1. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. &amp; 3. And what ſhall we ſay; Do the Apoſtles in theſe Texts call men back again to the yoke of Bondage?</p>
               <p>Two Reaſons are alleaged againſt the uſe of thoſe Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: 1. <hi>Chriſtians need them not.</hi> 2. <hi>They need not fear them.</hi> That they need them not, they endeavor to prove by this reaſon; <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Believers are of an ingenuous diſpoſition, and led by a free Spirit: The Spirit of Chriſt doth ſweetly incline the Heart to love God and Man; yea by Faith bringing love is man enlarged and prepared to the Duties of the Law:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113960:14"/>
Nor need he be tyed and bound to it as a Bear to the ſtake.</hi> I anſwer, That what is here ſaid is right, if rightly underſtood: Only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that this is a ſtate of perfection to which the Holy heart aſpireth indeed, yet hardly attaineth. And therefore there is ſtill need of the Law and the Motives thereof to excite and ſtir up our over-ſlothful &amp; ſluggiſh minds: The Spirit of Chriſt, I grant, doth execute the office of the Law, whether conſidered as the Rule, or the Principle of well doing; the Spirit is both Principle and Rule: but by reaſon of that rebellion which is in the fleſh, there is uſe of the Law and of the terror thereof: the Spirit doth make uſe of them to ſhake off that ſluggiſhneſs that is in us. As he doth teach, ſo doth he incline the Heart: Teach he doth, not only by inward Motions and Suggeſtions, but alſo by external Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Inſtructions: ſo doth he incline and diſcipline the heart by external motives, no leſs then inward motions: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal motives I ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> the Promiſes and Threatnings of the Law.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Is not this to call for an outward Authority to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Heart to that which it hath none affection nor inclination?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Nothing leſs: It is indeed to call for an outward authority or Argument to quicken the Soul unto that unto which though by Grace it hath an inward affection, yet by reaſon of the powerful relliques of Corruption, that inward affection is not ſtrong enough to prevail without ſome outward helps; we know that a Crutch doth no harm to the weak and feeble, nor do we account of Chriſtians moved by fear to be as a Bear tyed to a ſtake: We know that they have in them an ingenuous and free Spirit by which they are led, but we know that there is in them alſo the Body of Sin ſtill dwelling; the Luſts whereof are violent and muſt be kept under by the Law: We fear to let the Chriſtian looſe too ſoon, leaſt like Heirs that come to their Eſtate before they be wiſe, they ſquander it away &amp; ſpoil all: we know that they have the Spirit of Faith which worketh by love: But we know alſo that the ſame Spirit worketh by Fear; Love and Fear are as the weights and plummets of the Soul: Love is indeed the ſweeteſt and moſt potent, but it is not for beginners and Babes in Chriſt; Theſe like School-boys muſt otherwhiles be frighted into their Duty: were there no fleſh in believers,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113960:14"/>
fear might be laid aſide, while there is Fleſh in them, there is uſe of fear: If not, why is it part of the promiſe in the New Covenant, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>I will put my Fear into their Hearts.</hi>

               <p>They grant, <hi>That the Law doth not loſe his Dominion till the Grace of God do challenge us to it ſelf, that it may reveal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in us:</hi> very good (ſay I) but adde this, That the Law doth not loſe his Dominion wholly, till the Grace of God hath revealed Righteouſneſs in us, <hi>i. e.</hi> till it hath ſet up the reign of Grace and ſubdued corruption, which is the daily endeavor of the Spirit, but much retarded by the fleſh, nor will it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected till this life be changed. It is not denyed, but while the Spirit of Love is active fear may ſtand aſide: But we know, that when the Heart is taken up with the pleaſures of Sin, as too often it is, the Spirit of God muſt uſe the whip of the Law to fetch it off again: otherwiſe it is hardly reclaimed. Nor do we deny, but that <hi>according to their Doctrine and Definition of a true Believer, there is no liberty ſet up nor given to the Fleſh:</hi> But we ſay, it is a Doctrine and Difinition not fitted to the ſtate of a Chriſtian in this life: <hi>To walk by Love,</hi> is the Duty of a Chriſtian, not the Definition: This motive and mean which they preſcribe, <hi>viz. The Love of Chriſt,</hi> is potent and prevalent to lead men on in Holineſs, if it meet with an Heart rightly fitted and qualified: But it is not for the common temper of Chriſtians, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the Law, <hi>It was too weak, Rom.</hi> 8. 3. Not in it ſelf, but in reſpect of mans impotency: So ſay we of this love, the only motive by which theſe men would have Chriſtians dealt withall; It is ſtrong in it ſelf, but not ſtrong enough to over bear the power and prevalency of Corruption ſtill remaining: Needs muſt we call in the help of this fear, the fear of danger that may come by Sin to keep men, even the beſt of Chriſtians from daring to meddle with it.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>But to what end ſhould theſe threatnings be uſed, ſince Chriſtians need not fear them:</hi> How ſo? Becauſe, <hi>by vertue of their juſtification they are delivered from the curſe of the Law:</hi> To this I might anſwer, That their Juſtification doth not free them from the Rod. What was ſaid of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> is true alſo of the Seed of Chriſt the Son of <hi>David;</hi> If they break my Statutes and keep not my Commandments, then will I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113960:15"/>
viſit their Tranſgreſſion with the Rod, and their Iniquity with ſtripes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 31. They may, and do ſmart for their ſins, as appeareth by the grievous complaints of divers holy men of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. and 88. 15. Now then, if they be lyable to ſmart and ſuffer for their ſin, may they not be threatned and put in fear thereof, that fear may make them watchful and careful? <hi>Not for ſin</hi> (ſay theſe men) <hi>doth the Believer ſmart and ſuffer, but from ſin, i. e.</hi> In the way of prevention, not in the way of puniſhment: A fond and a fooliſh poſition, contrary to the Text of Scripture, which directly ſaith, <hi>For this cauſe many among you are weak and ſick, and ſome are fallen a ſleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 30. contrary to reaſon: Why doth one Chriſtian ſmart rather then another? Hath he in him more ſeeds of ſin then another? contrary to experience: What Father doth correct his childe for a fault not yet committed? And whoſe conſcience doth not tell him, that his ſin hath procured theſe things to himſelf? Even <hi>Job</hi> is at it, <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee,</hi> Job. 7. 20.</p>
               <p>I might adde, That if their juſtification doth exempt them from being caſt into Hell, yet doth it not exempt them from having an Hell caſt into them, even the very flames and fl<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhes of that fire and brimſtone, for a time caſt into their ſouls, to drink up their ſpirits, and dry up the moiſture of their vital parts, as the experience of divers holy Saints of God doth teſtifie.</p>
               <p>But this I urge finally, That notwithſtanding their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, they are not exempted from the fear of Hell it ſelf. Iuſtification doth onely free them from this fear, while they walk worthy of it; But ſuppoſe them ſinning againſt the Law of holineſs, ſuppoſe them ſtepping aſide from Chriſt, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring into the way of ſin, they cannot be free from the fear of death: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye,</hi> nor doth he make any exception of the juſtified perſon. So that if you can ſuppoſe a juſtified perſon ſinning (as no doubt but he may, otherwiſe in vain had S. <hi>Paul</hi> to them of whom he had ſaid, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Ye are juſtified,</hi> recommended this exhortation, verſe 18. <hi>Flee Fornication)</hi> if you can ſuppoſe him ſinning, I will conclude him thereby in danger of death, and till he repent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113960:15"/>
and return to Chriſt, that he may gain the pardon of this ſin alſo, he cannot be out of the fear of death. Nay more, if you can ſuppoſe him ſinning, and dying in his ſin without repentance for that ſin, I will conclude him in the ſtate of death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, or elſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was deceived; He ſaith, <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. and again, <hi>He that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption,</hi> Gal. 6. 8. If you will exempt him from all poſſibility of ſinning, and from all poſſibility of living after the fleſh; Then I grant, he need not fear death and Hell: But if ſuch only be true Believers, I ſuppoſe you muſt go out of the World to ſeek for your true Believers.</p>
               <p>Conſequently, ſince it cannot juſtly and truly be ſaid, either that Believers need not the threats of the Law, or that they need not fear them, it is fit that they ſhould hear them, and have them preſſed upon the conſcience: The threats, I ſay, and therefore much more the precepts and duties of the Moral Law. This we teach, and thus we practiſe, <hi>For by Faith we do not make void the Law, nay we do eſtabliſh it,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. Our Faith in Chriſt doth give us an intereſt in the Promiſe of life and ſalvation: But our Conformity to Chriſt in holineſs, and the daily growth and increaſe thereof, is that which doth by degrees fit and faſhion us for it. Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthines of the fleſh and ſpirit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>Arg. 1. <hi>INfants are juſtified, yet do they not believe,</hi> Rom. 10. 17. <hi>therefore, ſome are juſtified before they believe.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Inſtance of Infants is not to the point in hand,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113960:16"/>
as not in the caſe of Apoſtacy, and falling from Grace, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Arminians: <note n="*" place="margin">See Suffrag. Theolog. Magn. Brit. in <hi>Artic.</hi> 5.</note> So neither in this point of Iuſtification before Faith, maintained by the Antinomians; For why, That  Iuſt fication which is in queſtion, conſiſteth in the <hi>Remiſſion of actual Tranſgreſsions:</hi> Not ſo that which Infants receive in their Infancy; They are as yet guilty of no more, but Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin: And it is enough for them that the guilt of that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: of Actual Sin they ſhall then receive the Remiſſion, when they ſtand in need of it, and are fitted for it.</p>
               <p>Objection. <hi>But whatſoever Infants do receive, they receive it without Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sol. <hi>Hic aqua haeret.</hi> And Divines do not all agree in expediting themſelves: Some do not ſtick to affirm, That Infants have Faith; I grant it is an hard matter to prove the Negative, <hi>viz.</hi> That Infants have not Faith. That Text of <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. Faith cometh by Hearing, is not fully to the purpoſe; If Hearing be reſtrained to the Ear, then all that are born deaf are excluded; if extended to any way of acquainting man with the will of God, even by the workings of the Spirit, who ſhall exclude Infants? As hard a matter it is to prove that Infants have Faith, eſpecially if Faith be defined by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, perſwaſion or confidence. It is ſaid of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> that he was filled with the holy Ghoſt: This ſheweth that Infants are capable of the Spirit, but it doth not thereupon follow that they do believe; Becauſe, though in its actings the Spirit depend not upon the faculties of the ſoul, and their fitneſs, yet doth it not uſually prevent them: Nor be the actings of Grace or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily found, but where Age hath added ſome perfection to the Abilities of Nature. All that can be ſaid in this point is this, That Infants do receive together with their Iuſtification, the principle of Faith, <hi>viz. The Spirit of Faith,</hi> as he is called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. This is that which ſome do call <hi>The Seed of Faith,</hi> or Seminal Faith (nor can the term be refuſed, ſince it is grounded on the phraſe of Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 9.) And ſo it may be ſaid, that Infants have Faith (as they have Reaſon) <hi>in Actu primo,</hi> though not <hi>in Actu ſecundo,</hi> in the <hi>ſeed,</hi> though not in the <hi>flower;</hi> And this is enough to make them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that Iuſtification which they receive in their infancy; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, though they have it without, and before actual Faith:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113960:16"/>
yet not before Seminal Faith, not before the ſeed, the root, the Spirit of Faith.</p>
               <p>2. Arg. <hi>He that is in Chriſt is Iuſtified, and ſo Iuſtified before he do believe; Becauſe none can believe before he be in Chriſt: Faith is the fruit of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Faith, in</hi> Gal 5. 22. <hi>is Fidelity, as in</hi> Tit. 2. 10. <hi>a moral Virtue.</hi>
                  </note> Chriſt, though that Text do not prove it, yet he may believe ſo ſoon as he is in Chriſt; and full as ſoon for time as he is Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and for order before he be Iuſt fied: for underſtanding whereof, know, That in the firſt moment of our <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with Chriſt, the Soul hath a <hi>Communion</hi> of all that floweth from Chriſt both for Grace and Glory: But how? In the vertue and power <hi>of a Root and Seed:</hi> from this Union floweth both <hi>Grace</hi> to enable the ſoul to do good actions, and alſo <hi>Glory</hi> to crown and reward each good act that is wrought, but each in his own order: <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> The plant engrafted into the ſtock, receiveth from it both ſap and fruit: Or thus, from the vertue of life in the ſoul, doth proceed a power both of Feeding, and of Growing, not both of them in the ſame maner; for Feeding cometh as an <hi>Act,</hi> Growing as an <hi>Effect,</hi> yea an Effect of this Act: ſo is it here, To Believe, and To be Juſtified, come from our Union with Chriſt (as indeed, all that we have, and all that we hope for is from him, and without him we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.) And in that Union are they folded up as in the root and ſeed; But ſtill to be conſidered in their natural order, in which one is the cauſe of the other, and therefore to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in order of Nature before the other: what ſay we that Glorification no leſs then Iuſtification doth flow from that Union: will you then ſay, that he that is in Chriſt is glorified, yea glorified before he do believe? Surely no: As none is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified before he be Iuſtified: ſo neither is he juſtified before he be called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. In which call, if Faith be not included, it will not be effectual. Thus every thing truſt be conſidered in its own order: All theſe, Grace and Glory, Faith and the Fruits thereof, are rolled up as in a Root, and beſtowed upon us in our firſt Union, but the explicite production and application of each to the Chriſtian ſoul is in a juſt order.</p>
               <p>3. and 4. Arg. <hi>All the Elect of God are Iuſtified before God,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113960:17"/>
for why, They cannot be charged with any thing,</hi> Rom. 8. 33. <hi>Their Sins are taken away,</hi> Iſa. 53. 6. Ioh. 1. 29. 1. Pet. 2. 24. <hi>And this before they believe: For ſome of them do not yet believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> All the Elect of God, even they that yet have no being in the World; yet when they are look't upon as juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſons, are conſidered of God as believers, no leſs then juſtified: before the World they are fore-ſeen as believing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fore-ſeen as juſtified; Becauſe, in the World, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they are not juſtified: ſtill that that in the execution of the decree hath the precedency, is conſidered in the decree as fore-going, Sin before Condemnation, Faith before Iuſtification. The elect have their ſins taken away before they do believe, But how? Not otherwiſe ſave in the purpoſe of God, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Chriſt: Elſe what uſe, nay what ſenſe in thoſe Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. Repent and be Baptized for the Remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19. Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 16. Ariſe, be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins; is it not evident that the ſins of theſe were not as then blotted out and waſhed away, that they might uſe theſe means to compaſs this end? The Texts aleaged for Proof of the Argument, ſpeak not home to the point intended: That of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. onely ſheweth that deſignation of Chriſt to be the ſacrifice of Expiation: Not is there more in the 6. verſe then was expreſſed in the 5. verſe, <hi>He was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions;</hi> this onely excepted, That <hi>v.</hi> 6. ſheweth, That Chriſt ſhould make peace for us by the way of a ſacrifice, even the ſacrifice of himſelf, upon whom God would lay the iniquities of us all; as <hi>Aaron</hi> laid the iniquities of the Children of Iſrael upon the Goat, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21. Say the ſame of <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 29. It ſheweth whom God had appointed to that work. And the Text of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. ſheweth, That he hath exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his Office: but none of theſe Texts do ſay any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the benefit thereof, redounding to any one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, whether without, or before or after Faith: Truth it is, That this was ſaid and done long before many of the Elect did believe; So alſo, before many of them had any need of Faith and Iuſtification, even before they had a being. Nay in that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113960:17"/>
Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. brought to prove the Elect juſtified, becauſe <hi>Nothing can be laid to their charge:</hi> It is evident, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Elect, now made actual Believers; For that phraſe of laying any thing to the charge of Gods Elect, doth preſuppoſe them living and ſtanding before the Tribunal, conſequently actual Believers: For againſt the Elect, till actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believing, doth Satan lay no accuſation: And we doubt not to affirm, That the Elect of God believing in Chriſt, and laying hold on him by Faith, are ſo juſtified before God, that in vain ſhall Satan ſeek to charge any thing upon them: But till then, notwithſtanding the Purpoſe of God, and the Purchaſe of Chriſt, yet are they not actually diſcharged of their ſins, nor actually juſtified in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>5. Arg. <hi>We were made ſinners in Adam, before we had done any evil, and ſo we are made righteous in Chriſt, before we have done any good. This is the Aſſertion of the Apoſtle,</hi> Rom. 5. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Text of the Apoſtle doth only ſet down this, That as <hi>Adam</hi> is the Author of condemnation to all that be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, ſo Chriſt is the Author of Iuſtification to all that are juſtified. But as to the time when this is done, in the one or the other, the Text ſpeaketh nothing. Grant indeed, That in reſpect of the Merit of Chriſt, it may be ſaid, that we are juſtified in the ſight of God, before any good be done by us; but now in reſpect of actual Application to particular perſons, as no man is condemned till he have an actual being, and be found a ſinner in himſelf, ſo neither is any man juſtified before he have an actual being, yea an actual being in Chriſt, and in him made righteous: Condemnation preſuppoſeth ſin in the party condemned, and Iuſtification preſuppoſeth Grace and Faith in the party juſtified.</p>
               <p>6. Arg. <hi>In Chriſt crucified (before we believed) was full ſatisfaction made,</hi> Heb. 10. 11—14. <hi>And God was contented to reſt in that ſatisfaction,</hi> Mat. 3. ult. Iſa. 53. 11. <hi>Therefore there will follow perfect Remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No doubt of it, perfect Remiſſion will follow, becauſe ſatisfaction is made and accepted: But when? Not till the ſinner need it: not till he be fitted for it: not till he have a being
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113960:18"/>
in Chriſt; not till he come to Chriſt, that he may receive. In very deed, the ſatisfaction was neither intended nor accepted, but upon that condition, That whoſo will have it, muſt come to Chriſt for it. Hence they in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 40. are blamed in that they would not come to Chriſt, that they might have life. That Text of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. is miſ-applied to the Father, being indeed ſpoken of Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>7. Arg. <hi>Either we are juſtified in the ſight of God before we believe, or elſe even the Elect of God are for ſome time hated of him; For he hateth all the workers of iniquity, but certainly the Elect of God are at no time hated of God: If ſo, Then God ſhould hate to day and love to morrow, with much changeableneſs of Affection: Nay more, Gods love to us ſhall depend upon our love to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Set this down for a truth; 1. That God hateth all the workers of iniquity whatſoever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 5. 2. That the Elect of God are loved of him from all eternity, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 3. 3. That there is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of change in God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 17. 4. That we love him, becauſe he loved us firſt. Now, if there ſeem any contrariety in theſe laid together, we are forced to ſome diſtinctions, by which a commodious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation may be ſet down: So then conſider of theſe Explications:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The love and hatred of God to the Creature may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, either <hi>in the purpoſe</hi> of God, or in the <hi>execution</hi> of that purpoſe, &amp; this execution is in the effects of love and hatred. The <hi>purpoſe of God</hi> is this, to appoint the Creature to be the object upon which in time he wil exerciſe the effects of love or hatred; in this purpoſe of God, the Elect are always Loved, never Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: nor doth <hi>God</hi> vary and change in this his purpoſe: nor doth this purpoſe of his depend upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foreſight of any good in man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the execution of this purpoſe, the ſuſpenſion of the Effects and Fruits of Love hath the name of Hatred: And God may be ſaid to hate them (as the Husband that Wife) from whom he with draweth the Effects of Love. Now in this doth God walk oftentimes according to the preſent diſpoſition of the Creature: whereſoever God findeth ſin, he hateth it, (ſin is properly the Object of Gods Hatred, ſin I ſay, not the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113960:18"/>
Creature) and if this ſin be in a perſon appointed to love though he will not change his purpoſe, yet will he ſuſpend all effects and fruit of love, yea, and put forth the effects of hatred, until the party do part with his ſin. Contrarily, whereſoever he findeth any good, he loveth it, yea, though it be in a perſon not appointed to love; though this his purpoſe change not, yet will he ſuſpend all the effects of hatred, yea, and with much tenderneſs of affection put forth the effects of love to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, till he doth wilfully let fall his care of goodneſs, and take up a Reſolution of evil, yea, and that incorrigibly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The love of God to the Creature in reſpect of the effects thereof, is not unfitly diſtinguiſhed into the love of <hi>Benevolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and the love of <hi>Complacency,</hi> the former conſiſting in well wiſhing or pittying the Creature, is abſolute and free: The other drawing with it delight in, or friendſhip with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is reſpective, and hath an eye to the good behavior of the Creature: ſee both theſe expreſſed in that Parable of the wretched Infant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 6. an emblem and fit reſemblance, as thereof the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo generally of the Elect of God. For firſt God doth caſt an eye of pitty upon them in their wretched condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſaith unto them <hi>Live;</hi> His word is operative, and did them good, as is intimated verſe 7. then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when his grace hath wrought in them, and faſhioned them into a comely beauty, he doth again paſs by them and behold them, and lo it is the time of love, whereupon he doth enter into a League and Covenant of friendſhip; ſo that now the ſoul of every one of them may ſay, as the Spouſe in the Canticles, <hi>I am my welbeloveds, and my welbeloved is mine:</hi> Gods delight is in them, and theirs in God: Theſe things well underſtood, will eaſily ſhew the Inconſequence of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the Elect may be loved in the purpoſe of God, and yet not actually juſtified, nor God enter into a Covenant of love, till by the work of his grace they be fitted for the time of love. Again, whiles they are workers of iniquity and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to God, their ſins may be hated, and the effects of love ſuſpended, notwithſtanding the eternal purpoſe of God. No variableneſs in God, becauſe it is his purpoſe, not to entertain them into the effects and fruits of his love and delight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113960:19"/>
be converted and fitted for it, by the actings of the ſpirit of grate moving and working in them.</p>
               <p>To cloſe up the point, let us to prevent erroneous miſconceits which ſpring from the Confounding of things that d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffer, let us, I ſay, take notice of this diſtinction; A man may be ſaid to be juſtified either <hi>Intentionally,</hi> or <hi>Virtually,</hi> or <hi>Actually,</hi> either in God, or in Chriſt, or in Himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Intentionally, in God,</hi> i. e. in Gods purpoſe and decree, this is from all eternity: But this decree and intention doth not put any thing into a ſtate of actual being but in the fulneſs of time; nor doth it exclude, nay it doth include and preſuppoſe Faith in the perſon juſtified; for though election be of the perſons, yet Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification &amp; Glorification are of the perſons ſo and ſo qualified.</p>

We know that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a purchaſe, beſide the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the price, there muſt be Livery and Seiſin given, before a man be in actual poſſeſſion of what is purchaſed: ſo here, there muſt be application of the Righteouſnes of Chriſt, as well as the Effuſion of his Blood, and this is received by Faith.</p>

In the day of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſay ſome, then did he bear the ſins of many, and take away the ſin of the world, ſo that from that time and forward to the end of the world, there is no more imputation of ſin to any of the elect. It hath been commonly ſaid, even by ſome of our beſt Divines, that juſtification is tranſacted in our firſt Union and Incorporation into Chriſt, at which time it is conceived, that the pardon of all ſin is ſealed, conſequently that it is to us an act already paſſed: Nor can we ſay, He ſhall, but he hath juſtified: But I fear that the miſ-underſtanding of this point (not untrue in it ſelf, if not miſtaken and miſ-apprehended) hath laid the ground upon which the Antinomian buildeth that unhappy ſtructure which turneth the Grace of God into wantonneſs. Who knoweth not that juſtification in it's proper acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word according to the Scripture phraſe, is the act of a Iudge, pronouncing a judicial ſentence? and according to this, I ſuppoſe we ſhall not erre from the truth, if we ſay, that the main work of Juſtification is even to us as yet future, and that the time when Chriſt ſhal juſtifie thoſe many in the Text of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:113960:20"/>

               <p>There is, I grant, a <hi>praejudicium in foro conſcientiae,</hi> a preludial Juſtification in the Court of Conſcience, which is a preguſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and foretaſte of that final Abſolution. In the Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth Chriſt ſet up his Tribunal, there doth he take notice of the Accuſations that are put in by Satan againſt the ſinner upon particular occaſions, and by the power and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſpirit working in the Conſcience, doth he upon the humble confeſſion of the penitent ſoul, pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of abſolution by the Miniſtery of the Word, and ſeal it by the bleſſed Sacrament; and what is now done daily upon emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occaſions, ſhall be ratified at the latter day, according to that gracious promiſe of Chriſt made to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he gave him the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on Earth ſhall be looſed in Heaven;</hi> And the ſame in effect repeated to the Apoſtles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23. Thus in preſent by the Miniſtery of Reconciliation, there is a work of Iuſtification in the Court of Conſcience; But the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſummation is reſerved to that day, when Chriſt the Iudge proceeding judicially ſhal pronounce the ſentence of abſolution. The main work of Iuſtification therefore is as yet future: for to ſay, that juſtification <hi>quatenus</hi> it comprehendeth remiſſion of ſin, is one individual act, or that the blood of Chriſt doth at once waſh us from all, even future ſins, in the Antinomian ſenſe, I dare not yield: It is the blood of Chriſt, and that alone, which doth cleanſe us from all ſin; ſo is it the word and ſpirit of Chriſt, that leadeth us into all truth, yet not all at once. Truth it is, that in our firſt union with Chriſt, there is conferred the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>pledge</hi> of future remiſsion for all ſins to the end of our lives; the <hi>Ground of it</hi> is our Adoption ſealed to us in our Baptiſm, the which is not afterward cut off, no not by the greateſt ſins which the believer doth commit: ſtill he is the childe of God, though
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:113960:20"/>
in reſpect of his ſin he may be the childe of Wrath, and lyable to puniſhment, ſtill he hath an intereſt in Chriſt, and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance he ſhall have benefit and communion with him in his Merits and Graces. The <hi>Pledge</hi> and pawn of future Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Remiſſion and Forgiveneſs of all future ſins, is that actual Remiſſion of what ſin for the preſent the ſoul ſtood guilty of, at that time when he was United to Chriſt: All ſins paſt and preſent, were actually pardoned, <hi>viz.</hi> Actual ſins in Converts, Original in their Inſants, the guilt of theſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and their juſtification in reference to theſe ſealed in Baptiſm. This favor received, is a Pledge of aſſurance to them, that in future alſo by applying themſelves to Chriſt, they may and ſhall receive the forgiveneſs of their daily ſins. He that by the application of a ſalve hath his wound cured, hath he not therein a Pledge of aſſurance, that in the uſe of the ſame means, upon the like occaſion he may receive the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit? But to ſay, That in our firſt Union with Chriſt we receive an actual Remiſſion of future ſins, is in mine Opinion as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous as to ſay, The Cure is done and paſt before the wound be made.</p>
               <p>I grant, That it hath been received, and paſſed for currant in the ſchools of our Divines, That all ſins are remitted to the Believer at once; all, <hi>viz.</hi> paſt, preſent, and to come: ſo hath it been received, That juſtifying Faith is a particular perſwaſion of Gods mercy to me: But as <hi>Ameſius</hi> hath well obſerved in <hi>Medulla Theol. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. That this was ſet down on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppoſe that general aſſent to the Articles of our Creed, in which Papiſts do place the eſſence of juſtifying faith [And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he granteth that <hi>Fides juſtificans parit hanc ſpecialem fiduciam, &amp;c.</hi> yet he defineth it to be <hi>Qua recumbimus in Chriſtum ad Remiſsionem]</hi> ſo I ſuppoſe that our Divines did ſet down this poſition of Iuſtification tranſacted at once, to cut off the Popiſh ground for the Sacrament of Penance; not foreſeeing what we by experience finde, how unhappy a ground is herein laid for looſneſs and Libertiniſm. Hereupon <hi>Ameſius (ibidem)</hi> coming to ſet down his Opinion of the matter, doth mince it, <hi>Remittuntur peccata juſtificatorum non praeterita ſolum ſed etiam aliquo modo futura.</hi> Note that <hi>aliquo modo:</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:113960:21"/>
Now to explain himſelf he addeth, <hi>Hoc tamen eſt diſcriminis, quod peccata praeterita per formalem applicationem Remiſſionis nobis in Chriſto paratae; futura autem virtualiter tantum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Praeterita in ſeſe: Futura in ſubjecto vel perſona peccante—</hi>The which is in effect to ſay, <hi>Non remittuntur niſi in pignore,</hi> The actual Remiſſion of ſins paſt, is the Pledge and Pawn of what ſhall be upon the uſe and exerciſe of Faith. But to conceive ſin remitted as it were by an <hi>Ante-</hi>dated pardon, is not only againſt ſenſe and reaſon, but alſo againſt the grounds of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Senſe and reaſon ſaith, there is no need of Remiſſion before there be a guilt, nor is there guilt before the ſin be committed: no need of a Plaiſter, before there be a wound, prepared aforehand it may be, and laid ready, but application of it muſt needs come in after the malady. Then for the ground of Religion,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the fifth Petition we are taught to pray for the pardon of ſin. Now prayer is an act of Faith and hope, and both theſe are <hi>de futuris,</hi> of things expected, and not in preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. Faith looketh upon the Promiſe, hope upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, neither of them upon the poſſeſſion. No man prayeth for what he hath in hand, or for what is compleatly done and paſt already. I know what is uſually ſaid, <hi>viz. That not the pardon it ſelf, but the aſſurance, the feeling and comfort of it is that which is deſired in the Petition.</hi> Nor do I deny, but that in reſpect of ſins paſt and formerly pardoned, this is ſo: We play for greater aſſurance of that pardon, becauſe our Faith is like a narrow-mouthed Bottle, which though caſt into the ſea, yet is not filled but by degrees. Or rather we pray for the continuance of aſſurance we have received, not as if God were off and on with us, or would revoke what he had given: But becauſe this daily Petition is a mean appointed of God to work that continuance; and no ſooner do we ceaſe to pray, and take off our eye from God in Chriſt, but we ceaſe to believe and receive that continuance. Thus I ſay, it is in reſpect of ſins paſt; but now for the ſins that daily are committed, it is the direct pardon of them which we deſire of God in that Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nor can the words receive any other ſenſe, except we ſhould wreſt them, and ſo wrong the Wiſdom of our Saviour,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113960:21"/>
as if he could not make choice of ſuch words &amp; phraſes as might plainly and underſtandingly expreſs his meaning. And if theſe words, <hi>Forgive us—</hi>do ſignifie, Make us to know that thou haſt long ſince forgiven us, then why ſhall not the next words, <hi>As we forgive—</hi>receive the ſame interpretation? Nay why not ſo alſo in the other Petitions, <hi>Lead us not into Tentation, Give us our daily Bread, i. e.</hi> in the Antinomian ſenſe, Make us to know that thou haſt not lead us—that thou haſt given us our daily Bread. Will not this be found a ſenſleſs gloſs, nay an utter perverting of our Saviours intention? And why then ſhould it hold only in the fifth Petition, and in none of the other?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Adde this, That one end of our daily addreſs to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, is to obtain the Remiſſion of our ſins by the application of Chriſts blood. The words of our Saviour touching the Wine are theſe, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, which is ſhed for you, and for many for the Remiſſion of ſins:</hi> That in it, as we have often need by reaſon of our daily Tranſgreſſions, ſo we may often look upon that Braſen ſerpent for the cure of our often bitings. Thus what we ask of God in prayer, the ſame in the Sacrament doth God beſtow upon us, <hi>viz.</hi> The daily pardon of our daily ſins. Were it not in this reſpect needful to provide for our wants, was the pardon of all actual ſins at once ſealed in this Sacrament, as is the pardon of our Original guilt ſealed in Baptiſm, what neceſſity to receive this Sacrament any oftner then we do the other, <hi>ſc.</hi> once for all?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And above all, it is a ground of Religion, that nothing is to be received and believed, but what is Revealed to us for a truth by the Word of God. Now there is no ground in the Word of God for any particular perſon to believe that his ſins are remitted already, before he do repent and believe in Chriſt. The Word of God ſets down what counſel hath been given to men, that they might obtain Remiſſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. and 3. 19. But no where doth the Scripture ſay to this or that man, <hi>Thy ſins be forgiven:</hi> And for any man to perſwade himſelf of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion before it be, yea before he hath a word for it, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and not ſaith. The Antinomian Doctors ſay, <hi>That the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113960:22"/>
Spirit of God doth reveal it in the heart of a man, and the Voice of the Spirit is the Teſtimony of truth.</hi> In very deed, we may not refuſe the Teſtimony of the Spirit, nor queſtion the truth of it: But in as much as we know, that Satan doth ſomtimes transform himſelf into an Angel of Light, and that there be many falſe Spirits, in which reſpect the Apoſtles bids us to try the Spirits; nor doth Satan ſeduce only by the Doctrines of men, but alſo by falſe ſuggeſtions, whiſpering to the ſinner comfort upon falſe grounds: How ſhall we diſcern the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit from the ſuggeſtion of Satan? They Anſwer, <hi>Hereby it is diſcerned, Becauſe it ſpeaketh things conſonant to the Scripture.</hi> Let this be manifeſted, and the queſtion is at an end. But where doth the Scripture countenance that Voice of the Spirit ſpeaking to the ſinner and ſaying, Thou art juſtified in the ſight of God, and thy ſin pardoned, and that long ago in the day of Chriſts Paſſion: How I ſay, is this proved to be according to the Scriptures? They ſay, <hi>The Scripture holdeth forth the Free Grace of God in Chriſt;</hi> viz. <hi>That Chriſt is given a Saviour for ſinners, for Enemies, for the Rebellious: That God doth juſtifie the Wicked and the ungodly, even when and while they are ſuch: That he calleth for no works of mans Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, nor any previous diſpoſitions to qualifie men that may come to Chriſt: So that neither Impiety nor Enmity can caſt in any bar to hinder him that will lay hold upon Chriſt.</hi> This we do not much queſtion, but withall we adde, That the Scripture doth alſo call upon ſinners to Repent and turn to the Lord, that ſo they may be pardoned, and their ſins bloted out: and in as much as we know that one Text of Scripture is no leſs truth then another, nor may we ſo cleave to the one, as to neglect the other (for they are not contradictory if rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) we conclude that Chriſt is held forth a Saviour to ſinners, but ſo, that they repent and forſake their ſins, not elſe: no ſin, not the greatneſs of any ſin, no, nor the multitude of great Tranſgreſſions can bar the humble Penitent. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, God is faithful and juſt to forgive us,</hi> 1 <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. 7. Note that <hi>[If] q. d.</hi> If not, then there is no ground to hope for it. Again we ſay, That God doth juſtifie the ungodly, as Chriſt doth ſave ſinners in <hi>ſenſu diviſo, i. e.</hi> Not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:113960:22"/>
while they are ungodly, not while they are ſinners, but when they have forſaken their wicked ways, &amp; have turned to the Lord by true and ſound repentance. That text of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. ſpeaking of him <hi>that worketh not, but believeth in him that juſtifieth the ungodly,</hi> muſt not be underſtood ſimply, of ſuch a one that doth nothing at all; but reſpectively of ſuch a one as doth not reſt upon his works, nor rely upon his Righteouſneſs, but renouncing his own works, doth caſt himſelf upon the Free Grace of God; nor doth it uſe that word <hi>ungodly</hi> in the common ſenſe, <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> for one that hath no goodneſs in him at all, but in a limited ſenſe, <hi>viz</hi> for one that wanteth ſuch a perfection of goodneſs, as on which he may build the hopes of his juſtification: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this explication is, becauſe the propoſition is drawn from the inſtance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a man certainly not altogether void of works and Righteouſneſs, though not ſo complete and perfect in them, as that he durſt reſt upon them, but renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his works, he did caſt himſelf upon the Free grace of God, and ſo was juſtified by his Faith. Conſequently, that voice of <hi>Revelation</hi> in man, which teacheth him to comfort himſelf in the aſſurance of his juſtification, without any reſpect to the work of Repentance wrought in him, this is not the voice of Gods ſpirit, but the deluſion of Satan. There is no word of God on which to ground ſuch an aſſurance, and therefore it may not be received nor believed for truth; it being a ground of our Religion, That nothing is to be received, but what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the word of God.</p>
               <p>I might adde this alſo, Nothing is to be received as a truth which is croſs and contrary to the Text of Scripture: Now, that ſins ſhould be actually pre-remitted before-hand, and the perſon actually juſtified, before that by Faith he be United to Chriſt, how doth it not croſs that Text of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3. 25. where ſpeaking of the Remiſſion of ſin by the blood of Chriſt, he mentioneth not ſin indifinitely, but <hi>Sins that are paſt?</hi> [for the Remiſſion of ſins that are paſt] I, know that ſome do by this phraſe, <hi>Sins that are paſt,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Tranſgreſſions of them who lived in the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, the Tranſgreſſions againſt the firſt Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. But whether this be not an over-great ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:113960:23"/>
of the Text, I leave it to the judgement of the Learned.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, alleaged by ſome to prove, No Iuſtification before Faith, is by <hi>H. D.</hi> turned off as not to the purpoſe: Why ſo? To pleaſe God (ſaith he) is to do things pleaſing to God, which cannot be done without Faith; But he cannot ſo eaſily turn of thoſe Texts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. In the former ſaith our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already;</hi> How ſo? Is the ſentence of condemnation judicially paſt upon him, or is the meaning of it, that he is in the ſtate of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; or in the words of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Verſe 26. <hi>The wrath of God abideth upon him, viz.</hi> till by Faith he lay hold upon Chriſt, <hi>By nature we are the children of wrath,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> we as well as others, Jews and Gentiles, one common eſtate of all, till <hi>by Grace,</hi> by a <hi>Quickning</hi> grace, there be put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and this Grace is effectual <hi>through Faith,</hi> Verſe 8. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, no actual Remiſſion of ſin, before the work of Grace, which is yet more apparent from Verſe 12. where ſpeaking of thoſe that then were quickned and juſtified; he ſaith, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that work of Grace calling them, and quickning to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, <hi>they were without Chriſt, without hope;</hi> It is an overbaſe and unworthy conceit of the Scripture, which is implied in the Anſwer that he maketh; <hi>viz.</hi> This were ſomething, if we were ſo in Gods account, as well as in our own eſteem: Unworthy of the Scripture, is this conceit, for whoſe Word is the Text of Scripture?

               <p>But now by this text alleaged to prove their poſition, and by the Argument framed upon it, it is evident that either they do not rightly underſtand what it is that we teach, or will not rightly propound it: For did we indeed hold forth theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications to be <hi>immediate</hi> evidences in the way of a legal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, then did they ſpeak to the point: Not ſo now, when as we do only account them <hi>mediate</hi>

               <p>1. Text. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 6. Saith <hi>David, Then ſhall I not be aſhamed when I have reſpect to all thy Commandments:</hi> where note, 1. His <hi>expectation;</hi> Not be aſhamed or confounded, <hi>viz.</hi> when I am queſtioned either by God or Man. 2. <hi>The ground of this;</hi> When I have reſpect to all thy Commandments: Do we not ſee, That <hi>David</hi> doth comfortably aſſure himſelf that his Univerſal Obedience ſhould give him boldneſs and confidence? Whereupon is that it in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. His earneſt deſire was, <hi>Oh, that my ways were ſo directed that I might keep thy Commandments.</hi> Now then, was it ſo with <hi>David</hi> (I might adde <hi>Job</hi> alſo, whence that Confidence of his expreſſed, <hi>Job.</hi> 13. 15. and 27. 16. Is it not from his integrity, ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. 10.—13. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.) was it ſo with them, and may it not be ſo with us? Had ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication a greater influence upon their Spiritual eſtate then it hath upon ours? Doubtleſs the Conſcionable care of Univerſal Obedience is an Evidence and comfortable Ground of our aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But how can this be an Evidence which Paul rejecteth as droſs and dung,</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>He was blameleſs as touching the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law, yet rejecteth it and will not reſt upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sol. True indeed, He was in his own opinion, and in others alſo; But this was only a Phariſaical blameleſneſs, ſuch as that that is mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. and 18. 11. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> came to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:113960:24"/>
himſelf he found it otherwiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. And therefore no wonder if he do reject it. But admit that his Righteousneſs was Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal according to the meaſure of his knowledge, and that what he wanted in it was through ignorance and miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Law; yet ſince he ſpeaketh of it in oppoſition to juſtification by Chriſt, and doth caſt it away as a thing of no value and confidence when he ſeeketh a Righteouſneſs for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: will it follow, That becauſe it is no <hi>Antecedent cauſe</hi> of juſtification, that therefore it is no <hi>Conſequent evidence</hi> of our Adoption? Or, becauſe it will not profit a man <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> that therefore <hi>with Chriſt and in Chriſt</hi> it wil afford no comfort. Even he that doth here caſt it off in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. doth gather it up as a ground of Comfort. Reaſon good, for though this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Righteouſneſs without Chriſt avail a man nothing, yet this being built upon Chriſt, and wrought by vertue of a principle of Holineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſpirit of Chriſt is an undoubted evidence of the Inhabitation of the ſpirit, even the ſpirit of Adoption; and therefore it is beſide the point which the Dr. alleageth: Can that (ſaith he) be an evidence of our being in Chriſt, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> caſteth away as droſs? For though it may be worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the work of juſtification, yet it may be of much worth to evidence the work thereof: Though <hi>without Chriſt</hi> it may not profit a man, yet <hi>in him</hi> it may afford much comfort.</p>
               <p>2. Object. <hi>But there is no ſuch thing as this univerſal obedience to be found in any; No ſhip in which not ſome leak, No pot of Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which not ſome dead fly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sol. I do not reply, How then was this univerſal blameleſneſs found in <hi>Paul,</hi> nay in <hi>Paul</hi> a perſecutor: But I grant, That ſuch a plenary perfection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is not any thing wanting of what the Law requireth, ſuch there is not to be found in any; nor is it expected: No, this univerſality is rather <hi>Negative</hi> then <hi>Poſitive:</hi> Not any one precept is there which the Holy heart doth not willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace as the rule to walk by: Not any one duty which he doth not deſire and endeavor: Not any ſin that he doth indulge or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe in himſelf. This is that that is meant by univerſal obedience: A deſire that nothing be wanting; An endeavor after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Or in the words of <hi>David;</hi> It is not ſo much an actual <hi>keeping of all the Statutes, but an having reſpect to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:113960:25"/>
To reſpect them as a rule both for <hi>Direction</hi> and <hi>Examination.</hi> Is there any thing to be done? the Holy Heart will not venture upon it till he hath ſought to the word of God for direction what may, and what may not be done for matter and maner, when, and how far, together with all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: Hath he done any thing? he will examine it by the rule, whether it will hold ſquare with it or not; And in this work, he will not look upon one or two, but upon every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment as his rule to walk by: if any Commandment ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, he will by no means touch with it; Or if he hath, he will in no wiſe excuſe or condemn himſelf. This is that univerſal Obedience which we make to be a ſign and mark of Adoption and juſt<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fication: Not ſo much <hi>the perfect work and practiſe</hi> of the Hand, as the <hi>ſtedfaſt will and purpoſe</hi> of the Heart. This is expected, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 23. This is accepted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 18. and 139. 23.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>Such purpoſes of the Heart are found in many wicked men in the time of Sickneſs, and fear of death: Then may you finde them far from excuſing any ſin, or neglecting any precept, yea ſuch is their purpoſe and reſolution ſo to continue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sol. Admit this to be ſo, though it is ſooner ſaid then proved, that thus it is in any, where ſome work of the ſanctifying ſpirit is not found: But I ſay, admit it, yet doth not this objection take off the Argument: For we judge not of a man by one act, either of good or evil; But by the habit and conſtant frame of the heart: It is grace alone, and the ſpirit of Adoption that new-mouldeth the heart, and caſteth it into an Holy temper of univerſal obebience. Grace is it that maketh the Heart conſtant in holineſs; wicked men may have good moods and preſent purpoſes, but theſe are like Land-ſtoods ſoon gone again. So then, we underſtand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of this univerſality to flow from the conſtant purpoſe of the Heart; This is the fruit and effect of Sanctifying Grace.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>But who can ſay from an Heart unfained that he hath ſuch a conſtant purpoſe:</hi> For why, <hi>Are there not untoward riſings of the Heart, and repining thoughts againſt many Truths of God? Are we not often weary of that ſervice to which God doth call us? Do we rejoyce in Afflictions as the tokens of Gods Love, and count it all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113960:25"/>
joy to fall into divers Tentations?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This is but to beat the Ayr, nor doth it prove the want of conſtancy in the former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the heart. Grant indeed that theſe riſings and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are in us, but are they ſetled in the h<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

If not, The bent of the heart is ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, notwithſtanding thoſe indiſpoſitions. This conſtancy is not meaſured by this, <hi>That there is no interruption of the Act,</hi> or <hi>intermixture</hi> of contrary diſpoſitions: but by this, That there is no <hi>interciſſion of the Habit,</hi> nor any <hi>Toleration</hi> of theſe contrary diſpoſitions. It is our happineſs that we have to do with an indulgent Father, who looketh not at men in their fears and frighted paſſions, eſpecially when they are ready to take down themſelves for their ill-moods. In a <hi>Legal ſtrictneſs</hi> no man can plead his conſtancy, but in a <hi>Goſpel uprightneſs.</hi> As there is not any Duty which the Holy heart doth not imbrace, ſo not any Time (if he be himſelf and free from Satans Tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) when he doth not conſtantly hold that purpoſe, and ſtrive againſt all interruptions.</p>
               <p>2. Text. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) is our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing—That in Sincerity and godly Simplicity—</hi>Hence we col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, That ſincerity and ſingle-heartedneſs in our Obedience is a ground of comfort, an Argument of our Adoption. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Becauſe it is ſuch a diſpoſition of the heart, by which whatſoever is done by us, we do it as to Chriſt, and for the Lords ſake. Thus hath Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribed it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5. Oppoſing is to eye-ſervice, men-pleaſing and ſelf-ſeeking. And who can doubt but that ſincerity of Obedience muſt needs be a ground of comfort and confidence? Can it be found in any that have not received the Spirit of ſanctification?

Where this is wanting, there may be ſome outward Conformity of mens actions, in reſpect of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work: But the Motive and main cauſe of their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, it is ſome by-end and baſe reſpect, as in <hi>Jehu</hi> and the Phariſees, which appeareth in this, That when that end is gained, or that reſpect ceaſeth, then alſo their work is at an end, though the Glory of God, and the good of Chriſts Church be never

ſo much concerned: None but the Childe of God doth make the Glory of his Father, the end and aim of all his actions. All others begin and end in <hi>Self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. This <hi>ſincerity is not found in the ordinary practiſes of Chriſtians,</hi> either in the exerciſes of Religion, or in the works of mercy and juſtice: For why, ſaith the Doctor, <hi>Is there not much Self mixed in their performances? in praying and faſting?—Is not the end of theſe Duties, to be delivered from Danger?</hi>

Let all Sectaries look to it, and the Antinomians by name, who pretend to be the only Brethren, becauſe they only ſit down by the free grace of God, and reſt themſelves upon the promiſes of the Goſpel, though they ſee themſelves full of ſin: Let them, I ſay, look to it, for if their Charity will not extend it ſelf to relieve the neceſſities, and bear with the infirmities of thoſe other whom they accuſe to run after <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Law for their peace and

ſatisfaction of Spirit: in as much as they cannot but know, that if we do erre it is through miſ-underſtanding of the Scripture, according to which we deſire to frame all our faith and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes; certainly they cannot approve themſelves to love the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you will ſay, this may eaſily be retorted: Nor will I deny the juſtneſs thereof, ſhould I ſuffer the difference of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſo far to draw off mine affection from any that profeſſeth Chriſt, as in the caſe of his neceſſity to neglect him, to reckon him no better then a Turk, I ſhould doubt whether the Spirit of Chriſt dwelled in me or not. Is he a man that would not ſuccor a man, though a Heathen or Turk, againſt a Lyon or a Bear? And is he a Chriſtian that will not ſuccor a Chriſtian, though perhaps a Papiſt or a Sectary againſt a Turk? Is not the Text of St <hi>Paul</hi> plain, <hi>Do good to all, but especially to the Houſhold of Faith:</hi> And why to them eſpecially? But becauſe they embrace the Goſpel, and ſo profeſs themſelves the ſubjects and ſervants of Chriſt: Truth it is, that among them there is ſome difference alſo by a different meaſure of the Spirit: And as each is before other in it, ſo the <hi>eſpecially</hi> falls upon him. We ſay that God himſelf is the firſt and chief Beloved: other things are loved for Gods ſake; <hi>viz.</hi> All the Creatures, but eſpecially Man, becauſe there is in him more of God then in the reſt: All men, but eſpecially Chriſtians; Becauſe they profeſs ſubjection to Chriſt: All Chriſtians, but eſpecially them in whom the work of the Spirit is moſt eminent; This it is to love the Brethren.

only in general; But the Spirit cometh home to every man in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: Whence he is called, The Comforter, becauſe he ſo ſpeaks to the Soul, that the Judge is alſo ſatisfied: And when men do fear, My ſin is not pardoned, The Spirit ſpeaks to the Soul, and ſaith, They are pardoned: Till this be revealed, all the World ſhall never ſatisfie the Soul, all ſigns and marks are meer riddles.</hi> The Spirit of Adoption teacheth as to cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father: The Spirit it ſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> the immediate voice of the Spirit without any inſtrument, what God hath determined of this or that man is not ſet down in the ſcripture: But it is revealed by the Spirit: Hence the Spirit is the ſeal and the earneſt. To this effect the Antinomian Doctor; And hereupon he expoſtulateth: <hi>Why do men ſcorn and cry out of them that teach and profeſs this, as of Enthuſiaſts, men that have Revelations?

               </p>
               <p>And to confeſs the truth, In all this I ſee not what can be denyed, or much doubted of, though all his proofs are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing: that one Text of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. doth ſpeak home to the point, <hi>That the Spirit of God is the Revealing evidence;</hi> The voice of the Spirit <hi>is the chief,</hi> though not the <hi>only Teſtimony</hi> of our Adoption: But all the failing is when he cometh to anſwer that Queſtion, <hi>How ſhall I know that this is the voice of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</hi> A needful Queſtion: Becauſe Satan may and doth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf into an Angel of light, and deceive the ſoul: <hi>This is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the uſual way of men, if the Word did bear witneſs to this particular voice of the Spirit in me, then I could be ſatisfied: But if the Word do not bear witneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this voice of the Spirit, I dare not truſt it.</hi> The uſual way; Nay is it not the only way?

And is it not ſo alſo in the New-Teſtament? See that Text of our Savior, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 13. <hi>He that is the Spirit ſhall lead you into all Truth:</hi> How ſo? <hi>For ſaith Chriſt, He ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but what he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak:</hi> And what is that which the Spirit heareth? Is it not that which is already contained in the ſcriptures? So then, no Revelation of any Doctrine, no nor the Application of it which is not conſonant to the Scripture, is to be thought to proceed from the ſpirit: but whatſoever is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to be revealed by the Spirit, doth ſo far forth call for Faith as is agreeable to the Scriptures. Well, not to quarrel needleſly, nor to be too ſtrict in terms, he doth alow it for a truth, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord never ſpeaks to the heart of a Believer, but he always ſpeaks according to the Word of grace revealed:</hi> But then he addeth two limitations which ſpoil all:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That by the Word we muſt not underſtand the Law, but the Goſpel:</hi> And this, I conceive, is put to choke them who ſeek for ſigns and marks of Inherent Qualifications.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That you muſt not make the credit of this voice of the Spirit to depend upon the Word,</hi> i. e. to receive credit from it; And why not? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if you ſay that the Word is of greater credit, then the Spirit wanteth ſomething in it ſelf of credit; as if a man were truſted for a ſureties ſake: But this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>muſt not be alowed, God never intended that any thing ſhould be of ſuch credit as to give credit to the Spirit.</hi> The iſſue of all returns to this, That the Teſtimony of the Spirit is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> If ſo, Then he muſt recant what he ſaid, That it doth not depend upon the Word. And well he may, For howſoever the <hi>Truth of what</hi> the Spirit ſpeaketh, doth not depend upon the Word, yet <hi>the credit of it</hi> doth. The Scripture is already known, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as the Word of God: And what cometh after it, muſt borrow credit from it: St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of the voice which they heard in the Mount, ſaith yet, <hi>We have a more ſure Word of Prophecy,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19. How more ſure? But becauſe it was already received as the undoubted Word of God: And ſo to them, and in their Apprehenſion, it was a more ſure Word.</p>
               <p>But to draw nearer to the point, Doth this voice of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

ſaying to an ungodly man, Thy ſins are forgiven, doth it ſpeak according to the Scripture?

Is there then any Univerſal Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and Juſtification taught in the Text of Scripture? I mean, any ſuch Reconciliation that is abſolute and irreſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; That Reconciliation is ſo far wrought by Chriſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely for the World of mankinde, that whoſoever will come in and lay hold upon Chriſt by Faith, ſhall not periſh, this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: None other do I know or acknowledge. Is it not rather taught us in the Scripture, That before there can be any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of comfort to the ſoul, by the particular Application of the Goſpel Promiſes (any I mean more then this conditional, If I will come in alſo, I may as well as others) there muſt come in the work of the ſanctifying ſpirit, purifying the ſoul and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and working in it thoſe inherent Qualifications to which the Promiſe is made, and upon which dependeth the concluſion of that practical ſyllogiſm which bringeth comfort: The Text of Scripture ſaith, <hi>They that Repent and Believe—They that are lead by the Spirit of God are the Sons of God:</hi> Then that renewed and ſanctified conſcience ſaith, I do Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve—I am lead by the Spirit therefore: And ſo this concluſion thus deduced, if the immediate Teſtimony of the Spirit, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Heavenly impreſſion and irradiation upon the ſoul, if it come in with his atteſtation to confirm it, we may not doubt of the truth thereof, becauſe now indeed it ſpeaketh according to the Word, and doth confirm that particular concluſion which was comprehended in the general Text of Scripture: For where the Text of Scripture hath not a <hi>Quicunque</hi> for the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there the Teſtimony of the Spirit that concludes, for <hi>hic &amp; ille</hi> doth not ſpeak according to the Word.</p>

Phyſitian to cure them, not as an Husband, to receive them into union with him: Or if you will, as a Husband to take them into the Bed of love: But not till he hath purged them, and fitted them for his Bed; is it not for this, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth call upon ſinners <hi>to waſh and cleanſe their hands and hearts,</hi> Iſa. 1. 15. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>To ſeparate from the Wicked,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. with infinite other Texts of Scripture, all of them calling upon us to labor for the work of the Spirit upon the ſoul, that ſo we may finde the fruits of union and communion with Chriſt, and by that work of the Spirit, felt in the heart, we way be aſſured that the word of the Spirit ſpeaking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the ſoul, and aſſuring the conſcience of pardon, is the word of truth, and worthy of belief. For as when God ſet down the Text of Scripture, and revealed the ſame to the Church of God; he confirmed it by his works from Heaven, by Miracles which did convince the world that it muſt needs be the Word of God, which was accompanied with ſuch mighty and miraculons operations; ſo when God will by the Spirit ſpeak to the ſoul the Application of a Text for comfort, he doth make way for the credit of it by the work of the Spirit, the work of grace upon the ſoul: If not, believe it not, the ſpirit of truth is a ſpirit of holineſs; There is no truth in that word which ſpeaks comfort to that heart, in which is not wrought the work of Holineſs. Conſequently, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven,</hi> in the heart of a Drunkard, Swearer, Whoremonger, is not the voice of the Spirit. The work and the word of the Spirit go together.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſo evident is this, that the Doctor having ſought to eſtabliſh this Revelation of the Spirit as a principle that may not be diſputed, and that cannot be demonſtrated, doth yet in the cloſe come in with this, <hi>Yet ſomething more, for the Spirit doth give men to credit what he ſpeaketh.</hi> His meaning I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be, That by this work of the Spirit, by which mans heart is framed to receive the Teſtimony of the Spirit, and to believe it, by it doth it appear that it is the Spirit of God which witneſſeth their Adoption; ſo then, it is the voice of the Spirit that ſaith, Thy ſins are forgiven, and it is evidenced to be the voice of the Spirit, becauſe he frameth the heart to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:113960:30"/>
believe it. It cannot be denied, but that it is the Spirit that giveth Faith to believe it; nor is it doubted, but that if this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion do come from the Spirit, it doth afford comfort; but ſtill the queſtion is, <hi>Whether this be the work of the Spirit or not:</hi> of the other, <hi>viz.</hi> The work of ſanctification there is no doubt, which if it do not accompany that work of perſwaſion, I much doubt whether it be not an over bold preſumption.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Touching Faith.</hi> This is delivered by the ſame Author: 1. <hi>That the Scripture doth authorize Faith to give full evidence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intereſt in Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>That this evidence of Faith is not Revealing, but a Receiving evidence;</hi> viz. <hi>As it taketh poſſeſsion of what the Spirit Revealeth, and doth reſt upon it.</hi> This Faith, ſaith he, brings with it unqueſtionable evidence, full aſſurance, and what needs a man look farther: The ſpirit within thee ſaith, Thy ſin is forgiven, Faith receiveth it, and ſits down ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, here is thine evidence (ſaith he) and thou haſt thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For why, the Text of Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that believeth hath the witneſs in himſelf,</hi> q. d. He hath as much as can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, when he hath believing in himſelf: And he that <hi>believeth not, hath made God a lyar,</hi> q. d. If when God hath ſpoken, man will not ſit down with Gods bare Word, but ſeek for ſigns and marks drawn from his own works; this man hath made God a lyar. The ſum of all returns to this, That this act of Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Teſtimony of the ſpirit (that is, when the ſoul doth reſt in it without any farther doubting) that this, I ſay, is the evidence of our Adoption and Juſtification: ſo then, ask him how do you know that ſin is pardoned? His Anſwer is, becauſe I believe it and reſt ſatisfied in this perſwaſion. And is not this, I pray you, a very ſatisfying evidence? <hi>It is ſo, becauſe I believe it is ſo;</hi> In this way what prophane perſon is there in the world who may not conclude for himſelf, if he will but force upon himſelf this perſwaſion.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Nay, but it is not meant but of a perſwaſion which the Spirit hath wrought in the Heart: If God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath given thee to believe it, this is thy evidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Yea, but how ſhall I know whether God hath given me this perſwaſion, or that Satan hath ſuggeſted it into my Heart. Doth the Spirit of God take a man out of the Dunghil of filthineſs, and inſtantly without any
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113960:31"/>
work of waſhing and cleanſing, ſpeak to him that word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, pronounce him pardoned, and work in him the full pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of it; or if he do ſpeedily, and as it were ſuddenly work him to this ful perſwaſion, Doth he not at the ſame inſtant work a change upon his will and affections, by which that light that is ſet up in the underſtanding may be diſcerned to proceed from the Spirit of God? Surely thus we have learned Chriſt, and thus we teach: The Spirit of God doth work upon the whole ſoul, and all the faculties at once, and equally; Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will, Conſcience and Affections: Nor is there mroe light of ſaving knowledge in the one, then there is heat of holines in the other: That Faith which doth not purifie the heart and cleanſe the conſcience, is not a ſaving Faith: ſuch a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of pardon is but a preſumption; that of S. <hi>Iames</hi> remaineth an everlaſting Truth, <hi>Faith without works is dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>That Faith</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not dead where the whole eſſence of Faith is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> True, but wherein conſiſteth that eſſence of Faith? <hi>This is nothing but the eccho of the Heart</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to this voice of the Spirit:</hi> Grant Faith to be the eccho of the Heart to the voice of the Spirit (though this indeed be but one act of Faith) yet by the voice of the Spirit we underſtand not that ſuggeſtion of <hi>Remittuntur,</hi> but the whole Text of Scripture, comprehending Precepts, Promiſes, Threatnings, in all which there is indeed an eccho of the Heart by Faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 8. But in this the Antinomian is farther off then the Papiſt: The eſſence of Iuſtifying Faith doth neither conſiſt in this eccho to the Text of Scripture, nor in that eccho to that word of Revelation, but in an act that cometh in between them, <hi>ex gr.</hi> The Text of Scripture ſaith, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved:</hi> Is man juſtified by believing this for a truth, or rather by doing that duty which the word <hi>Believeth</hi> doth intimate, <hi>viz.</hi> The act of confidence and affiance in Chriſt. Again, the Spirit ſaith, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven;</hi> Is man juſtified becauſe the believeth this word? Surely, no: He muſt have it, before the word that ſaith ſo be a word of Truth. So then the firſt eccho goeth before, the other doth follow after: The right act of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith, whence it is ſo named is that intermediate act of confidence and affiance. Underſtand me to ſpeak of theſe acts of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:113960:31"/>
Faith as firſt, ſecond, third, in the order of Nature, not in the diſtance of time: In the order of Nature juſtification doth not go before Faith, but follow upon it: Nor is man juſtiſted, becauſe he doth perſwade himſelf that ſo it is.</p>
               <p>To wade no farther in this Argument: By this I ſuppoſe it is evident, That the new way of evidencing by the word of the Spirit, and the ſubſcription of Faith, cannot lay the Ground of perfect peace, except there come in alſo the evidence of inherent Qualifications. The voice of Pardon, is not the voice of the ſpirit, except when it ſpeaks to a Heart prepared and fitted for it: Then only is it true, when it falls upon a Penitent ſoul, a Repenting ſinner; otherwiſe it is the ſuggeſtion of Satan. Again, the ſubſcription of Faith is then a ground of comfort, when it is accompanied with ſuch inherent Qualifications as do certainly proclaim the work of the ſanctifying ſpirit in the Heart, otherwiſe it is but Preſumption and raſh Boldneſs.</p>
               <p>The ground of all this is in the nature of this Teſtimony of the ſpirit: It is not denied, <hi>But that the teſtimony of the Spirit is the chief and principal aſſurance of our Adoption: that without it the ſoul is not finally rid of fears: that when it cometh, it taketh away all fears and doubts—</hi>But this is that which we are to nore, that this is rather an Atteſtation then a Teſtimony; a ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary, not the firſt deponent: is not this rightly concluded from that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>The Spirit witneſſeth with our Spirit—</hi>where we have two witneſſes joyning together their Teſtimonies to aſſert this truth, <hi>That we are the Sons of God:</hi> Two I ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> Our ſpirit, and the ſpirit of God, the witneſs of our ſpirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> of our conſcience is the firſt; The ſpirit of God is the ſecond: His work is not <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to witneſs together with our Spirit: i. e.</hi> To confirm and ratifie what that hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. So that indeed the evidencing of this Teſtimony of the ſpirit is from the Teſtimony of our own conſcience: If this do not firſt ſpeak and conclude, that other of the ſpirit ſpeaks not at all: Now the Teſtimony of the conſcience is the concluſion of that practical Syllogiſm; and the certainty of this concluſion depends upon the verity of the Aſſumption, which mentioneth the work of grace in the Heart. So then, let it be the care of the Chriſtian to make good the verity of the Aſſumption, that he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:113960:32"/>
may truly ſay, I do repent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am led by the ſpirit: I do believe and reſt upon Chriſt, &amp;c. This ſhall not only afford him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by the concluſion, but alſo aſſure him that he is not miſ-led by the ſuggeſtion of Satan, but guided by the ſpirit, to reſt upon that Teſtimony of his Adoption and Juſtification.</p>

               <p>Touching the firſt man, Who from that text <hi>[God hath laid on him]</hi> grounded thoſe Points aforementioned, viz. <hi>That God hath laid upon Chriſt all the ſins of the Elect,</hi> and that therefore men <hi>do needleſly trouble themſelves by putting them again into the Conſcience;</hi> And that they ſhould reſt upon this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113960:34"/>
aſſured ground, that all their ſins are ſo done away, that there is no need of Repentance and Humiliation for them: This man, I ſay, either did not throughly look into the text, to finde out the true meaning of that phraſe, or elſe did willingly neglect it as not fit for his purpoſe: For I deſire it may be ſeriouſly conſidered, whether that phraſe <hi>[The Lord hath laid upon him]</hi> doth intend any more then what St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath expreſſed in that verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>God hath ſet him forth, or pre-ordained him to be a propitiation,</hi> in which reſpect it is that he is called <hi>The Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the World, i. e.</hi> The Lamb, the ſacrifice of Expiation which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that end: And ſo the words of the Prophet do give us this as the intention of God, that though we every one of us have gone aſtray, and ſo incurred the juſt wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God, yet doth not God lay the puniſhment of our tranſgreſſion upon our own perſons, but hath appointed him (the Lord Chriſt) to bear the puniſhment and ſatisfie the Iuſtice of God, ſo that we do make the fault, and he doth bear the blame. But now, as touching the mean and maner, how the fruit of this ſacrifice ſhall redound to us, whether abſolutely without any intervenient act of man, or conditionally in and upon mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Chriſt; this is not determined in that text, but to be fought elſwhere. Conſequently, to that which he urgeth, <hi>That it is Gods own act to lay iniquity upon Chriſt, and that it is done long ſince:</hi> We may Reply, This is little to the point, the Pre-ordination of Chriſt in this office is Gods own act, man hath no hand in it; No, nor in the purchaſe of pardon, that is Chriſts own act: Both theſe are done long ſince, yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but that in the Application of it to man, which cannot be till man have a being, it hinders not I ſay, but that man may have his Act, as indeed he hath: The which is evident by that Analogy which holdeth betwixt the Type and the Truth; the ſins of the people were not laid upon the Sacrifice but by the hand of Man. God indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Sacrifices for Expiation, and in that ſence may be ſaid, to lay the iniquity of the ſinner upon the ſacrifice; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this, the man that brought the ſacrifice was to lay his hand upon it: And yet more evident is this in that Doctrinal Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:113960:35"/>
of the Scape-goat in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 22. Till the Prieſt by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the iniquities and tranſgreſſions of the people had laid them on him, the Scape-Goat did not bear them away. So that Man alſo hath his act in laying iniquity upon Chriſt, no leſs then God, not in the preparation of the price, but in the way of Application.</p>
               <p>Adde this, that the words <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s all]</hi> which he applyeth to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (contending againſt the neceſſity of inherent Qualifications in any, to diſpoſe them and make them fit to receive the benefit of redemption purchaſed) theſe words, I ſay, are not Univerſal, but only in relation to the Church of God: So that till a man be of the Church, and in the Number of Believers, he may not include himſelf in the liſt of them to whom it doth belong. For why? If it belong to ſinners as ſinners, then to all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: And ſo he will lay the Ground for an Univerſal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, which I believe he doth not intend: If this Redemption belong not to all as ſinners, and yet the terms of the promiſe run in the Univerſal; then ſome act of Man ſanctified by the ſpirit of God muſt come in between, by which he may be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before he conclude for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Truth it is, <hi>That no ſin may keep off the penitent ſoul from cloſing with Chriſt.</hi> And if in ſaying, that this grace is appliable by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin to perſons beſore the leaſt meaſure of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if he intend no more but this, that ſuch is the vertue and value of Chriſts Sacrifice, that no ſin how great ſoever can hinder the hope of Pardon in caſe he come in and apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Chriſt, I know no man that will not ſubſcribe. No ſin may may keep off the Penitent; but till man be Penitent, no man may cloſe with Chriſt nor conclude to himſelf the Remiſſion of ſin: The reaſon hereof is, becauſe mens names are not ſet down in the Book of God: They muſt know, that the concluſion of Comfort is by the way of a practical Syllogiſm; in which alway the Aſſumption is the Teſtimony of the Conſcience, touching that work of Grace in the heart to which the promiſe is made: <hi>ex. gr.</hi> He that believeth in the name of the Son of God ſhall not periſh: If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins—Here is the Promiſe made to the Penitent believer; now ſaith the Conſcience, I do believe, I do confeſs my ſins,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:113960:35"/>
this is the Teſtimony of the ſanctified Conſcience, ſpeaking the work of the ſpirit upon the heart of man: Hence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of Comfort is, This promiſe is mine, My Portion is in it, and hence both peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But now look upon the Antinomian ground of Comfort, and let even reaſon judge whether it can produce any true conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>God hath laid the Iniquity of Sinners upon Chriſt; God juſtified the ungodly: But I am a ſinner, I am ungodly, therefore the Benefit is mine.</hi> Is it not evident, that except all ſinners promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euouſly receive this benefit, there is no certainty of Comfort in the concluſion? If it may appear, as who doubteth but that it may appear, that there be many ungodly that never had nor ſhall have benefit by Chriſt; Is not the concluſion uncertain? True ſaith the Author aforeſaid, <hi>Names of particular perſons are not written in the word: But what hinders that thou maiſt not have part in Chriſt: the Pardon is to all theeves, may not each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar take his part? This general tender of free Grace is as ſufficient for ſatisfaction of mans Spirit as if his name were written.</hi> Well, But this Pardon is to all Theeves, is it not, if they will come in? And ſurely it is intended, that they come in as Penitents, not as perverſe rebellious Perſons, and till they come in thus, can they claim the benefit of the Kings pardon? And therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he addeth, <hi>Hath the Lord given thee an heart to come in, that thou fain wouldeſt have Chriſt if thou durſt, it is enough; He ſhould deny himſelf if he ſhould caſt thee off.</hi> This is a precious truth if rightly underſtood; But in his Intention it halteth: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, that when God giveth an heart to come in to Chriſt, he giveth an holy heart, an humble and penitent heart, an heart no leſs ready to take Chriſt for a Lord then for a Saviour: Nay indeed, more deſirous of this then of that: Not that he might merit favor by his ſervice; but out of the abundance of Love to Chriſt, he is much deſirous that Chriſt ſhould now be glorified by him (as formerly he hath been diſhonored) before himſelf be glorified by Chriſt. Beſides this, I ſay, the concluſion of comfort grounded upon the general tender of free-grace, is not by the Aſſumption, <hi>I am a ſinner,</hi> I am a theef: But by this, <hi>I do come in:</hi> Hereupon it followeth, that he may not caſt me off; And, this coming in, what is it, but to believe in the name of Chriſt,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113960:36"/>
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. And what is that, but to reſt upon him for ſalvation. So then, the general tender of free-grace made to ſinners is conditional, as touching the benefit of Pardon, <hi>viz. If they come in and caſt themſelves upon the mercy of God in Chriſt,</hi> there is hope of Pardon. And indeed it may appear that this is that which the Doctor did intend, howſoever in the proſecution of the point his words did ſeem to drive farther; for thus he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth in one of his Sermons: <hi>So then, notwithſtanding any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs which thou findeſt in thy ſelf, thou maiſt boldly come to Chriſt and commit thy ſelf unto him as an All-ſufficient Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond Author, who hath more covertly and more cautelouſly delivered himſelf, he ſets it down as a Doctrine of Antichriſt, to ſay, <hi>That ſin is not taken away out of the Conſcience till the work of Baptiſm and of Repentance.</hi> Particularly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baptiſm this he cenſureth as a Doctrine of the Man of Sin, <hi>That Baptiſm doth take away ſin out of the Conſcience, and out of the ſight of God:</hi> And well he may, if it be maintained in that ſenſe which he oppoſeth, <hi>viz.</hi> As an Ordinance which hath in it a vertue and efficacy of taking away ſins not derived from, and ſubſervient to the blood of Chriſt: In this ſenſe, if any do maintain any efficacy in that Sacrament, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> But if it be no derogation to the ſpirit, that the Miniſtery of the word is ſaid to have an effectual working power in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of men, and cauſing them by Repentance to return to God: In as much as the efficacy of the Miniſtery is ſubſervient to the ſpirit, as the Inſtrument by which the ſpirit worketh, Why is it derogatory to the Blood of Chriſt, that the Sacrament hath an effectual power in this act of taking away ſin out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; In as much as it is intended hereby to aſcribe no effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy at all to it, ſave only as an Ordinance of application, yea, and this alſo ſubſervient to the ſpirit. The blood of Chriſt is that that taketh away ſin out of the Conſcience: But then doth it perform this ſpiritual cure when it is applyed; And the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a mean of application: A mean, I ſay, by which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit applyeth the blood of Chriſt unto the Conſcience: In which reſpect, by a communication of Phraſes, it is ſaid, <hi>To waſh away Sin, Act.</hi> 22. 16. And God is ſaid to ſave us <hi>by the waſhing of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113960:36"/>
Regeneration,</hi> Titus 3. 5. And Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to cleanſe his Church by the waſhing of water,</hi> Epheſians 5. 26. Not as if any vertue were in the Water, which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. But becauſe the Blood of Chriſt which hath that vertue in it is applied in and by the Adminiſtration of that Sacrament. And therefore for him to ſay, <hi>That if Baptiſm taketh away ſin out of the Conſcience, then hath not Chriſt finiſhed the taking away ſin by his one and alone offering;</hi> This, I ſay, is not to the purpoſe, in as much as beſide the paying of the price, there muſt alſo be an Application of it, otherwiſe the work is not done; A wound in the fleſh is not cured by the preparation of an effectual Plaiſter, but by the Application of it to the wound. Nor can there be any perfection to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without the Application of this price, of this Plaiſter. This he was not ignorant of, and thereupon ſeeketh to make his advantage; for thus he argueth, <hi>Is there</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Creature, without Application?</hi> Surely no, and yet <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified;</hi> What he would hence conclude, I ſee not. Will he from the word <hi>[Hath perfected]</hi> conclude the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication already paſt, <hi>viz.</hi> From the very hour of Chriſts Paſſion? How can that be? Is there any here ſaid to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by that one ſacrifice, but they that are ſanctified? Are any ſanctified but by the Communion of Chriſts ſpirit? Doth not this Communion preſuppoſe an Union? Is not that Union with Chriſt, ſealed to us in our Baptiſm? <hi>Sanctified perſons then are perfected by that one ſacrifice;</hi> Yet how perfected? All at once? Not ſo, But the ground-work of their perfect conſummation is laid in that one ſacrifice; And ſo laid, that in due time by the vertue and power thereof, without any other offering they ſhall be perfected. The true meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of them that ſay (if any do ſay it in thoſe terms) that <hi>ſin is not taken away out of the Conſcience, till by the Sacrament of Baptiſm it be taken away:</hi> Their meaning, I ſay, is no more but this, That till the Elect of God be really and actually united to Chriſt, they are not actually made partakers of that Remiſſion which was purchaſed for them by that ſacrifice. In which reſpect they do call upon Converts and Believers, as did
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113960:37"/>
                  <hi>Ananias</hi> upon <hi>Paul, Ariſe and be Baptized, and waſh away thy ſins.</hi> A text plainly proving, that Baptiſm hath ſome kinde of work and efficacy in waſhing away ſin; He Objecteth, <hi>That theſe words were ſpoken to a Believer; Conſequently, If</hi> Paul <hi>was already a Believer, and yet his ſins not waſhed away until he were Baptized: Then it will follow, that ſin is not alway pardoned to a Believer.</hi> But this Objection doth nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Concluſion ſet down: Becauſe, Though <hi>Paul</hi> as a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever had right to the benefits of Chriſt, by vertue of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to Believers; yet could he not have fruition of them till he had taken poſſeſſion of Chriſt by being incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; Faith is the hand of man to receive, but the Sacrament is the hand of the ſpirit to convey unto us Chriſt and all his benefits: Might not he have learned this out of that text, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> had he well marked it? If there be nothing added by Baptiſm to complete the ſtate of a Chriſtian, why is it enjoyned? I demand, Whether a Believer, ſuppoſe him to live and dye in the wilful neglect of that Sacrament, can be ſaved? Nay more, ſuppoſe him to have been an Alien, a ſtranger, or as <hi>Paul,</hi> a Perſecuter of the Church of God; but now a Convert as <hi>Paul</hi> was, nay a profeſſor and zealous Preacher of Chriſt; and ſo to have waſht away his ſins in the ſenſe that this man giveth of <hi>Ananias</hi> words (The ſenſe of thoſe words of <hi>Ananias</hi> which <hi>H. D.</hi> giveth is this, <hi>Break off thy ſins—It is a waſhing in converſation,</hi> ſc. <hi>To manifeſt to the world that thou art another man:</hi> And he noteth, <hi>That one waſhed in reſpect of Gods imputation, and waſhed in Conſcience in reſpect of manifeſtation and apprehenſion of the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, may yet be exhorted to waſh in reſpect of Converſation:</hi> By which it ſeemeth that there was no farther uſe of Baptiſm to <hi>Paul</hi> at this time, ſave only to manifeſt to the world that he was a Convert, which I ſuppoſe is ſo ſenſleſs a poſition, that it needeth no Refutation:) I ſay then, ſuppoſe a man thus to have waſht away his ſins, Can all this profit him to ſalvation, if he wilfully reject the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſm? Can he by his profeſſion and Preaching obtain a part in Chriſt, and a pardon of this wilfulneſs? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, except the Church of God in all ages hath hitherto wanted
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:113960:37"/>
light and ſight to ſee the true meaning of the words; that text of our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 5. reprehending <hi>Nicodemus</hi> for his backwardneſs in this Duty, is very clear and evident for the proof of the Negative, <hi>viz. That ſuch a man ſo wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Sacrament, cannot plead his Faith, nor have entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This man is not more out in the point of Baptiſm, then he is in the next point, touching Repentance. This doth he account a Doctrine of the Man of Sin, to ſay, <hi>That Repentance doth waſh away ſin; that Repentance is a mean to obtain Remiſſion; that there is no forgiveneſs with God before Repentancce.</hi> Touching that firſt Expreſſion, We do not ſay, that Repentance doth waſh away ſin in any other ſenſe but this, That there is no forgiveneſs of ſin to the impenitent. It is neceſſary as a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Qualification. It hath no efficacy in procuring pardon or perfecting forgiveneſs, more then this, that it fitteth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to receive it: And this is no Doctrine of the Man of Sin, it was the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. True (ſaith he) it was ſo in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Contrition and Confeſſion went before Remiſſion; But in the New Teſtament, Remiſſion doth go before Contrition.</hi> This is ſoon ſaid, But how is it proved? What text of Scripture, what Argument from any text of Scripture? The worldly Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was it not a figure and patern of Heavenly things? May we not ſee, as the mercy of God ſhadowed forth in thoſe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Expiation, ſo the Duty of the ſinner expreſſed in thoſe Legal Purifications? To this he Anſwereth, <hi>That Contrition went before Remiſſion in our High Prieſt: He was bruiſed, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſlain before any Remiſsion;</hi> This no man doubteth: But we demand, Whether, as then, Contrition was required of the People, before by their ſacrifice they could have Remiſſion: So now alſo, it be not required that Contrition be found in us before we obtain Remiſſion by the ſacriſice of Chriſt; At no hand will he endure to hear of this: <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our ſins, offereth for our ſins, maketh peace through his Blood, and calleth upon us to believe this Peace and Atonement made.</hi> This we deny not, But ſtill inſiſt upon this, Whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition be not required of Believers in the New Teſtament, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:113960:38"/>
well as of them in the Old Teſtament, to make them capable of Remiſſion; If not, What is there in the New Teſtament to anſwer to that figure? I finde it interſerted in a parentheſis, <hi>That Preiſt, ſacrifices and people, were all of them figures of Chriſt:</hi> What the meaning of it ſhould be, I cannot gueſs, except it be this, That Chriſt muſt be all, and do all: Upon him muſt lie no leſs the work of Repentance for ſin, then of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus ſhall the burthen be increaſed to him, that ſo it may be caſed to the ſinner; had the Scripture revealed it ſo to be, we had received it; now we may not. Well it is that Chriſt hath done for us, what we could not, <hi>viz.</hi> He hath made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; It is not much if he require of us what we may well do, <hi>viz.</hi> To be truely contrite and penitent for our ſins. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Faith which is the knowledge of Remiſſion muſt needs go before Contrition, elſe would it be ſin: For whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin, Rom.</hi> 14. 23. I might juſtly reply and ſay, Like point, like proof. Neither is juſtifying Faith the knowledge of Remiſsion; Nor doth that text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak of juſtifying Faith. But this I ſay, That if Faith be the knowledge of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> fully paſt, and already in poſſeſſion, it doth rather take away Contrition then call for it: There is no place for ſorrow in Heaven; the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, who are in full poſſeſſion of Remiſſion, do not now any more weep and ſhed tears for the ſins that they have committed. He addeth, <hi>We do not therefore believe Remiſſion, becauſe we repent; But therefore repent, becauſe we believe Remiſſion.</hi> I Anſwer, We do both; we believe Remiſſion, becauſe we do repent, not as if there were any merit in our repentance to deſerve it, but becauſe there is truth in God to perform his Promiſes: And we repent, becauſe we believe Remiſſion. Here note, That to believe Remiſſion may be conſidered either in the Promiſe or in the Performance: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Remiſſion is made for the Penitent, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance required as a mean to fit men for it. Is not this evident by the Preaching of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. and 3. 19. The performance of this promiſed Remiſſion doth preſuppoſe Penitency in the ſinner; yea and doth put him more upon it. So that, as of Faith there is one act that doth go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:113960:38"/>
Remiſſion, and another act that doth follow after: So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Repentance, there is ſomthing of it doth go before Faith, and ſomething alſo doth follow after.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſaith this Author, <hi>Judas Repentance may go before Faith, i. e. before the knowledge of Remiſſion: But Godly Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance doth follow after.</hi> I might reply, That is improperly ſaid to go before this Faith, when as this Faith doth never follow after. Doubtleſs if Faith be the knowledge of Remiſſion, it doth never follow upon <hi>Judas</hi> Repentance. But this I rather reply, That it was not a <hi>Judas</hi> Repentance that went before Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Old Teſtament; nor is it a <hi>Judas</hi> Repentance which the Apoſtle doth call for, to this end, that their ſin might be blotted out, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19. Nor can it with reaſon be denyed, but that he who ſaith, <hi>Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out—</hi>doth leave them to conclude, that unleſs they do repent their ſins ſhall not be blotted out: And again, that if they do repent, their ſin ſhall be blotted out; Conſequently, there is a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which is required as a mean to obtain Remiſſion, and that by the warrant of Scripture-Text. And therefore it is no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Antichriſt, not footſtep of the Man of Sin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Repentance as a mean of Remiſſion.</p>
               <p>But now to return to the Queſtion propounded, <hi>viz. Whence is it, that ſin doth trouble and terrifie the Conſcience?</hi> I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give this anſwer; The reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe ſin is not yet taken away out of the Conſcience by the Application of the blood of Chriſt.</hi> To ſay that there is no ſin at all in the Conſcience, when we feel the ſting and terror thereof, is it not in effect to ſay. No mote in the eye, no thorn in the fleſh, when we feel the pain and pricking of it? How doth it vex if it be not there? Doubtleſs while it vexeth it is not quite taken forth; nor is the rankling of it quite healed: The Indiſpoſition of the Body may adde to the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the minde, till it be removed and cured by Phyſick: But when the body is in good order, and yet the Conſcience in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual diſtreſs; doth it not appear that ſin lyeth at the Door, and muſt be removed out of the Conſcience by the Application of the Blood of Chriſt? Application of the Plaiſter is no leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary then the preparation of it. The Brazen-ſerpent ſet up cured none that would not look up to it: Nor doth Chriſt cure any
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:113960:39"/>
that will not believe him. And how do we believe in him, if we do not apply our ſelves to him for remedy?</p>
               <p>This application of the blood of Chriſt is wrought by the Minſtery of the Word and Sacraments; hence it is called <hi>The Miniſtery of Reconciliation;</hi> In which and by which God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth his favors and comforts to them of his Houſhold: And by thoſe Ordinances doth he bring home the blood of Chriſt to the Soul and Conſcience of the worthy receiver.</p>
               <p>And as in the Old Teſtament the guilt of ſin was not removed out of the Conſcience, till the ſacrifice appointed for this or that ſin was offered (which is not improbably aleaged as a reaſon why the ſin of <hi>David</hi> lay ſo heavy upon him, even becauſe he made no haſt to confeſs his ſin and to bring his ſacrifice, without which no Remiſſion) ſo in the New Teſtament, ſin is not removed out of the Conſcience, till by the Miniſtery of Reconciliation the blood of Chriſt be applyed to the Conſcience for the cure thereof: God hath appointed the Miniſtery for this end, and he will have his Ordinances honored, and workings of his ſpirit in them acknowledged. It is not for this cauſe that many who ſeek for Comfort with much importunity of prayer and ſupplication, yet are held off for a long time; Even becauſe they do not addreſs themſelves to God in his Ordinances? And here is that neceſſity and uſefulneſs of Baptiſm to take away ſin out of the Conſcience, which ſo much diſpleaſed the Antinomian Doctor, nor of Baptiſm only but of the Lords Supper alſo; yea of the whole Miniſtery of the Goſpel: Not as if the Word and Sacraments, or the Miniſtery that diſpenſeth them, had any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and efficacy in themſelves: But as hath been ſaid, becauſe theſe are the Inſtruments of the ſpirit in applying the blood of Chriſt, which alone is the remedy of our ſpiritual malady.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note:</hi> This Miniſterial Application is only to the worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; And none ſuch doth the Text of Scripture acknowledge, but him who being truly humbled and grieved for his ſin, for this and that ſin in particular, doth judge himſelf: And then by Faith looking up to Chriſt on the Croſs (as did Iſrael look up to the brazen ſerpent) and reſting upon the paſſion of Chriſt, as the only ſatisfaction of Gods juſtice, deſireth to be purged in his Blood: And in teſtimony of his Faith in the blood of Chriſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:113960:39"/>
doth draw near to the Ordinance of Application, that therein he may be made partaker of the blood of Chriſt, to purge his Conſcience, and quiet his minde: And here is the neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without which no Remiſſion (the ſecond point of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſm in the Antinomians account) Not as if Repentance hath any efficacy of a meritorious, yea or of an efficient cauſe; but becauſe Faith neither ought, nor indeed can cloſe with Chriſt, and draw vertue from him for the purging of the Conſcience, but when it ſelf is lodged in a penitent ſoul: The Reaſon is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſo muſt the promiſe of pardon by Chriſt be receiv'd by man as it is tendred to him: And this is not to the ſinner as a ſinner, but to the ſinner as humble and penitent, as before was ſhewed.</p>
               <p>So then the Anſwer of the Queſtion returns to this, Sin doth yet terrifie the Conſcience, notwithſtanding that Chriſt on the Croſs hath ſatisfied for it, and ſo obtained reconciliation for the ſinner: Becauſe otherwhiles men are not careful to ſeek for the Application of Chriſts blood to themſelves, in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances appointed. What wonder if <hi>Iſrael</hi> dye of the ſerpent bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, if they will not look up to the Brazen ſerpent: ſo here, if men neglect the means of remedy, what wonder is it if they lie and languiſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But even they that have often ſought to God in theſe Ordinances; yea and with much care have prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the worthy receiving of the ſacrament, yet do not finde that peace of Conſcience which is expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> It may be ſo, But do they withal reſt upon it as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the ſpirit to apply the blood of Chriſt, and ſo to ſeal unto the ſoul the Aſſurance of peace and pardon? Do they I ſay reſt in it; or do they expect to receive their Aſſurance by ſome irradiation and immediate revelation of the ſpirit? This is the error of ſome; Others are careleſs in their walking afterward: They forget that Caveat of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The Lord will ſpeak peace to his people: But let them not return again to folly,</hi> Pſa. 85. 8. What wonder if the re-admiſſion of ſin into the ſoul, renew the ſting and terror of Conſcience. Satan re-entring brings ſeven other ſpirits worſe then himſelf: Hence commonly the terror af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward is greater then before: Impoſſible it is that the ſoul ſhould finde ſweetneſs inſin, deſire it, delight in it: And
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:113960:40"/>
the Conſcience not fear and tremble at the thought of Hel, and the wrath of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> To cloſe up all: Is the Conſcience terrified? See the way to finde remedy, and how thou maiſt provide for comfort. Not in the Antinomian way, <hi>viz.</hi> by a violent perſwaſion of this, <hi>That thy ſin was long ſince laid upon Chriſt in the day of his Paſſion;</hi> But by ſeeking for the Application of his blood in the Word and Sacraments. Prepare thee for the worthy receiving of them, by renewing thy Repentance: By Faith look upon Chriſt in the Sacrament, hear him ſpeaking in the word, as the aſſured remedy of all ſpiritual diſeaſes and diſtreſſes: carefully watch againſt future Tentations; take heed of relapſing into ſin: Remember that as Chriſt hath joyned theſe two Petitions, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our Treſpaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Lead us not into Tentation;</hi> ſo hath he bound up the comfort of the former, in the cautelous obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the latter: Whoſo doth not watch againſt Tentation, loſeth all comfort of Remiſſion.</p>

In the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is enjoyned to look to the ſtranger within his Gates, no leſs then to them of his family: The ſtranger might not be permitted to pollute the Sabbath, nor to prophane any of Gods Ordinances.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſa</hi> compelled the People to ſeek the Lord God; And <hi>Joſiah</hi> cauſed them to enter into the Oath and Covenant: From which Texts it is evident, that the power of the Magiſtrate in matters of Religion is both Coactive, and Coercive: Coactive in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them within, Coercive in reſpect of them without the Church: Strangers are not indeed compelled to ſanctifie the Sabbath, but reſtrained from prophaning it.

(perad venture overmuch) clemency towards Hereticks: but if we do remember that God who is immutable in his eſſence, is alſo unchangable in his will, nor doth he ſo expreſs his minde in any one text of Scripture, that it ſhould draw with it the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of another, if rightly underſtood: And if we hold that rule of Interpretation for good, which Divines deliver, <hi>viz.</hi> That where there is a ſeeming repugnancy in the Texts, there it is fit that plain precepts ſhould guide our practiſe rather then dark and obſcure parables: We ſhall eaſily conclude, that the meaning of our Saviour is not to forbid the uſe either of the ſpiritual or civil ſword; Both which are the Ordinances of God, inſtituted of God for the Coertion and Reſtraint of them that do evil: And yet if this word muſt ſtand, Let them alone till the Harveſt, there will be no uſe of either the Civil ſword for the puniſhment of Malefactors, nor of the Spiritual Cenſures for the ejection and exciſſion of ſcandalous offenders. For why? Theſe Tares in the Parable are expounded to be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the wicked, <hi>i. e.</hi> of that wicked one the Devil: And why this Text ſhould be ſo expounded as to favor Hereticks ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Hypocrites, I mean ſuch whoſe practiſe is not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, nay contrary to their Profeſſion, I deſire to learn from theſe men, who it ſeemeth preſume to know more of Gods minde then he hath revealed in the word.</p>
                  <p>The precept of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13. is plain, and his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe according, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. Nor could Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> otherwiſe reconcile theſe two, but by this Interpretation of that parable, That inaſmuch as there is not much difference and diſſimilitude betwixt the wheat and the tares while both are in the herb, the intention of our Saviour is to premoniſh us not to be overhaſty in pronouncing ſentence, where there is any ambiguity and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, but rather reſerve it, and refer all to the judgement of God: And he giveth this reaſon of ſo doing; Becauſe it may come to paſs, that he who to day is depraved in his judgement, may repent and amend to morrow, yea and return to the truth, in which we may rather commend his gentleneſs, then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to his judgement, in the ſence of the parable; the ſcope whereof doubtleſs is not to teach lenity and mildeneſs in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt <hi>Hereticks</hi> (the word is not, Let them alone yet a

little, or be not ſo haſty. But, until the harveſt, and that is at the end of world; Till then let them grow ſaith the parable: and yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>An Heretick after the firſt and ſecond admonition reject)</hi> but the intention of the parable doubtleſs is to ſhew, that there is no expectation of univerſal purity in the Church of God during this life: There will be tares always till in the end of the world there be made a total ſeparation. This is the intent, and farther then ſo it is not doctrinal.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, they ſpeak reaſon, who granting the tares to be <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But this farther obſerve, that he who forbad the plucking them up, did not forbid to hinder the ſowing of them. Good therefore is the councel of Saint <hi>Jerome, Quam<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So then, It is evident, that he who forbade to pluck up the Tares, did not forbid to hinder the ſowing of them: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if we mark it, the Queſtion in this point of compulſion and liberty of Conſcience, is not touching what is to be done with them that are of another minde, But what is to be done with them that publiſh their erroneous Opinions, and ſeek to druw diſciples after them: Nor touching them that receive not for truth, whatſoever is decreed by the verdict of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but touching them that oppoſe and contradict it as errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

It were, I confeſs, overmuch to binde me to believe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Synod concludeth: But it is not unfitting for Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to reſtrain my hand and tongue from open oppoſition and apparent contradiction.</p>
                  <p>I cloſe up my thoughts of this Point, with theſe few Rules, which I conceive fit to be thought upon, for the prevention of Schiſm, and the preſervation of peace and unity.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In things decreed by Authority, and enjoyned by Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, the Queſtion that Subjects are to debate, is not, <hi>An hoc ſit optimum,</hi> but, <hi>An hoc ſit illi citum:</hi> Not, whether it might no be better; But, whether this be ſo bad, as not to be endured Reaſon; Becauſe if it be not unlawful in it ſelf, it is for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be received, and a fitter apportunity to be waited for, when in humility we may tender to Authority a farther light of information.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The plea of Conſcience is not an excuſe for our not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the Command of Authority, ſave only in the caſe of that weakneſs before mentioned; <hi>viz.</hi> When having uſed all good means of farther information, yet the underſtanding is not able to overmaſter the ſcruple of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Not they who differ in Opinion, from what is decreed by Authority, but they that publiſh their Opinions are juſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. For why? Though the thoughts of the heart fall not under the command of the Magiſtate, yet the publication of them doth; Becauſe, hereby the Peace of the Church, and the Purity of Religion may come into danger; And the care of theſe is committed to him, and only in this care of his doth he ſerve God as a Magiſtrate, and go beyond the ordinary ſervice of the Chriſtian, According to that obſervation of St. <hi>Auſtin, Epl.</hi> 50. <hi>ad Bonifacium, Aliter ſervit Rex quia Homo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aliter etiam quia Rex.
