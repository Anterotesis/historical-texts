            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But were it so, that this chaunge were for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than might man iustly receaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by the consideration thereof. But alas it is so farre from that, that on the contrary parte, we maye beholde in so many and so often mutations, decay in euery one, &amp; eche one worse then other,
<pb facs="tcp:14639:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
&amp; so the last worst of all the rest. Which thyng ryght well appeareth, aswell by diuine as prophane wryters in euery age, amongste whom the poetes (not without great consideration) esteemed the first to be lyke golde, the next so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed that it was from golde abased to syluer, the thirde to brasse, the fourth of lesse price and halue, and was become lyke iron, whervpon they all lament the decay of vertue, loue, and feare of God, decay of charitie, decay of true fayth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of mutuall loue, decay of fidelitie &amp; good conscience, decay of obedience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of humilitie, and finally and chiefly decay of deuotion, prayer, and heauenly contemplation, whiche ought to be the roote out of the which all the rest should growe and flooryshe, as proceedyng fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a perfect loue and reuerent feare of God: For by the decay therof, God is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vppon for his grace and assistaunce, he is not thanked &amp; praysed for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye and great benefites, the rewarde of his mercy is not desired, the horrible pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshement of his iustice is not feared,
<pb facs="tcp:14639:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whereby we lyue as though we had no nede of God, and as though we hoped for no better, nor mistrusted no worse than we fynd here, as though God were not the rewarder of vertue and punysh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of vice, and finally as though there were no God at all, no resurrection, no heauen nor hell. So as in this tyme these olde verses are more than trulye verified here.

For if God be, why acknowlege not we his power, maiestie, and omnipotencie, and honour hym thereafter? If God be mercyfull, why craue we not his mercy?

But forasmuche as there passeth no moment of tyme, in whiche we haue not great nede of the helpe &amp; assistaunce of almightie God: There are we of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie constrayned by continual prayer, humblye with all diligence to require and craue his diuine helpe and succour. For who is he that perceyueth not
<pb facs="tcp:14639:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(so as he geue his mynde diligently to obserue the same) that all we are euen presentlye to be returned to duste and asshes, whensoeuer God should detayne and withholde his hande of helpe from ouer vs, and that there is no man of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer without him, to endure the space of one moment of tyme, as Iob sayeth. <hi>In eius manu est anima omnis viuentis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. xii.</note> In his hande is the life of euery liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

And lykewyse must it nedes happen vnto euery one of vs, yf God su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne vs not incessauntlye with his mightie hande and power.

But forasmuch as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this vnderstandyng and sense, there is no man that by actuall prayer (as we call it) doth satisfie and fulfyll the same wordes of our Sauiour, that is to say, euery moment to continue in prayer: Therefore we had nede to searche out some other sense and meanyng thereof. And in deede, this saying of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, may rightly be otherwise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded? As thus. A certayne Monke, one of the olde fathers, beyng demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded howe he fulfilled that saying or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
<pb facs="tcp:14639:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Christ, <hi>Oportet semper Orare,</hi> made this aunswere: When I haue (sayeth he) finisshed and sayde my dayly prayers, the time that remayneth, I vse to bestowe in labouryng with my handes, as farre forth as the habilitie and strength of my bodye doth permit, whereby it commeth to passe, that dayly I gayne somwhat, with the whiche I may relieue not onlye my selfe, but also some other poore people. And they (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he) pray for me, as ofte as by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes &amp; trouble of my body, I can not pray for my selfe: And by this meane, he dyd beleue that he satisfied the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. And he had the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture agreable with his opinion, whiche sayeth.<note place="margin">Eccle. xxix</note> 
               <hi>Absconde Eleemosinam in sinu pauperis, &amp; ipsa pro te orabit.</hi> Hyde thy almes in the bosome of the poore, and that shall pray for thee. See than, howe the holy scripture confirmeth that our almes doth pray for vs: and therefore, if a man apply his mynde to shewe mercy and pitie to his neighbours, yf he seeke to defende the Orphans and fatherlesse
<pb facs="tcp:14639:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
chyldren, if he labour to comfort the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes whiche be destitute of all consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he be carefull to deliuer those that be oppressed with violence, from iniury and wronge: Finally, yf he shewe hym selfe redy to helpe to his power, any that want succour or reliefe, so that besydes all this he neglect not the ordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted times for prayer, by the Church of God, he may well be iudged to haue fulfilled the former wordes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. For that man doth pray alwayes, eyther by him selfe, or els by his almes and charitable deedes, whiche supplieth all the want that appeareth in his owne prayer. In this wyse than, maye the wordes of Christ aforesayde, be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, wherin he teacheth vs alwayes to continue in prayer, whiche is as muche to saye, alwayes to lyue and do well, whiche doth sometyme happen to menne, yea when they be slepyng. For as ofte as we do slepe or wake, walke or sit styll, eate or drinke, be vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or be in quiet, or what els soeuer we do or suffer, yf all these doynges
<pb facs="tcp:14639:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be with a true fayth referred to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory of God, no doubt they appertayne to the increase of a good and perfect lyfe. For if it were not so, Saint Paule woulde not haue wylled the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, that whatsoeuer they did, thei shoulde intende and direct the same, to the glory of God, saying vnto them. <hi>Siue editis, siue bibitis, siue quid aliud fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">i. Cor. x.</note> 
               <hi>omnia in gloriam dei facite.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye eate, or drinke, or what thyng els soeuer ye do, do al to the honour of God. And surely, yf God be moued with our wordes and speaking, to be gracious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, he wylbe muche more stirred to the same, by our good workes and well doyng, forasmuche as workes do nowe supplye the place of wordes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fauour of GOD is turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs by our good workes, whiche we do to this ende, and of purpose to please his diuine Maiestie: For they do expresse the vehemencie of prayer, and that much more mightely then the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers them selfe. Therefore, whosoeuer referreth all that he doth or suffereth,
<pb facs="tcp:14639:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onlye to the glory of GOD, he surely prayeth continuallye, and doth at all tymes, satisfie this aforesayde precept of Christ. For we may iustly say, that he doth continue alwayes in prayer, which alwayes directeth his workes and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>nges, to the honour and glory of God. But albeit this saying, <hi>Oportet semper Orare,</hi> maye be vnderstanded in this sense: Yet notwithstandyng, because Chryst hath of purpose appoynted a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwene praying and workyng, and declareth a great diuersitie, betwene almes, prayer, and fastyng: Therefore we shall nowe adde vnto these two, a thirde vnderstandyng of the same. Sainct Paule doth admonishe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Thessalonica, that they shoulde pray incessauntly, saying: <hi>Sine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missione orate.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. v.</note> And in many places of his Epistles, he declareth that he dyd without ceassyng, remember dyuers in his prayers. Moreouer in the Actes of the Apostles it is wrytten,<note place="margin">Act. xii.</note> that whylst Peter was deteyned prysoner and in captiuitie, the Churche of GOD made
<pb facs="tcp:14639:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
continuall prayer, and intercession for him. By the whiche wordes it is many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and apparaunt, that euery true Christian man, doth pray in euery acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and worke he doth, yea although he slepe. The whiche thing can not be true in any wyse, except we do by prayer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande the continuall desyre of the hart, whiche is alwayes strong, and hath his continuall motion in mans mynde. For like as a man beyng bounde in pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with wayghtie fetters of yron, is compelled by the tedious werynesse of those miseries and afflictions whiche he indureth, vehemently to desyre, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly seeke for libertie. And yf he haue once conceyued any maner of hope of his deliueraunce, he than incessauntly longeth, wissheth, and desireth to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from those paynefull bandes.

               <hi>exaudiuit domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> GOD hath harde the vehement desyre of the poore. For doubtlesse, the earnest desyre of those that be vexed and punished in minde and soule, doth spedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye breake in, and maketh a redye waye to the presence of God hym selfe, and rayseth a wonderfull outcry and noyse into his eares: And therefore foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as suche and the lyke desyre, neuer ceaseth in the hartes of good men, but is

continuallye occupyed, and mooued by grace, so that they do alwayes desyre and long for the succoure and ayde of God, his myght, and power, and that whether they slepe, wake, eate, drinke, or whatsoeuer thing els they do, these men may iustly be iudged alwayes to pray, and that without any intermission. For the declaration whereof, Sainct Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine sayeth thus. <hi>Sine intermissione orare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sainct Austust. in the. Cxxi. Epistle, ad proban. the .ix. Chapter.</note>

And without this hartie desyre, it is not any noyse or sounde of wordes, be it neuer so long, that can stirre vp the eares of almightie God.

And in another sense, a man can not easely conceyue howe he may, or is in any wise able con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually without ceassyng to pray: But by the feruencie of this desyre, whiche is neuer quenched in the hartes of good men, prayer is alwayes and incessauntly made before God, and we do continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally knocke at the gates of the mercy of God, beggyng of hym his grace and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine assistaunce.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND nowe lette vs shewe forth an other reason, whiche may eftsones moue and stirre our myndes to prayer. It is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt and well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen that the principall and chiefe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes belongyng to man, is called &amp; estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the true perfection of eternall felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the which is appoynted by God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, for his laste ende. But no man can be able to reache and atteyne to this ende, without such ordinarie meanes as God hath appoynted to leade vs vnto the same. And amongste many other meanes, there be two whiche yf a man once perfectlye haue obteyned, he shall not lyghtly want the rest, which be also necessarie for the obteynyng of this bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: and those verylye be prayer and good workes. In those two meanes, we reade in the Actes of the Apostles, that
<pb facs="tcp:14639:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Cornelius the Centurian was moste commonly exercysed, by the which he so pleased God, that albeit he was an eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nycke and infidell, yet was it sayde vnto hym by the Angell of God:<note place="margin">Actes. x.</note> 
                  <hi>Orationes tue, &amp; eloemosine tue, ascenderunt in memoriam coram deo.</hi> Thy prayers and almes deedes haue ascended into the sight of god, and are remembred of him. Therefore he that wyll exercise himselfe in these two, that is to say, in prayer and good workes, he shall surely neuer want the rest, which be the other guydes to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall felicitie. For God his wyll is, that we should humiliate and deiect our selues in the sight of his maiestie, vtterly confessyng, and acknowledgyng, that of our owne power and strength it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that we should do well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that a good lyfe (whiche is continued in the practise of good workes) is to be craued at his hande by continuall prayer. And that by these meanes, we may at the last ascende and come vnto this last appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ende for man, which is eternall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie with God. And therfore, forasmuch
<pb facs="tcp:14639:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as without the benefite commyng of the vse of good workes, no man atteyneth to this appoynted last ende for man, and also that the grace of good lyfe can in no wyse be obteined without prayer, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that yf we mynde not to fall into eternall miserie, we must continuallye frequent this prayer. And nowe let no man obiect vnto me in this case, the foo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyshe, pyuyshe, &amp; beastly argument, and persuasion of the prescience of almightie God, which can not be deceaued, and yet some there be that saieth thus, God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeth and assuredly knoweth al that euer shall happen after, before it be eyther thought or done by man: And now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he knoweth that either I shal be saued in ioy &amp; felicitie, or dampned to perpetuall tormentes &amp; misery. But if he knowe I shalbe saued, what neede haue I to praye for that I am alredye assured of, and shall haue it without any maner of praier, euen only by theffect of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of God, whiche can not be decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. On the other side, yf he by his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge perceaue me to be dampned, no prayers in the world are able to profit

me, forasmuch as his prescience can not be disappoynted or chaunged. Ueryly, this croked dilemma, or false subtyle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, hath seduced very many, but howe very a sophisticall fallax it is, we shall shewe and declare afterward much better, yf we do firste make profe, howe the same argument is vtterlye voyde, standeth not, nor hath any consequence, in all other thynges whiche daylye do happen and chaunce vnto vs.<note place="margin">I notable example agaynste reasonyng of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God.</note> As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.

very argument, all the art of Phisicke and benefite thereof destroyed: Let vs proue howe well it wyll stande in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The husband man wyll say, I wyl not sowe, tyll, &amp; husbande my grounde, knoweth not GOD whether this fielde shall without my labour bryng foorth plentie of fruite yea or naye? But yf he knowe it shall so do, than needeth it not my trauayle, and paynefull husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng: yf otherwyse, I shal but labour in vayne. And by this argument, destroye also all maner of husbandry, and tylthe of the earth. The lyke successe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion shalbe founde in all other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, if they be in the same maner sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; compared together. And therefore by these it is very apparaunt and many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that the firste supposed reason is of no validitie, but vtterly false and deceyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: For yf it myght be true, than were it by the same reason neyther needefull nor wysedome for the sicke to seke phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, nor the husbande man to labour to manure and tyll his grounde. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the husbande man may not loke

for fruite of his fieldes except he tyll and sowe, neyther yet the sicke man atteyne his health except he be content to folow the aduice of his phisition: Euen so can no Christian man atchieue the fruition of perfecte felicitie, vnlesse he fyrste haue the grace of God to lyue well, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto can he not at any time come, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe and meane of continuall &amp; faythfull prayer. And like as we do most commonly see for trueth, that those sicke men must needes peryshe that refuse the medicines, councell, &amp; aduice of their phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and that those fieldes be without all doubt barreyne and fruitlesse whiche want manuryng and good husbanding: Euen so maye we be well assured, that without prayer &amp; good workes, it is not possible for vs to obteyne euerlastyng felicitie. And therefore, albeit that God hath ordeyned that eternal beatitude, as the supreme, &amp; last ende to all good men, yet was it not his wyll that man should atteyne vnto the fame, but by such iuste meanes as he had appoynted. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, first and principallye, if a man do
<pb facs="tcp:14639:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not first begyn with a good lyfe, let him neuer loke to end with that glory which is to come, and therewith lette no man thynke to obteyne the grace to lyue wel, excepte he do by daylye and continuall prayer, craue &amp; begge the same of God.

For we seke in euery corner a felicitie which may satisfie vs, and fulfyll our desyres, and we foolyshly thynke that it may be gotten eyther of worldely pleasures, of riches, of honours, or at the least, of them all ioyned together, wherby it foloweth, that we neuer make an end in desiring &amp; sekyng for them, yea &amp; for the gettyng of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> groweth the disturbaunce of al good orders, and the confusion of all thynges

knowledge in this state of lyfe, that he standeth and remayneth in the fauour of God, yet by certayne coniectures, he may assuredly beleue it, specially if he knowe hym selfe free from any deadly sinne, of the whiche he hath not alredy repented hym selfe, and eyther confessed him selfe, or els purposeth assuredlye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to confesse the same to his ghostly father in tyme conuenient: And therewith yf he fynde hym selfe apte, redye, and wyllyng to the doyng of those thinges, wherewith God his honour may be aduaunced, yf he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyght in hearyng of the holy and sacred worde of God, read and preached, yf he seeke to be often present at the diuine seruice and prayse geuyng to the name of God: And finally, if he intende as far forth as he maye, to abstayne and flee from thence forth, from all contagious corruption of sinne: Ueryly this man may assuredly beleue that he is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the state of grace, and in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God.

And this feare is taught and perswaded vnto vs, by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Scripture, where it is written: <hi>De propiciatu peccatorum noli esse sine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu.</hi> Be not out of feare,<note place="margin">Eccle. v.</note> and altogether carelesse of thy sinnes forgeuen.

But whan a man hath with this consideration, in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie deiected hym selfe in the syght of the maiestie of God, it is further very necessarie, that he do diligently examine and weygh with hym selfe, what it is that he intendeth to require of God in his supplication and prayer, lest perhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes his requeste be hurtefull vnto hym selfe, and such a peticion no man ought to loke for at Gods hande. For almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God who is of his owne nature most gracious and well wyllyng to man, can not graunt to his beseacher and suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt his suite and request, where as it is knowen vnto his diuine wysedome, that the same shalbe hurtfull and peryl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous vnto hym that requireth the same.

he could attende all those thynges toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his prayer, so as the heede takyng eyther to the wordes, or the meanyng of the wordes, shoulde nothyng slacke his diligent and attentiue mynd to god hym selfe, that maner of prayer, were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse most excellent and beneficiall. But because it can scarcely be possible that a man in earnestly heedyng and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one of these, shall not negligently omit and forget the other, let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perticulerly inquire of euery one, whiche is the better, more necessary, and more fruitefull. And amongest these, there is no man that diligently conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the thing, that can or nede to doubt, but that the attention whiche is directed vnto GOD hym selfe, is the chiefe and moste meritorious, so that all other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be agreeyng vnto the same, that is, if that same prayer directed vnto God, be in no wise more neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t than the other, whiche is intended eyther to the wordes or meaning.

And therefore if a man be so atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and diligent in vttering the wordes

of prayer, that he neyther regarde nor obserue the scope and ende whiche the holy fathers (whan they ordayned those prayers) iudged and determined chiefely to be considered, I may in no wise allow or commende this maner of prayer, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as chiefe, or more fruitefull than the others. And yet would I not that others, whiche contrarywyse so rashely runne ouer the prayers appoynted, that scarsely they can vnderstande them selues for haste, neyther regardyng the superexcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of hym, to whom they pray, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet imagining of any further sense and meaning of the wordes they speake, I woulde not (I say) that those shoulde make my speache before, any maner of colour of defence for theyr errours and abuses. For I speake it not with that minde to mislike or condemne them that regarde the wordes they speake, who I knowe do obserue and fulfyll the lawe and order: but to this ende, to perswade vnto those a more excellent maner of prayer, and therewith more fruitfull. It may be also, that those which are chiefly

sensible taste and feeling of that supreme delectation and comfort, whiche he onlye knoweth, whom God hath graunted to taste the same. But marke and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this, that the imagination whiche our mynde frameth to it selfe of GOD, must neyther be subiect to colour, light, figure, or briefly any wordly or corporal shape, for all those thynges beyng crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are playnely besydes God. And we seeke to ioyne our selues with God and nothyng els, besyde him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a man wyll ryghtly thinke of God him selfe, let his mynde ouertunne all worldly creatures, and conceiue him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye alone whiche is highest, best, most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, most mightie, and him that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, doth vnspeakeably excede all other thinges. If thou canst this do, than thinke the same to be present with thee, and yet without imagination ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of colour, lyght shape, or fourme whatsoeuer, and than hast thou ryghtly thought of God. In whiche worke and busynes, yf thou be paynefull, and wyll diligently exercise thy selfe, than shall

But yet yf this maner and forme of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, seeme at the beginning harde and vneasie to any man, let him fyrst exercise him selfe in thinking and contemplation of Iesus Christ, who besydes his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is also very God.

As though he woulde haue sayd, my soule by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the spirite of God, hath conceyued in it self, so merueylous a delyght in god, that by the great delectation therof, euen my fleshe is also replenished and watered ouer and ouer, wherein it hath so reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that it could not refrayne or staye it selfe from expressyng and shewyng forth the pleasure whiche it had receyued. And surely this delectation is a very sparkell or glimering resemblaunce of the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life, whiche all good men shall haue after the generall resurrection of theyr bodyes.

Lo than howe the mynde of God abhorteth those persons that be newters, and be neyther hotte nor colde. We must therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour our selues by all meanes to be feruent in charitie, for the kyndelyng of the whiche in vs, no doubt prayer is the most necessarie thyng. The whiche cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie beyng once gotten, we be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged cherefullye to take in hande all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynges, which we trust shall please God, and for the doyng whereof, we shall by the goodnes and promyse of God, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with euerlastyng ioy and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And therefore our speciall endeuour in the tyme of our prayer, ought to be, that the feruent heate of charitie myght
<pb facs="tcp:14639:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be kyndeled in our hartes, and in suche sort shall it be conuenient to moderate the length of our prayer, so as that ende maye both be acquired and preserued in vs. And therfore whan we in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do perceaue this feruentnes of mynde once kyndled in vs, by the weaknes and wearynes of our bodyes to waxe colde &amp; faynt, than is it tyme to ceasse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and occupie our selues about some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertuous exercise. For if we should so long continue, that the feruentnes of deuotion shoulde be vtterly extynguysh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vs, we should not only not obteine the end which is sought for by our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but we shoulde also geue no small oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to procure the contrary. For so sone as by ouerlong continuyng in that dulnesse of prayer, the feruentnes therof &amp; deuotion is once colde in our myndes, we do forthwith lose the inwarde conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our myndes, whiche that fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie of deuotion, not beyng vtterlye extynguyshed, wrought and preserued in vs, wherby it doth many tymes folowe that we wander abroade, sekyng some

And it appeareth, that this was the cause why they vsed so often praiers, because they woulde oftentymes renue and kyndle agayne the fyre of deuotion in theyr hartes: But the cause why they vsed short prayers was only this, lest by length of prayer and tediousnes therein, feruent deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before conceaued, might be dulled, cooled, &amp; finally extynguishe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And therfore a man in prayer must spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially labour and take heede, that when God hath once kyndled that feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion in his hart, he by negligence suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not the same vtterly go out and dye. But so long as the same may eyther be increased or contynued, we ought not to leaue of prayer, excepte eyther the great weerysomenes of our bodyes, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lyke necessitie inforce vs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both the shortnes &amp; length of prayer, is to be ruled &amp; measured, to and for this ende aforesayde.

In lyke maner as yf a man,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude aptly applyed.</note> whan after muche trauaile, he hath passed the Seas, and hath obtayned harborowe and his desired Hauen, leauyng his shyppe whiche brought him to the hauen, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nowe to thende and purpose for the which he arriued, and thinketh nowe no more of his ship. Euen so veryly, he that by the vse of pronounced prayer, as by a meane, is caryed into the inwarde conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the minde, and commeth to the spirituall feruencie in God, ought nowe to haue his principall care and study bent on this, that this heate in no wyse waxe colde, and leauyng nowe the prayer of the mouth, he must folowe the spirite of God, the minister of this feruent deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whyther soeuer it doth dryue hym. And nowe let hym not vse any more his owne wordes, but onlye those whiche be suggested inwardly in the hart by that holy spirite of God, and let him aske that of God with vehement and feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of mynde, without any pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
<pb facs="tcp:14639:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or sounde of wordes. But to the ende thou mayest more playnely &amp; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly perceyue, that this maner of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whiche is done by the spirite and minde, is much more excellent, than that whiche is vttered in wordes, heare what our Sauiour Christ sayeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospell: <hi>Spiritus est deus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. iiii.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; qui adorant eum in spiritu &amp; veritate oportet adorare.</hi> God is a spirite, and they that adore him, must adore him in spirite and trueth. Lo, as God is a moste spirituall thyng, euen so requireth he a moste spirituall sacrifice. And therefore that prayer is more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto hym, whiche is offered by the spirit and the minde, than the only grosse vtteraunce of the voyce, whiche can not be framed without the bodyly breath. And let not this moue the, that <hi>Adorare,</hi> is named in that place, and not <hi>Orare,</hi> for the one of them shall neuer well be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, but whan God is prayed vnto, than is he also adored, and whan he is adored, he is also prayed vnto. And therefore God wylbe intreated with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and mynde of the moste chosen and
<pb facs="tcp:14639:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
excellent myndes, whiche he moste spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and desireth, such as in his Gospell he noteth, to honour and adore hym in spirite and trueth. Wherfore I nothing doubt, but many godlye and spirituall men (whiche haue diligentlye exercised them selues in prayer, and haue accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med dayly to eleuate theyr hartes vnto GOD, and haue at some tymes tasted and conceiued the sweetenes of that fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent affection) haue much more profited by that prayer of their hart, than yf they had sayd an endlesse numbre of prayers and Psalmes with theyr mouth, whiche thyng some do, ouerchargyng theyr mindes, yea, and rather excluding them selues from the very ende of prayer, for that in that case, they can neuer be able to tast the spirituall sweetenes of perfect praier. And out of doubt, that desyre and trauayle to perfourme the saying of so great a number of Psalmes, doth many tymes hynder and turne away the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious visitation of God from the hartes of them that labour in them, whiche otherwyse he would willingly and redy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
<pb facs="tcp:14639:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
exhibite vnto them.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the redye assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of God in Prayer.</note> For lyke as the sonne doth euery way disperse and sprede abrode the beames of his lyght, euen so is God redye on euery syde, to powre forth vpon vs the sweetenes of his grace and goodnes, except by suche lettes and hinderaunces, all excesse and entry to our myndes be stopped, and the way hidden from vs, as it were with a thicke &amp; darke miste. For he that desireth to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of that sweetenes, maye in no wyse geue heede to any other thyng whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be, but attende only and wholly to God hymselfe, yea, and that withall his harte. But those other attende neuer a whit to God, but onlye regarde howe to vtter out those numbre of wordes, which they minde to say: Neither do thei co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the present Maiestie of god, but only how they may most speedyly runne ouer their number of psalmes, with the care where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they do so occupie and ouercome theyr mindes, that no drop of heauenly sweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, can in any wise enter into them. And yet do thei thinke &amp; perswade themselues, that by so doing they shall specially please
<pb facs="tcp:14639:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God, and can not be quiet or satisfied in conscience, vntill they haue by one way or other, ouerrunne and finished that huge number of Psalmes. Yea, and yf they chaunce by forgetfulnes to pretermit any part vnsayde of that (I meane not which the Churche appoynteth to be sayde) but whiche they of theyr owne wyll haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hande to say, they fynde theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science greeuouslye therewith offended, wherewith they be miserably tormented, and theyr hartes torne and rent. Those men truely do not sufficiently waygh the saying of S. Ierome, whiche is this, that the saying or singing of fiue Psalmes with a pure and sincere hart and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ioy and gladnes, is more worth than the whole Psalter, ouerrun with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and troubled mynde. And yet is it more meruayle that they heare not, or at the least marke not Christ himselfe in the Gospell, geuyng admonition and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting suche as pray, not to bende theyr la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to speake much, saying in this wyse: <hi>Orantis, nolite multum loqui.</hi> Whan ye pray,<note place="margin">Math. vi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> do ye not speake muche, not to this
<pb facs="tcp:14639:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ende, that by those wordes it were to be vnderstanded or thought that Christ mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked a long continued prayer, whereas we reade that he himselfe continued very long in prayer: But he would not in any wyse, that we shoulde put a vayne trust in a number of wordes, by one waye or other made vp and multiplyed, speciallye whan they vtterly wanted all deuoute affection of the minde, and that we should not hope that he would sooner be moued, with a multitude of wordes, than with a well affected mynde. For God is muche more inclyned to heare our petitions by the onlye feruent affection of the harte, than by neuer so great a number of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des pronounced without suche affection. For the whiche cause Sainct Augustine sayeth thus. It is one thyng to speake much, and farre an other to be much and well affected. It is one thing (sayeth he) to continue speach long, and much another to continue deuotion long. That man speaketh much to God, that thinketh his mercy is to be wonne with a numbre of wordes onlye. But truely he vseth not
<pb facs="tcp:14639:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be moued with the multitude of speach, but with the quantitie and aboundaunce of deuotion and godly affection. And the bare sounde of wordes pronounced by the lippes only, maketh a very dull sounde in his eares. But the feruent and vehement affection of the mynde, doth quickely and speedyly penetrate them, and that because God is muche more delyghted with our godly affection, then with our bare praier, and specially whan that affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with feruent sighes &amp; aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teares, do pearse the heauens. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye that maner of prayer, if God were (in a maner) vnexorable, woulde ouercome him to mercy, and be he neuer so omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, wyll binde him to graunt our lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full desires. And surely the same prayer, is muche rather framed and perfected in the spirite &amp; mynde of man, and so sooner presented vnto God, than by any wordes that mans mouth is able to perfourme or expresse. For the spirite and soule of man, beyng once quickened and kindeled with the feruent fyre of deuotion, much sooner
<pb facs="tcp:14639:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dispatcheth his intent and purpose, than any motion of the lippes, or framed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the mouth were able to do, whiche thing (yf none other) maketh apparaunt the thing wherof we haue so long intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is to say, the prayer of the minde and soule onlye, to be more excellent and better, than the praier of the mouth: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuche as both the motion of the lippes is very slowe, and the corporall weyght of the tongue, vttering forth his wordes, not so apt to folowe the quickenes of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and also muche hynderaunce folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth by openyng and shuttyng the mouth, so that they can not in any wyse, serue the swift motion of the soule and mynde, and speciallye at suche tyme, as the mynde is inflamed, and deuotion fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentlye kynde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed therein. For in that case, it is caryed with suche a swyftnes, that the fleshelynes of the mouth, tongue, and lyppes, can in no wyse folowe it: And yf they shoulde, yet do they bryng no benefite to the spirite, but onlye a wayght and heauye burthen. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I woulde admonyshe all suche as
<pb facs="tcp:14639:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
delight in prayer, and willingly studye to serue God therewith, and specially suche as haue leysure to attende the same, and to bestowe very much of theyr tyme ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that they do not vnprofitably ouerlode themselues with to many words in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but that they woulde from henceforth dayly bestowe so muche tyme in kynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng theyr myndes, in castynge theyr thoughtes and affections vpon God, and in the receyuing his mercyfull visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into the bowels of theyr hartes, as they haue spent lesse fruitfully heretofore, in ouerrunnyng a multitude of wordes with small consideration or weyghing of them, to the ende that by this meane, they may at the laste obteyne and come vnto the tast and feeling of that vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sweetenes, whiche thing surely they shall attayne vnto, yf they first do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyly prepare them selues in suche sort, as we haue shewed before, and than do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye offer theyr myndes in the syght of God, and finally apply theyr carefull stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye and intent, to perfourme and finishe theyr prayer, with all attention and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb facs="tcp:14639:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of theyr hartes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And yet they shall do well to begin with vocall prayer, and specially with suche, whereby they haue founde them selues before moste easyly kyndled and inflamed to deuotion, and the other contemplation of theyr soules. But whan after theyr begynnyng a whyle, they shall perceyue them selues inflamed and sweetely affected with the inspiration and mercyfull visitation of the spirite of God, and pleasauntly dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen towardes his heauenly presence, than leauing to vtter or pronounce their prayer, let them folowe the leadyng of the holy spirit of God in them, and than let them labour in the silent prayer of theyr mynde, with compunction of hart, sighing, and teares, crauyng onlye those thinges of God, whiche his spirite shall put them in mynde of: And chiefely to begge of God the continuall presence of his grace, so that he forsake them not, but that it maye please hym to graunt those thynges vnto them, whiche his wisedome knoweth and seeth to be most expedient and profitable for them. And
<pb facs="tcp:14639:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
surely yf they do persist and continue in this trade and fourme aforesayde, they shall not only be vnto God, dayly more and more gratefull and acceptable, but they shall also proceede dayly more and more, in the increase of feruent charitie, and shalbe made lyke vnto the heauenly and Angelicall mindes, which dayly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the presence of God. For what cause is there (although they remayne here in earth, and be couered with the vessell of mortall and corruptible fleshe) why they shoulde not be called moste lyke vnto the Angelles, whan theyr prayer is lyke vnto the prayer of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles? That is to say, they pray in soule and mynde, and taste in theyr soules the lyke sweetenes as the Angelles do, yea, and do perceyue and feele within them selues the pledge and assuraunce of the felicitie to come, whiche the Angelles nowe alredy do enioye: So as they do nowe want nothyng of the absolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblaunce vnto the Angelles, but only the fruition of the ioyes and glory to come, whiche so soone as they be rid out
