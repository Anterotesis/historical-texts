         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

AND MIGHTIE PRINCE
ELIZABET, by the grace of God
Queene of Englande, Fraunce,

the fayth. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Preſented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your Highnes (moſt
gracious Soueraine) the
Concent of the holy Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
endeuoryng there
to ſhewe, that all the
Booke of trueth brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
from one ſpirite.
That coulde not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
vnles the times
had a moſt exact playnnes: which I recorded to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynly
chayned, euen from the fall, to the Redemption.
For that, I layde downe the pure wordes of the text:
whereof an angel tolde: That from the ende of Iudahs
captiuitie 490. yeeres are pared out vnto our Lordes
death. Againſt this last part, a Learned man of Oxford
long diſputed: not denying the wordes to haue Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
in them, nor yet differing from mee for their
beginning and ende. but affirming, That the Angell
meant no certaine tyme. And ſetting aſide the Angels
<pb facs="tcp:6170:2"/>
wordes, he affirmeth, That from Olympiades 560. yeeres
preciſely may be gathered by the Greeke affayres: And
going on by the Iewes common weale, maketh a partitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
He maketh the Temple (a marke moſt famous) the limit
of both partes: as I had done, but not in lyke tyme.
From Zorobabel and Ioſuahs returne from Babel, he
maketh yeeres an hundreth and ſeauen vnto the buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Temple. There I ſay that ancient Ebrewes
vniuerſally, ancient Greekes vniuerſally, and Latines
moſt generally olde and late, keepe them within 32. yeres,
and that Scripture and lyues of all famous men agree
with that. After the buylding of the Temple, are by
him to our Lordes death 453. yeres: which I wyll grant
him, and fiue more. In this laboure of his I blame his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
of two generall errours: That he diſanulleth the
propriety of the Angels wordes, and affirmeth, that the
returned from Babel lyued 107. yeeres to buylde the
Temple. He read twelue monethes, as his hearers trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed.
Some of his Lectures he ſent me, by which I might
iudge what matter could be in the reſt. I could haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
that he woulde eyther haue ſpoken where I myght
reply, or haue printed his opinions, that rumors myght
not preuayle aboue iudgement. I haue printed many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
workes againſt him. The ſumme of them is this:
That all his gaynſaying is extreamely erroneous: and
that he hath not blamed with any colour of ſounde lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
one worde of my Booke. Thoſe ſmall workes of my
Defences for our Religion, and common trueth, oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by one pretending peculiar differing from me: who
for theſe two poyntes haue all Nations, Religions, and
Studies, on my ſide: Them I humbly commende to your
<pb facs="tcp:6170:2"/>
Highnes, that they may be cenſured by ſome Learned,
countenanced as trueth requireth, and conſidered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the honour of your gracious gouernement.
A priuate cenſure hath paſſed betwixt vs all ready.
For my Lord Archbyſhop of Canterburies grace, was
choſen vmpier, and examined both ſides argumentes.
I hope I may with modeſty pleade his teſtimony, though
for my ſelfe, yet in a publique cauſe: where it is good for
all to knowe the full ſtrength of the trueth. His Grace
did wholly approue the Concent for euery whit: where
his wiſedome ſaw Heathen (that deceaued Diuines)
confuted moſt plentifully, by moſt ancient Heathen of
their owne kinde, and vniuerſally by all Iewes. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
former Chriſtians folowyng Gentiles on Daniel,
folowing Iewes in Ezra, his Grace ſaw them holpen from
errours, by their owne graunt: that when the D. and I
ioyne iſſue for the ſpace betwixt the Alter and Temple:
Prophane heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue there no worke: but olde Diuines
Ebrew, Greeke, Latine, tell him, that he went very farr,
further then they woulde wiſh him. And touching croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Angels propriety, I can not thinke that Europe
beareth one learned Chriſtian, or that Iury (which trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
at Gabriels oration) hath now one man, that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the number vncertaine. I thinke his Grace will tell
your Highnes ſo much. And your Maieſties ſignification
of your Princely determination, woulde more breake
young brauing Studentes, whom reaſon in ſuch vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
ſoyles can not bende. I greatly reuerence my lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
aduerſarie, and commende him, that he woulde not
haue all libraries ſet on flame by fire of iudgement in few
wordes, without tryall in one twelue monethes fight.
<pb facs="tcp:6170:3"/>
But I ſhoulde more commende him now, if at the laſt
he woulde tell, how playne the Scripture lay alwayes,
though no heathen before ſetled Iubilees aright with the
Chronicle. His fame of Learning, and my more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
reſistance, maketh many thinke that the Scripture
is hard, where our long labours differ. The fault is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
in the one of vs two, eyther in him or in mee:
and the faulty ſhoulde be forced to yeelde, that none
thinke amiſse of Gods worde. I refuſe not to abyde all
diſgrace, yf my trauels be not founde true for the ſtory,
profitable for the quietnes of the ſtate, and fit for a Prince,
reigning in theſe weſt endes of the earth, the poſsesſion
of Chriſt. Our Marchantes that paſſe ouer all Nations,
can not carry into the Eaſt more noble marchandiſe
from the Weſt, then skil of teaching Greekes, vpon what
occaſion, euer hitherto they miſſed 1500. yeeres in 4000.
and marred all the holy ſtory, and loſt religion: and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Chriſtian Arabians to follow and fayle alike.
And that poynt hath been hence firſt opened, in
that lytle worke to your Maieſtie, and in a further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it. Likewyſe, where by the tyme and kinred
of Chriſt, they may moue any Iewes: there, I truſt, that I
may affirme, without chalenging more then due, that to
your Highnes firſt, both poyntes were declared in full
and conſtant Concent. What the paynes hath been to
contriue vnto agreement ſo many moſt intricate pointes,
as for this harmony of Scripture haue been ioyned, from
eaſt writers of hard and diuers tongues, and ſubtilties:
not Ebrew onely, but Syriaque and Chaldean, in ſundry
Dialectes from Greekes and Latines of all ſortes, auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the errours of all, bringing nothing but matters of
<pb facs="tcp:6170:3"/>
difficultie, and all iudged faultleſſe: any may iudge, that
conſidereth but the hardnes of the leaſt of theſe ſtudies
ſeuerally. The payne is augmented by the greatnes of the
charges: not mainteined by great allowance of Diuinity,
but gotten through Ebrew skill, and ſpent on Diuinity:
though it be a rule of God and man, that none warre on
their owne charges. Yet duetie bindeth all men to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as they can, celeſtiall knowledge. But paynes in this
ſort, loſeth much of the due encoragement. And ſome
encreaſe of grieſe I felt, that when I had a meaning to
looke to my ſelfe by other meanes then Diuinity: I was
requeſted by one of your Maieſties honorable Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
a Diuine, to take rather your Highnes preferment:
the delay whereof hath hindred myne owne courſe.
But all this may ſoone be cured, when it is knowen to
your gracious care ouer Learning.</p>

to all the Realme, with what
vehemencie and care D.R. la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored
to proue, that a Concent
of Scripture for certaintie of
Chronicle coulde not be made.
By reaſon of his former credite, he hath drawen
many to deny that, which they alwayes helde:
&amp; to be againſt them ſelues, to countenance him,
and to diſgrace mee. I thought ſmall skill might
ſerue in an Apologie for all men: and was ſo bolde
as to pronounce him more groſely deceyued,
then euer I knew any man. And content coulde
I haue been, to haue tryed by diſputation, or by
printing: not minding to leaue off, vntil my booke
to her Maieſtie (which he laboreth wholly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace)
ſtandeth by open iudgement, or falleth to
my continuall diſgrace, and laſt paynes in ſtudie.
<pb facs="tcp:6170:4"/>
When he had long read to proue that <hi>Mardochai</hi>
was not of <hi>Iechonias</hi> captiuitie, and had made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
commende his cauſe (we both graunt that to
ende our ſtrife) and they being called to reade the
text, loathed their owne inconſtancie: Yet then
this was tolde me, that ſome Oxforde men requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
anſwere of me. Therevpon I wrote to <hi>D. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon,</hi>
Prouoſt of the Q. Colledge, certaine The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which might ende the cauſe: requeſting his
alowance, or reiection: with this addition, that I
thought it iniurious that Oxforde men ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
me to defende that, which they euer helde:
vnleſſe they woulde proteſt, that eyther their
mindes were altered, or that they were vnable: and
of <hi>D. Reynoldes</hi> I wrote, that he was extremely cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
in blaming me for differing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: where
none euer was, nor wylbe of his iudgement; and
by his owne wordes he is vtterly condemned.
Vpon this, <hi>D. Reynoldes</hi> commeth to London to
me, ſhewing that he was willing to take any iudge:
and both we agreed vpon your Grace, &amp; you my
L. B. of London, that we might haue the cauſe
fully ended, without partialitie to the credite of
either, clearely to the glory of God, and brightnes
of his trueth: That whether ſoeuer hereafter ſhould
make any ſtir in the cauſe, he ſhoulde be openly
culpable by all cenſures. My matter is opened in

him to do ſo much, yf he meane to defende him

and ſhort declarations, to giue an inſight to the
matter: a copie whereof I coulde wiſh D. R. yf
he would: as I would gladly giue him any thing
for a Booke of his whole Lectures againſt mee. If

a litle the knowledge of Chriſt, the peace of the Church,
and honour of all humane good learning. My defenſes I
hope, proue my cauſe to be ſounde. And not onely that,
but a more playne dealing vſed, then I haue founde from
your Studentes. I wyll touch what I wrote: and your
mens iniuries: and require your cenſure. Firſt the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of <hi>Mardochai,</hi> wrytten without open noting any
perticuler aduerſarie, proouing all Churches and Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goges,
and the natiue iudgement of all playne folke, to
be of my ſyde, myght haue quietly appeaſed all ſtryfe, or
haue dryuen all you to haue defended your owne cauſe.
Moreouer I, though I ſtoode in poſſesſion of the ancient
opinion, and by that onely myght diſgrace the replyer,
conſented to abyde arbitrement, which commonly
would part ſtakes. Beſides, I chayned holy teſtimonies
for the ſeruice of Shemeſh, vnto that bleſſed ſeruice of
redemption, that the cauſe myght match the Sunnes
brightnes in the ſimpleſt ſight: and the ſpeach of euery
<pb facs="tcp:6170:6"/>
part appeare of one tenour in phraſe: that he which wold
be tropique in one poynt, ſhould be guilty of threatning
the lyke to all. Some learned ſtrangers, thought that
paynes the beſt of mine. But ſome ſayd, that your D. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
to anſwere that: being whole the expreſſe worde
of God. Such reuerence holy <hi>Euthyphrones</hi> gaue Gods
worde. Beſides, your D. affyrming, that there was not a
Chronicle in the Bible, diſputed vpon <hi>Abrabams</hi> tymes,
and the <hi>Iudges,</hi> to proue them vncertayne. I marueyled
what he ſhould meane to diſturbe the trueth, in that moſt
famous place: where God vpon <hi>Terahs</hi> death, bagan a
new accumpt from Chriſtes promiſe. The Sunne dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
not more from the dimmeſt Starre, then that
poynt differeth from obſcuritie. And the ancient Grekes
ſaw it ſo wonderfull a matter, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould tell of
<hi>Terahs</hi> death, telling in the eight aboue onely all their
yeeres: that to hide the wonder, they put in eight tymes,
and he dyed, S. Stephen and <hi>Philo</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might haue tolde your D. that antiquitie therein
made no doubt. Neyther did euer any Englyſhe differ
from me for <hi>S. Stephens</hi> wordes. For the <hi>Iudges</hi> times, my
Booke woulde haue tolde him by perticuler accomptes,
where <hi>S. Paul</hi> bringeth 18. ſtories to one worde: that no
Virginalles were better in tune, then that harmonie of
time: though your D. would needes be buſie with me
for the ſeauen yeeres of Conqueſt, and the ſeauen Iubilees
to <hi>Samuel:</hi> feauen Seauenties to <hi>Nebucadnezars</hi> warre, the
ſeauenty of Captiuitie, and thence the ſeauen Seauenties.
But for <hi>Abrahams</hi> Promiſe, I moſt labord to reforme
him: that he might not preuayle to marre the two moſt
heauenly Promiſes, and nobleſt ioyntes of all the Bible:
that, and the other to <hi>Daniel.</hi> In a diſputation vpon <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedek.</hi>
I conueyed a redreſſe of his opinions: which
becauſe ſome litle marked, afterwardes I graued in braſſe,
by reaſon of ſome Pictures, a view of the whole Bible,
<pb facs="tcp:6170:6"/>
freendly amending his breaches of all the buylding.
This alſo being vnregarded, directly do I reproue your
Studentes, as denying the Redemption by a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent:
who holde, that it fell not out in the time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
tolde: whereas men and Angels wyll holde, that
otherwiſe it coulde not be from God: and the Iewes
ſeeke no more colorable defence then to proue, that the
proper time cannot be proued to agree with the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Therein alſo I founde your Studentes enemies to
Gods trueth, as before: and bitter, becauſe I liken them
to <hi>Nero,</hi> harping at their owne cities flames. Hearing of
their rage againſt my cauſe, and mee for that, I wrote a
ſmoth treatiſe of the whole time, with fuller handling of
euery ioynt, as though I had no aduerſary: with a Preface,
telling what ſome others thought of him, whom yours
do ſo much deſpiſe: thinking that among indifferent
<hi>Athenians Eſchines</hi> muſt giue leaue to <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely
accuſed, to proue how for all his times, others
woulde haue made him a garlande. Thus I haue tolde
what, and why I haue printed. Now for the next poynt,
I thinke it not amiſſe to call your Studentes dealinges to
accompt, and to requeſt, what Chriſtian defence they
can make, that the pleaſure which they tooke in ſpeaking
againſt the trueth, and the defender, may be bitternes to
them in hearing a recompence, I wyll not complayne
what hinderances and griefes they wrought me: but call
them to accompt barely, for bad dealing.</p>

for if he liuing ſo long after great <hi>Alexander</hi> were ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felow

<pb facs="tcp:6170:11"/>
whole ſpeaches in the later Attique oratours talke in the
ſame tenour of <hi>Conon,</hi> and the equals, as knowen well to
ſome then alyue. Thus <hi>Grecia</hi> is with S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S.
<hi>Luke,</hi> in their ages: and not I, but your D.hath the new
opinion. For ten by him muſt draw 527. yeeres in their
ſuccesſions: the lyke where of ſince <hi>Dauids</hi> tyme, that is
2500. yeres, the Sunne neuer ſaw. I may not blame him
agayne for callyng thoſe ten men the glory of all the
earth, and rare argumentes for this cauſe, <hi>Obſcura ſydera.</hi>
But this I may tell, that a diuine, M. I. I. bred at <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
there in iudgement holden inferiour to none of yours,
ſeeing in the countrey your Doctors booke of Lectures,
was greeued to ſeetherin for thoſe ten men theſe wordes:
<hi>Autoris Concentus obſcura ſydera.</hi> The man him ſelfe tolde
mee: And gaue your diuines this prayſe, that they were
indifferent iudges: and ſayd, that your D. was now out
of his ſtudies. That, all the worlde may ſee, whom ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
blyndeth not. But how then wyll he be able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the Church, pretending trueth and antiquity, and
defence of the ſetled opinion, diſturbyng all Englande,
all Europe, and Aſia. May not I require that he be called
to accompt, for what one ſyllable in my Booke for this
matter, differing from others of our beſt he blameth me,
and putteth me to priuate paynes and charges, for the
deſence of the publique trueth? If the young ſtudent
delyght in floutyng, let him ſee whoſe dealynges deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
that: your Doctors, myne, or his owne?</p>
            <p>A graue Preacher dwelling betwixt Algate and Bow,
gaue this cenſure: that your D. and one other D. wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
both contrary to them ſelues, and to the thirde that
helde the true, beginnyng vpon affection out-off their
ſtudie, had made many Athieſtes. The man, yf partiality
might ſerue, is knowen otherwiſe bent. Many haue ſayd
ſince: What, ſhall we ſtudy the Bible, when ſo great
Scholers cannot agree? And a Preacher of your breede,
<pb facs="tcp:6170:11"/>
now teaching in London, ſeeing your D. confuted, ſayd,
For two pence halfepeny he woulde be of eyther opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
to ſuch a paſſe come your Diuines. They triumph
at the firſt, as hauing caried away Burlyſpoyles, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
laude: how one is by yours confuted, for endeuoring
to proue, that God draweth vs by the Sunnes Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
vnto the Sonnes iuſtice, contriuing all Libraries, all,
playnely to this high poynt. When the matter is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
that he confuted the trueth, himſelfe, and all the
worlde: then a new peſtiferous errour is bred, that the
matters are ſmall: though they be the harmony of all
Scripture, and ioy of Chriſtianity. An other B. of D. of
yours neare Lon. thanked God, that he neuer troubled
his head with theſe matters: That is, why God vpon
<hi>Terahs</hi> death, leaueth to honour man with the Sunnes
ourneys, and tyeth all to the promyſe of Chriſt: and
what wiſedome <hi>Gabriel</hi> promiſed to teach <hi>Daniel.</hi> Belike
yong diuines are in deepe myſteries, that can diſpiſe ſuch
high poyntes.</p>
            <p>But here I muſt needes pardon your young Students;
whereas Preachers abroad, ſome not of your breede, fall
to groſſe ſchiſme. A certaine learned man was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
vnto a charge, one that helde my ſtudies for the
trueth of the frame of the Bible not vnprofitable. An
aged graue Gentleman liked well to collate a place on
him. Certayne that would be counted Preachers, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of that which they call reformation, aboue al holyer
knowledge, come to the Gentleman with greater heate
then the Terentian Chremes came to Simo, charging the
Gentleman in his conſcience, that the ſhoulde not prefer
him, for the doctrine which he liked off. The gentleman
aſked an olde great-learned man, what he thought of the
doctrine, and of the man. He ſhewed how groſly the
Preachers were deceaued. Becauſe of their calling, I wyll
not lyken them to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Capper-ſmith: but I
<pb facs="tcp:6170:12"/>
am ſure that <hi>Paul</hi> would abandon them. Olde <hi>M. Iohn
More,</hi> preacher of <hi>Norwich,</hi> lately a neighbour of theirs,
one in their zeale, but ſeaſoned better, no colder then
they, &amp; as great a ſtudent in the text Hebrew &amp; Greke,
as they knew any: he was of an other ſpirit, &amp; diſdayned
not to treade in euery ſtep, where theſe men, like <hi>Paris</hi>
of <hi>Homer</hi> ſhrunke, as if they had troden neare a Serpent.
I know it to be farre from your D. minde, to pricke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
rumors in that kind. And I thinke that he is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
how zeale (as Iewes proued) running afore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
is the ruine of Religion: and knoweth tradeſinen,
who be cunninger in the depht of the holy booke, then
the common ſort of teachers: whoſe zeale medleth not
beyond their owne boundes. I would not be thought to
thinke, that your D. could fauour ſuch dealings: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they wil needes be ſhrowding vnder his winges, I
thought good to warne of that. This euil ſowen by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
your D. is like a Grangraena further growing. A
Cambridge man that liueth in Eſſex a Scholmaſter and
a Preacher, meeting with a Gentleman that knew from
<hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> the frame of the Bible better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he, was counſelled by that Gentleman to make a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
of chriſtianity, how in al ages it was cleere (before he
trauelled to ſtir the ſimple vncertainly) and to make the
people know the euerlaſting certainty of ſaluation, by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, the Goſpel, and the Epiſtles. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that ſome bookes of Scripture could neuer yet
be vnderſtood: namely the Reuelation. The Gentleman
vſing an inſtance from ſome for that, he ſayd, that your
D. had confuted that paines: though he medled not with
one worde. You may ſee what harme to himſelfe, and to
the Church is wrought by his reading, being miſtaken,
and miſreported. I could wiſh that he would eyther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
all his gain-ſayinges: as I charge him, that they be
all iniurious &amp; erronious: or print al his lectures, which
<pb facs="tcp:6170:12"/>
I ſaw for the one halfe, an yeeres reading, that all might
ſee what is in controuerſy.</p>
            <p>Marke further infection of an other learned man: I
know not whether he were bred amongſt you, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Gentleman, whom I neuer ſaw, writeth to a friend
of his from Dunſlei in Staffoideſhyre, to a Londoner
thus: <hi>Dec. 20. 1592. I hearde not long ſince, a learned man, yet
ignorant, and ouer ſwift in iudgement, diſprayſe this Booke (of</hi>
Scripture Concent) <hi>as needeleſſe, and a ſuperfluous worke:
of whom I demaunded, whether he did know it: or euer read it.
His anſwere was, no. How can you giue iudgement then, ſayd I,
of that you know not. He anſwered, that he heard ſo. Thus lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the counſell of</hi> S. Iohn, <hi>which biddeth vs try ſpirites, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be of God or no: ſuch fall into the curſe of the Lord,
that call lyght darknes, and darknes lyght: that iudge good euyl
and euyll good. Although he tooke himſelfe learned, I am ſure
he was not able of his owne pregnant wit, ſo much as to reade
ouer the booke in ſuch order as it requireth, without an inſtructer:
much leſſe then to vnder ſtande the ſame, and the drift therien.</hi>
The Gentleman that wrote this, fauoureth much your
ſtudentes, and hearing of my iuſt griefes, wrote a requeſt
to beare with the loſers. But when he perceiued the
ſtrang dealinges of ſome from you, and ſauage barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſnes,
he was of that mynde, that pitty may not marre
the citie. VVhat ſome Doctors of <hi>Cambridge</hi> thought, I
recorded. One being at <hi>London</hi> vpon your Doctors firſt
Antilogy, being aſked of a Londoner, what he thought
of the Booke which your D. confuted, ſayd thus: The
argument is as profitable, as could be choſen for this age.
Then ſayd the Londoner: yf it be ſo, VVhy did none of
you DD. or of the BB. take it in hande? Then ſayd he:
The man who tooke it in hande knew, by reaſon of his
ſtudies in the tongues, longer then any others, that he
was ableſt to performe it. Truely, I woulde not for any
preferment, haue troubled her Maieſtie with accepting
<pb facs="tcp:6170:13"/>
any worke of mine, aboue all others in the kinde: in
yeeres the youngeſt of dealers in ſo weighty affaires, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
I had thought my houres moſt of any in that ſtudy,
and my ſelfe able to keepe our nation from all foyle for
accepting my paynes. And I know that by that helpe,
an other may ſee more into Scripture by a learned guide
in few monethes, then I coulde before I founde the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
in ten yeeres. And acertaine Nobleman of my age
tolde me, that he learned more in two houres by that
helpe, with open ſpeach vpon it, then by all his former
paines. I hope you wyll beare with me: the cauſe is not
now mine owne. And I may giue as good leaue to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
the cauſe, as the defender. <hi>Pericles</hi> or <hi>Neſtor</hi> would
do this vnprouoked. <hi>Iob. Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> would in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
ſpeake of them ſelues. And as I made the cauſe
from priuate by arbitrement to be publique, ſo I wyll
enterlace here the teſtimony of a publique perſon. The
Archbyſhop of C<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="2 letters">

yeeres errours, ſo to cleare the holy ſtory, as the booke of
Concent hath done. Of what ſpirite then ſhal we holde
Studentes, that cannot abide their owne Religion to go
cleare forwarde, nor the publique teſtimonie, which
ſtandeth as the Princes owne? I moſt humbly woulde
intreate her Maieſtie to commaunde that a publique te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
which might be knowen ouer the Realme,
may paſſe betwixt ys. But now I deſire your goodnes to
giue your teſtimony, eyther in print, or as you wil: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I holde not the trueth, and haue bin more groſly
iniuried<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then euer any by any of a contrary religion. I
hope all wyll ſo conclude, who reuerence learning, care
for trueth, honour Scripture, and regarde Religion.</p>
