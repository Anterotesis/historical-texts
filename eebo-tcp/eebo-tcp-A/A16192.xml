            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Pſalme, is, touching the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the righteous.

            </q>
            <p>THe Prophet begins with an excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ſigh, ſorrowing that ſo few do tread in the pathes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes. Ye know there is but one God, but many Legions of Deuils: and wee find, that the deuill hath more friends in the world, then God. For Chriſt our Sauiour had onely <hi>Pilats</hi> wife to entreat for him: But all the multitude cried out, Set <hi>Barrabas</hi> the murderer at liberty.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, the ſoule is but one; yet doth an armie of luſts fight againſt it; and who can tell how oft they preuayle? When this Scripture is verified, that the ſingle woman hath more children, then ſhee which hath an husband; is that ſinne bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren? <hi>Precioſa non ſunt numeroſa.</hi> Good men are odde men. Helpe, Lord, cries <hi>Dauid,</hi> for good men decay. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous periſheth, who layes it to heart?
<pb facs="tcp:14715:4"/>
Waſps and Hornets ſwarme: the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders egges are many: there is an harueſt of Vices crieth to the Lord for a ſickle: Sinne ouerflowes like water, who ſeeks to ſtop the ſtreame? Aske the earth: it will ſay, I yeeld much matter to make pots of: but little duſt, that Gold comes thereof. Aske the Gardiner: he will ſay, I haue more weedes then flowres, more nettles then Roſes, more brambles then Vines. Aske thine owne conſcience: and it will anſwere, There is great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men, <hi>magna ſolitudo bonorum,</hi> which walke vndefiled in the way of the Lord. Cheriſh therefore ſuch as feare God; there are but fewe of them. Let a vile perſon bee deſpiſed in your eyes; there are too many of them.</p>
            <p>And this I take to be the reaſon why the Prophet doeth ſigh, that ſo many ſeeme bleſſed in ſhew, and ſo fewe in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <q>
               <pb facs="tcp:14715:5"/>
               <hi>HAISH:</hi> that is, <hi>that man.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>IN the Scriptures, Man hath three names: <hi>Adam,</hi> in reſpect of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Red earth: <hi>Aenoſh,</hi> in reſpect of his fal, Wretched: for nothing makes the people wretched, but ſinne. And here he is called, <hi>ISH; a virtute,</hi> which is, Bleſſedneſſe. Hereof comes <hi>Iſhah: vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rago,</hi> a woman of Vertue. Happy hee that meeteth with ſuch a match; Pearles and precious ſtones are not comparable to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ISH,</hi> is a man of Vertue and Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Wiſedome is the gray haire; the vndefiled life is the old age; to depart from euil, this is vnderſtanding. <hi>Iſhachar,</hi> is a great boned Aſſe; ſeldome lodgeth Wiſdome there. Behold, the Bee is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but his fruit is ſweet. The Oke is great and tall, and his fruit is fit for hogs. The Peacock is fayre, but proud. The Vine is lowe, and creeps by ground: but
<pb facs="tcp:14715:5"/>
it yeeldeth wine acceptable to God and man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ingenio pollet, cui vim natur a negauit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The power of God is declared in weakneſſe. Bleſſed therefore is that man of vertue and wiſdome.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>The firſt ſtep to bleſſednes, negatiuely; is, <hi>not to walke in the Counſell of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>COunſell, as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, is <hi>Hieron ti,</hi> a diuine thing: like the water ſpring, the deeper ye draw it, the ſweeter. Like a ſweet perfume, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the ſpirits. Where many are that can giue good counſell, there is ſafety. Bleſſed is he, that hath grace to follow it. Counſell in Hebrue, is <hi>Gnatſa,</hi> of the root <hi>Gnets,</hi> A tree. For as a good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and an euill tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth euil fruite: ſo all men reſemble the maners of their Counſellers. There is no ſinne almoſt done without counſel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14715:6"/>
Would <hi>Achab</hi> haue wrung by violence the Vineyard from <hi>Naboth,</hi> but for the wicked counſell of <hi>Ieſabel?</hi> Would <hi>Abſolon</hi> haue continued his Rebellion againſt his father, but for the peſtilent counſell of <hi>Achitophel?</hi> Could <hi>Amnon</hi> haue compaſt his ſiſter <hi>Thamar,</hi> but for the aduice of his Attendants, Make thy ſelfe to be ſicke? Such dead Flies corrupt ſweet oyntments, infect many yong men and Maydens. Would God there were none ſuch in Iſrael.</p>
               <p>The root of all actions, is counſell in the heart. The heart is like a Mill, euer grinding good or ill thoughts. Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therefore is this prayer: <hi>Make me a cleane heart, O God, and renue a right ſpirit within me.</hi> Our Sauiour ſayth, that from the heart, come the things that defyle a man. Once the Lord ſent a floud to waſh it: now there needes a fire to purge it. The firſt ſtep to murder, is anger. Where lurketh anger? In the heart. Chriſt ſaith, that to looke, and to luſt after a woman, is
<pb facs="tcp:14715:6"/>
adultery. Where reſteth luſt? In the heart. If the Fountaine be thus corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, can the riuer be wholeſome? If the Conſcience be polluted, no puddle, no ſinke ſo vnſauory as it. Bleſſed is he, that reſiſteth the firſt motion and entiſement to euill. The Poets counſell is, <hi>Venienti occurrite morbo:</hi> before ſicknes, take Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſike: reſiſt a miſchiefe in the beginning. Would you haue inſtance hereof? A ſparke of fire in the end of a ſtraw, is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put out: but if it catch the truſſe, it hazardeth the houſe. The ſeed of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and hereſie being but in one, is eaſily ſuppreſt: but if it be ſpred, it wil require <hi>Hercules</hi> labour to roote it out. The he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy of <hi>Arrius</hi> was firſt aſparke; being neglected, it ſo ſpred, that as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayth, <hi>Totus orbis ingemuit, miratus ſefactum Arrianum.</hi> Therefore little things are not to be deſpiſed. And though ſome ſay, <hi>De minimis non curat lex:</hi> yet a little pricke of a rapier, may make a deadly wound. A great tree groweth vp of the
<pb facs="tcp:14715:7"/>
leaſt graine of Muſtard ſeed. A drop of water is a ſmall thing, yet many drops wil ſinke a ſhip. A haire is leſſe, yet hath it choked a big man. So the luſts ſeeme tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, but by continuance get dominion, to the danger of the ſoule, Go not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after thy luſts, for it will make thine enemies which hate thee, to laugh thee to ſcorne. Reſiſt a miſchiefe in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; admit of no ill counſell: and this is the firſt ſtep to Bleſſednes.</p>

The counſell of buſie-bodies is euer dangerous. Such in Law, are called Pettifoggers; they breed multiplicity of ſuits and actions. In the Church, ſuch are the ſactious; they break all good order.

                  <p>TO walke, is to delight in: Looke what company we freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for ſuch ſhall we be deemed and eſteemed: for experience teacheth, that Birds of a feather doe flock together.

What can be more dangerous to Gods children, then this? Doe not euill words corrupt good maners? Doth not a little leauen ſowre the whole lumpe of dowe?

For this cauſe was antiquity ſo ſeuere: for it was not lawfull for á Iewe to connerſe with a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritane. If an Hebrue did eate with an Egyptian, it was counted abomination. Therefore hath the Church ordayned excommunication. If any that is called a brother, be a whore-maſter, a drunkard, or a couetous perſon: with ſuch doe not eate or drinke, receiue him not into thy houſe, ſay not, God ſpeed, Iend him no countenance. Canſt thou not ſhun him with thy body? yet be ſeuered from him in thy mind: for pure deuotion is this, to keepe our ſelues vndefiled from this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked world.

               </p>
               <p>The firſt, is the Doctors chaire. The ancient cuſtome was, that Doctors did preach ſitting. Our Sauiour in Nazareth after the Lecture of <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſate downe and taught. The Scribes and Phariſes did ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire. Hereof Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall churches haue their name, where there is ordinary teaching. GOD.
<pb facs="tcp:14715:13"/>
forbid that any chaire ſhould be without a teacher, or any Biſhops ſeat long voyd; for then the people will mourne.</p>
               <p>THe ſecond is the ſeat of Iuſtice, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the good, to puniſh the wrong doer. Sweet is that melody conſiſting of theſe 2. poynts, mercy &amp; iudgement: for <hi>ſummum Ius</hi> is <hi>ſumma iniuria:</hi> extremity of law, is open iniuſtice. He that blowes his noſe too hard, wrings out blood. As <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayd in another place may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this: <hi>Mammillam Scripturae duriùs premitis:</hi> ye wreſt the Scripture &amp; Iuſtice too violently, &amp; ſo inſtead of milke and ſuccour, ye wring out blood &amp; oppreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So, too much pity ſpilles a city. There is <hi>miſericordia puniens,</hi> &amp; <hi>crudelitas parcens.</hi> He that ſpares a woolfe, &amp; pardons a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full murderer, doth hazzard the whole flocke. <hi>Aurea mediocritas.</hi> It is an honor to the ſeat of Iuſtice, to miniſter it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14715:13"/>
THe third is the ſeate of peſtilence: ſo the Greeke text enforceth, which is, <hi>Loimoon.</hi> In the time of peſt, we follow the Phyſicians rule: <hi>Citò, longè, tardè:</hi> God forbid that any ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace or countenance a peſtilent fellow. Can there be any greater glory to a King, then with the teſtimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſay, All my delight is in the Saynts that are in the Land, and ſuch as excell in vertue? I am a friend to all ſuch as imbrace the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus. Whoſo is faythfull, and feareth God, he ſhall be my ſeruant. As for peſtilent fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, I hate and abhorre: ſuch bring a Realme into thraldome. Therefore if you will be partakers of true bleſſednes, beware of buſy heads, infamous ſinners, but ſpecially of ſkorners: delight not in their counſell, ſtand not in their wayes; leaſt of all be reſolute in their deſperate courſes: <hi>Hàc itur ad Inferos:</hi> this is the high way to hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14715:14"/>
The affirmatiue part is, <hi>But his delight is in the Law of the Lord, &amp; in his Law will meditate day and night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe Lord is here called <hi>Iehoua,</hi> the King of Kings, &amp; Lord of all Lords, to whom all the Kings of the earth muſt bow their ſcepters, and do homage; for of him they hold in chiefe. This name the Iewes hold to be vnvtterable: that is, true in reſpect of the eſſence: for the nature of GOD is infinite, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they expreſt it by <hi>Tetragrammaton.</hi> Superſtitious this was, yet it condemneth our lacke of reuerence vnto it: For Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Magiſtrates we remember with their ſtile and titles of honour, but the name of God paſſeth with contempt, and too often with blaſphemy: Call ye this Religion?</p>
               <p>THis Lord hath his Law, in which he will haue no competitors, <hi>aut ſolus, aut nullus.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> calles it <hi>Gala ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi> pure milke, without any mingle-mangle.
<pb facs="tcp:14715:14"/>
It is called <hi>Thora,</hi> of <hi>Iara,</hi> to teach: becauſe it inſtructeth euery one what to chuſe, what to refuſe. Hony is ſweet to a ſound taſte: but the Law of God to a ſound Profeſſor is ſweeter then the hony and honycombe. Gold is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: but to me, the law of my God is dearer, then thouſands of gold and ſiluer.</p>
               <p>Life is ſweet: yet the Martyrs of Chriſt reſpected not their liues, to keepe the teſtimony of a good conſcience. Therefore that which is ſweeter then hony, more precious then gold, and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then life, that ought all men to delight in: But ſuch is the law of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed is the man whoſe delight is in it: that is the firſt ſtep to bleſſedneſſe affirmatiuely.</p>
               <p>YOu know there is no life withoutſom delight, the error is in the choyſe: but where delight is, there is cherefulnes:
<pb facs="tcp:14715:15"/>
ſo the Hebrew word <hi>Chephets</hi> enforceth, a readineſſe, a willingneſſe to all good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amor meus, pondus meum:</hi> Where loue doeth leane, both wit and will doe bend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. A little plucking drawes a man, whither he willingly goes. A little wind driues a great ſhip with the ſtream. Where God writes his Law in any mans heart, there is cherefulneſſe. This made <hi>Dauid</hi> to runne in the way of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements: and when his footeſteps fayled, he wiſhed, <hi>O that I had wings like a Doue to performe it!</hi> Gods ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts muſt be like to Angels, moſt ſwift in their ſeruice. To a willing minde nothing is hard or heauy: for loue makes all things light. To ſuch Chriſts yoke is ſweete; his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are not grieuous; becauſe their delight is in them.</p>
               <p>FRom this delight proceedes Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the ſecond ſtep to Bleſſednes affirmatiuely. This Meditation is like to digeſtion: for vnleſſe the meate
<pb facs="tcp:14715:15"/>
digeſt in the ſtomake, it nouriſheth not the body. vnleſſe the wheate corne dye in the ground, it ſpringeth not vp againe: ſo, vnleſſe the Word take roote in your hearts by meditation, it profiteth not.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Iames</hi> compares an idle hearer, to a man that looks his bodily face in a glaſſe, and with the turning of a hand forgets it. Which of you walketh through a greene meddow, and gathereth not a flowre? Who comes into an Orchard, &amp; taſteth not the fruite thereof? So, bring home ſomewhat from a Sermon, that ye may be the better for it.</p>
               <p>THis delight and meditation muſt not be for a ſpurt, but day and night: for godlines is a iourny, wherein muſt be no faynting. It is not ſufficient to begin wel, but ye muſt continue in well doing. <hi>In Chriſtianis non initia, ſed fines petuntur:</hi> With what earneſtnes doe men run in a race? yet but one receyues the price. In the ſpirituall race, runne all, that all may
<pb facs="tcp:14715:16"/>
obtayne: for in heauen is roome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p>Hence may the Preacher learne this: <hi>Attende lectioni:</hi> for curſed is hee, which doeth the Lords worke negligently. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite h<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s praedones,</hi> ſayd <hi>Eſchines</hi> the Orator, <hi>qui nauigant in mari verborum.</hi> Katch me theſe Pirats, which ſayle in a ſea of words, and run a ſentence out of breath.</p>
               <p>Hence may the King gather a ſweete meditation, that ſo long as the Law of God is his Counſeller, all things ſhall proſper with him: God will be his Lord Protector, and keeper, whitherſoeuer hee goeth. He wil keepe all his bones, ſo that not one of them ſhall be broken. He wil preſerue his going out, and his comming in, from this time forth for euermore.</p>
               <p>Generally, God hath promiſed to all the faithfull, <hi>I will giue my holy feare into your hearts, that ye ſhall neuer depart from me.</hi> And I doe aſſure you with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: <hi>That God, which hath begun this good worke in you, will perfit it, euen to the
<pb facs="tcp:14715:16"/>
day of Chriſt. Hac itur adſuperos:</hi> This is the high way to Heauen.</p>
               <p>God for his mercies ſake write theſe leſſons in our hearts, and teach vs to frame our liues thereafter, that in the end wee may obtayne that Kingdome, which he hath prepared for all his elect people, through Ieſus Chriſt our alone Sauiour. To whom with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, be all honour and glory both now and euer. Amen.</p>
