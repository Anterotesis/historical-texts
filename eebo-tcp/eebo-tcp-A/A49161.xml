            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LORD <hi>BALTEMORE'S</hi> CASE, Concerning the Province of <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> joyning to <hi>Virginia</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N 1632. the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> had a Patent granted to him and his heirs, of the ſaid Province of <hi>Maryland,</hi> with divers privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and juriſdictions for the Government thereof, the better to incourage him to ſettle a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of Engliſh there, whereby to prevent the Dutch and Swedes from incroaching any nearer to <hi>Virginia, Maryland</hi> being between Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and the Dutch and Swedes Plantation on that Continent, and New-England beyond them, to the Northward.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> hereupon in 1633. ſent two of his own brothers with above 200 people to begin and ſeat a Plantation there; wherein, and in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid Plantation, ever ſince, hee and his friends have disburſed above 40000 l. whereof 20000 l. at leaſt, was out of his own purſe, and his ſaid two brothers died there in the proſecution thereof.</p>
            <p>In Septem. 1651. when the Councell of State ſent Commiſſioners from hence, to wit, Captaine <hi>Dennis,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33821:4"/>
Captain <hi>Steg,</hi> and Captain <hi>Curtes,</hi> to reduce Virginia to the obedience of the Parliament, Maryland was at firſt inſerted in their Inſtructions to be reduced as wel as Virginia, but the Councel being afterwards ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that that Plantation was never in oppoſition to the Parliament, that Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> Deputy there, was generally knowne to have been always zealouſly affected to the Parliament, and that divers of the Parliaments friends were, by the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> ſpeciall direction, received into Maryland, and well treated there, when they were fain <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ve Virginia for their good affection to the Parliament; then the Councell thought it not fit at all to diſturb that Plantation, and therefore cauſed Maryland to be ſtruck out of the ſaid Inſtructions, which was twice done, it being by ſome miſtake or other put in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time.</p>
            <p>In this expedition to Virginia, Captain <hi>Dennis</hi> and Captain <hi>Stegg,</hi> the two chiefe Commiſſioners, were caſt away, outward bound in the Admirall of that Fleet, which was ſent from hence upon that ſervice, and with them the Originall Commiſſion for that ſervice was loſt.</p>
            <p>But Cap. <hi>Curtes</hi> having a copy of the ſaid Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Inſtructions with him in another ſhip, arrived ſafe in Virginia, and there being alſo nominated in the ſaid Commiſſion two other perſons reſident in Virginia, to wit, Cap. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and Cap. <hi>Cleyborn</hi> (known and declared enemies of the L. <hi>Baltemore's)</hi> they, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Cap. <hi>Curtes,</hi> proceeded to the reducement of Virginia, which was effected accordingly upon Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, among which one was; That the Virginians ſhould injoy the antient bounds and limits of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and that they ſhould ſeek a Charter from the Parliament to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:33821:4"/>
In the reducement of Virginia, Captain <hi>Stone</hi> (the L. <hi>Baltemore's</hi> Deputy of Maryland) ſent to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners at the firſt arrival of the Fleet in Virginia, to offer them all the aſſiſtance he could, and did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually aſſiſt them therein, with proviſion of victuall, and other neceſſaries, as will be teſtified (if need be) by Mr. <hi>Edward Gibbons</hi> Major-Generall of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and divers others who were then there, and eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes of it, and are now here.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding which, the ſaid Commiſſioners, after Virginia was reduced, went to Maryland, and upon pretence of a certaine clauſe (which it ſeems was by ſome meanes or other, put into their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, after Maryland was ſtruck out as aforeſaid) to wit, that they ſhould reduce all the Plantations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Bay of Cheſeapeack to the obedience of the Parliament, and ſome part of Maryland, where the L. <hi>Baltemore's</hi> chief Colony there is ſeated, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Bay, as well as moſt of the Plantations of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia are; they required Captaine <hi>Stone,</hi> and the reſt of the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> Officers there, firſt to take the Ingagement, which they all readily ſubſcribed, and declared, that they did in all humility ſubmit themſelves to the Government of the Commonwealth of England in chief under God; then the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners required them to iſſue out Writs and Proceſſe out of the L. <hi>Baltemore's</hi> Courts there in the name of the Keepers of the Liberty of England, and not in the name of the Lord Proprietary, as they were wont to doe, wherein they deſired to be excuſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not conceive the Parliament intended to deveſt the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> of his right there, and that they underſtood out of England that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of State intended not that any alteration ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33821:5"/>
be made in <hi>Maryland.</hi> That the Kings name was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed heertofore in the ſayd Writs, but that they had alwayes been in the name of the Lord Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, according to the Priviledges of his Patent, ever ſince the beginning of that Plantation; that the late Act in England for changing of the forms of Writts declared only, that in ſuch Writs and Proceſs wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Kings name was formerly uſed, the Keepers of the Liberty of England, ſhould for the future be put in ſtead therof: that the continuing of the Writs in the Lord Proprietaries name, was eſſential <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt there, and that therefore they could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of truſt, concur to any ſuch alteration; wherupon the Commiſſioners demanded of Captain <hi>Stone</hi> the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> Commiſſion to him, which he delivered, and then without any other cauſe at all, they removed the ſayd Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> other Officers out of their Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there under him, and appointed others to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the government of that Plantation, till the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Councell of State and Parliament ſhould be further known therin; ſeized upon all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Place, and ſent divers of them hither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England, all which they did without any oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all from Cap. <hi>Stone,</hi> or any other of the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> Officers, in regard of their reſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the Commiſſioners of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Colony of Virginia, not long after, ſent one Colonell <hi>Mathews</hi> hither into England to get their Articles confirmed by the Parliament, which were read in the Houſe on the 31. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1652. Upon the reading wherof a Petition of the Lord <hi>Baltimores,</hi> and of about twenty more conſiderable Proteſtant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers and Planters to and in <hi>Maryland,</hi> who are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33821:5"/>
known by divers Members of the Houſe to have been well affected alwayes to the Parliament, and who ſigned the ſaid Petition, was alſo read; whereby it was humbly deſired that before the Houſe paſſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that Article concerning the old limits of Virginia, the ſaid Petitioners might be heard by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, in regard <hi>Maryland</hi> was long ſince eſteemed part of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and therefore they were concerned in that Article; and they further humbly deſired in the ſayd Petition, that the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> Officers might be reſtored to their places in <hi>Maryland</hi> under him, &amp; that the Petitioners might quietly enjoy the Priviledges of the ſayd Patent of <hi>Maryland,</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence whereof, they had Adventured ſo much of their fortunes thither as aforeſayd.</p>
            <p>Whereupon divers Parchments under the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> hand and ſeale, which were ſent out of <hi>Maryland,</hi> by the ſayd Capt. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Cley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> were at that time produced to the Houſe by a Member therof, who it ſeems conceived that there would appear ſomething in them, wherby the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> had forfeited his ſaid Patent, or at leaſt that his Authority in <hi>Maryland</hi> was not fit to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of by the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Houſe on the 31. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1652. referred the ſayd Article concerning the old Limits of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to the Committee of the Navy to conſider what Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was fit to be granted to the Inhabitants of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> and to hear all Parties, and conſider of their particular Claims, and report the ſame, with their Opinions to the Parliament, and the ſayd Parchments delivered in concerning <hi>Maryland,</hi> were alſo referred to the ſame Committee.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> accordingly made his claim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33821:6"/>
the ſaid Committee, unto whom he delivered a true Copy of his ſaid Patent, and deſired therefore that the Patent which the Virginians were Suitors for, might not extend to any part of Maryland, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made appear to the ſaid Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittee, that that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince had not been for theſe 20 years laſt paſt accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any part of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and that the Virginians had neither poſſeſſion of any part thereof, at the time of the making of the ſaid Articles, nor for 20 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor that the preſent Inhabitants of <hi>Virginia</hi> had ever at all any right unto it.</p>
            <p>Then, upon the ſuggeſtion of a Member of that Committee, certain Exceptions againſt the Lord <hi>Baltimores</hi> Patent, and his Proceedings thereupon in Maryland, were ſhortly after preſented in writing to the ſaid Committee, unto which the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> put in his Anſwer alſo in writing, which was read, and the Committee upon debate thereof (it ſeems) thought not fit to deliver any Opinion in the buſineſs, but Ordered, that the whole matter of fact ſhould be ſtated by a Sub-Committee, and reported firſt to the ſaid Grand Committee, and afterwards to the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Exceptions aforeſaid were many, but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them are reduceable to theſe heads follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are ſet down by way of Objections, with Anſwers to them.</p>

There was indeed a Patent heretofore granted by King <hi>James</hi> in the 7. yeare of his reign of a great part of that northern Continent of <hi>America,</hi> which was then called <hi>Virginia,</hi> to divers Lords and Gentlemen here in <hi>England,</hi> who were by that Patent erected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Corporation, by the name of the <hi>Virginia</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in which tract of land granted to the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that Country which is now called <hi>Maryland,</hi> was included, but that Patent was Legally evicted by a <hi>Quoranto</hi> in the then Kings Bench, in 21. year of the ſayd King <hi>James,</hi> 8. or 9. years before the Patent of <hi>Maryland</hi> was granted to the L. <hi>Baltemore;</hi> which Company or Corporation the Inhabitants of <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> deſire not now to revive, by vertue of their Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles abovementioned, but abhor the memory of it, in regard of the great oppreſſion and ſlavery they lived in under it, when it was on foot, ſo as they never having had any Patent, right, or poſſeſſion of the ſayd Province of <hi>Maryland,</hi> there could be no injury done to them by the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> ſayd Patent, after the eviction of the ſayd Virginia Companies Patent thereof. For it was as free in the late Kings power to grant any part of that Continent not poſſeſſed before by any Legall grant then in force from the Crown of England (which <hi>Maryland</hi> was not, at the time of the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> Patent thereof) as it was for King <hi>James</hi> to grant the aforeſaid Country to the ſaid Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia Company.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33821:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which ſhould have any power over this Common-wealth, would not be conſiſtent with it, yet certainly any Monarchical Government in forraign parts which is ſubordinate to, &amp; dependent on, this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, may be conſiſtent with it, aſwell as divers Kings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that famous Common-wealth of the Romans heretofore were, inſomuch as they thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and fit to conſtitute divers Kings under them. All Lords of Mannors or Liberties here in England may, in ſome kinde, be aſwell accounted Monarches within their ſeverall Mannors and Liberties as the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> in <hi>Maryland;</hi> for Writs iſſue, at this day, in their names out of their Courts within their reſpective Mannors and Liberties, and not in the name of the Keepers of the Libertie of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; Oathes of Fealty are taken to them by their Tenants, and they have great Royalties and Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſome more then others, and ſome as great in proportion, within their ſaid Mannors and Liberties, as the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> hath in <hi>Maryland,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the power of making Lawes touching life and Eſtate, power of pardoning, and ſome few others of leſſer concernment, which although they may not be convenient for any one man to have in England, yet are they neceſſary for any (whether one man or a Company) that undertakes a Plantation, in ſo remote and wild a place as <hi>Mariland,</hi> to have them there; eſpecially with ſuch limitations as are in the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> Patent; to wit, that the Laws be made with the conſent of the Freemen of the ſaid Province, or the <hi>major</hi> part of them, or their Deputies, and that they be conſonant to reaſon, and be not repugnant or contrary, but, as neare as conveniently may bee, agreeable to the Laws of England; which limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33821:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> hath not exceeded, as may appeare by his Anſwer to the Committee of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to the Exceptions above mentioned: and although it be not fit that any one Perſon ſhould have a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voyce here in the making of Lawes, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, as no Company, ſo no ſingle man, that is well in his wits, will be ſo indiſcreet, as to undertake a Plantation at ſo vaſt an expence as the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> hath, if after all his charge, pains, and hazards, which are infinite in ſuch a buſineſſe, ſuch neceſſitous facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people as uſually new Plantations conſiſt of, for the moſt part, and went thither at his charge, or by contract or agreement with him, ſhould have power to make Lawes to diſpoſe of him, and all his eſtate there, without his conſent, and he be left without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: for before the Supream Authority here, upon any appeale to it, will probably be at leiſure from buſineſs of greater conſequence, or perhaps have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient means to relieve him, he may be ruined and deſtroyed: ſuch chargeable and hazardous things as Plantations are, will not be undertaken by any, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a Company or a ſingle man, without as great incouragements of priviledges as are in the Lo. <hi>Baltemore's</hi> Patent of <hi>Maryland;</hi> and if it be not any prejudice, as certainly it is not, but advantagious to the intereſt and honor of this Common-wealth, that an Engliſh man (although a Recuſant, for the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> knows of no Lawes here againſt Recuſants which reach into <hi>America)</hi> ſhould poſſeſs ſome part of that great Continent of <hi>America</hi> with the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and juriſdictions aforeſaid dependent on, and ſubordinate to it, then the Indian Kings or Forreigners (as the Dutch &amp; Swedes afore mentioned) who have no dependency on it, as certainly it is, then he hopes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33821:8"/>
the Parliament will not thinke it inconſiſtent with this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, but juſt that he ſhould injoy the Rights and Priviledges of his Patent, upon confidence whereof, he and his friends have adventured the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of their fortunes for the honour of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſwell as their own particular advantage; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing no other perſon hath any wrong done him therein, for none are compelled to go to <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or to ſtay there, but know beforehand upon what termes they are to be in that place; and the Engliſh Inhabitants of that Province are ſo well pleaſed with the Government conſtituted there by the ſaid Patent, as that, by generall conſent of the Proteſtants, aſwell as Roman Catholiques, it is eſtabliſhed by a Law there, aſwell as freedome of Conſcience and exerciſe of Religion within that Province is, to all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, as appears by the Laws of that Province now in the hands of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Navy, which makes it evident that a Petition lately read at that Committee, with ten unknown hands to it, in the name of the Inhabitants of <hi>Maryland,</hi> againſt the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> ſayd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, is eyther wholly fictitious, or elſe ſigned by ſome few obſcure factious fellows, which is eaſie to bee procured by any ill affected perſon, againſt any Government whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Object.</hi> That the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> gave his aſſent to certaine Lawes for <hi>Maryland</hi> in 1650. in one of which Lawes the late King <hi>Charles</hi> is ſtiled the late high and mighty Prince <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt of that name K. of England, &amp;c. And in another of the ſaid Lawes it is Enacted, That the L. <hi>Baltemore</hi> ſhall have 10s. a hogs-head for all Tobacco's ſhip't from <hi>Maryland</hi> in any Dutch Veſſell, &amp; bound for any other Port then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33821:9"/>
his Majeſties, whereby ſome would infer, that hee did acknowledge a <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond to be King, &amp;c. for that the word firſt, in one Law inferred a ſecond, and by the word Majeſty, in the other Law, the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> muſt mean the late Kings eldeſt ſon, for the late King <hi>Charles</hi> was dead, when the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> aſſented to that Law, to wit, in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1650.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this is anſwered, that although thoſe Lawes were aſſented unto by the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> in Auguſt 1650. yet it appears by his ſaid Declaration of aſſent, that ſome of them were enacted in Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by the Aſſembly there, in April 1649. whereof that Law was one, wherein thoſe words, to wit, any other Ports then his Majeſties, are inſerted (as was proved to the ſaid Committee of the Navy) at which time, the people in Maryland could not know of the late Kings death, which was but in January then next before; for in February, March, and April, ſhips uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return from thoſe parts, and in September, October, and November, goe thither; ſo as the Aſſembly in Maryland could mean no body by that word Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, but the late King, and the L. <hi>Baltemore</hi> could have no other meaning but what the Aſſembly had, for he did but aſſent to what they had done, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enacted, as aforeſaid: as to the other law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe other words are inſerted, to wit, the late high and mighty Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> the firſt of that name, &amp;c. it was one of thoſe Laws which were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Aſſembly in Maryland, in April 1650. when the people there knew of the late Kings death; to wit, a year after the other law above-mentioned, with divers others, which were enacted in April, 1649. as aforeſaid, though in the ingroſſement of them all here, (when the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> gave his aſſent to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33821:9"/>
them altogether in Auguſt, 1650.) it is written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, becauſe they were tranſpoſed here in ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> thought fit, according to the nature, and more or leſſe importance of them, placing the Act concerning Religion firſt, &amp;c. And as to thoſe words, the firſt of that name, &amp;c. the word firſt, doth not neceſſarily imply a ſecond, as ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon it, no more then when the firſt born of thy ſonnes were commanded to be given to God, did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a ſecond, which was performed, though there were never a ſecond; the word firſt, hath relation to the time paſt, and not to the time to come; King <hi>James</hi> is ſtiled in Hiſtory, <hi>James</hi> the firſt of that name, King, &amp;c. though there were never a ſecond of that name King of England, &amp;c. and it is uſually written and ſaid, that a King died in the firſt yeer of his Raign, when he lived not to enter into a ſecond, the like whereof may be made out by many other inſtances; and as the L. <hi>Baltemore</hi> is confident the Aſſembly in Maryland had no intention by thoſe words, <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, &amp;c. to infer a ſecond King of that name, no more had he, in his aſſent to that Law, any ſuch thought or meaning; and the comportment of him and his Officers in Maryland above-mentioned, towards the Parliament, and their friends, doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confirme it.</p>
            <p>Among other priviledges granted to the L. <hi>Balte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor e,</hi> and the Inhabitants of Maryland, by his ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, one is, (by an expreſſe clauſe therein inſerted) that the ſaid Province ſhould not from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be, or be reputed any part of Virginia, or bee dependent or ſubject to their Government in any thing, (although the Government of Virginia was then immediately in the Kings hands) but was, by the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33821:10"/>
ſaid Patent, (in expreſs words) ſeperated from it, and ſo it hath been ever ſince, which was one of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt incouragements, upon confidence whereof, the L. <hi>Baltemore,</hi> and others, adventured ſo great a part of their eſtates thither as aforeſaid; for it was the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and immunities, and not the land only, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſaid Patent, which did chiefly induce the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> to make ſo great an Adventure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he would not certainly, upon the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a common Planter, have disburſed any thing upon a Plantation in America: Wherefore he hopes the Parliament will not think it juſt, or fit, to deprive him, and the Inhabitants of Maryland of ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a priviledge, (which is their inheritance, and dearly purchaſed by them) by putting them now under the Government of Virginia, upon colour of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Articles agreed on, when the Virginians were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared enemies of this Commonwealth, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe even in point of policy alſo, (as is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceived) for certain Reaſons of State heerunto annexed, it will be more advantageous to the honour and intereſt of this Commonwealth, to keep thoſe two Governments ſtill divided, and to preſerve and protect the Lord <hi>Baltemore's</hi> rights and priviledges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid in <hi>Maryland,</hi> then to deſtroy either of them.</p>

            <p n="1">1. FIrſt, It is much better to keep that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtill divided from Virginia (as it hath beene for theſe twenty yeares laſt paſt,) then to unite them; for, by that meanes, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth will have the more power over both, by making one an Inſtrument (as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) to keep the other in its due obedience to this Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, in caſe any defection ſhould happen in either Colony (as lately was in Virginia) the other may be a place of refuge for ſuch as ſhall continue faithfull to this Common-wealth, as Maryland lately was, upon that occaſion, which it could not have beene, in caſe the Government of that place had been, at that time, united unto, or had had any dependence on Virginia.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, it will cauſe an emulation in both, which of them ſhall give the better account of their proceedings to the Supreme Authority of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33821:11"/>
on which they both depend, and alſo which of them ſhall give better ſatisfaction to the Planters and Adventurers of both.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> having an eſtate, and his reſidence in England, this Commonwealth will have a better aſſurance of the due obedience of that Plantation, and the Planters and Adventurers thither, of having right done unto them, in caſe the Government thereof have ſtill a dependence on him, and he upon this Commonwealth, (as he had before on the late King) then if the Government of that place at ſo remote a diſtance, ſhould be diſpoſed of into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands who had little or nothing here to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for it, and whoſe intereſt and reſidence were wholly there.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, by the continuance of his Intereſt in the Government thereof, this Commonwealth and the people there, are eaſed of the charge of a Deputy Governour; which he, at his own charges, maintains, the Inhabitants there being yet ſo poor, (and ſo like to be for many years) as they are not able to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any thing towards it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, if the L. <hi>Baltemore</hi> ſhould, by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, be prejudiced in any of the rights or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of his Patent of that Province, it would be a great diſcouragement to others in forraign Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon any exigency, to adhere to the intereſt of this Commonwealth, becauſe it is notoriouſly known, that, by his expreſſe direction, his Officers and the
