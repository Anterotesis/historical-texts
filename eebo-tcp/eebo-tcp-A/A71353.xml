            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>As ſoone as news came to this place from the Ambaſſador in England De Franciſco De Mello, that his Majeſty King Charles the ſecond was ſafe in his Pallace at Whitehall, in quiet and peaceable poſſeſſion of his Hereditary Kingdoms, and welcomed with ſo great exceſs of Joy that from all parts the Nobility, Gentry and Commons, came flocking to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his Arival and kiſs his hand. His Majeſty the King
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:97700:429"/>
of Portugal preſently gave order that the ſame night all the great Guns of the Caſtle of this Towne, and of all the Forts and Caſtles of this Harbour, ſhould be fired in ſigne of his joy and contentment, which was accordingly performed, and at the ſame time all the Navy-ſhips and Merchantmen in the Port, ſhot all their Canon. All that night the whole Citty was adorned with Luminaries. In every window of the Kings Pallace two great torches of white wax, the Ambaſſadors houſe was ſet out in the ſame faſhion, beſides in the ſtreets there were made very many Bonfires, rare artificial Fireworks and other inventions expreſſing the alacrity of the Court and people very much expreſſed by the Continual noyſe of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, Weights, and all ſorts of muſicall Inſtruments. The next morning their Majeſties with the Infanta went forth in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner attended by all the Nobillity and Gentry of the Court and Citty, in a rich and ſplendid equipage to the Church of St Antony of the Capuchins, and returned to the Pallace in the ſame Pomp, all the bells of the towne ringing the while. By which it is plainly ſeen with what reall joy and ſatisfaction the People of this Court and Nation received this welcome news, whereof I thought good to give you notice. We have alſo news that ſome days ſince, on the Frontire of Alentejo, our General of Horſe Alfonſo Turtudo, meeting with a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade of the Enemies Horſe nigh Badajox, fought and defeated them, killed and tooke 400 of them, amongſt the Priſoners there are 4 Captains of Horſe.</p>
