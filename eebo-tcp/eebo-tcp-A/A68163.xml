            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by some learned French gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
experienced in the estate of both
Countries, but iealous (as he saith)
of the honor of his owne; and (as
appeareth) especially desirous of the prosperitie, and
preseruation thereof; may serue vnto vs for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
patterne, and a liuely example howe farre the
loue of truth is to be preferd aboue al other respects:
yea euen aboue the dutie due vnto our countrie,
which ought notwithstanding to be in greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation
amongest vs, then any reuerent respect
of Parentes; or affection towardes friendes, kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes,
or allyes; or whatsoeuer else we holde dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
vnto vs. Which loue of truth in this author see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to haue beene ioyned with so zealous a care
of the wel-fare of his Countrie, that like a skilfull
&amp; wise Chirurgian, he choseth rather to rip vp old
sores, which peraduenture may seeme to be healed
outwardly; then to drawe ouer them faire scars, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
them to rankle and fester inwardly. For euen
as a good Phisician carefull to cure his patients ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie,
and desirous of his health &amp; recouerie, doth
<pb facs="tcp:21573:3"/>
not minister pleasant potions, if they be vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his purpose; but rather holesome restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
though peraduenture somewhat yrkesome:
So the author of this treatise, especially carefull and
desirous of the good and flourishing estate of his
troubled and afflicted Countrie, (which he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
prooueth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist not wholy, though chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
in her selfe: but to depend much on her ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
with such of her neighbour Nations, as may
most aduantage or endamage her) to effect his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
for her benefite and preseruation, bringeth
such proofes as (being but such as their owne Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
afford) may seeme partiall prayses of our
Countrie, and purposed disgraces of his owne.
Which roundnesse, and integritie of his made me
at the request of some friendes, that vnderstood not
well the French to translate it into English: which
I vndertooke so much the rather, because it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the memorable, and valiant deedes of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed
Ancestors, in that noble Realme of
France; togither with a rehearsall of the Spanish
braueries: that the viewe of the one, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the other, may stirre vp that courage
which ought still to remaine in our English harts;
that we do not degenerate from our noble Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
but with an earnest emulation followe
those happie footsteps of our famous forefathers:
<pb facs="tcp:21573:3"/>
and learne to despise those magnificent <hi>Dom Diegos</hi>
and <hi>Spanish Caualieros,</hi> whose doughtiest deedes
are bragges and boastinges, and themselues (for
the most part) shadowes without substaunce:
whose affected <hi>Monarchie,</hi> is like to prooue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded

            <p>This translation (how simple soeuer) I offer to

or stand you in steede; who by your owne indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
indeuours, and continued trauailes in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine

            <p>Moreouer, your benefites, not onely extended

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, I was constrained by some
friendes, to breake of a worke of some greater
importance and larger discourse, to vndertake
the translation of this briefe and pithie trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
Ere I had fully finished it, there came into my hands
another translation thereof, done by an Italian, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnder the title of <hi>A Politike Discourse most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
for the time present.</hi> On sight whereof though
I had perfected mine, I purposed to suppresse it, or at least
to reserue it to my selfe, and such friendes as seemed to
like it.</p>
            <p>But some being not satisfied with this former
translation, done by a stranger, and in some places (as
they thought) estraunged from our English phrase, were
desirous of my copie; which (being but one) could not well
content so manie. By occasion whereof: I was willing to
publish it, seeking their satisfaction. And the rather was I
thereto induce, because I found the treatise to bee so well
liked, that the former copies were for the most part alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
distracted.</p>
            <p>The former title of a <hi>Politike Discourse,</hi> because
it seemed too Generall, I haue chaunged into <hi>A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
betweene England and Spaine,</hi> which seemes
more neerely, &amp; particularly to expresse the substance of
the treatise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21573:5"/>
The paines which the other hath taken (howsoeuer
some mislike) I doe not condemne; neither would I wish
him to be discontented, that he being a straunger to both
countries, cannot satisfie all, in both languages; for hee
which is borne in the one, and brought vp in both, is not
able to performe it. But though he misse of his marke,
yet thinke well of his endeuors: and where I want of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
there I craue the like construction.</p>

if in priuate matters the respect of neighbourhood be so
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21573:6"/>
much to be had in recommendation amongst vs, how much
more I pray you, in managing &amp; guiding of an estate. What

the way vnto them to make themselues masters of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

            <p>The like may be sayd in respect of <hi>Italy:</hi> for the affaires of

            <p>Contrariwise, if we looke neere into the estate of thinges
past, we shall finde that many of the greatest houses in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie</hi>
haue by the prudent policie and heartie affection of
their neighbours ben preserued from the ouerthrow which
was threatened by the common calamity. In the tyme of

he was banished the Empire &amp; driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But <hi>Frederike</hi> duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> his neighbor a wise prince
and of great vnderstanding did so mildly handle this matter
that all the tempest was changed into a sweete and pleasant
calme. Wherin notwithstanding, I am of opinion, that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
can not pretend any aduantage aboue Aristocratie and
popular estates. Euery one knowes how that about fourtie
yeares since <hi>Charles</hi> duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> inuaded <hi>Geneua,</hi> the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
and lordship whereof he had left vnto his successors,
if the men of <hi>Friburgh</hi> fellow burgesses and allyes to those of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21573:6"/>
               <hi>Geneua</hi> had not made him open his iawes, and let goe the
pray which he had betweene his teeth.</p>
            <p>I alleage these familiar examples, of fresh date, because I
would not stay too long on those of ancient time, &amp; namely
of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth of <hi>Athens,</hi> whose practice was alwaies
to relieue their distressed neighbours, being beaten or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen
by any euill encounter. Wherof the reestablishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of <hi>Thebes,</hi> will serue for sufficient testimony, as long as mans
life shall enioy that good happe to be lightned by the lampe
of learning. These then are pertinent reasons to make vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
how carefully kingdoms &amp; estates are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped
by the friendship &amp; faithfulnes of their neighbors.
But as this point is of great importance, so it requires a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and mature consideration: for men which are not so
cleeresighted nor practised in the affaires of this worlde, are
so much the easier deceiued, as a vaine appearance can deck
and set foorth it selfe with a show of sound commoditie.</p>
            <p>And to manifest this matter by example, and by deduction
of a particular deed to make way to the decision of a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
I will speake of that which more neerely concernes the
ordering of our owne affaires. There is none be he neuer so
voide of vnderstanding, but seeth &amp; plainely perceiueth the
poore and miserable estate, whereunto France loosing her
ancient brightnesse is brought at this day by the crueltie and
continuance of ciuill wars. Euery one confesseth that shee
wants a restoratiue to relieue hir of so pernicious a recidiue;
notwithstanding, they agree not all in one concerning the
confection &amp; ingredients proper and sortable to such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storatiue.
True it is that they who by dealing in affaires and
managing of matters, haue aduantaged themselues in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
do come thus farre foorth: that following the rule of
good Phisicians, the maladie must be cured by his contrarie;
and seeing that the sicknes of France comes only of vnqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes,
that nothing can be more auaileable to the restoring
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21573:7"/>
of her former helth, then a good &amp; assured quietnes: which
aduice in my iudgement, is better grounded on reason, then
cleerely discussed. In confirmation whereof, when there is
question of the quiet of our country, he were too much out
of the way that would bound it within the circuit of France,
not caring greatly in what estate she be with her neighbors,
so that her inhabitants liue in peace one with an other, and
the flame of ciuill wars be extinguished.</p>
            <p>But although I readily confesse that the matter being once
reduced into termes of calling into one of the two inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
there is no forraine war how difficult or dangerous
soeuer it be, but we ought to vndertake, if thereby wee may
warrant our countrie from a ciuill warre: yet so is it that the
entire prosperitie of an estate is founded on the exemption
of both inconueniences: except we thinke our age to be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
priuiledged, that we may haue war without the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
appendances thereof which are miserie and pouertie.
They then which endeuour to procure the good and quiet
of France, ought to aime at this marke, that not onely al
coales of ciuill combustion may be quenched, but also that
she mainteine her selfe in good estate with her neighbors: &amp;
especially with those whose alliance is most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious and
most assured vnto her: which in my iudgement is a point no
lesse necessary then difficult to decide, by reason of the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of their passions, who prefer their priuate profit before
the common commoditie. So it is that if vnto the deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this doubt, we bring no other passion, but an ardent
affection towardes the trueth &amp; a zealous loue of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
we shall soone decide this difficultie. And I do not think
when euery thing is cast and accounted, whether you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it in grosse, or else haue particular respect to the time
present, that there is any of our neighbours, whose allyance
can be so commodious and auaylable vnto vs as that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
On the contrary I am of opinion, that he which in ſtate 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21573:7"/>
matters would intreate of popular errors could not choose
a more ample argument, then to showe that such as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
call the English auncient enemies to the estate and
crowne of France, thinking thereby to be accounted lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
amongest the ignorant, discouer themselues to be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant amongst the learned. And for so much as diuers
Courtiers, whom I haue heard discoursing on this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
haue come to this conclusion, that they prefer the alliance
of <hi>Spain</hi> before any other whatsoeuer, hauing regard (as they
say) to the safetie and welfare of France, I purpose to dispute
this question, which in my iudgement hath no better foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
then a partialized affection, or else too litle know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the affaires of this world. I hope then by liuely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to enforce, that the alliance of <hi>Englande</hi> is much more
expedient for vs, then that of <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; by the same means to
cleare the generall controuersie, and to make knowen that
there is no people in the world whose alliance is so commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
&amp; so necessarie vnto vs, as that of the English nation.
And to lay some foundation for my opinion, I say that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
there is question of making alliance with some nation, there
is principall regard to be had of two things: th' one that those
whose allyance we preferre, haue more wayes &amp; meanes to
helpe vs: th' other that they haue also more means to harme
vs, being once become our enemies. And I pray you what
people is there in the world, that hath iuster occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue
vs, then the English, which are allyed vnto vs in bloud, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
in manners, and brotherly giuen to the selfe same
vertuous inclinations? which I meane nor onely of those
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this day we call English but also of the ancient Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
the remainder of whom we see at this day in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of <hi>Wales,</hi> who though they agree in manners, fashions,
customes, and vsages;<note place="margin">Caesar lib. 1 de bello Gallico.</note> yet in language they differ from the
other inhabitants of <hi>Englande. Caesar</hi> who first amongst the
Romaine Captaines discouered and had knowledge of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21573:8"/>
estate of this Ile: teacheth vs that one part of the Britaines,
that is, they which dwell next the sea, haue taken their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
of the <hi>Belgae:</hi> the same author hath also left vs in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,<note place="margin">Caesar lib. 2. de bello Gallico.</note>
that in his time the king of the <hi>Switzers</hi> named <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacus,</hi>
did rule also ouer great Britaine. And therefore is it no
meruaile if the Britains (especially those that inhabite about
Kent) were agreeable in humanitie and maner of liuing with
the French. And indeede, if we iudge by that which we find
in writing, nothing can be sayde more brotherly then these
two Nations.</p>
            <p>That I may not busie my selfe too much in sifting out par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
I will speake only of the <hi>Druides,</hi> which in auncient
time bare rule in both Nations.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Druydes</hi> were Poets and Priests, as in ancient time
was <hi>Hesiodus</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> Most certain it is that the first among
the Grecians, who haue adorned their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of learning, comprehended all their doctrine in verse;
as <hi>Homerus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plutarchus in Theseo. Plato in Lysida. Cic. 2. de natura de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum.</note> 
               <hi>Hesiodus, Orpheus, Musaeus, Linus, Empedocles, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides,</hi>
and <hi>Pitheus,</hi> of whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> maketh mention.
And therefore it is that <hi>Plato</hi> hath attributed so much vnto
Poets, calling them fathers and fountaines of wisedome.
These <hi>Druydes</hi> were also Mathematicians &amp; Philosophers,
which make me, that I can not comprehend wherupon <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero</hi>
should thinke, when he compared the Britains with the
Scythians, in respect of their ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Mathematikes.</p>
            <p>If he relyed on the testimonie of his friend <hi>Trebatius,</hi> eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one knowes him to be a witnes as may be gathered euen
out of the workes of <hi>Cieero, Qui calat hum libentius, quam ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
contemplabatur.</hi> But it seemes that <hi>Cieero,</hi> a person other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of exquisite iudgement, would needes versie the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Thales</hi> of <hi>Milesia,</hi> who being asked how farre trueth
was different from falshood, answered, as farre as the eyes
from the eares. So may we say in respecte of that which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
are now to intreat of, that we acknowledge eies in <hi>Caesar,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21573:8"/>
eares in <hi>Cicero.</hi> But howsoeuer it be, either that the Britains
receiued the knowledge of good letters from the Gaules, or
the Gaules from the Britaines, so it is, that the young men of
France, for farther aduancement in their studies, transported
into Britaine, to the <hi>Druydes</hi> of that countrie, of whom they
learned the most hidden secrets of Philosophy &amp; of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall
sciences. If we report our selues to what <hi>Caesar</hi>
hath writen hereof, the Philosophie and doctrine of the
<hi>Druydes</hi> had his first beginning in great Britaine: which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
I willingly embrace: howbeit, that rare and excellent
personage,<note place="margin">Ramus de moribus veterum Gallorum.</note> 
               <hi>Petrus Ramus</hi> seemes in a worke of his to holde
the contrarie. No maruell then, if so learned a Nation, and
so well nurtured in good letters, hath beene endewed with
so singular humanitie sortable to their knowledge, and such
as whereof our ancient Gaules haue gathered the principall
fruite. In so much that <hi>Caesar</hi> intending a descent into Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,<note place="margin">Caesar lib. de bello Gallico.</note>
alleageth for his purpose an other pretence, but that
the Gaules had beene succoured by the Brytains in all their
quarrels which they had against the Romans. But if any one
thinke that those people which since the time of <hi>Caesar,</hi> haue
made themselues masters of <hi>Gaule</hi> and of <hi>Britaine,</hi> namely
the English &amp; the French, haue not had so firme friendship,
but rather lesse occasions of louing one another, he deceiues
himselfe as much as he that is ignorant, howe great is the
force of that friendship which is founded on naturall ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
the memorie whereof can not be blotted out, neyther
by tract of time, nor distance of place. The Citizens of <hi>Sais</hi>
in <hi>Aegypt</hi> sayd that their Citie was founded by the Goddesse
<hi>Minerua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plato in Timaeo.</note> as did also the <hi>Athenians</hi> of theirs: In contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which allyance as <hi>Plato</hi> witnesseth, the Grecians in
generall, and specially the Athenians were welcomed and
well intertained at <hi>Sais.</hi> It resteth nowe to consider howe
straightly the French are vnited to the English, and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of friendship they haue made from time to time
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21573:9"/>
the one to th' other. Neither is it sufficient to say that they
haue had great and long warres togither, euen in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of our great grandfathers, for by the same reason shold
we banish amitie from amongst all Nations of the earth. By
the same reason should we conclude that there could be no
friendshippe amongest the French themselues, who euen of
late daies, haue furnished a stage in their own countrie with
the bloudiest tragedie that euer was heard of. And touching
the wars betweene the English and French; I hope hereafter
to showe in due place, that so farre off is it that this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
should bring any alteration of friendshippe or amitie
betweene them and vs, that contrariwise it ought to enforce
at our handes some increase of good will in their behalfe.
For God hauing giuen them so great aduantages ouer vs,
as euerie knoweth, it is hard to say whether this noble nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
haue showen themselues more valiant in fight, then mild
&amp; gentle after the victorie. To lesse purpose yet serue those
vnseemely speeches, which may be heard in the streetes as
well of <hi>France</hi> as <hi>England,</hi> as among the rest these tetmes,
Cullion, and French dogge, which is the rethoricke of Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
Tinkers, Coblers, Rogues and such kind of people, not
the language of honest and ciuill persons, such as we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to intreate of in this discourse: laying aside then al such
baggage and tromperie, let vs speake of the naturall amitie
which is betweene these two Nations.</p>
            <p>In the time of the Emperors <hi>Martian</hi> &amp; <hi>Valentinian,</hi> about
the yeare of Christ, 449. <hi>Witigerne</hi> king of great Britaine,
desirous to repulse the Picts and Scots, called to his ayd the
Angles or English, who dwelt then betweene the <hi>Vites</hi> and
<hi>Saxons:</hi> And indeede the Welchmen at this day call the
Englishmen <hi>Sasses,</hi> as who would say, <hi>Saxons:</hi> which hath
beene ensured me of some learned men of that countrie. It
resulteth then of this discourse that the English are come
out of Germanie, as the French are also according to our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21573:9"/>
Histories. And howbeit that in respect of the French Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I durst not affirme that they are descended of the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
yet so it is that the house of our kinges, which at this
day swayes the scepter in France, drawes his stocke from
thence, as is best knowen to them who are best seene in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories.
For <hi>Windekind</hi> a Saxon of the line of that great <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekinde</hi>
subdued by <hi>Charlemayne,</hi> came into France to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
<hi>Charles</hi> the balde, beeing then much molested by the
<hi>Normans.</hi> This young <hi>Windekind</hi> had a sonne called <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
who so fortunately followed the footsteps of his father,
that <hi>Charles</hi> the bald made him generall of the armie which
he sent against the <hi>Normans:</hi> who at that time foraged the
countrie of France. This <hi>Robert</hi> was slaine in battell, leauing
a sonne called <hi>Otho,</hi> who by consent of the Emperor <hi>Arnold,</hi>
had the gouernement of France, during the minoritie of
<hi>Charles</hi> the simple. Whence he got him not so much repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as in that hee was father to <hi>Hugh</hi> the great, Earle of
<hi>Paris.</hi> But <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> sonne of this <hi>Hugh</hi> the great, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in glorie and splendor all the forenamed, as well in that
he was chiefe of the absolute estate of France, as in that he
left a Royall posteritie behinde him, which swayes the scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diuided into two houses, namely <hi>Valoys</hi> and <hi>Bourbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So may we conclude, that if the French and English may
not be called by the terme of <hi>Charondas</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, that is, descending from the selfe same extraction.</p>
            <p>And although this alliance be of it selfe sufficiently clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Historiographers, yet is it better confirmed by the
conformitie of maners of these two Nations, and the good
comportmentes of the one towardes the other.<note place="margin">Arist. Ethic. lib. 4. cap. 3</note> The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman

louing openly, rather led by truth then by opinion, louing
the effect better then the appearance, free in speech, louing
his libertie, and easily forgetting iniuries: moreouer, he is
liberall, ciuill, curteous, and gentle: of all vertuous qualities,
I thinke that in them are to be found as many cleare and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
testimonies as there are places that speake of their
exploites in vnpassionate Historiographers. For in respect
of ciuilitie what better witnesse can wee haue then <hi>Philip de
Commines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Comines cap. 34.</note> who himselfe had experience thereof in behalfe
of the lord of <hi>Vaucler.</hi> I should speake of a thing but too wel
knowen throughout all the world, if I should spend manie
words in discoursing of their magnificence and liberalitie.
Certainely if that be true which <hi>Herodian</hi> writes of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
men,<note place="margin">Herodian. in Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> namely that they are naturally greedy of money,
Englishmen are sufficiently discharged of the blame of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barousnes:
howsoeuer some ignorant, or passionate writers,
haue endeuoured to stayne them therewith. But to what
purpose is it to stande long on this point, seeing the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and testimony of noble and famous personages dooth
openly ratifie my saying? That good <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> of
famous memorie (who for that himselfe was one of the
most liberall Lo, of our time, might best speake of liberalitie)
said openly that if there were any Nation in Christendome
more liberall and courteous towardes strangers, then the
English, he would be reckoned amongst those which talke
rashly of thinges which they know not. He which hath suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him as well in his vertues as his heritage, protesteth
often that he dares not to speake of the humanitie, liberalitie
and courtesie of the English Nation, fearing to begin a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
the entrie whereof were found much easier then the
issue. <hi>Odet</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Chastilion,</hi> had ordinarily this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his mouth: that courtesie had once imparked her selfe
in France, but that now she was passed ouer the sea.</p>
            <p>This discourse would demand longer deduction, but I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21573:10"/>
am a Frenchman and iealous of the honor of my countrie.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> writes that the great Rethoritian <hi>Molon,</hi> hauing on
a day heard <hi>Cicero</hi> declaiming in Greeke,<note place="margin">Plutarch in the life of Cicero.</note> saide lamenting,
that he deplored the estate of Greece, whose richest orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(meaning eloquence) <hi>Cicero</hi> carryed away with him.
For my part, though I am no lesse affectionate towards the
English Nation then commands the desert of their vertues,
yet so is it that I am sorrie to see them so richly arayed with
our spoiles. In so much that England may by good right be
accounted at this day the very Sanctuarie of all ciuilitie,
kindnesse and courtesie: the testimonies whereof may be
seene not only towardes their friends, and in time of peace,
but euen in time of warre, and towardes their enemies. Of
many examples I will chuse one so notable, as I knowe not
whether the like be to be found in the Greeke or Latine Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographers.
Amongest all the battels which were euer
fought in France, that of <hi>Poytiers</hi> is worthy the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance,
not onely for the inestimable losse of the vanquished, but
much more for the courtesie and generositie of the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher.
For the Nobilitie of France was there hewen in peeces,
many Princes and great Lordes made prisoners, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
king <hi>John</hi> himselfe fell into the handes of the Prince of
Wales, who had him afterwardes into England where here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
so good and gracious intertainement of king <hi>Edward</hi>
father to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> that being on his fayth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages
returned into France, to giue order for his affaires,
after he had thoroughly considered the intertainement that
was made him, he sauoured and liked so well of the English
courtesie, that he esteemed it more honorable to die neere
so noble a Prince, then to liue as king of the greatest and
mightiest kingdome in Christendome. <hi>Porus</hi> an Indian king,
being taken by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and being asked of him how hee
desired to be dealt with at his handes, I am (sayth he) a king,
let me be vsed Royally, as belongeth to a king. <hi>Alexander</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21573:11"/>
farther instant on him to know what he dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded more:
this word <hi>Royally</hi> (sayth he) comprehends all, which made
that <hi>Alexander</hi> esteemed highly of him afterwardes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned
him according to his demand. But this courtesie
of king <hi>Edward</hi> ought to be esteemed so much greater then
that of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as <hi>Porus</hi> tooke no armes against him, but
constrayned for his owne lawfull defence: and contrariwise,
king <hi>Iohn</hi> would not accept such honest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions of peace,
as were offered him by the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> although the
Cardinall of <hi>Perigort,</hi> being sent by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> laboured
to bring him to some composition. But hee being ouer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
by his choler, was ouercome by a handfull of people,
and lost a battell the nineteenth of September, 1356. which
can not so well be compared vnto any as to that memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
exployt at <hi>Cannas,</hi> which was like to haue ouerthrowen
the whole estate of the <hi>Romaine</hi> common wealth. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ciuill warres are ordinarily managed with a courage
so much the more inuenomed, as the allyance is straighter
betweene countrie men: yet so it is (if we credite Histories)
that there is not in all the world any Nation founde, which
in this respect hath remained in such and so long a possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of moderation, and clemencie, as the English. <hi>Comines</hi>
who hath beene as much or more acquainted with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of England,<note place="margin">Comines cap. 112.</note> as any Frenchman of his time, sayth that
the custome of the country is in ciuill wars, to come straight
to battell, &amp; that the chiefe of that side, to which the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
enclines, causeth to be proclaymed aloud, <hi>Saue the people.</hi>
That I would to God wee had vsed the like moderation in
our ciuill warres, we should then at this day haue fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande
more witnesses of our dissention, the shedding of
whose bloud prouokes the anger of God against our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of France. But because that being occasioned as well by
naturall affinitie, as by conformitie of manners, to loue a
people, is not a thing of it selfe deseruing any great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21573:11"/>
without endeuour to make demonstration thereof:
the order of our discourse requires to haue this article sifted
yet somwhat neerer, to the end that such as call the English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ancient enemies to the crowne of France, may learne
eyther to speake better, or else to holde their peace, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
there is question of any such matter. I say then that
the effectes of amitie haue bin alwayes reciprocall beweene
these two Nations. For laying aside that which I alleaged
out of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that the Britains had alwaies succoured the
Gaules in all their warres. I will take testimonies of fresher
memorie, of a hundred or sixe score yeares past.</p>
            <p>In the time of king <hi>Lewes</hi> the eleuenth, <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of
<hi>Burgundie,</hi> desirous to clip the wings of his mortall enimie
<hi>Lewes</hi> of France, called to helpe him <hi>Edward</hi> king of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
his brother in lawe, to whom there needed not much
speech to make him passe ouer into France, whereunto he
wanted no pretence. There was then great likelihood, that
if the duke of <hi>Burgundie</hi> had well knowen howe to vse his
prosperitie, he had eyther quite ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or at least won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
shaken the whole estate of France. But king <hi>Lewes</hi>
being a Prince much better furnished of wisedome, then of
courage, considering to what exigent his affayres were
brought, procured or rather cunningly practised a treatie
of peace with king <hi>Edward</hi> at <hi>Piquignie.</hi> One may well say
that at that time the mildnesse of king <hi>Edwarde,</hi> serued in
steed of a strong and mightie bulwarke vnto France, against
the surious and impetous effortes of the Burgonian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, the sonne and successour of <hi>Lewes</hi> was
fauoured of heauen, so farre foorth as to haue occasion to
acknowledge this courtesie towardes the English Nation:
who was as readie to embrace such an occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely
offered him. <hi>Edwarde</hi> of whom we last spake being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
his brother <hi>Richard</hi> duke of Glocester, by euil practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and vnlawful meanes, inuested himselfe with the crowne
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21573:12"/>
of Englande, defrauding his Nephewes of their inheritance.
If the meanes of inuesting himselfe with so great an estate
were strange and exorbitant, his behauiour and comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therein was yet more strange. Such and so miserable
was then the estate of poore Englande that he escaped best
cheape, who went away with the losse of his goods, estate,
and dignities. Diuerse of good calling and account, to saue
themselues out of this shower, retyred into France. The
Noblest and of greatest name amongest them was the Earle
of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who hauing a while soiourned in Britanie, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
resolued himselfe to recouer with his owne good, the
libertie of his countrie. This newe <hi>Thrasibulus,</hi> wanted ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
friends nor partakers: for he had succor of king <hi>Charles</hi>
the eight, with whom he passed ouer into England, where
hauing giuen battell with happie successe, he had for guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of his prowesse, the estate and crowne, which hath euer
since remained on the head of his successors. I would not
stand so much on the courtesie of England, were it not that
in our time euen within these sixtie yeares the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
had beene so good, and so manifest on our behalfe, that it
were blockishnesse in vs to be ignorant thereof, and great
loosenesse if we did not acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>Since the battell of <hi>Poytiers,</hi> France receiued not so great
an ouerthrowe, as at <hi>Pauie,</hi> where king <hi>Francis</hi> was taken
prisoner. The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> being yet a young Prince,
and boyling with ambition, after so fayre a victorie, entered
into maruellous hopes, and helde himselfe assured that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
fewe yeares, the vniuersall Monarchie of Europe would
be the interpretation of his <hi>Plus oultre.</hi> And indeede there
is great likehood that the forces of France being so mated,<note place="margin">See the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of Bellay.</note>
he might if not wholly, yet in part haue seene the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of his desseignes, had not God (beholding out
countrie with his pitifull eye) stirred vp the heart of <hi>Henrie</hi>
the eight king of England, to stay the course of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21573:12"/>
striking with full sayles through the midst of his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
An act deseruing so much the more admiration as king
<hi>Henrie</hi> had no other occasion to do it, but an Heroicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
with the which his courage being once enkindled, hee
choose rather to appropriate vnto himselfe the sole honour
of releiuing an afflicted neighbour, then to be copartner
with the vanquisher in the spoyle and pray. In so much that
we may well say, that king <hi>Henrie</hi> the 8. next vnto God hath
beene the author of our deliuerance, and that the Lion hath
plucked vs out of the Eagle his clawes. And we must not
thinke that he sought herein either his owne priuate profite
or particular safetie. For touching profite, besides that which
the euent hath made knowen, the protestation which hee
made by his king at armes, defying the Emperor doth show
sufficiently that he had no other end but honor and vertuous
exploytes,<note place="margin">Theocritus in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

gotten the title of <hi>Heroes,</hi> to great and renowmed persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
And in respect of securitie, the Emperour being as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
affectionate towardes his vncle king <hi>Henrie,</hi> for greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of amitie, a mariage was intreated of betweene
him and the Ladie <hi>Marie,</hi> eldest daughter to king <hi>Henrie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Insomuch that all thinges accounted, the English had then
no cause to be affraid of the Emperour. Moreouer, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
could not enterprise any thing on the estate of France
without parting stakes with the English, for their olde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
vnto <hi>Guyen</hi> and <hi>Normandie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This matter deserueth longer discourse, but I studie after
breuitie, that I may speake somewhat of king <hi>Edwarde</hi> the
sixt, the sonne of king <hi>Henrie.</hi> This Prince was so full of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and the feare of God, that he may be good right be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Iosias</hi> of the new Testament, and the Paragon of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Christian. But laying aside his rare vertues, whereof the
best speakers can speake but too compendiously, I will only
touch that which neerest concernes our subiect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:21573:13"/>
This Prince by the counsell of the late duke of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
lande</hi> carried so entire, and sincere an affection to our king
<hi>Henrie</hi> the seconde, that if God had lent him longer life,
there had beene a league made betweene these two kinges
&amp; duke <hi>Maurice</hi> of Saxonie. In such sort that there is great
likelihood that an allyance made betweene three such migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Princes, had then brought the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> to take
that part which afterwardes he tooke, that is, to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into <hi>Castile,</hi> to the Monasterie of Saint <hi>Iust.</hi> I speake not
of his humanitie vsed towardes our poore Frenchmen, fled
into England for refuge in a time, when to make p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ofession
of a Christian life in France, was but to expose themselues
to the death. This obligation is common to vs with almost
all the Nations of Europe, whose exile hath beene honored
with the assistance and comfort of this most holy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
king <hi>Edwarde.</hi> Happie (say I) not only in respect of him
selfe, but for that he hath also in his sister the Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
so perfect a portraiture, and so right a resemblance of
his most Christian and Heroicall vertues. Which causeth
that all such as throughout Europe are indued with sound
iudgement, do wish of all thinges in the world, eyther to be
the subiectes of such a Princesse, or at least to liue vnder the
subiection of such a Prince as might most resemble her. But
I dare not vndertake to set foorth the prayses of Queene <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi>
in respect that if I should omit any one of her rare
vertues, my discourse would not be well taken of the better
sort: and to go about to discourse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by particulars, were
neuer to haue done. Taking then a shorter course, I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say that she hath made demonstration of her good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
France, as often times as the estate of our affaires
hath presented her any occasion. Aboue all, she hath alwaies
showed her selfe affectionate to the intertayning of peace
with vs, being induced thereunto as well by her owne cleare
insight and wise forecast, as also by the mature &amp; sage coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21573:13"/>
of the right vertuous and noble Lords Sir <hi>William Cecill;</hi>
yet at this day Lord Treasurer of England, and Sir <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
Bacon,</hi> of worthie memorie, sometimes Lorde Keeper of
her Maiesties great Seale; personages indued with so high
and eminent wisedome, and so happily qualified in all kinds
of vertue, that he shall well deserue a place amongst the best
speakers that shall duly set foorth their praises to posteritie.
For my part I magnifie that most mercifull God which hath
so well married good happe to the vertue of these two Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

               <note place="margin">Callima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus in hymno Iouis,</note> that in them may be seene the accomplishment

            <p>It remaines now to speake of a like demonstration of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
towardes vs, and yet in a case much vnlike. France hath
not in it any greater ornament, then the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> nor
the City of <hi>Paris</hi> then the exercise of learning, which hath
beene there continued, euer since the time of <hi>Charlemaine:</hi>
that is to say, since the yeare 792. euen till this day with such
reputation, that in the time of our fathers, to haue studied
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and to be well learned, were two diuerse termes sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
one and the selfe same thing. But if this benefite be
great, (as it can not be otherwise accounted sauing of such
as want iudgement) we can not acknowledge to haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it of any but the English Nation, except we will in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21573:14"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their deserued praise, bereaue our selues also
of being reputed a people that loues roundnesse and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie.
For <hi>Charles</hi> the great was induced to this so happie
an enterprise, by the counsell of <hi>Flaccus Albinus</hi> an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
seconded by two Scotishmen, the one named <hi>Ioannes
Milrosius,</hi> the other <hi>Claudius Clemens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But euen as euill counsell, by a iust iudgement of God fals
ordinarily to the preiudice of him that giues it; contrariwise
the author of good and holy counsell, is hee who willingly
tasteth the first fruites thereof: So the Englishmen haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the fruite of that good and wholsome counsell of <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and his companions in that the Vniuersitie of <hi>Oxford</hi> is
a branch of that of <hi>Paris.</hi> But because wee see men to be so
much the more inclined to thinges vnto the which they are
drawen for the conseruation of that which doth neerest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
them: I say that the safetie of England toucheth vs so
neerely, and our safegarde so neerely the English, that one
of the two Nations, being distressed by a stranger, the other
may make reckoning that they are not long to enioy any
great quietnesse. It is knowen that as soone as <hi>Caesar</hi> had set
on foot the Romaine power in France, he thought hee had
not well played his part, vntill he went to remoue houshold
into England. The histories haue so cleared this article, that
it were but superfluitie of speech to extende our selues any
farther in deduction thereof.</p>
            <p>I would now that some one of our maisters of the Court,
who are so affectionate and make so great account of the
allyance of <hi>Spaine</hi> wold show me the like motiues &amp; grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
of their opinion. But I assure my selfe, that they will not put
themselues to the paynes of proouing any naturall affinitie
betweene the French and Spanish, vnlesse they fetch it from
the Arke of <hi>Noe:</hi> or else make reckoning of that which the
Poets tell touching the beautifull <hi>Bebrix.</hi> Which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
were an argument as feeble as far from the purpose
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21573:14"/>
as is knowen to such as are seene in the knowledge of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
and specially of Poeticall fictions.</p>
            <p>But being now entered into this discourse, it will not bee
impertinent to speake of the originall of our Spaniardes at
this day. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as waters which run out of sulphur springs,
haue alwayes a taste of brimstone, so men carrie alwaies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in their manners, the vertuous or vitious qualitie of
their ancestors. So that hauing knowen the originall of the
Spaniardes, it will be a good opening to the discourses en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing.
About the yeare of Christ 717. <hi>Iulian</hi> Count of <hi>Biscay</hi>
being extreemely greeued, and exceeding desirous to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged
of the outrage done vnto him by <hi>Rodericke</hi> king of
the Gothes, who had defloured his daughter, called and
drew vnto him the <hi>Moores</hi> for his succor, vnder the conduct
of their king <hi>Muza Maramamolin.</hi> Vnder this pretence (so
safe a thing is it to bring in forrain forces) the Moores made
themselues masters of all Spaine, except Biscay and Auster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande:
their captaines hauing afterwardes parted this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
countrie amongest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, became so many pettie kings
in Spaine. Since that time the <hi>Saracens</hi> haue beene mingled
farther amongest them. But if wee will fetch the matter yet
farther about (that is) from <hi>Caesars</hi> time, we shall finde that
without speaking of the Romains, who commanded almost
ouer all Europe, the <hi>Gothes,</hi> the <hi>Vandales,</hi> the <hi>Moores,</hi> the
<hi>Saracens,</hi> haue ruled ouer <hi>Spaine.</hi> Therefore if of good right
the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandales,</hi> are counted cruell, the <hi>Moores</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
and reuengefull, the <hi>Saracens</hi> proud, and villanous in
their manner of liuing. I pray you what humanitie, what
faith, what courtesie, what modestie, and ciuilitie, may wee
thinke to finde amongest this scumme of Barbarians? But to
the end it be not thought that I rest rather on presumptions,
then on proofes and sound argumentes, I am content that
this article be cleered by conference of their manners with
ours, that is, of their vices with our vertues, of their vile vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liacquerie,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21573:15"/>
with our generositie. In breefe, such is this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
that if some Rhethoritian would employ his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in framing of a long and liuely Antithesis, he could
not in the world find a subiect more sortable to his purpose,
then the comparing of our conditions with those of this
mongrell generation.</p>
            <p>And to the end that none may thinke that I speake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
booke, to beginne with the blazon of their brauest co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
I will produce a witnesse, who will make them blush
for shame, though they be so brasenfaced, that they blush
not by their wils. If I should but say, that the witnesse whom
I purpose to produce, is a Senatour of <hi>Venice,</hi> yet had I suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
qualified him to make him get credence of wise and
discreete persons. But I will say moreouer, that he is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Senator, and so well seene in the affaires of this world,
that for a man to conforme himselfe after his imitation, is
nothing else at this day amongest the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but to aspire
to an immortall renowne, by a most wise conduct of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of estate. It is (to be short) that excellent and renowned
personage <hi>Andrea Griti,</hi> who discoursing in the Senate of
<hi>Venice,</hi> of the humors of this Spanish generation: beholde
what good testimonie he giues of their integritie.<note place="margin">Guichar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dino. lib. 15</note> The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Nation (sayth he) is vnfaithfull, rauenous, and insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
aboue all other Nations. And where is (I pray you) that
place of the worlde, where those infamous Harpyes haue
once set footing without defiling of it with the footsteps of
their abhominable vices?</p>
            <p>But because that in matter of proofe, the testimony of one
alone is of no great weight. I will yet produce an other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which is <hi>Francis Guichardin,</hi> an Historian so accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
as the naming onely of his giftes and perfections,
would desire and deserue a whole Historie. Behold what te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
he giues of the Spanish integritie. The Spanish
Nation (sayth he, giuing his iudgement of these venerable
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21573:15"/>
               <hi>Padres</hi>) is couetous and craftie,<note place="margin">Guichardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no. lib, 16.</note> and when they haue meanes
to discouer themselues, such as indeede they are, most inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and outragious. <hi>Geryon</hi> king of Spaine (if we giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
to Poeticall fables) had three bodies: and although it be
a Poeticall fiction, yet will it not be found so strange of him
that will thoroughly consider the nature and disposition of
the Spaniarde, in whom may be seene togither incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
a craftie Foxe, a rauenous Wolfe, and a raging Tygre.
And let that be spoken in respect of the least insupportable
of that Nation. For he which shall neerely looke into those
of greatest account amongest them, that is, such as are more
wicked and abhominable, then the vulgar sort, he shall find
in euery one of them the Cube: yea oftentimes the verie
Sursolide of this ternarie monster. He shall finde (I say) an
vncleane and filthie swine, a theeuish howlet, a proud pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke:
and for an accomplishment of all their ornaments, he
shall find a legion of diuels, making trade of lying, coose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and deceauing the world.</p>

be content to confesse, that the Spaniarde hath changed his
custom. I say if pilferie &amp; theft be rather to be esteemed cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomarie,
then naturall in this Nation. And if any doubt of
their sufficiency in this respect, the estate of the low cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries
will so manifest it vnto him, that he wil soone be brought to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that the <hi>Bohemians</hi> &amp; <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> are but young pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises
of the Spaniard in appropriating other mens goods to
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. And he shold do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great iniury, who shold think
that with time they had not made themselues more cunning
in their craft, specially these later yeres, during which a great
many of these gallant spirits haue serued their apprentiship

facultie,<note place="margin">Virg. Eglog. 1.</note> that to go about to compare vnto him an <hi>Autolicus,</hi>
or a <hi>Verres,</hi> were to fall into the errour of the sheepheard

            <p>But me thinkes it were reasonable to hide the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this great Captaine, in contemplation of such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
partes as are in him. For by the saying of his disciples,
and vpholders, he is secret, wise, &amp; of great vnderstanding.
As touching his taciturnitie, I doubt not at all but that he is
verie secrete. Neither is there any thing, specially in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and domesticall actions, but may by him &amp; his with
more honestie be concealed than vttered. Touching his
great wisedome and forecast, he hath giuen such and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
testimonies thereof in the conduct of Flanders affayres,
that if the Sunne should as often eclipse in heauen, as wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hath in his head, during that time there, wee might
well thinke that we were on that daies eue, which shal bring
an end to all things of this world. At the least, it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that his wit so farre fayled him, as that he knew not how
to hide those theftes and robberies which hee had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the poore people (for the thing is too well knowen)
but those pillinges and peculations, which he made on the
treasours of his maister, I knowe well that his creatures dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guising
the deede, say that hee remayned in arrerages. But
laying aside these colours of <hi>Castillan</hi> Rhetorick, I say round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that our French tongue is so bare, that it hath no other
tearme fit enough to specifie the good dealing of the Duke
of <hi>Alua,</hi> but theft and robberie. And therefore if at this day
he practise as well in Spaine with the lute, as he hath doone
with the harpe in Flanders, king <hi>Phillip</hi> may well sende backe
his <hi>Seuerino</hi> into Italy. But howsoeuer it be, the king his
master hath reprehended his auarice, but yet not with
rigour, hauing respect peraduenture to the order of the
fleece, which I dare well say; hee hath no better reason to
beare, then because he first fleeced, and then deuoured as a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21573:16"/>
rauening Wolfe, the innocent sheepe of a good shepheard.
For we must not thinke that hee and the rest of that Spanish
rascall, spared any more the bloud, then the purses of the
poore people of the lowe countries: for they had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
so to do. And their Prince was not with anything
so much moued, as in that they did not handle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet more
extreemely. That soone mayest thou O new <hi>Pharao,</hi> by thy
miserable death make an end of the waylings of so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate
persons.</p>
            <p>But if any one thinke that the courages of the Spaniards
haue been so inuenomed against those of the low countries,
for the different of Religion, he showes that he is as little
acquainted with their naturall disposition, as with the state
of their affaires. It is about a hundred yeares since they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
a new world, vnder the conduct of <hi>Christopher Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus,</hi>
who in my iudgment would neuer haue vndertaken
this voyage, if he had thought that the men whome hee
brought thither, as if they were charmed by the cup of <hi>Circe,</hi>
should straightwaies be transformed into Lions, Panthers,
Tigres, and other sauage beastes. The Indians and Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
are poore barbarous, and simple ones: such as by good
conuersation, and godly perswasions, might easily be wonne
vnto Christ, which way the Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue since that time
both wisely and happily followed. But in truth we may well
say that this new Indian and American world hath not beene
so much vnknowen in times past: as the new and enormous
cruelties, which these diuels incarnate comming out of
Spaine, do there put in practise.</p>
            <p>O Turkes, O Scithians, O Tartarians, reioyce yee now,
sithence at this day there is found in Christendome a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which by their wicked and detestable deeds, go about to
burie that hatred which is borne to your barbarous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But I dwell too long on so tragicall a subiect, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
I do with as great griefe as with iust occasion.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21573:17"/>
Laying aside then such an argument as is sufficient to make
<hi>Democritus</hi> weepe, let vs speake of two articles, eyther of
which is such as hee had neede to be possessed with an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
more then <hi>Heracliticall,</hi> that hearing and considering
them neerely could abstaine from laughter. It is of their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie
and modestie.</p>
            <p>Touching the first, if any haue had that good hap neuer to
haue beene conuersant with Spaniards, and would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
be informed according to the truth of their Gothish
ciuilitie, hee can not see a more liuely portraiture, nor a
draught drawne by the hande of a happier <hi>Appelles,</hi> then <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
in the description which hee makes of harlots in his
<hi>Eunuch,</hi> in these tearmes: <hi>Quae dum foris sunt, nihil videtur
mundius, nec magis compositum quicquam, nec magis elegans.</hi>
And a little after he addeth: <hi>Harum videre est ingluuiem, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
inopiam, quàm inhonestae solae sint domi, atque auidae cibi: quo
pacto ex iure hesterno panem atrum vorent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would say more, were it not for displeasing of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
sort: and we haue here set the Spaniardes on stage like
good Apothecaries, to furnish our selues with laughter at
their charges. And I pray you what man is there so melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
that could forbeare laughter, seeing a burden-bearer,
a cobler, or a carter, to call himselfe Caualiero: or else to
see a Caualiero of Spaine, going thorough the fields, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
the fragmentes of his dinner in a budget, and to play a
thousand other peasauntly partes, which the carriers, cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and carters of our countrie would disdayne once to
haue thought on. The Mathematicians teach, that in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
of Algebra, the most equall is often reduced vnto
lesse. The speeches of the Spaniardes do much resemble this
diuine Algebricall misterie: In so much that ordinarily these
great and magnificent titles of a grand Caualiero, hauing
ten thousand duckets of reuenewe; make as much beeing
taken at their true rate and value, as an vnthrift, a rascall and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21573:17"/>
a runnagate, hauing scarse thirtie Maluedies in his purse, to
pay for patching of his pantofles. So that one may well say
to those magnificent <hi>Dom Diegos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plutarchus in Phocio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> as sometimes said a great
personage of <hi>Athens,</hi> your discourse is like to the Cipres tree,
which being great and high bringeth foorth no fruite.</p>
            <p>To be short, he that would see a liuely picture of an Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
a Suffenus, or a Thraso, without troubling himselfe too
much in turning ouer <hi>Martiall, Catullus,</hi> and <hi>Terence:</hi> let him
onely consider the sterne lookes, and stately speeches of a
Spaniarde. And although these tarcelets of Saracens be
qualified, as I haue sayde, yet haue they with blowes of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolets
so blinded the eyes of some of our Courtiers, that
they are not ashamed to maintayne, that wee are much
bound to these honest creatures. For my part I confesse I am
not so sharpe witted, as to see the foundation of this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
except they will take it in the same sense that <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
did,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note> saying that he was much beholden to the Romains,
who hauing shortned his authoritie and power, had eased
him of a huge and heauie burden. Euen so are wee indebted
to the Spaniards, in that they haue eased vs of such trauailes
as the estates of Flanders, Naples, and Millayne, might haue
brought vnto vs. And moreouer to intreate yet farther of
their good affection towardes vs, is not this a testimonie of
their cordiall Spanish amitie, which they vsed in times past
to our ancestors, (according to their cruell nature) that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
wonne the battell of our men, they slue afterwardes all
the prisoners they had in their hands, as <hi>Froysard</hi>
               <note place="margin">Looke Froysard.</note> witnesseth?
Would any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> craue a clearer interpretation of that which
heretofore I alleaged out of <hi>Guychardine,</hi> that this Nation is
most insolent, when they haue found their aduantage to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
themselues as they are, that is, to take off the maske of
their hipocrisie. It is also a faire testimony of their courtesie
towards vs, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to their promised faith, they massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
our men in <hi>Florida,</hi> about twentie yeares since. I had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21573:18"/>
almost forgotten to produce one notable effect of their
courtesie towardes vs, that is, the imprisonment of king
<hi>Francis,</hi> which himselfe tooke the more greeuously (as
<hi>Guichardine</hi> reportes) because the remembrance of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
courtesie towardes king <hi>Iohn</hi> was deepely engrauen in
his memorie. What testimonie of amitie towards vs is that
which the Spaniardes will alleadge? shall it not be the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
which king <hi>Henrie</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi> gaue in the time of king
<hi>Charles</hi> the fift:<note place="margin">Se Froysard</note> and the victorie which hee wonne before
<hi>Rochell</hi> of the Earle of <hi>Pembrocke?</hi> As if he himselfe had not
reaped the principall fruite of this victorie, or as if such an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
had not beene the chiefe rampire of his owne estate.</p>
            <p>But as the English are conformable vnto vs in so many
thinges as I haue heretofore alleaged, so they haue that also
common with our miserie, that they haue tryed to their cost
the most dangerous amitie of the Spaniards. For <hi>Phillip</hi> king
of Spaine, and then also king of England, hauing purposed
to possesse himselfe of Callis, gaue occasion to the French
to do that with the Lyons clawe, which the Spaniarde had
thought to haue done with the Foxe his tooth: otherwise
the French would neuer haue resolued themselues on so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
an enterprise as the siege of Callis.</p>
            <p>To make short, one may well say, that the Nation of the
worlde which is most affectioned towardes the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale
of France, is that which least resembleth the Spanish,
which so much the more boldlie I conclude, as I hold my
selfe assured that none will paine himselfe so much as to
proue that they haue beene helpefull vnto vs, eyther in the
knowledge of good letters, or in gouernment of our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
For what lightning vnto learning can be expected of
a Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which during this happie age hath scarcely brought
foorth fiue or sixe learned men. Thence I thinke it is, that
the Spaniards (as great trauaylers as they are) neuer durst go
so farre as to the <hi>Hiperboreans,</hi> fearing belike, least they yet
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21573:18"/>
kept their ancient custome, that is,<note place="margin">Pindarus ode. x. Pith.</note> sacrifycing of Asses. For
gouernement of manners, we may well say, that as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
<hi>Polyanus,</hi> being once wedded to the dotages of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi>
forgot all the knowledge which he had of Geometry,<note place="margin">Cicero in Lucullo.</note>
so by the acquaintance of Spaniards, we haue almost forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that vertue which we were best acquainted with, that is,
courtesie and humanitie.</p>
            <p>And to what purpose I pray you, should that Nation bee
so affectionate vnto vs, who hath so little interest in our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe?
nay rather which hath alwayes, and especially
within these hundred yeares, founded their aduancement
on our destruction. I abridge this discourse of purpose, to
intreate of an article of more importance, that is, the means
which both the one and the other hath to helpe and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
vs. I wil speake first concerning traficke, and after touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matter of armes.</p>
            <p>All such as haue knowledge both of England &amp; Spaine,
will agree vnto me, that Englande is much better stored of
people then Spaine. I speake not in respect of proportion,
but absolutely (although England be by a great deale the
lesser) which proceedes onely of the temperature of the
place. For although France be one of the temperatest regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are, yet so is it that <hi>Caesar</hi> sayth expressely, speaking
of England, <hi>Loca sunt temperatiora quàm in Gallia.</hi> This aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of people is a certain argument of the fertilitie of the
place. <hi>Pindarus</hi> in some place calleth <hi>Sicilie</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is,
aboundant in sheepe,<note place="margin">Pindarus ode 1. Olym. Pind. od. 1. Nem.</note> and expounding himselfe, in an other
place he calleth it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, fat or fertile. If the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this so learned Poet be well couched, we may well
conclude, the fertilitie of England, by the great aboundance
not onely of sheepe, but in generall, of cattell which is in it.
Here (it may be) some will alledge the saying of <hi>Cicero</hi> in his
oration entituled <hi>De Aruspicum responsis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cicero in Lucullo.</note> For beholde with
what wordes he speaketh. <hi>Quàm volumus, licèt ipsi nos amemus:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21573:19"/>
tamen nec numero Hispanos, nec rob<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re Gallos, nec calliditate Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,
nec artibus Graecos, nec denique hoc ipso huius gentis ac terrae
natiuo sensu Itales ipsos ac Latinos, sed pietate, ac religione omnes
gentes ac nattones superauimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this place it is easie to see that <hi>Cicero</hi> had rather eares,
then eyes, as well as heretofore speaking of Astrologie. And
that in this discourse, hee would play the part of an other
<hi>Mirmecides,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plinius li. 7. Cap. 21.</note> making a great ado about a small matter. But to
what purpose is it to stande much on this article, since the
trafficke of the one and the other countrie, may easily cleere
it. We haue out of England, Wooll, Tinne, Fish, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other thinges in great quantitie. In exchange whereof
wee furnish them with wine, salt, woad, and diuerse other
thinges, which is the cause that <hi>Rochell, Bourdeaux,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
all the coast of <hi>Normandie, Britaine,</hi> and <hi>Guienne,</hi> is
brought into great perplexitie, when the traficke ceaseth
with Englande.</p>
            <p>Out of Spaine, I confesse, we haue very good Horses for
seruice, although they come but by stealth. Which I doo
neuerthelesse against my will, because that confessing this
article, I am constrayned to accuse the negligence and sloth
of our Frenchmen. For if we would maintaine such races of
horses and mares as are seene at <hi>Lauedan,</hi> our traficke with
Spaine should be accounted of meere charitie: for as much
as we shold helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very much, without being holpen or
eased by them. For the marchandise of a fewe perfumed
gloues, and such other small baggage, deserues not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of. And for their behoose they are constrayned to
borrowe of vs, (by reason of the drinesse and barrennesse of
their countrie) that which is most necessarie for the life of
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is corne. As for wine, they haue sufficient. There
remaines the traficke of wooll, of kersyes, and clothes both
woollen and linnen, which comes not to the thirde part of
that which our Marchantes haue out of Englande. Neither
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21573:19"/>
will it serue to say that he may haue store of corn out of such
places, as he holdeth in <hi>Italy,</hi> as out of <hi>Naples, Sicily,</hi> and
<hi>Millaine.</hi> For they which husbande the matter after this
manner, do not consider that this were but robbing of <hi>Peter</hi>
to pay <hi>Paule. Sicily</hi> is fruitefull I graunt, but it behooueth
that <hi>Malta</hi> and the <hi>Goze,</hi> be sustayned by her fruitfulnesse,
except they will in abandoning of them, expose themselues
for a pray to the Turke. Moreouer a great part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of <hi>Sicile,</hi> are employed on the maintenance of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
But in respect of <hi>Millaine,</hi> and of <hi>Lombardie,</hi> the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde
findes such difficultie of carriage, that hee can not well
helpe himselfe with the commodities thereof, except the
sauce cost him much dearer than the fish is worth. Touching
<hi>Naples, Apulia,</hi> and <hi>Calabria,</hi> as they are lesse fruitfull, so also
the Spaniard can be lesse holpen by them. The like may be
sayd in respect of the lowe countries.</p>
            <p>Some peraduenture will finde it strange, that I stande so
much on the infertilitie of Spaine, seeing that the great
meanes which this Nation hath to helpe vs with, make a
more then suffieient counterpoise, for this default. Heere
must I needes employ that <hi>Quolibet,</hi> which the Iudges of
Rome were woont to vse, when they found themselues per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
for the decision of some matter of importance, that
is to say, <hi>Non liquet.</hi> But this perplexitie of mine, is so much
the lesse, as it may easily be remoued by comparing of the
meanes as well of England as of Spaine. If we will measure
these meanes by the number of souldiers which the one and
the other Nation is able to set forth: experience, (that is Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie)
pleadeth manifestly for the English. And, that so it is;
king <hi>Edward,</hi> of whom we haue spoken afore, brought to the
ayde of the Duke of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> by the testimony of <hi>Comines,</hi>
fifteene hundred men well mounted, the most of them on
barbed horses, and richly furnished. Also fifteene thousand
Archers on horsbacke. In our time king <hi>Henrie</hi> making de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21573:20"/>
into <hi>Picardie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Guichar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine lib. 12</note> to ioyne him selfe with the Emperour
<hi>Maximilian</hi> the first, at the camp of <hi>Terouane,</hi> had fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
horse, and more then fortie thousande footmen, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
fiue and twentie thousand were English, and fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande
Lansquenets. The Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> and his sonne
king <hi>Phillip</hi> haue beene the Princes, who haue commanded
most absolutely ouer Spaine: yet neyther the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue in their warres made greater leauie, then eight
thousand naturall Spaniardes, and almost all footmen. For
in respect of horsemanship, the Spaniarde somewhat resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the sword-fish, which hath a blade, and can not helpe
himselfe therewith. The same may be saide of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes,
who haue very good horses which serue their turne
better to traficke with their friendes, than to fight and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
the enemie. But because that the memorie of late ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes
may serue much to the deciding of this difficultie,
I will here alleage so cleere and euident a testimonie, as that
whosoeuer makes reckoning of Spanish forces, shall haue
nothing for ground of his opinion, but either a light beliefe,
or an opinatiue conceipt. During the raigne of king <hi>Francis</hi>
the second, when the great ones of France were at discord
amongest themselues, king <hi>Phillip</hi> wrote a letter to the king,
which was read in the priuie Counsell: I can not well say
in what language it was written, but the contentes seemed
to smell of the Spanish phrase. For he protested that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
any sturres happen in France, hee woulde helpe the
king his brother, with an armie of fiftie thousande men.
Shortly after occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was offered of effectuating that which
he had so solemnely protested. For France was torne with a
tempest of ciuill warre: And although our miseries made
almost as many fountaines of teares to issue foorth, as there
are townes in France; yet gaue they vnto the king of Spaine
occasion to reioyce, in furnishing him with meanes, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
his promise. Let vs see then how well he acquired
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21573:20"/>
himselfe. He was requested to send succour vnto the King
his brother, being desirous to restablish the Romish religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in her former estate. He, because hee woulde not be
thought to be backewarde, eyther in zeale to his religion, or
amitie towardes his brother, assembled certaine troupes of
those prudent &amp; religious persons, whose ordinarie practise,
is in the straightes of the mountaynes <hi>Pirenees,</hi> to take gold
without waying it, and siluer without telling it. Neither yet
to the number of fiftie thousand as he promised, but of two
thousand only. In sort that it was easie for good Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
to iudge, that this good Prince making such protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as abouesaide, had calculated his meanes by the rule of
false position. Touching the behauiours of these braue and
valorous souldiers, to him that considered them neerely
they seemed to represent I know not what Image of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times,<note place="margin">Thucidide<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> lib. 1</note> during which as <hi>Thucidides</hi> writeth, robberie
was not subiect vnto any reproch. The respect of these good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
qualities, made the Romaine Catholikes to lament so
much the more the losse of these honest men. For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
incamped on the riuer of <hi>Tard,</hi> those <hi>Amazons</hi> of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi>
in certaine sailyes killed a great number of them,
without confession or repentance of any sinne, sauing of
that which is termed militarie temeritie, and ouersight of
warre. But because that in comparing diuerse thinges togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Geometricall proportion is to be accepted aboue
the Arithmeticall, he were not much out of the way, who
would iudge rather by the valour and desert of both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in deedes of armes, then by the number. For oftentimes
a small number of men doth ouercome a great armie, and
treades them vnder foote. I am exceeding sorie that I can
not produce any better testimonies of the English prowesse,
then those great and notable victories which they haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ouer vs. Yet so it is that our valiant Successors wanting
nothing lesse then courage and good will, in those battailes,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21573:21"/>
the English can not vaunt themselues of any thing, more
then that they ouer-came most valiant enemies. So those
Poetes and Historiographers, who haue song of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie,
could not therewith but report our valiancie. In
briefe, the vertue and prowesse of our auncestors, deserued
not to be surmounted by any, but by such enemies as knew
how to vanquish euen victorie it selfe, that is to say, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and insolencie of victorious armes. Let the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans</hi>
boast, as much as they list, of their happie successe at
<hi>Cannas:</hi> yet he that should preferre it aboue the battaile of
<hi>Cressie,</hi> should showe himselfe eyther too much appassionate
or too simply skilled in the knowledge of histories. Out of
which we may gather, that in the sayde renowmed battell
which was fought in the yeare 1346. there were slaine on
our side eleuen Princes, foure score Barons, a thousand and
two hundred horsemen, and aboue thirtie thousande foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Also the battell of <hi>Poytiers</hi> (whereof I haue spoken
heretofore) gaue the like testimonie as well of the English
prowesse in winning of the victorie, as of their courtesie and
mildnesse in vsing of it moderately; which makes mee the
more freely to speake of their vertue, and roundly to confesse
that the smal number on their side, haue made their victories
the more notable and renowmed.</p>
            <p>It were against reason to request the Spaniardes, in this
comparison, to furnish vs with the like examples of their
prowesse and valiancie, for they are discharged of so doing
by that rule of lawe which sayth, that none is bound to the
execution of thinges which are impossible. I should feare
also of being accounted a forger of Paradoxes, in saying that
the Spaniardes are no warlike Nation, if I had not so cleere
and euident proofes thereof, that to denie them were but
fast shutting of a mans eyes, that he might not see the sunne
shine at noone day. And to seeke out the depth of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to reason of effectes by their causes, I say that if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

haue not changed her ordinarie course of working, the
Spaniarde can not any wayes be reputed amongst the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Nations.<note place="margin">Arist. lib. 7.</note> Those Nations which inhabite colde coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith) indued with a more hautie and
stout courage then others:<note place="margin">cap. 7. po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic.</note> but not so quicke and sharp wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as other. And therefore they loue more their libertie,
but are not so fit to beare rule ouer their neighbor Nations.
Contrariwise, the Nations of <hi>Asia</hi> are more quickspirited:
but being of baser courage, they yeelde their necke sooner
vnto the yoke of bondage. And therefore, hee concludeth
that the Greekes holding the midst betweene extreme heate
and extreme colde, are partakers of both complexions. But
as his proposition is founded on so good a consideration,
that all men of vnderstanding will alwayes yeelde vnto it, so
dare I to affirme, that in the applying thereof, the loue of
truth gaue place to the loue of his countrie. For the most
Northerne part of Greece is of fortie foure degrees, which
is the eleuation of that quarter where <hi>Constantinople</hi> is situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and also of the mountaines <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> which separate
France from Spaine. And therefore the fiue and fortith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
which is the very bound of temperature, marking out
the middest of France, we may well say, that our countrie
is more temperate then Greece. But although Englande be
as much or more northernly, then any part of France; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on euerie side enuironed with the Ocean, the colde is
nothing so excessiue there, as it is in France, which <hi>Caesar</hi>
very well obserued. And therefore it is easie to conclude,
that by reason of the situation of the place, that the English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are both warlike and wise, that is to say, accomplished
with whatsoeuer is necessarie to a ciuill life. For the force
of bodie is no lesse requisite in execution,<note place="margin">Pind. ode. 1.</note> than the dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and vigour of wit,<note place="margin">Nem.</note> in deuise and deliberation, as very well

            <p>And it is not sufficient to say as <hi>Commines</hi> doth, that the
Englishmen are very cholericke; a passion which of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doth most trouble a mans iudgement, especially when
he is at point to resolue himselfe. For well it might be so in
the time of <hi>Comines,</hi> when Englishmen were not yet so well
polished, as they haue bin since by the knowledge of good
letters. But since that by the liberalitie of king <hi>Edward</hi> wee
haue seene two <hi>Athens</hi> in one England, that is to wit, <hi>Oxford</hi>
and <hi>Cambridge:</hi> it were hard to iudge whether that so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
a realme, hath beene more plentifull in the fruites of the
earth, then aboundant in fine, subtile, and most excellent
wits, meete for the managing of matters of estate. It is about
three or foure score yeares past,<note place="margin">Machiauell in lib. de principe.</note> that the Italian made the
same reproch to the Frenchmen that <hi>Comines</hi> dooth to the
Englishmen: namely that they could not skill of matters of
estate. But since the time that king <hi>Francis</hi> replenished France
with learned men, by meanes of the professors which hee
caused to come from all partes of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Italians should
flatter themselues ouer much, if they thought that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of ciuill affaires, the Frenchmen were any whit behind
them. Therefore it is that <hi>Petrus Ramus</hi> (a man whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne
flyeth daily through out all the coastes of the world)
did so much enforce himselfe in his familiar talke, to extoll
the liberalitie, and other excellent vertues of king <hi>Edwarde,</hi>
and Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that he thought he neuer had a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
worthie to worke on with his wonderfull eloquence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he were discoursing of the nature of a Princely and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall
vertue, whereof he represented a true and liuely por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture
in the actions, and behauiour of these two Princes.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21573:22"/>
But the desire which I haue with the meanes, to showe that
the Spaniarde is no warlike man, makes me to be somewhat
the shorter in discoursing of the wisedome of the English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
I take that reason which I alleaged out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> to
be sufficient to put backe the Spaniarde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that place which
he pretendes to haue amongest the warlike Nations. Yet if
any man chuse rather to referre himselfe to experience then
to these Philosophicall reasons, I haue sufficient to content
him, if he be a man that will be contented with reason. I say
then, that before this last hundred yeares, the Spanish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was had in no reputation for feates of armes. And for
proofe, I report mee to the testimonie of Histories. I say
moreouer, that since that time looke how often the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Spaine haue placed the chiefest strength of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
in bandes of the Spanish Nation, they haue alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the ouerthrow. The battels of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> &amp; <hi>Serizoles</hi> do
sufficiently prooue my saying. On the contrarie, if they
haue had any aduantages ouer vs, as at <hi>Pauie,</hi> saint <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi>
and at <hi>Graueling,</hi> they ought to thanke the Almaynes,
and Englishmen for it. I confesse that vnder the conduct of
the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> they were brought to some order of
discipline; which they do yet, and shall continue as long as
it shall please God to vse them for the execution of his iust
vengeance. For it is he that both giueth and taketh vertue
to and from men, when and as oftentimes as he himselfe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth,
as the Poet <hi>Homer</hi> hath very well noted, saying:

               </q>
            </p>

question of their owne prowesse and valiancie, yet do they
labour to surmount themselues in this impudent boasting
when they once come to speake of their treasors and riches.
And for as much as this is the chief foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginatiue
greatnesse, I will stand somewhat the longer on this
point and will make it knowen, that if they had but the third
part of that riches which they imagine they haue, they
should be three times richer then they are. The Aegyptians
reported in their Histories, that in the Temple of <hi>Iupiter</hi>
there was a piller made of foure Emerauds, hauing euerye
one of them fortie cubites of length: whereat <hi>Theophrastus</hi>

iested pleasantly, and with great reason. Such like tales are
found in the Spanish Historiographers, concerning the Ile
of <hi>Zipangrie,</hi> where these good fellowes would faine make
vs to beleeue, that flies carrie double pike staues. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the treasures of <hi>Peru,</hi> to make vs vnderstande that their
reportes are made by imitation of <hi>Lucians</hi> true tales, they
seeme not to haue forgotten anything vntolde, sauing that
in the Cabinet of <hi>Atapaliba,</hi> they found a whole hundred of
Diamonds, euery one of them as bigge at least, as an Ostri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
egge. But laying aside these lyes which can not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
of any but of such as beleeue the reall veritie of <hi>Ouid</hi>
his Metamorphosis. Let vs consider that these riches
come not into the king of Spaine his coffers, like grasse in a
medowe, that is to say, without any cost, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
that the carriage cost him deere. Let vs consider far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that other Nations, and especially the Frenchmen
haue learned the way to <hi>Peru,</hi> who fearing perhaps least the
Spaniardes might perish in the sea by being ouer-laden, do
diuerse times of meere charitie, and good will yeelde them
so much succour as to take some part of their burden into
their owne ships. Yea so courteous &amp; friendly be our French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that they constraine the Spaniardes whether they will
or no, to receiue the effectes and testimonies of this their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21573:23"/>
charitable courtesie. Besides all this, the Indians begin to

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21573:25"/>
and become executors of God his wrath, against the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
and crueltie of their owne Nation.</p>
            <p>Now remayneth to be considered the third and last point
of this discourse, that is to wit, whether of these two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being become our enemie, hath most meanes to annoy
vs. This point may well be cleered by that which hath beene
discoursed in the former, touching the meanes which ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of those Nations hath to succour vs with all. Yet so it
is notwithstanding, that if the Englishmen should happen
to set foote in France, and especially in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> it would be
as hard for vs to stay a great part of the Nobilitie and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
from taking their part, as to burie the remembrance
of the good turnes and pleasures, which their houses haue
receiued heretofore at the handes of the kings of Englande,
especially considering that the Charters of the greatest hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Guyen,</hi> are as many testimonies, or rather as many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall
recordes of the obligation wherin they are bound
to the memorie of the kings of England: moreouer, falling
at ods with the English, euerie one knoweth that they haue
good diches, large and deepe, such as can not be drayned.</p>
            <p>On the contrarie part, according to the opinion of that
great Captaine the Admirall <hi>Chastillon,</hi> it were no lesse easie
then expedient for vs to ouercome the Spaniards, if we war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vpon them as we ought, that is to say, if cutting off the
riuer at the spring head, we would set vpon them at home in
their owne countrie of Spaine, which is a land very easie to
be entred into, being both vnfurnished of strong townes, &amp;
which cannot but hardly be succoured fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Germanie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the contrarie part, our armies should be backed by the
countries of <hi>Languedocke,</hi> and <hi>Gascoyne,</hi> both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with victuals, and men of warre, so that in France that
quarter may wel be called at this day the storehouse of Mars.</p>
            <p>If I should adde nothing else, yet notwithstanding the
causes heretofore set downe being well considered, do suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

conclude of themselues, that to preferre, or to match
in equalitie the allyance of Spaine, to that of England, were
openly to show our selues vnnaturall, and vnkinde to our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes.
It were (I say) to shew our selues blockish, and vnable
to discerne the nature that matcheth iumpe with ours, from
that which is cleane contrarie vnto ours; and manifestly to
oppose our selues against the benefite, and welfare of our
countrie.</p>
            <p>The Spaniardes (as we haue sayde) are couetous, craftie,
proud, and rauenous: Shall we change then our franke libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie
into a slauish, and insatiable couetousnesse? shall we
change the generositie of the Lyon, into the subtiltie of the
Foxe? shall we become of gentle, and courteous; arrogant,
and disdainefull? and of milde and meeke, cruell and raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous?
shall we so bereaue our selues of those vertues which
haue gotten vs reputation through out the whole world, as
that there shall remaine no more vnto vs of Frenchmen, but
euen the bare name? And yet if we neerely consider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
disposition of the Spaniarde, that miserable exchange
(whereof I now spake) will be euermore noted, as an euident
and sure testimonie of our ouer great facilitie in making so
great account of that Nation, who (resembling Iuie) hath
alwaies made those to feele the most pernitious effects of
her most hurtfull malice, which haue beene most straightly
allied vnto her.</p>
            <p>Now for as much as prayer is accounted the duetie of an
honest man towards his countrie; I pray to God O France,
that thy preseruation &amp; increase, may be a continuall mirror
of his goodnesse &amp; wisedome, which shineth in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of great estates and kingdomes. And that to the same
end, he vouchsafe to open thy eies, that thou maiest discern
that poyson mixt with hony, by the which they go about to
worke thy ruine, and the vtter ouerthrowe of thy honour
and greatnesse.</p>
