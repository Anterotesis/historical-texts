         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO ALL Ingenious Lovers of MUSICK.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough in this Age Books of all sorts do abound, yet in some Cases there will be still need of writing more. When many Mysteries do remain still undiscovered, no man will doubt, but it is the duty of any Ingenious Lover of a Science, to bring the Truth to Light according to his utmost ability. If any will say, shall we be wise than our Forefathers, to endeavour the discovery of that which they could never find out? The Answer is clear, Truth is the Daughter of Time. A Pigmy upon a Gyants shoulder may see farther than the Gyant himself. Even so, one enjoying the Labours of those, that have gone before, may see as far as they did, and by wading into further depths, may go farther then they, Upon this account it doth more peculiarly belong to every Ingenious Lover of an Art or Science, to continue the work, where they <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it, to add to the stock of knowledge to be clear, where they were confused, to turn into the way, where they went out, and to bring
<pb facs="tcp:48207:3"/>
those things to light, that have been hidden from them, If they further urge, that they are come to the very Zenith and top of all kind of Learning, and that they know already all what they need to know: daily experience will shew the contrary, to wit, that many things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the industry and diligence of the latter times, and that there will be just occasion of writing new Books, as long as new matter remains to be published to the World. Especially is this more evident in the excellent Art and Science of Musick, which transcendeth all others of its rank, because of its profound mysteries, which have many times put the most learned Professors thereof into great admiration. Therefore in this latter Age the most learned and renowned <hi>Alstedius, Des Cartes,</hi> and <hi>Kircherus,</hi> have not thought it any disparagement to make a further, clearer and fuller Discovery, both of the Theorical and Practical Parts of this Noble Science, shewing such a way of an improvement thereof, that those things which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, may be fully discovered; those which are imperfect, compleated; and those which are doubtful, cleared by evident demonstration. But because the Operation and Experience of the Practical Part of Composing, require the study and expence of many years, and so many excellent Tunes for Air, Variety, and Substance are at present Composed by divers eminent Authors, amongst several Nations: to condescend to the meanest Capacity of Beginners, who intend onely
<pb facs="tcp:48207:3"/>
to spend but a small portion of time, and to reap the benefit of the Works of those eminent Composers, there are in this Treatise delivered so Solid, Short and Plain Principles and Rules, that whosoever desires to learn to Sing any composed harmonical Song, may now more exactly, speedily and easily, than ever heretofore attain thereunto. For, besides the Principles and Rules formerly published by divers other Professors of this Art, here are now delivered and demonstrated out of the foresaid famous Authors, the exact division of all the space, which any Sound can pass, into certain degrees, whereof the Scale of Musick doth consist, and the admirable Order of those degrees, their proportional dimensions or intervals, and also the exact agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Cliffs and Syllables with them, and the generation of a Diapason or Eighth in <hi>b flat:</hi> by which means the very beginners will be not only delivered of that toilsome and troublesome torture of mutation of voices or syllables, which hath often caused many of them to despair of ever coming to any perfection; but they will also be very much enlightned, that they may know the transcendent vertue and excellency, that is comprehended in the due proportion of Musical Sounds, and gain a full satisfaction unto their Reason as well as to their Sense. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more here are added twelve most usual Tunes of Psalms in Three Parts, Treble, Mean, and Bass; then twelve selected Tunes of divers <hi>English</hi> Authors, also in Three Parts; two Trebles
<pb facs="tcp:48207:4"/>
and a Bass, with twelve Selected Catches of three Voices; lastly fourteen <hi>Italian</hi> Tunes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by <hi>Giovanni Giacomo Castoldi de Carrivaggio,</hi> also in Three Parts, two Trebles and a Bass, whereby beginners will have a sufficient store of Tunes to exercise themselves by degrees, till they going on further to more difficult Songs at length may come to some perfection, and be able to sing at the first sight any Harmonical Song to their own delightful Divertisement from their more serious Employments. No nobler and more pleasant Satisfaction can be afforded both to Sense and Mind than by this Art, which is known to none but to their own tryal and experience, and by how much the more one exerciseth himself herein, and becomes the more skilful, he will find and enjoy the more delight and pleasure. For the improvement then of all ingenious Lovers, these Rules are thus contrived, the certainty whereof hath been experienced by divers, and may likewise be further known unto others, if they please to try, understand and use them. Now not being willing to weary the Readers Patience, I shall only add, that if any shall (as I doubt not but they will) reap benefit hereby, I receive the end of my desires, and so rest</p>

               <p>For the formal object of it is Singing, wherein it directeth the understanding.</p>

The end and effect of it is, a sweet moving of the affections and the mind. For exhilarating the animal spirits, it moderateth gratefully the affections, and thus penetrateth the interiour of the mind, which it most pleasantly doth affect.</p>
               <p>The means by which it is acquired are a frequent exercising of the voice, as well according to certain signs by which vocal melodies are represented, as according to the direction, either of a well tuned Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or rather of an experienced Master.</p>
               <p>The signs whereby vocal melodies are represented, are either of the melodies themselves, or of the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of them.</p>

The Slower Triple consisteth of three Semibreves, or equivalent Notes, and is marked with the numbers 3 and 1, the former being perpendicularly placed above the latter, because it consisteth of three Notes of one Time, according to the common Time. As in Example <gap reason="music">

               <p>A Breve serving in respect of his latter half part for the elevation of the hand is commonly blacked, and also for the most part his immediately anteceding Note. As <gap reason="music">

               <p>Two or more Breves, the one following immediately the other, are often signed without Pricks or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Notes for a whole time, because then the one perfecteth the other. As <gap reason="music">

               <p>But because they are not sufficient to express the seven degrees of the Scale of Musick, many have had need of divers mutations of them, which (as Experience witnesseth) hath been to Learners, not only a troublesome torture in learning, but also no little hinderance in their going forwards.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the Scale of Musick.</head>
               <p>THE Scale of Musick is an order of seven degrees, distant one from another by just intervals, according to which every sound in ascending and descending is to be directed.</p>
               <p>The degrees of it are certain limits, by which all the space which a sound can pass, is divided so exactly in certain intervals, that a sound may by them be lifted up, or pressed down, in a due proportion, one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing another.</p>
               <p>And these degrees can be by nature neither more nor less in number: moreover, neither can they differ one from another by greater or lesser intervals.</p>
               <p>For all the space of sounds is first of all by Nature itself divided into consonancies, whereof every one is called an <hi>Eighth,</hi> or commonly a <hi>Diapason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because Nature it self sheweth most evidentiy this division in a Whistle, which being blown with a stronger blast than usually, giveth immediately a sound higher by an eighth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48207:20"/>
And this sound, as the higher term of the eighth, although it in respect of its altitude differeth from the graver or profounder term of that eighth therein, that it is only its half part, because it's twice contained in it, like a shorter string in a longer, which is very well known by experiment in a monochord; and that it is weaker, because it is moved of a graver, as of a stronger, which appeareth by the strings of a Lute, whereof if any graver is stricken, that which is by an eighth acuter, immediately trembleth and soundeth: yet in respect of its consonancy it doth equisonate with it after the manner of an unison, which also most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeareth out of the singing of a Song of one voice made by two singers, who can sing that same alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from the beginning to the end, without any dissonancy, yet the one by an eigth higher than the other.</p>
               <p>The eighth therefore is the most perfect consonancy, differing from an unison only therein, that in its terms is the most simple conveniency divers, as between the whole and half.</p>
               <p>The same reason is of an eighth once compounded, commonly called a <hi>disdiapason, a double eighth, or fifteenth;</hi> and of a twice compounded, which is called a <hi>trisdiapason, a triple eighth or two and twentieth;</hi> and also of a thrice compounded called a <hi>tetradiapason, a quadrula eighth, or nine and twentieth,</hi> whereof the one can in no way differ from the other.</p>
               <p>Afterwards an eighth is divided into a <hi>fifth,</hi> and its residue a <hi>fourth:</hi> this is commonly called a <hi>diatessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> that a <hi>diapente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A fifth</hi> or <hi>diapente</hi> is very easily discerned by hearing, because its terms differ between themselves more than they of an eighth, and less than they of a third or ditone, and therefore it soundeth to the hearing not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48207:20"/>
so flatly as an eighth, nor so sharply as a ditone, but most pleasantly of all. For that object is most pleasant to sense, which in its receiving, neither by its easiness wholly filleth the desire of sense, nor by its difficulty doth weary it: because as too much easiness breedeth fulness and loathing, so too much difficulty trouble and weariness.</p>
               <p>And this fifth is the most perfect amongst consonancies next to the eighth, because it is by it self generated out of the division of an eight, which is certainly known by experiment in the strings of a Lute, that if any of them be stricken, that the strength of that very sound, immediately striketh all the strings, which are acuter by any kind of a fifth.</p>
               <p>After that a fifth is divided into a <hi>greater third,</hi> and its residue a <hi>lesser third:</hi> this is commonly called a <hi>Semiditone,</hi> that a <hi>Ditone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This greater third or <hi>Ditone</hi> is also very easily discerned by hearing, because it consisteth in a manifold proportion, consonating with the terms, not only of an eighth, but also of a fifth, and is therefore, next to the fifth, a consonancy so perfect, that it, as experience witnesseth, effecteth upon the strings of a Lute a trembling, which may be perceived not only by seeing but also by hearing.</p>
               <p>Besides, the remaining <hi>Semiditone</hi> is divided into a greater Semitone, and a greater tone, that the acuter term of the greater Semitone may consonate with the acuter term of the eighth, after the manner of a fifth.</p>
               <p>Further this fifth generated out of the division of the foresaid <hi>Semiditone,</hi> is also divided into a <hi>Ditone</hi> and its residue a <hi>Semiditone,</hi> whose <hi>Ditone's</hi> acuter term doth constitute the sixth degree in an eighth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48207:21"/>
Moreover the <hi>Ditone</hi> of the first divided fifth, is divided into a lesser and a greater tone, that the acuter term of this lesser tone may consonate with the acuter term of the sixth, after the manner of a fifth.</p>
               <p>Lastly the <hi>Semiditone</hi> betwixt the sixth an eighth is divided into a greater tone and greater Semitone, that the acuter term of this grater tone may constitute a fifth, with the acuter term of the first <hi>Ditone.</hi>

               <p>THE seven Degrees of the Scale of Musick are then generated after this order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first Degree ariseth out of the division of all the space of Sounds into eighths, and is the graver term of an eighth, as the acuter term of that same eighth is likewise the first Degree of the next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ácuter eighth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The fifth Degree ariseth out of the division of an eighth into a fifth, and its residue fourth, and is the acuter term of that fifth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Degree ariseth out of the division of a fifth into a <hi>Ditone,</hi> and its remaining <hi>Semiditone,</hi> and as the acuter term of that <hi>Ditone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48207:21"/>
4. The fourth Degree ariseth out of the division of the <hi>Semiditone</hi> into a greater Semitone and a greater Tone, and is the acuter term of that greater Semitone, which maketh a fifth with the acuter term of the eighth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The sixth Degree ariseth out of the division of this foresaid fifth into a <hi>Ditone</hi> and <hi>Semiditone,</hi> and is the acuter term of that <hi>Ditone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The second Degree ariseth out of the division of the <hi>Ditone</hi> of the former fifth into a lesser and greater Tone, and is the term of that lesser Tone, and maketh a fifth with the acuter term of the sixth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The seventh Degree ariseth out of the division of the latter <hi>Semiditone</hi> into a greater Tone and a greater Semitone, and is the acuter term of that greater Tone, and maketh a fifth with the acuter term of the former <hi>Ditone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore an eighth is divided according to the successive order of these Degrees into a fifth and its resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due a fourth; that fifth into a <hi>Ditone</hi> and a <hi>Semiditone;</hi> the <hi>Ditone</hi> into a lesser and greater Tone; the <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditone</hi> into a greater Semitone and a greater Tone; that remaining sourth into a lesser Tone and a <hi>Semidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone;</hi> that <hi>Semiditone</hi> into a greater Tone and a greater Semitone.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of the Intervals of the Degrees.</head>
               <p>AND these Degrees are distant the one from the other by these Tones or Intervals. For a Tone is a space, distance, or interval between two sounds, a graver and an acuter.</p>
               <p>Between the first and second Degree is a lesser Tone, containing nine comma's: between the second and the third is a greater Tone, exceeding the lesser by its tenth part, which tenth part is commonly called a Comma; between the third and fourth is an half greater Tone, commonly called a greater Semitone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fourth and fifth is a greater Tone of ten Comma's; between the fifth and sixth is a lesser Tone of nine Comma's; between the sixth and seventh is a greater Tone of ten Comma's; between the seventh and the first of the next following acuter eighth is a greater Semitone of five Comma's.</p>
               <p>So that Nature it self demonstrateth it most manifestly that there can be in the Scale of Musick neither more nor less degrees in number than seven: moreover that they cannot be distant the one from the other by greater or lesser intervals.</p>
               <p>That all these things may appear more evidently, so is the successive division of all the space of sounds, and also the Scale of Musick, together with its degrees and intervals, rolled into a Circle, and represented in the following Figure.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of the agreeableness of the Cliffs and Syllables with the Degrees of the Scale of Musick.</head>
               <p>TO discem rightly these seven Degrees of the Scale of Musick, are commonly used the first seven letters of the Alphabet, called Cliffs (as above is said Chap. 14.) which by their Notes do shew before ones Eyes, the just altitude and profundity of the sound of every Degree.</p>
               <p>And because the Cliff <hi>b,</hi> being by nature <hi>sharp,</hi> can be changed into a <hi>flat,</hi> as afterwards shall be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, so is the first Degree of an eighth represented by the Cliff <hi>c,</hi> the second by <hi>d,</hi> the third by <hi>e,</hi> the fourth by <hi>f,</hi> the fifth by <hi>g,</hi> the sixth by <hi>a,</hi> and the seventh by <hi>b:</hi> which seventh Degree, because it is the acuter term of a greater Tone, it maketh a sharp sound, and therefore that Cliss <hi>b</hi> is called <hi>b sharp,</hi> and the Scale marked with that <hi>b,</hi> the Scale of <hi>b sharp,</hi> and also a Song contained in that Scale, a Song in <hi>b sharp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now reason it self also telleth, that like as there be seven Cliffs shewing the just altitude and profundity of the sounds of every Degree to the sight, that there also must be used seven voices or syllables, which also may fitly represent the same altitude and profundity of the Sounds to the hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48207:23"/>
And there can be no fitter syllables than the six of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> now by long use every where received, if to them be added the seventh, to wit, <hi>ci,</hi> because they make by their letters a sound convenient enough.</p>
               <p>For <hi>ut</hi> and <hi>fa</hi> afford a flat and esseminate sound; <hi>re, sol,</hi> and <hi>la,</hi> a natural and middle; but <hi>mi</hi> and <hi>ci</hi> a sharp and man-like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ut</hi> agreeth with the first Degree, because this Degree is distant from the seventh Degree of the graver eighth by a greater Semitone, which therefore also maketh a flat sound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Re</hi> answereth the second Degree, because this Degree is distant from the first by a lesser Tone, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also affordeth a natural and middle sound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mi</hi> is like to the third Degree, because this Degree is distant from the second by a greater Tone, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also emitteth a sharp and man-like sound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fa</hi> agreeth with the fourth Degree, because this Degree is distant from the third by a greater Semitone, and therefore also maketh an effeminate and flat sound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol</hi> answereth to the fifth Degree, because this Degree is distant from the fourth, indeed by a greater Tone, but moveable into a lesser, as afterwards shall be demonstrated, when <hi>b</hi> flat shall be treated of, and therefore also affordeth a natural or middle sound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>La</hi> is like to the sixth Degree, because this Degree is distant from the fifth by a lesser Tone, and therefore also giveth a natural and middle sound.</p>
               <p>Lastly <hi>Ci</hi> doth agree with the seventh Degree, because this Degree is distant from the sixth by a greater Tone, and therefore also maketh a sharp and man-like sound.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of the generation of an Eighth in <hi>b</hi> flat.</head>
               <p>FUrther because there be in an Eighth two greater Semitones, and the acuter term of a greater Semitone be the first Degree of an Eighth, so must then be considered, how an Eighth with every one of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees is exactly to be made out of the acuter term of the latter greater Semitone.</p>
               <p>The first Degree of that Eighth let be the acuter term of that latter <hi>greater Semitone,</hi> to wit, the fourth Degree of the former Eighth.</p>
               <p>The second Degree of an Eighth should be distant from the first by a <hi>lesser Tone,</hi> and the thiid from the second by a <hi>greater,</hi> but the fifth Degree of the first Eight is distant from the fourth by a <hi>greater Tone,</hi> and the sixth from the fifth by a <hi>lesser Tone,</hi> therefore there must be made a fraction, which is the difference of a <hi>greater and lesser Tone,</hi> and is commonly called a <hi>Schisma</hi> or <hi>Comma,</hi> and that <hi>Comma</hi> must be taken away
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48207:24"/>
from the <hi>greater Tone,</hi> and be added to the <hi>lesser,</hi> then the second Degree of this Octave will be distant from the first by a <hi>lesser Tone,</hi> and the third from the second by a <hi>greater Tone</hi> which was required.</p>
               <p>The fourth Degree of an Eighth should be distant from the third by a <hi>greater Semitone,</hi> and the fifth from a fourth by a <hi>greater Tone,</hi> but the seventh Degree of the first Eighth is distant from the sixth by a <hi>greater Tone,</hi> and the first from the seventh by a <hi>greater Semitone:</hi> therefore must here also be made a fraction by the difference of a <hi>greater Semitone,</hi> to wit, a <hi>greater Semitone</hi> must be taken away from the <hi>greater Tone,</hi> and be added to the <hi>greater Semitone;</hi> then the fourth Degree of this Eighth will be distant from the third by a <hi>greater Semitone,</hi> and the fifth from the fourth by a <hi>greater Tone,</hi> which also was required.</p>
               <p>The sixth Degree should be distant from the fifth by a <hi>lesser Tone,</hi> the seventh from the sixth by a <hi>greater Tone,</hi> and again the first from the seventh by a <hi>greater Semitone,</hi> now the second Degree of the first Eighth, is distant from the first by a <hi>lesser Tone,</hi> the third from the second by a <hi>greater Tone,</hi> and the fourth from the third by a <hi>greater Semitone,</hi> therefore these Degrees do well agree amongst themselves, and all the latter eighth is perfected.</p>
               <p>The Scale arising out of this Eighth is called the Scale of <hi>b flat,</hi> because herein <hi>b sharp</hi> is turned into <hi>b flat;</hi> and also a Song contained in this Scale, is called a Song in <hi>b flat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it beginneth in the Cliff <hi>f,</hi> and is therefore distant from the Scale of <hi>b sharp</hi> by its gravity, by a fifth, for in so much as a Sound is flatter, in so much it is also graver, and needeth lesser breath, that it may be uttered. Both these Scales, as well of <hi>b sharp,</hi> as of <hi>b flat,</hi> together with their Cliffs and Syllables, rolled into a Circle, are exactly represented in the following Figure: the degrees of the Scale of <hi>b sharp</hi> with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Lines, but the degrees of the Scale of <hi>b flat</hi> with lines made of small points.</p>

               <p>Therefore a Song being proposed, first must be the Cliff consulted what Cliff it be, and whether in <hi>B sharp,</hi> or in <hi>B flat,</hi> and accordingly by its Name be called: from thence must be proceeded to the Notes according to the Scale, in ascending and descending to the end of the Song.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Of the signs of the Ornaments of Songs.</head>
               <p>SIgns of the Ornaments of Songs are also by Artists less carefully expressed, the Art of Singing with Graces and Orntments being left to Beginners, to attain to it by the imitation of those, who are perfect in it.</p>
               <p>Yet these few directions are commonly given, that the chiefest ornaments do consist in Exclamations, Trillo's, and Gruppo's.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48207:28"/>
An Exclamation is a slacking of the Voice to reinforce it afterwards, and is especially used in Minims and Crotchets with a prick, whom shorter Notes do follow.</p>
               <p>A Trillo is a shaking of the Uvula on the Throat in one Sound or Note, as the Gruppo is in two Sounds or Notes, the one being by one degree higher than the other, and are commonly used in cadences and closes.</p>
               <p>These Ornaments are not to be used in Airy Songs, which require only a lively and cheerful kind of Singing, carried by the Air it self: but in Passionate Musick, wherein must be kept a command of the breath, by taking heed, that by spending much in one place it do not afterward fail in another when it is needful. Besides the ordinary measure of Time is here less regarded, for many times is the value of <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Notes made less by half, and sometimes more, according to the conceit of the words, with a graceful neglect.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> Of the second Mean to attain the Art of Musick.</head>
               <p>HItherto is treated of the frequent exercising of the voice, according to certain signs by which vocal melodies are represented, as the first Mean, whereby the Art of Singing is to be acquired: followeth now the other mean by which it is attained, the often exercising of the Vo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e also, by the direction either of a well Tuned Instrument, or of an experienced Master.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48207:28"/>
Because a Beginner cannot at first order his Voice, in rising and falling of the Sounds according to the several Degrees of the Scale of Musick, he must therefore guide his Voice in unity of the Sounds, either of an Instrument, especially of the Virginals which are well tuned, or of the voice of one, who in this Art is well experienced: a little practice by singing sometimes with, and sometimes without this help, will so estabiish his Voice, that he will be able to express by Voices all the Degrees of the Scale, and any Sounds of any plain Song according to them.</p>
               <p>But in the exercising of the Voice is this Order to be observed.</p>
               <p>First of all must a Beginner learn the Scale of Musick, that he may be able to express exactly in Or erall the Sounds of every Degree, in Ascending and Descending.</p>
               <p>After that he must learn to Tune a Third, a Fourth, a Fifth, a Seventh, and an Eighth, in Ascending and Descending from every Degree: which he will speedily attain, by Sounding at the first Tuning by Degrees all the middle Notes, and afterwards by leaving them out, as in Example. <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>From the First Degree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>From the Second Degree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48207:29"/>
After the same manner must they be Tuned from the rest of the Degrees. And being herein also exactly skilled, he must begin with any plain Song, consulting first the Cliffs whether it is in <hi>B sharp,</hi> or in <hi>B flat,</hi> naming it by its proper name, and then proceed from the Cliff to the first Note of the Song, giving it its name, and Tuning it so to the pitch of his Voice, that when he cometh to his highest Note, he may reach it without squeaking, and to his lowest without grumbling, so that his Voice may come always clear from the throat.</p>
               <p>Then he must sing over all the Song first with the syllables, till he can sing exactly: Afterwards leaving the syllables, he must sing it over with the Text or words underwritten, and that so often till he can sing it all, with all readiness.</p>
               <p>Having thus exercised himself in easier Songs, he must strive continually to exercise himself after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by Degrees further in harder Songs, till he cometh to perfection, and can sing any Harmonical Song at the first sight, using this Art to his own Recreation, and the Glory of God, which are to Vocal Musick its subordinate and ultimate end.</p>
