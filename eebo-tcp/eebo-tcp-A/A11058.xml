            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Yet there is great relation betweene Christ, Gods internall Word, and the Scripture, his external word, for as none knoweth the Father but by the Sonne, his word internall; so none knoweth the Father &amp; the Son, but by the Scripture, his Word externall.

Secondly, to shew the vanitie of this life, which is so short. Thirdly, to put vs in minde of our mortalitie, that wee might prepare our selues for our end.

                     <head>Q. Why would God haue more cleane then vncleane beasts in the Arke?</head>
                     <p>A. The vncleane were preserued onely for propogation, but the cleane. First, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogation. Secondly, for man to eate. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for sacrifice. Therefore God would haue more cleane then vncleane, besides, by this God would teach vs two things. First, that there should bee more cleane then vncleane in the Church, as there was in the Arke, that is, more good then bad; for we are chosen to be holy and without blame. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it falles out otherwise that in Christs field there are more weedes then corne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his loue and care, in that he will haue but few of the vncleane saued, because the most part of them are wilde and cruell to man; and hurtfull to the cleane beasts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are more Doues then Hawkes, Sheepe then Woolfes, yet some of these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadge beasts hee would preserue, that hee might vse them as instruments to punish mans rebellion.</p>

                     <head>Q. How is it vnderstood that some beasts are cleane some vncleane?</head>
                     <p>A. By nature all beasts are cleane because good. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31. and there is nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane of it selfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 14. but some are

called vncleane, because men doe account them so. Secondly, because they are not vsed for meate. Thirdly, because afterward by <hi>Moses</hi> Law they were excluded from being offered vp in sacrifice.

                     <head>Q. Was there any distinction of cleane and vncleane beasts before the flood?</head>
                     <p>A. Yes, <hi>Moses</hi> indeed did establish this distinction, but it was in vse amongst the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before him, and many things else.

two wayes God remembers the creatures.

                     <p>A. Both is true, for the first day of the first moneth the earth began to drie, so that the waters were quite remooued, but the earth was not perfectly drie till the 27. day of the second moneth, and by this reckoning also we see that <hi>Noah</hi> was in the Arke a full yeere, that is, 365. dayes: for he entred the Arke the 17. day of the second moneth in the 600. yeere, and there continued till the 27. day of the 2. moneth in the yeere 601.</p>

                     <p>A. Although it was now time for him to goe, seeing the earth was drie, yet such was his modestie and obedience, that as he did not enter the Arke without a warrant from God, so hee will not goe out without the same warrant, so should we depend on Gods mouth and doe nothing but what hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth: for obedience is better then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:

                     <p>A. It is most like that it was made of earth, for this law was giuen after by <hi>Moses; Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>verse</hi> 24. An Altar of earth thou shalt make to mee: secondly, this kinde of Altar was most vsuall, euen amongst the Gentiles, <hi>Hic viuum mihi cespitem, hic verbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas pueri ponite thuraque, Horat. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>od.</hi> 19. thirdly, by this <hi>Noah</hi> will teach vs, that God delights not in external pompe and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; he loueth the giuer more then the gift, and the widdowes mite more then the rich mans sinnes.

                     <p>A. We doe not reade that God did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely command this, yet wee may gather by consequence that <hi>Noah</hi> did not this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant. First, it was ancient to serue God after this manner, as we see in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Habel.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Noah</hi> did nothing without Gods warrant, without this he did not build the Arke, nor enter therein; nor come out from thence, much lesse would he build an Altar. Thirdly, we see that God smelled a sauour of rest in his sacrifice, which could not be if it had beene offered without Gods direction. Fourthly, <hi>Noah</hi> knew that the seauenth beast was receiued into the Arke not for procreation but for Sacrifice. Fifthly, he did questionlesse beleeue in Christ our perfect Sacrifice, therefore he could not testifie his faith better then to build an Altar and offer a sacrifice.</p>

Yes, else it had beene no great blessing to haue receiued the vse of flesh, and that flesh doth nourish more it is knowne by the Phisitians, who prescribe flesh to their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents but not hearbes: secondly, we see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that those who feede most on flesh, are more lustie and strong, then they who feede on hearbes: thirdly, that is best foode which is most neere to the nature of him

To him that is pure all things are pure; Gods children may eate any thing if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with thankes, for the beasts were created not only to serue but also to feede man; and good reason hath man to kill the beasts for his foode: both because God hath giuen him authoritie so to doe.

Therefore he should receiue this benefite of them; but as for the wicked they haue no interest other then ciuil in any of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they eate and drinke not by right, but by vsurpation, if wee consider the freedome of grace.</p>

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:16669:88"/>A. In my opinion it was lawfull, because there was no law against it: secondly, the beasts were created to be eate: thirdly, their flesh then was as nourishing as now: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they before the flood had their flockes of sheepe not only to cloath their nakednesse with their skinnes: but also to satisfie their hungers with their flesh: but although it was lawfull, yet it was not much vsuall, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongst the Saints: first, because they had no positiue law to eate flesh as now: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the earth then beeing in her full vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour yeelds store of excellent hearbs: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, mans nature then was stronger, but now after the flood his strength begins to decay and his yeeres to shorten.

                     <p>A. There is a foure-fold seruice. 1. diuine, which all creatures owe to God by right of creation. 2. naturall, which is nothing else but the subiection of inferiours to their superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours proceeding of loue for order sake, and this should haue beene in the state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie: thirdly violent, when men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to serue, and this kinde of seruice is hatefull and bitter: first, because it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the libertie of mans nature: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because it is contrarie to the end of mans creation, for man was created to rule and not to serue: thirdly, it is repugnant to the image of God, a part whereof doth consist in ruling and commanding, and this seruice is a curse laid vpon man for sinne: the fourth kinde of seruice is <hi>diabolicall,</hi> when a man doth serue his sinnes and mancepate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his owne affections, for whosoeuer committeth sinne, is the seruant of sinne. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 34. and he that serueth such masters may be called a seruant of seruants, and such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants were the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> seruing not onely their brethren, but also their owne abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,

                     <p>A. No, for many things haue and doe proceede of euill causes, which God doth turne to good vses: secondly, seruice is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for sinne, and therefore should not bee reiected, but with patience indured: thirdly, it is a meanes to beate downe our pride, and contempt of God; and this means God vsed against the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to serue the <hi>King of Aram</hi> eight yeeres, and <hi>Eglon King of Moab</hi> 18. yeeres. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3.

This then is that tongue in which God spake and gaue his Oracles, both before and after the flood.

First, because they were now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly increased, and an 100. yeeres had beene pinned vp in that countrey, therefore now seeing all feare of the flood was gone, they thought good to discend to the plaine and inlarge their habitation.

Properly speech belongs not to any thing but to man, who onely hath the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of speech, yet there is an internall and mental speech in spirits, which is nothing but the reasoning and discoursing of the minde; and this speech is imperfect in respect of man; for none vnderstands what is in the minde of man but himselfe; in Angels it is more perfect, for they vnderstand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this mentall speech; but in God it is most perfect, for after an incomprehensible manner, he speakes to himselfe, and the three persons in the glorious Trinity doe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand one another after that manner which we cannot conceiue, much lesse expresse. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> as our minds internally and spiritually can speake to God although our tongues do not mooue, so can the Angels speake to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, so can God both to them and vs. In times past God spake so to the Prophets, and oftentimes by his Spirit he speakes so to his Saints still, yet God may be said to speake, when he frames audible voyces in the ayre,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16669:125"/>
as <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. Or when his Angels assuming mens bodies, doe speake in his name, as often in Scripture and most excellently did hee speake when his onely begotten Sonne did assume the whole nature of man. By this essentiall word he hath spoken to vs in these last dayes. Now because the Father speakes here to the Sonne and Holy Ghost, wee can neither define nor diuine how he spake; yet this we know, that he being eternall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible, did speake after an eternall and incomprehensible manner.</p>

And this confusion of tongues did take away that vnion which was amongst men, and hath beene the cause of hatred and contempt amongst nations.

                     <p>A. No: for so there had beene no society amongst men, if none could haue vnderstood anothers speech, and so the world could not haue beene replenished with people but it is probable according to the opinion of the Ancients, that their tongues were diuided according to the number of the families, so that euery family spake a language, which those that were of another family could not vnderstand. Now this confusion of speech is the third vniuersall punishment with which he doth correct the world, for the first was mortality, denounced against <hi>Adam</hi> and his posteritie: the second was an vniuersall flood: and this an vniuersall confusion of tongues; and that diuision of tongues is a great iudgement, we may see in the 55. <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. where <hi>Dauid</hi> doth wish it against his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>

                     <p>A. Because he was borne when his father <hi>Terah</hi> was a hundred thirty yeares old, for <hi>Terah</hi> dyed two hundred fiue yeares olde, vers. 32. of this cap. Then <hi>Abraham</hi> departed from <hi>Charran</hi> 75. yeeres olde. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 4. therefore if <hi>Abram</hi> was 75. yeeres old at the death of his father, it is manifest that he was borne the 130. yeere of his fathers age, and so consequently he was yonger then <hi>Nachor</hi> and <hi>Haran</hi> who were borne before this time: for <hi>Milcah Nachors</hi> wife was the daughter of <hi>Haran. verse</hi> 29. therefore que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse <hi>Haran</hi> was the eldest.

If then he died and had a daughter who was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before <hi>Abraham</hi> was 75. yeeres old, then doubtlesse he was the eldest, if then <hi>Abraham</hi> was borne when <hi>Terah</hi> was 130. yeeres old, <hi>Haran</hi> must needs be borne when <hi>Terah</hi> was 70. For at that time he begate, that is, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to beget children. <hi>verse</hi> 26. Therefore by this also we may gather that <hi>Nachor</hi> was elder then <hi>Abraham.</hi>

                     <p>A. No: for before our calling we are all by nature the children of wrath. <hi>Abraham</hi> was an Idolater, as well as the rest of his kindred, <hi>Ios.</hi> 24. 2. For how could hee else

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16669:133"/>
nor by present benefits, as those who were healed by Christ and the Apostles, nor by working of miracles as many in the Gospell, but by the bare word of God, <hi>Get thee out of thy country, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, hee was called not because of his fore-seene faith, much lesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his fore-seene merits, for both these follow calling; <hi>Non praecidunt iustificandum, sed sequuntur iustificatum.</hi> But hee called him, because it was the good pleasure of his will, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 5. Fourthly, he is not called onely to a priuate office or function, as <hi>Saul</hi> was to the kingdome, and <hi>Iudas</hi> to the Apostleship, and neither of them to grace: but he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both to bee a Father and Prince on his people, as also to be a member of that City which he looked for; whose builder and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker is God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 10.

And truly as the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the wicked, hinders the seruice of God, so nothing fitter to aduance it, then a priuate life, free from the multitude. Amongst whom we both see and here these things, which doe not bring vs to God, but drawes vs from him; yet here I doe not commend the idle life of the Monkes, which is vndertaken more for superstition then religion, for the belly then the soule, amongst whom for the part: gluttonie; couetousnesse and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doe reigne, instead of sobrietie, meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and continencie, as <hi>Helias Abbas</hi> did complaine, although I finde nothing in that kinde of life contrarie to true Christianitie, if so be it were purged from errour and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, and corrected according to the patterne of that life, embraced by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, and so highly commended by the fathers.

                     </head>
                     <p>A. First, that hee would make of him a great nation, which hee performed in his children by <hi>Agar,</hi> but more wonderfully in the Israelites by <hi>Sarah,</hi> being old and barren, but aboue all in the spirituall Israelites. For hee is the father of all them that beleeue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. Secondly, That hee will blesse him, and so he did in earthly things. For he was very rich in cattell, in siluer and golde<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 2. and 24, 25. But specially in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. Yea in all things God blessed <hi>Abraham. Gen.</hi> 24. 1. Thirdly, he will make his name great; (not as the Hebrewes thinke by putting to the letter (He) and of <hi>Abram,</hi> making it <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> for this coniecture is ridiculous) but he will make his fame and person glorious. For the name is often taken for the person it self, as thou hast a few names in Sardis, that is, a few persons. <hi>Reu.</hi> 3. 4. And Gods name is in Scripture taken for himselfe, then <hi>Abraham</hi> was great and famous, for his faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for Gods care to him for many bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings

he had of God, in his sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> in barren <hi>Sarah,</hi> in his posteritie the Israelites, in the faithfull, whose father hee is; in that God calleth himselfe, the God of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But specially in that Christ came of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> according to the flesh, so then <hi>Abrahams</hi> name shall bee so great, that hee shall bee a blessing to others. Fourthly, hee will blesse them that blesseth him, and curse them that curse him; so <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> were blessed for his cause; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was plagued, the foure Kings ouerthrowne, and <hi>Abimelec</hi> terrified for his sake; but this cursing and blessing hath beene alwaies seene executed vpon the friends and enemies of the Church; the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian, Persian, Grecian, Romane Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, haue beene cursed for cursing her. But the mid-wiues in Aegypt, the whoore <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab,</hi> the widdow of Serepta, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue beene blessed for blessing her. Fifthly, in him all the families of the earth shall be blessed, that is in his seed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18. Which the Apostle expoundeth of Christ. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. For the blessing of God is come to the Gentiles through Iesus Christ. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. God hath sent Christ to blesse vs, in turning euery one of vs from our iniquities. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 26.

all spirituall blessings, &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3.

This beauty of <hi>Sarai</hi> made <hi>Abraham</hi> giue her counsell to say that shee was his sister, and not his wife, for hee knew what danger there is to haue a beautifull woman. And truely oftentimes beauty hath beene the cause of murther and mischiefe, the wife of <hi>Vriah, Lucretia, Helina,</hi> and many more can testifie, therefore beauty is not so much to be regarded as vertue. <hi>Abraham</hi> then had good cause to feare the Egyptians, because they are blacker then the Cananites, and when they see a faire woman, which is scarce in that hot country, they are exceeding prone to defloure her, hee knew also that the aboundance and plenty in Egypt, brought out incontinance and intemperance among them.</p>

Fourthly, neither can we altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther say that hee sinned in hazzarding his wifes chastity, if we looke to his faith. For we may thinke that hee who in greater matters depended vpon Gods prouidence, did also in this; and was assured that God would rather deliuer her, then suffer her chastity to be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as the euent sheweth: yet we will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but some humane infirmities are mixed with this action of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for he did not call <hi>Sarai</hi> his sister in that sence that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> vnderstood her to be.

                     <p>A. His wife <hi>Sarai</hi> is commended by the Princes to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and she receiued into his house, here then ws see that <hi>Sarai</hi> did as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> desired her, and in this shee shewed her selfe a louing and faithfull wife, who will rather hazard her chastity, then suffer her husband to be killed. Secondly, in that the Princes commended her, we haue here the nature of flattering courtiers set downe, who accommodate themselues to the humors and vices of their king. Thirdly, we see in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians the nature of carnall men, who are more mooued with externall shewes and beauty, then with internall vertue and grace.

                     <head>Q. Why could not <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> dwell together?</head>
                     <p>A. Because their substance was great, where we see that <hi>Lot</hi> also had great riches, and questionlesse the more for good <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> sake, with whom he still did keepe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany till now. Secondly, these two whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pouerty, long iournies, nor famine, could separate their great substance and wealth, do
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16669:149"/>
separate, such is the nature of riches, when Rome was poore, there was great concord, but when it waxed potent and rich, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed diuision and rent of the Empire, so there was no distinction and heart-burning betweene <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> till they waxed rich, and the Christians while they suffered persecution and pouerty, they did maintaine loue and concord amongst them, they were of one heart and minde, yea had all things common, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. But after the Church grew rich, they who should haue beate their swords into plow-shares, and their speares into pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hookes, did beate their plow shares into swords, and their pruning hooks into speares. Thirdly, in that <hi>Abraham</hi> must depart from <hi>Lot</hi> his kinsman, whom he loued so dearely, it was no small griefe to him, thus God did cast him downe, lest his riches should too much puffe him vp. Fourthly, the cause of this strife was without doubt scarcity both of pasture ground and water for their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. Fifthly, seruants oftentimes doe breede quarrels amongst themselues, which are the cause of strife betweene their masters, as we may see here in these heards-men.

much lesse should Christians, who are not onely the sonnes of God and brethren with Christ, but also the members of the same bodie.</p>

                     <p>A. Whether these three were infidels or notit is vncerten, and I rather hold that they were not, both because <hi>Abraham</hi> made 2 couenant with them, rather then with others, as also because wee cannot deny but there
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16669:164"/>
were some in these parts, who knew the true God. As <hi>Melchisedech</hi> who conuersed in these countries, was both a king and priest of the most high God, it is very like that his seruants and many more were of his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and if there were, why should we think that these three who were <hi>Abrahams</hi> speciall friends to be infidels, seeing the holy man made a couenant with them, but suppose they were infidels, yet we cannot reprooue <hi>Abraham</hi> for this couenant made with them because as yet there was no positiue law to the contrary.

Which plainely sheweth he descended of another stocke then the Iewes did who came of <hi>Sem.</hi> Fourthly, all this country in which <hi>Melchisedech</hi> reigned, was possessed by <hi>Canaans</hi> posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Therefore <hi>Sem</hi> could not bare rule here, to be both a king and a priest among them. Fifthly, if we should yeeld that <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech</hi>

was <hi>Sem,</hi> wee must be forced to deny a chiefe relation betweene <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> and Christ, which <hi>Paul</hi> toucheth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. Which is this, as <hi>Melchisedech</hi> beeing a stranger from the family of <hi>Sem,</hi> was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding a priest and king; so Christ though a stranger from the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> which onely was appointed for the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, is notwithstanding a king and priest for euer. Sixthly, <hi>Melchisedech</hi> had no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour in his priest-hood, but <hi>Sem</hi> had, for <hi>Abraham</hi> was a priest, so was <hi>Isaac, Iacob,</hi> and the children of <hi>Leui.</hi> Seauenthly, if <hi>Melchisedcch</hi> was <hi>Sem.</hi> Then, whereas <hi>Leui</hi> payd tithes being in the loynes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> he being also in the loynes of <hi>Sem,</hi> (because <hi>Abraham</hi> came of <hi>Sem</hi>) did pay tithes to <hi>Sem,</hi> which is absurd. Eighthly, if this be true, then we must confesse that in the person of <hi>Sem,</hi> both the priesthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for <hi>Aron</hi> was in the loynes of <hi>Sem,</hi> and so we must yeelde that Christ in that he was a priest after the order of <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech,</hi> he was also after the order of <hi>Aaron.</hi> Ninthly, if <hi>Melchisedech</hi> had beene <hi>Sem,</hi> it it is very like that <hi>Abraham</hi> all this while
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16669:168"/>
that he was in <hi>Canaan,</hi> would not negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to haue sought him out, and conuersed with him, both for his further comfort, strength and instruction, then the fift opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is soundest, which holdeth <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> to haue beene a <hi>Cananite,</hi> yet a true worshipper of God, for it is very like, that as God had his priests amongst the Iewes, so he had some amongst the Gentiles, and as <hi>Aaron</hi> among the Iewes was eminent, so <hi>Melchisedech</hi> among the Gentiles, for God is the God of the Gentiles, as well as of the Iewes, and besides that <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Iosephus</hi> are of this opinion, the chiefest of the auncient Fathers doe defend the same.</p>

and hee who bestoweth all things onvs, doth require no more but his tithes of vs, for the tithes doe not principally belong to the preachers, but to God; and he who setteth them a worke is their pay-master. Therefore hee who withholdeth the tithes from the preachers, doth not so much wrong the preachers as God, to whom they properly belong. Moreouer, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of paying tithes is not altogether ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall, but partly morall, partly iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: morall, in that the labourer is worthy of his hire, especially they who labour in the word are worthy of double honour, for he that serueth at the Altar must liue by the Altar.

And other famous synods haue most strictly enioyned the paying of tithes, then seeing tithes are both commanded by God to be paid, as also by the ciuill magistrate, it is both sacriledge and contempt against the magistrate (whom we must obey for conscience sake) not to pay them, truely if it had not beene the speciall will of God, euen in the time of the Gospell, to pay tithes to the preachers, Christ had not commended the Scribes and Pharises for paying of them, which he doth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. Againe, it was necessary in the old law to pay tithes to the <hi>Leuites,</hi> much more needfull is it now in the Gospell, for the preachers are not onely the <hi>Leuites</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, but also their calling is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and their charge is greater. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides our righteousnesse must exceede the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharises, or else we cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen, but their righteousnesse was so great, that they did not omit to pay their tythes, euen of the least things; therefore much more carefull must we be to let the preachers haue their due; the Gentiles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so led by the law of nature, were carefull in

thing, &amp; thinking another, for an oath is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make an end of strife, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. But such oathes doe increase strife. Sixthly, that we sweare not by the name of Idols, or false Gods, for that is also to attribute Gods glory vnto them, and they that sweare by them doe seeme to put their trust and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them, if then we sweare at all, let vs sweare only by God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did here, who lifted vp his hand in testimony thereof, for we know that the Gentiles did honour their false gods by vsing their names to confirme their oathes, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> by <hi>Fides Plut. in numa.</hi> The Vestall Nymphus by <hi>Vesta,</hi> the Carthaginians by their countrey gods, some by <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> others by <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> did vse to sweare, much more should wee then seeke the glory of the true God by calling vpon him in our lawfull oathes.</p>

                     <head>Q. Did <hi>Abraham</hi> well to refuse the king of <hi>Sodomes</hi> offer?</head>
                     <p>A. Yes: because he would not haue him thinke that it was for his owne profite hee vndertooke this battle, neither would hee haue any thinke, that he would bee so much beholding to a prophane king, neither did he stand at this time in need, because hee
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16669:175"/>
was sufficiently rich. Besides he would let him and all ages see how little hee did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard riches, and how little we should, seeing our treasure is laid vp in heauen. Yet this fact of <hi>Abrahams</hi> is no president for any to refuse gifts when they may lawfully take them, for <hi>Abraham</hi> did not refuse the gifts of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> nor <hi>Ioseph</hi> the present of his brethren, nor <hi>Salomon</hi> the gifts of the Queene of <hi>Seba,</hi> neither did <hi>Ezechia</hi> refuse to take gifts from the king of <hi>Babel,</hi> nor <hi>Ieremy</hi> from the captaine of the guard, nor <hi>Daniel</hi> from <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> nor Christ from the wise men. Notwithstanding, wee must know, that taking and giuing of gifts, is not alwayes lawfull, for it is dangerous and suspicious for any subiect to receiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gift from a for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It is also vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to receiue gifts from the poore, and those that cannot spare them, for wee must giue to the poore and not take from them: no lesse preposterous and impious it is for a iudge or magistrate to receiue gifts to doe iniustice, for, <hi>Oblatio muneris tinea est re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giminis, Cassiod. in epist.</hi> But most of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable it is to take or giue gifts for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, for deliuerance from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,

But I will not seeme too much to exclaime against this abuse, because the time will come, when the reeds will proclaime it, as they did the long eares of <hi>Midas.</hi> Besides <hi>Harpocrates</hi> teacheth me that, <hi>Tutum est silentii praemium,</hi> Now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the matter, no gift is to bee giuen or taken which is contrary to true piety, or Gods glory, for such a gift blindeth the wise and peruerteth the words of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 8. Secondly, it peruerteth the naturall affection of men, so that <hi>Iudas</hi> for a gift sold his master, the souldiers for a gift did bely Christ, saying, that his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples stole him by night, and <hi>Dalilath</hi> for a gift betrayed <hi>Sampson, Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, auri sacra fames?</hi> Thirdly, it is an enemy to liberty, for he that is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:16669:176"/>
with gifts, hath his hands bound from doing good, and his mouth from speaking truth. Fourthly, it is the cause of iniustice, therefore cursed be he that asketh a gift to slay an innocent person, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 25. And woe to them which iustifie the wicked for a gift, <hi>Esay</hi> 5. 23. 5. It is a hinderance to true happinesse, for, not he that taketh bribes, but he that shaketh his hands from taking of bribes, shall dwell on high, &amp;c. <hi>Esay</hi> 33. 15. Sixthly, the reward of these that take such rewards is fire, fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery, <hi>Iob</hi> 15. 34. For these causes therefore many holy men haue refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed gifts, as the man of God refused to take a gift from <hi>Ieroboam, Eliseus</hi> from <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Dauid</hi> from <hi>Araunah, Daniel</hi> from <hi>Belthashar,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>Simon</hi> the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer.
