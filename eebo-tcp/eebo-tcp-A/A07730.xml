            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

came to light.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Caleb Morley</hi> in May next following vpon his Maieſties owne preſentation to the ſaid Church of <hi>Stalbridge. Ratione lapſus ſeu aliquo alio quocunque modo,</hi> was
admitted, inſtituted, and inducted Parſon thereof, His Patent of preſentation hauing in the body thereof theſe words (<hi>Mandantes &amp;c.</hi>) and in the foote
thereof theſe words, <hi>Per Breue de Priuato Sigillo.</hi> And afterwards the now Earle of <hi>Caſtle-hauens</hi> Father viz. <hi>George Lord Audley</hi> who confirmed the ſaid
Leaſe as aforeſaid dyed.</p>
            <list>
               <head>The Queſtions vpon the whole Precedent matter are Two.</head>
               <item>I. Whether <hi>Morley</hi> or <hi>Alan Biſhop</hi> be lawfull Parſon of <hi>Stalbridge.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. Whether the ſaid Leaſe be good againſt <hi>Morley</hi> being Parſon.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>To the firſt is anſwered,</hi> that the Church was at that time voide when his Maieſtie preſented the petitioner <hi>Morley,</hi> and not full (as is ſuppoſed) for <hi>Alan Biſhop,</hi> was
neuer Parſon there for Two Cauſes,</p>
            <p>1 He the ſaid <hi>Alan Biſhop</hi> was for euer diſabled for the ſame Benefice by reaſon of his Simonicall Contract as aforeſaid, as may appeare by the Statute againſt Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
as followeth. If any perſon ſhall or doe for money reward, gift, profit or benefite directly or indirectly, or for or by reaſon of any promiſe, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
grant, bond, Couenant, or other aſſurance directly or indirectly preſent any perſon to any Benefice with Cure, that euery ſuch Preſentation ſhall be
vtterly void; And the perſon ſo corruptly taking, procuring, ſeeking or accepting any ſuch Benefice, ſhall thereupon bee adiudged a diſabled perſon in
Law to haue or enioy the ſame Benefice. And the ſaid <hi>Alan Biſhop</hi> hath beene ſentenced and depriued for the ſaid Simonie, by ſeauen Reuerend Biſhops,
and ſeauen others in his Maieſties Court of High Commiſſion;</p>
            <p>2 The ſaid <hi>Alan Biſhops</hi> preſentation is voide alſo by deceiuing the King in his Graunt; <hi>Coke 6. Reports fol.</hi> 29. For he made a counterfeit Certificate, in his
own handwriting, that the ſaid Parſonage was but 17. pound value in the Kings Bookes, and in the Lord Chancelors right and gift as aforeſaid, and ſo obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a Preſentation vnder the broad Seale by the warrant of the Lord Chancellor, whereas in truth the ſaid Parſonage is 27. pound 4. ſhillings value in the
Kings Bookes, and therefore in the peculiar and imediate gift of his Gracious Maieſtie, and beyond the Lord Chancellors power and gift.</p>
            <p>The late Honourable Lord Chancellor <hi>Egerton</hi> acknowledged in open Court that <hi>Morley</hi> was rightfull Parſon of the ſaid Benefice, and graunted the Writ <hi>De vi
laica remouenda</hi> to ſettle him in quiet poſſeſſion, which poſſeſſion was further alſo confirmed for <hi>Morley</hi> by a Verdict, Iudgement and Execution to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of 20. <abbr>l'</abbr>. againſt the ſaid Earles Bailiffe, for taking and carrying away his Tythes, in his Maieſties Court of Kings Bench.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is alledged that the opinions of ſome of the Iudges are againſt <hi>Morley;</hi> their opinions were grounded vpon a wrong Caſe, as making the King to
preſent aſwell the ſaid <hi>Alan Biſhop</hi> as <hi>Morley,</hi> without any mention of the ſaid counterfeit Certificate and ſuggeſtion, which being afterward made knowen
to the now Honourable Lord Treaſurer, his Lordſhip did acknowledge thereupon that the King was deceiued in his graunt, and the graunt voide as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.
And further how euer the pretence be, it will appeare, that it is but one of the ſaid Iudges that gaue and holdeth the ſaid opinion, all being done
likewiſe, without hearing <hi>Morley</hi> or his learned Counſell.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is alledged that a verdict did paſſe againſt <hi>Morleys</hi> Leaſee for 4. <abbr>l'</abbr>. that was by the euidence of <hi>Alan Biſhop</hi> the ſaid conuicted and depriued Simoniſt
being a principall partie, who againſt his Oath vpon Record in the Hon. Court of Chancerie, and High Commiſſion teſtified againſt the ſaid <hi>Morley.</hi> And
it was by a Iudge who ſhould haue giuen the ſaid <hi>Morley</hi> the benefit of the Law before (whereby, his Maieſties Title had neuer come in further queſtion)
but did not, being requeſted and required thereunto, and againe the ſaid Iudge gaue his opinion without hearing againſt the King and his right &amp; Title, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Kings graunt muſt be taken <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <list>
               <head>REASONS in equitie againſt Alan Biſhops Preſentation by the warrant of the L. Chancelor.</head>
               <item>1 If this caſe ſhall be made good for <hi>Alan Biſhops</hi> Preſentation, the King and his Succeſſors will looſe their right &amp; praerogatiue and this will be the leading Caſe.</item>
