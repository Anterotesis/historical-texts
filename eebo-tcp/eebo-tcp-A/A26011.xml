            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Nterpreters call this Text a Proverbe, the interpretation whereof is to be fetched from the occaſion of it.</p>
            <p>God by way of tryall did put his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Abraham</hi> upon a ſad taske,<note place="margin">Verſ. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> a dead ſervice, commanding him to make a burnt offering of his ſonne, his ſonne <hi>Iſaack,</hi> the ſonne of his age, and the ſonne of Gods promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take now thy ſonne, thy only ſonne</hi> Iſaack <hi>whom thou loveſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>and get thee into the land of</hi> Moriah, <hi>and offer him there for a burnt offering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How heavy this worke was likely to be upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart, I leave it to the judgement of any affectionate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he hath ſeriouſly peruſed the law of the Lord concerning burnt offerings.</p>
            <p>The offering being ſlaine it was to be cut in peeces,<note place="margin">Lev. 1.6.8, 9.</note> the wood being laid upon the Altar fire was to be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the parts, the head, the fat were to be laid in order upon the wood, the inwards and the legs being waſht in water, all were to be burnt on the Altar.</p>
            <p>When the good old man had chewed this bitter pill for the ſpace of three dayes, towards the end of the third day,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.4.</note> he lifting up <hi>his eyes ſaw the place afarre off</hi> where his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64090:4"/>
deareſt ſonne muſt be ſacrificed.</p>
            <p>Being come to his journeyes end he builds the Altar, binds his ſonne, and layes him thereon. What patheticall conference pafled betweene them two, the Holy Ghoſt reveales not. But what it was each affectionate heart will make conjecture. When the father (no doubt with a heavy heart) had taken the knife, and lifted up his hand, and was ready to give the deaths blow to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Iſaack,</hi> now imagin you what were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſtraights.</p>
            <p>Is it not probable he might have ſuch reaſonings as theſe? If I kill not my ſonne God will be incenſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is diſobeyed; If I doe, how will the world cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and cenſure, being ignorant of my warrant, and therefore apt to judge my act both impious and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</p>
            <p>Now in the Mount is the Lord ſeene, divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſweetly and gloriouſly appeareth two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſonne is ſpared.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>How welcome were theſe words to the working warme heart of <hi>Abraham,</hi> being ready to let forth the life of his welbeloved ſonne? The execution is checkt, <hi>Iſaack</hi> is not killed,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.17.</note> and yet the intention of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience herein is graciouſly accepted: yea and as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of mercy, he is aſſured by Chriſt the Angell of the covenant,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note> that God accounted him one that truly feared his name. <hi>Now J know thou feareſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This unexpected providence might worke in the good mans heart willingneſſe to tender unto the Lord an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in way of thankfullneſſe, that his Majeſty might have ſome homage in the ſame place where he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much favour. And though ſpeedy proviſion of that kind was as farre from <hi>Abrahams</hi> thoughts, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his ſonne, yet when he lifted up his eyes and looked, <hi>behold behind him aramme caught in a thicket by the hornes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>went and tooke the ramme
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64090:4"/>
and offered him up for a burnt offering in the ſtead of his ſonne, and</hi> Abraham <hi>called the name of that place</hi> Jehovah Jireh. <hi>In the Mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not trouble you in reporting the various rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of theſe words from the originall. In ſhort, the engliſh of my Text is this, <hi>Mans extremity is Gods opportunity.</hi> Or if you would have my Doctrine in other words, take it thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Mount, in the midſt of ſtraights it hath beene the manner of the Almighty,</hi>

               <hi>mercifully to manifeſt himſelfe for his ſervants comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things that I ſhall deſire to ſpeake too in the proſecution of this point, purpoſeley pitched upon becauſe of this dayes perplexity.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Confirmation, that it may be ſtrongly beleeved.</item>
               <item>2. Application, that it may be ſeaſonably improved.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Confirmation of the Doctrine I will give in.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By Scripture.</item>
               <item>2. By Reaſon.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Scripture proofe you ſhall have under two heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Promiſes of God.</item>
               <item>2. The experiences of the godly.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I will mention only two pretious Promiſes, becauſe they are ſufficient, being both pregnant and pertinent, ſpeaking both fully and punctually to the point in hand.</p>
            <p>The former is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.12. where the ſweet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Chriſts regall authority being tipically foretold by King <hi>Solomons</hi> government,<note place="margin">Pſal. 72.12.</note> we have this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. <hi>He ſhall deliver the needy when he cryeth, the poore alſo and him that hath no helper.</hi> You may doe well to marke the fitneſſe and fullneſſe of the Promiſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. When Chriſt finds his people in themſelves poore and needy, deſtitute of abilities to ſhelter themſelves from wrong and violence.</item>
               <item>2. When in regard of others it is thus with them, <hi>viz.</hi> not only that they have weake helps, or few helpers, but when they have no helpers, none at all.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64090:5"/>3. When in this diſtreſſe they cry out as perſons in an undone condition, then, though not till then will he deliver.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The other Promiſe is regiſtred in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36. <hi>For the Lord ſhall judge his people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32.36.</note> 
               <hi>and repent himſelfe for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants when he ſeeth that their power is gone, and there is none ſhut, up, or left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The language is large, and hath much in it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the proofe in it is apparent to every eye, I will leave it.</p>
            <p>The experiences of the godly which I ſhall produce you may pleaſe thus to conſider:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Of ſingle Perſons plunged into deepe dangers.</item>
               <item>2. Of companies, whether few or many, compaſſed about with devouring perills on every ſide.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For ſingle Perſons, I will inſtance in foure Examples.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 6.16.17, &amp;c.</note>The firſt is of <hi>Daniell,</hi> wherein fource circumſtances are remarkeable.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. He was <hi>caſt to Lyons,</hi> not only one but many, the number we know not.</item>
               <item>2. He was put into the Lyons den, and the doore was ſhut, <hi>a ſtone was brought and layed upon the mouth of the den</hi> that he might not get forth from thoſe beaſts of prey.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>The King ſealeth it with his owne ſignet, and with the ſignet of his Lords, that the purpoſe might not be changed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> Daniell.</item>
               <item>4. In this darke den of deadly danger he continued a whole night, and in this great ſtraight <hi>the Lord by his Angell, ſhut the Lyons mouthes that they did his ſervant no hurt at all.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The ſecond Example is that of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. from the 25. to the 28. Saul <hi>purſued after</hi> David <hi>in the wilderneſſe</hi> of Maon, <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>went on this ſide the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and</hi> David <hi>and his men on that ſide of the Mountaine, and</hi> David <hi>made haſte to get away for feare of</hi> Saul, <hi>for</hi> Saul <hi>and his men compaſſed</hi> David <hi>and his men round about to take them. But there came a meſſenger unto</hi> Saul <hi>ſaying, haſt thee and come, for the</hi> Philiſtines <hi>have invaded the Land,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64090:5"/>
wherefore</hi> Saul <hi>returned from purſuing after</hi> David.</p>
            <p>In this Example theſe things are conſiderable.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It was no leſſe then <hi>Davids</hi> life that now was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered.<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note>
               </item>
               <item>2. The <hi>Ziphites</hi> who were acquainted with <hi>Davids</hi> holds, combined themſelves alſo againſt him.<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note>
               </item>
               <item>3. All this ſtrength did not only in a warre-like way take up armes to meete him, for then by flying backe he might have made an eſcape, but they compaſſed him round about.</item>
               <item>4. His ſtrength was not ſufficient ſafely to breake through theſe blood-thirſting forces: Now in this ſtraight, an unexpected providence procures his preſervation: In this <hi>Mount</hi> was God ſeene gloriouſly.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The third Example is that of <hi>Paul,</hi> which you have in the 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 30.31, 32. <hi>All the City was moved, and the people ranne together, they bound</hi> Paul, <hi>drew him out of the Temple, and forthwith the doores were ſhut, and as they went about to kill him, tydings came to the chiefe Captaine of the band, that all</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was in an uproare, who immediately tooke ſouldiers, and Centurions, and ranne downe unto them, and when they ſaw the chiefe Captaine and the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they left beating</hi> Paul.</p>
            <p>Herein you may note:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The generall Inſurrection, <hi>All the City.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Their violent Oppoſition, <hi>They drew him out.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Their bloody Intention, <hi>It was to kill</hi> Paul.</item>
               <item>4. Their entrance upon execution, <hi>They were beating him</hi> to beate out his life: Now in this ſtraight commeth tydings, leave him there is ſomething elſe to doe: Thus was God in the <hi>Mount</hi> ſeene, and <hi>Pauls</hi> life preſerved.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The fourth Example is of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 12.4, 6, 7. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in note:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That <hi>Herod</hi> intending to kill him (having done ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution upon <hi>James, ver.</hi> 3.) had apprehended him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned him.</item>
               <item>2. In priſon he was committed to the cuſtody of foure quaternions of ſouldiers, that for every watch both day
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64090:6"/>
and night there might be 4. looking to him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent eſcape.</item>
               <item>3. The night before he was to be brought forth, he was bound with two chaines, and two ſouldiers had him betweene them. And now, that night, and in that ſtraight, he was delivered by the Angell of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The experiences of Gods people in combined com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, come in the next place to be conſidered, and for brevities ſake I will only ſuggeſt three.</p>
            <p>The firſt is of <hi>Shadrack, Meſheck</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> wherein their Perſons are not ſo many as the particulars notable in their deliverance, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21, 22, 23. &amp;c. <hi>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the forme of his viſage was changed againſt</hi> Shadrack, Meſech <hi>and</hi> Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego, <hi>therefore he spake and commanded that they ſhould heate the furnace ſeven times more then it was wont to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From theſe words their extreame perill with which they were beſieged, appeares in five circumſtances.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Their death is determined by the King, who had authority to command both their tortures and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.</item>
               <item>2. The moſt mighty ſouldiers were appointed to bind them, and doe execution upon them.</item>
               <item>3. The furnace being heated ſeven times more hot then ordinarily, did burne to death them who undertooke their burning.</item>
               <item>4. Theſe 3. men, were caſt not only into the mouth, but into the midſt of the furnace.</item>
               <item>5. They fell down bound in the midſt of the burning fiery furnace. Now in this condition, conceive how little hope could be expected of life to be continued, and yet it is affirmed by the Holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>that they had no hurt, upon their bodies the fire had no power, nor was the haire of their head ſinged.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The next is of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> recorded, <hi>Exodus</hi> 14. wherein theſe things ſet forth <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> extremity.</p>

               </item>
               <item>2. The purſuit made after them, <hi>They purſued after the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the</hi> Egyptians <hi>purſued after them,</hi>

            <p>Vpon ſuch occaſions the Attributes of the Lord breake forth in glory, His Wiſdome is moſt manifeſted when it worketh beyond meanes, above meanes, that humane reaſon cannot find out divine foot-ſteps. His Power truimphs when all oppoſition ſhrinketh before his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous workings. The like might be ſhewed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his other excellencies. The event of Gods dealings with <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the three young governours in the times of their ſtraights, diſcover that this was Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in thoſe providences. For marke how <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> and the King <hi>Darius</hi> did trumpet forth the praiſes of the God of <hi>Shadrach, Meſech, Abednego</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> when they were eye witneſſes of thoſe two glorious deliverances which were wrought on by omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency.<note place="margin">Dan. 3.28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>Then</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>ſpake and ſaid, bleſſed be the God of</hi> Shadrach, Meſhach <hi>and</hi> Abednego, <hi>who hath ſent his Angell, and delivered his ſervants that trusted in him, and have changed the Kings word, and yeelded their bodies that they might not ſerve, nor worſhip any god, except their owne God. Therefore I make a decree, that every peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nation and language, which ſpeake any thing amiſſe againſt the God of</hi> Shadrach, Meſhach <hi>and</hi> Abednego, <hi>ſhall be cut in pieces, and their houſes ſhall be made a dung-hill, Then King</hi> Darius <hi>wrote unto all people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 6.26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>nations and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, that dwell in all the earth. I make a decree, that in every dominion of my Kingdome, men tremble and feare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64090:7"/>
the God of</hi> Daniell, <hi>for he is the living God, and ſtedfaſt for ever, and his Kingdome that which ſhall not be destroyed, and his dominion ſhall be even unto the end. He delivereth and reſoueth, and he worketh ſignes and wonders in Heaven and in earth who hath delivered</hi> Daniell <hi>from the power of the Lyons.</hi> By both theſe inſtances it is evident, that the Lord doth appeare in the Mount for his owne ſake, to get and raiſe himſelfe a name in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God doth thus work in reſpect to his own people. And here I will note only foure particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes that he might diſcover to his ſervants for their encouragement, both the truth and ſtrength of his owne graces in them. This was the reaſon why God thus tryed <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might manifeſt that holy feare which was planted in his breaſt. Hereupon God putteth him to it, and carrieth him into the Mount, leadeth him into diſtreſſe by degrees, acting him on to build the Altar, to lay the wood in order, to bind his <hi>Iſaack,</hi> to lay him upon the Altar, upon the wood, yea to take the knife, and to ſtretch forth his hand to ſlay his ſonne, before he did appeare for his comfort, in giving order for the lengthening of <hi>Iſaacks</hi> life. And now when there ſeemed to be but one minute of time unto the effuſion of <hi>Iſaacks</hi> blood, heare the good newes from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Abraham I know thou feareſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes to manifeſt the feebleneſſe of ſome grace in their hearts for their humbling, <hi>Peter</hi> thought himſelfe full enough of courage to come to Chriſt upon the ſinking ſeas it he might have a call. Well! marke the iſſue, Chriſt calleth him, come out <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>when he ſaw the windes boyſterous,</hi> and when his ſooting failed, <hi>he began to ſinke, then he was afraid and cryed out,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 14.28, 29, 30, 31.</note> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon obſerve Chriſts anſwer, <hi>O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That he may ſet the graces of his Spirit in exerciſe, both for their increaſe, and for the enfeebling of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary luſts. We know that habits are ſtrengthened by exerciſe, and grace is augmented in its meaſure, by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64090:8"/>
being put forth vigorouſly in it's operations. And by how much any grace gathereth ſtrength, by ſo much the oppoſing corruption becommeth feeble in a Chriſtian breſt. And that the Lord hath this end in this kind of working, it might be evidenced by manifold inſtances, but for brevities ſake, I will only point at one, in one ſingle experiment.</p>
            <p>As holy affiance in God is confirmed, ſo by ſuch like diſpenſations creature confidence is abated in holy hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>But we had the ſentence of death in our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God which raiſeth the dead, who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver, in whom we truſt that he will yet deliver us.</hi> Men in ſtraights ſee the ſtrength of creature helps ſhunke up, and withered, whereupon they dare leane to them no longer; but Gods irreſiſtible power profound wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, abundant goodneſſe, and other glorious attributes in ſuch difficult caſes being clearely diſcovered, the ſoule is incouraged confidently to caſt it ſelfe into his armes for future times.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That their deliverance might be more ſweet to their ſpirits, and conſequently that their joyes might the more readily runne out before his Majeſty in holy thankfullneſſe. When we expect that now our houſes ſhall be fired, the City ſack it our eſtates waſted, our wives abuſed, our children cruelly murthered, our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath and weeke day meetings interrupted, our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſſolved, and our Kingdome deſolated. Now to ſee theſe clouds to blow over, and our Sunne to breake forth againe, oh how ſweet will this glorious change be to our now-dropping hearts! <hi>Davids</hi> experince ſpeaks to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal</hi> 34.1, 2, 3. A Pſalme of <hi>David</hi> when he changed his behavior before <hi>Abimelech,</hi> who drove him away, and he departed. <hi>I will bleſſe the Lord at all times, his praiſe ſhall continually be in my mouth: My ſoule ſhall make her bouſt in the Lord, the hamble ſhall heare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and be glad, oh magnifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.</hi> Pſal. 86.12, 1, 3. <hi>I will praiſe thee O
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64090:8"/>
Lord my God with all my heart, and I will glorifie thy name for evermore. For great is thy mercy toward me, and thou haſt delivered my ſoule from the loweſt hell.</hi> But more fully and fitly may our Kingdome concernments be expreſſed by: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24. if our God be pleaſed now to appeare in the Mount for <hi>London,</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> in this day of our deep danger, and exceeding, exceeding great feare, And our deſired deliverance from preſent perplexities, may with joy of ſoule be expreſſed by the words of that Pſalme. <hi>If it had not beene the Lord who was on our ſide, now may</hi> England <hi>ſay, if it had not beene the Lord who was on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, then they had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled againſt us, then the waters had overwhelmed us, the ſtreame had gone over our ſoule, then the proud waters had gone over our ſoule. But bleſſed be the Lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God thus worketh in regard of his peoples ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, both the Divell and diveliſh men. 1. In regard of the Divell, that he might ſtop his black and ſlanderous mouth, which is upon all occaſions wide open in wayes of calumny, caſting ſlanderous accuſations upon Gods good ſervants. When all <hi>Jobs</hi> eſtate was removed in a day, all his children knockt dead at one blow, God commending <hi>Job</hi> ſaith thus to Satan,<note place="margin">Job 2 3.</note> 
               <hi>Haſt thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheweth evill? and ſtill be holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedſt me againſt him to deſtroy him without cauſe. And Satan anſwered and ſaid, skin for skin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 4, 5,</note> 
               <hi>yea all that a man hath will he give for his life, put forth thy hand now and touch his bone, and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> Hereupon God bringeth <hi>Job</hi> into further ſtraights, for this very purpoſe to ſilence Satan.<note place="margin">Rev. 12.10.</note> And whereas thoſe malignant ſpirits continue to be the accuſers of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and are ſtill apt to provoke his Majeſty againſt them, ſuggeſting, that if his providence put them to pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they will then ſly out, and manifeſt their carnall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64090:9"/>
fleſhlineſſe in the profeſſion and practice of Religion: Hereupon God puts them (as it were) into the ſtocks, and ſets them upon the rack, and cauſeth them to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged with difficulties to prove Satan a notoriour lyar.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard of divelliſh men. Partly to fill their hearts with the more vexation: Partly to chaine down their violent ſpirits, that they may not breake forth with further fury againſt his cauſe and people, and through the power of ſtrong conviction, to work ſome change in their lives and courſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To fill their hearts with the more vexation. The Lord doth indeed rejoyce in the miſery of the wicked. <hi>I will laugh at your calamity,</hi>

Now to keep us from adding guilt to our grief, that we may not provoke God to be angry, while our enemies are filled brim full of bloud-thirſting fury. I will briefly ſuggeſt foure conſiderations, to preſerve us from this miſtake.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By this error acted, we deny the perfection of the word of God, becauſe therein there is no ſuch rule to judge by. Yea the Scriptures openly and evidently ſpeake the contrary, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1, 2. <hi>No man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them. All things come alike to all, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked.</hi> And certainely if we ſhall dare to adde our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes to Gods word,<note place="margin">Prov. 30.6.</note> he will be angry. <hi>Adde thou not unto his words leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a lyar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus people beare falſe witneſſe againſt themſelves, by paſſing unjuſtifiable ſentences againſt their own ſoules.<note place="margin">Exod. 20.16.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſſe againſt thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> To detract from our neighbours credit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, is a breach of Gods law. And truly it admits ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aggravations, when we deale thus injuriouſly with our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We expreſſe much ingratitude to God, the God of all our mercies, calling his love into queſtion, and overlooking or undervaluing all former favours, becauſe of preſent preſſures and approaching dangers. Let <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> miſcarriage in this kind be your looking-glaſſe to ſhew the foule face of this fault, that you may take heed of this deformity. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> purſued them, and the roaring ſeas threatned to devoure them, their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (though wrought on by many miraculous providences) was accounted a miſery rather then a mercy, for obſerve their language, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.11. <hi>wherefore haſt thou dealt thus with us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. By this miſtake we reach a wrong to others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.15. <hi>If I ſay I will speake thus, behold I ſhould offend againſt the generation of thy children.</hi> Our carriage in this particular may caſt ſad diſcouragements upon the hearts

of many deare to God, cauſing them to queſtion their ſpirituall ſtate, becauſe of outward ſtraights. Hereby alſo we ſeeme to ſuſpect their wiſdome who uphold their hopes, and maintaine their comforts, notwithſtanding their manifold heavy afflictions.</p>
            <p>Cenſure not others to be rejected or abhorred by the Lord, becauſe you meet with them in the Mount,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Admonition.</note> you ſee them in ſtraights, in extremities. Beloved, the words of the Pſalmiſt are conſiderable.<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.1, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the poore, the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble, the Lord will ſtrengthen him upon the bed of languiſhing, thou wilt make all his bed in his ſickneſſe.</hi> As you deſire favourable dealing from God in the time of your perſonall calamity, learne to judge wiſely and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably of them who are in extremity. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> did cenſure <hi>Paul</hi> to be a man under ſome black note of infamy, faſtened upon him by the Lord, becauſe of his ſuddaine and unexpected danger. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.4. <hi>And when the</hi> Barbarians <hi>ſaw the venemous beaſt hang on his hand, they ſaid among themſelves, no doubt this man is a murderer.</hi> Marke their confidence as well as their uncharitableneſſe, no doubt he is a murderer: And why no doubt? <hi>becauſe though he hath eſcaped the ſea, yet vengeance ſuffereth him not to live,</hi> for a venemous viper, a death threatning crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture now did hang upon his hand. Beloved when we looke upon men arreſted by credit-killing accuſations, and purſued with death-threatning charges, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to hide themſelves from the bloody hands of violence, let us take heed of adding to their ſorrow by our cenſures. That practice which was well beſeeming <hi>Barbarians,</hi> will be very uncomely for us Chriſtians. Two things conſider to keep you from this fault, which I will propound without much enlargement.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The ſinfullneſſe of this cenſoriouſneſſe.</item>
               <item>2. The dangerouſneſſe of this cenſoriouſneſſe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The ſinfullneſſe of it:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Being forbidden by Chriſt, <hi>judge not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7.1.</note> 
               <hi>that you be not judged;</hi> judge not, that is, not raſhly, groundleſly, unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64090:11"/>2. Arguing want of love, for truth and ſtrength of love maketh faire and canded conſtructions of all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances which concerne them whom we love. <hi>Charity doth not behave it ſelfe unſeemly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.5. ver. 7.</note> 
               <hi>is not eaſily provoked, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no evill, beareth all things, beleeveth all things, hopeth all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Weakning love, for affection is enfeebled by our looking upon our brethren through the glaſſe which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them as unlovely, while we think them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſregarded by God, our reſpect to them is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hindering prayer, the Apoſtle knew this, and therfore I pray you conſider by what an argument he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to pray for him,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.18.</note> 
               <hi>pray for us, for we truſt we have a good conſcience in all things, willing to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.</hi> If you be well perſwaded of the afflicted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their pious frame, you will be the more willing to let out your hearts for them in a way of prayer. But when men thus think, the Heavens frown, and God is angry with ſuch an one, and therfore it is a vain thing to beſtow time and breath in prayer for him, this office of Chriſtian love is interrupted. By theſe particulars you may perceive that this cenſoriouſneſſe is very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; ſinfull in the root, and ſinfull in the fruits, ſinfull in the heart, and ſinfull in the life, checking grace, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider the dangerouſneſſe of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God is much incenſed, You remember how <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> and the other of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, loaded him with their heavy cenſures, concluding his hypocriſie from his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. Now when God had done with <hi>Job,</hi> having ſchooled him out of the whirlwind, and had wrought him to his own bent, obſerve what followeth, <hi>The Lord ſaid to</hi> Eliphas <hi>the Tewanite, my wrath is kindled againſt thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 42.7.</note> 
               <hi>and againſt thy two friends, for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my ſervant</hi> Job <hi>hath.</hi> Therefore my beloved if you would not ſuffer under Gods frowns, nor ſmart under the expreſſions of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64090:11"/>
if you would not have the ſparks of Gods wrath to kindle upon you, take heed of cenſuring any of Gods worthies that have bin inſtrumentall for good either in Church or commonwealth, becauſe for the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a black cloud, becauſe expoſed unto any diſgrace or danger, by reaſon of ſome ſad providence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our cenſoriouſneſſe may in our ſuffering times adde much weight to our own heavy preſſures. If I cenſure others, and thereby adde affliction to their bonds, I may expect that God will adde gall to my wormwood, when the bitter cup commeth to my hand, and I muſt per force take down a diſpleaſing and diſtaſtfull draught. <hi>Judge not, that you be not judged, for with what judgement ye judge, ye ſhall be judged, and with what meaſure ye mete,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7.1. ver. 2.</note> 
               <hi>it ſhall be meaſured to you againe.</hi> Theſe meditations made uſe of, may, I hope through Gods mercy, prevent our ſinning againſt God, others and our ſelves, by uncharitable cenſures caſt upon our diſtreſſed brethren.</p>
            <p>It concerneth all of us to prepare for a journey into the Mount, to make ready for tryalls by extremities.<note place="margin">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Exhortation.</note> Beloved, this day the Heavens are black over our heads, and our feares are not few, for ought we know God will have us into the Mount, my meaning is, it may be the Lord will thruſt us into ſuch extremities, as we never yet met with in all our lives.</p>
            <p>There are two things that I will plainly ſpeake to in the enlarging of this uſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What may quicken us to prepare for ſtraights.</item>
               <item>2. What courſe muſt be taken that we may be prepared for ſuch a condition.</item>
            </list>
            <p>To perſwade our preparation, conſider two motive.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That we are all expoſed unto perplexities.</item>
               <item>2. That we are all ſubject to manifold miſcarriages in ſuch a ſtate.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. We are all ſubject to a diſtreſſed condition, let him that denieth it bring forth his ſuperſedias, and ſay here, I have that from Heaven ſigned and fealed, which doth ſecure me I ſhall never come into adverſity. Beloved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve

it, whatſoever afflictions have ſeized upon any of Gods worthies formerly, may overtake you and me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we dye, and we cannot tell how ſpeedily. You have heard what befell <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and why may not the ſame betide <hi>England,</hi> you have heard what befell <hi>Abraham, David, Daniell, Paul,</hi> and why may not we looke for the like.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Subject we are to many miſcarriages when God in his providence bringeth us to extremities: I will only hint this in a word or two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Extremities doe expoſe us unto unbeliefe, A grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſinne it is to ſuffer our ſoules at any time to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from an holy adherence, and firme dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our God, and yet thus we are in danger to diſhonour his highneſſe, and wrong our own ſoules in times of diſtreſſe. <hi>Davids</hi> example doth evidence this fully. What more fayre promiſe can any man imbrace, then that which God made to him particularly, that he ſhould be the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and yet when <hi>David</hi> was in a ſtraight, you heare of his diſtruſt from his own confeſſion, <hi>I was gratly afflicted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 116.10, 21.</note> 
               <hi>I ſaid in my hast all men are lyars, Nathan</hi> a lyar, and all others who told him of ſucceeding <hi>Saul</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were all lyars. And why? becauſe he ſaw not a faire and eaſie paſſage to the crown. The like alſo is recorded concerning him, when wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out with the bloody purſuit of envious <hi>Saul. And David ſaid in his heart, I ſhall periſh now one day by the hand of</hi> Saul.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 27.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In diſtreſſe we are diſpoſed to ſtrange impatiency and diſcontent of ſpirit, which diſtemper doth wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſguiſe our hearts, and diſgrace our profeſſion. It is a wonderfull thing that ever a heart furniſhed with grace,<note place="margin">Jonah 44.</note> ſhould flye out as <hi>Jonah</hi> did.

               <note place="margin">ver. 8.</note> Marke and be warned by his anſwer, <hi>I doe well to be angry even unto death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 9. Job 3.</note> The hiſtory of patient <hi>Job</hi> alſo proves this plentifully.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I might adde, that we are ſubject to ſinfull feares, which diſmay and torment the heart, check duty, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken joy, and interrupt our ſweet communion with God. Take notice of this diſtemper in Gods own people, for which his majeſty chideth them,<note place="margin">Iſa. 51.12. ver. 13.</note> 
               <hi>And who art thou that feareſt a man that ſhall dye, and the ſonne of man that is but as graſſe, and for getteſt the Lord thy maker, that hath ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth the Heavens, and layed the foundations of the earth, and haſt feared continually every day,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Apt we are to uſe ſinfull ſhiſts betaking our ſelves to unworthy practices to ſafeguard our ſelves in times of extremitie. Obſerve this in <hi>Peters</hi> practice,<note place="margin">Mat. 26, 70. ver. 72.</note> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is apprehended, violently carried away, likely to ſuffer death as a grievous malefactor. Now he ſeeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſurrounded with them that oppoſe Chriſt,<note place="margin">ver. 74.</note> and this diſtreſſe drove him upon a dangerous rock, a three-fold denyall of his deareſt Maſter: Let this move you and me, to prepare that we may not in like manner miſſe it, if God ſhall be pleaſed thus to prove us.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I beleeve doe affect your hearts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in probability you will deſire direction. Attend therefore and I will give you ſome counſell briefly: There are ſix things which I ſhall commend to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and practice.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You muſt labour to make ſure your propriety in God: When <hi>David</hi> upon ſervice had bin abroad,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.2.</note> 
               <hi>Ziglack</hi> the place where he left his wife and children was burnt,<note place="margin">ver. 3.</note> when he commeth home, there was no houſe to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him, no wife to welcome him, no children to be a comfort unto him, they all were carried captive, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he with the reſt,<note place="margin">ver. 4. ver. 5. ver. 6.</note> 
               <hi>wept till they could weepe no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But</hi> David <hi>incouraged himſelfe in the Lord his God.</hi> Heede here the ground of his ſupport and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, not the Lord God, but the Lord his God, deity
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64090:13"/>
and propriety hold up his heavy heart, for the good man enjoying God, might thus refreſh his drooping ſpirit. What though I have not an houſe to dwell in? thou art my dwelling place, my habitation, a place of ſweeteſt reſt and ſafeſt refuge. What though I have not a Wife? I have more in God then a yoak-fellow could have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded. What though I have not a Child? there is more then the comfort of a numerous poſterity in the bleſſed Deity. The ſouldiers cannot batter down this caſtle, the pilfering people pillaging, cannot poſſibly ſteale away this treaſure, the troops of robbers, the deſperate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiers cannot deprive of this poſſeſſion: This might be much enlarged both ſeaſonably and profitably, but I muſt not inſiſt upon any thing. But this is my requeſt, that you would without delay endeavour to cleare up your intereſt in the almighty, that your dejected hearts may not abide diſconſolate in the dayes of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Acquaint your ſelves with God, and labour to be familiar with his Majeſty by conſtant and frequent communion through Jeſus Chriſt. Men deſire to know the utmoſt worth of what they have in poſſeſſion, and what improvement may be made thereof if need ſhould ſo require. We reade in the Parable, that he <hi>that had bought a piece of ground,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 14.13.</note> 
               <hi>muſt needs goe to ſee it,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt be excuſed if other things be neglected. If we were thus wiſe for our ſoules, we would ſeek to know, and to improve our God who is our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, yea our all, unto our various advantages in the times of our greateſt need. Seriouſly therefore aske thy ſelfe this queſtion, What have I in having a God? What have I? I have infinite wiſdome to adviſe me in all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, infinite power to carry me through all ſtraights, abundant goodneſſe to ſupply all my wants, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt bowells to commiſerate me in my moſt dolefull condition, yea I have alſufficiency to fill me brim full, and running over unto ſatisfaction. I added converſe with thy God. He that would have comfort from Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64090:13"/>
in time of ſickneſſe, gaineth and maintaineth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with them in time of health. If you and I ſhall dare to keep at a diſtance from God in a way of eſtrangement from his Majeſty in ſummer dayes, and in ſun-ſhine ſeaſons, when the Heavens are cleere, and the City is peaceable, and the Parliament promiſing, and our hopes flouriſhing, we ſhall want comfort through communion with God, when the ſunne ſetteth, winter approacheth, Parliament breaketh, and miſery threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth on every ſide. Being in haſt I ſhall here lay heads confuſedly on heapes, whereas I ſhould diſtinctly have diſcovered three things.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, Walke exactly. Take heed of making brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upon your conſciences, by willing and willfull ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt the God of your comforts. Beloved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved you know that thoſe who have had bruiſes and broken bones, they will feele aches in hard weather, and certainly if you will in time of proſperity dare to ſinne againſt conſcience, it will adde ſorrow to your Sops, and gall to your wormwood, when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth upon you in a way of bitter calamity. Sinfull ſenſuall ſurfets upon ſweet morſells, will breed wringing paines, and painfull vomits.<note place="margin">Gen 42.21.</note> The ſonnes of <hi>Jacob</hi> were in a great ſtraight when they were taken for ſpyes as the ſtory reports. What did now wring them? The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſinne, though many yeers ſince committed, ah our brothers blood, our brothers blood; we would not pity him when he made his moane, and now God will be avenged of us. Alas, alas, we were hard-hearted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64090:14"/>
a brother, and therefore no wonder that we meet with harſhneſſe amongſt ſtrangers. Whereas the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a cleere conſcience, ô what a comfort will it be when all ſhall be blackneſſe, and blood about us. See it in <hi>Paul</hi> and his companions. When they made no other account but to dye,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.12.</note> what ſaith <hi>Paul, This was our rejoycing,</hi> (that was ſtrange, rejoyce when the next day they might expect to goe to the ſtake?) well ſaith <hi>Paul our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, we have had our converſation in the world.</hi> Beloved, beleeve it that you cannot lay in a better cordiall, to comfort and to ſtay your hearts in fearfull, fainting, diſtreſſing, dying times, then by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act walking with God before the ſtorme fall. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles experience puts <hi>a probatum eſt</hi> unto this preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For ought we know, the day is at hand wherein we ſhall heare the warre-Horſes neighing, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Cannons roaring, the little Children skreaking, and the fearfull Women skritching: You know not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, how ſoon you may ſee your City flaming, your own houſes burning, your goods waſting. It will be a ſad ſight to behold your Wives barbarouſly abuſed, your Husbands bloudily butchered, and your Children cruelly tormented. I beſeech you, I beſeech you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider now what will yeeld you comfort then. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did daily expect to dye, take notice, unto what he betooke himſelfe for ſolace and ſupport: <hi>Remember now ô Lord I beſeech thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 38.3.</note> 
               <hi>how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> In like manner may we raiſe up our ſinking hearts in ſuch heavy times, if we can truly thus ſpeake unto the ſoule-ſearching Majeſty. Lord while times were peaceable and proſperous, when I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with comforts on every ſide, thou knoweſt I had a heart to walke with thee humbly, to obſerve thy Sabbath holily, to uſe thy worſhips purely, and to aime at the honour of thy name ſincerely. This, this will cheare you both living and dying. You know that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64090:14"/>
the lowd windes, nor the black clouds, nor the great ſhowers, nor the flaſhings of lightning, nor the hideous claps of thunder, doe ſo much affright us, as an earthquake. But when ſome vapours are got into the hollow places, the bowells of the earth, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world ſhakes, this is terrible, this is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible indeed, though the Sunne ſhine, and no cloud ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the skie. In like manner it is not ſo much an outward affliction as guilt within, guilt within which cauſeth the heart of man to rocke and quake through feare within him. Therfore take heed, ſtop all the paſſages into your ſoules, keep the heart with all diligence, that no knowne guilt be admitted into it, as you deſire a ſtable, firme frame of ſpirit, prepared for the ſtrongeſt ſtormes, the greateſt ſtraights wherewith divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence may poſſibly prove you.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you have made wounds and bruiſes in your conſciences, ſeeke an healing plaiſter by ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſuddainely. A bone broken being well ſet (they ſay) becomes the ſtronger. <hi>David</hi> had gaſhed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience grievouſly, both by uncleanneſſe and murther, in the matter of <hi>Bathſheba</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> Notwithſtanding by means of <hi>Nathans</hi> plaine dealing being wrought to deepe ſorrow, the wound was healed, and the ſame mouth which cured him by a corraſive, gave him this comfort, <hi>God hath forgiven thy ſinne, thou ſhalt not dye.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.13.</note> Now after this, according to the threatning of <hi>Nathan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 11.</note> God raiſed up evill againſt him out of his own houſe, and he was in a wonderfull ſtraight, <hi>Abſolom</hi> was up in armes againſt him. This diſtreſſe occaſioned the third Pſalme, as the title tells, wherein he expreſſeth his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed condition. <hi>Many are they that riſe up against me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 3.1.2.</note> 
               <hi>many there be that ſay of my ſoule there is no helpe for him in God.</hi> Now here is a ſtraight indeed, many imagining, that Heaven could not helpe him: yet if you will by his phraſe of ſpeech, judge the frame of his heart, you ſhall find as much confidence in him now, as ever in all his life: Take notice of it.<note place="margin">ver. 3.</note> 
               <hi>But thou ô Lord art a ſhield for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64090:15"/>
me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 6.</note> 
               <hi>my glory, and the lifter up of my head. I will not be afraid of ten thouſands of people, that have ſet themſelves againſt me round about.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 5.</note> Yea this is added, <hi>I laid me down and ſlept.</hi> Conſider in his ſuppoſition, 1. The number of enemies, <hi>viz. ten thouſand.</hi> 2. The manner of their oppoſition, <hi>though they ſhould riſe up in a warlike manner againſt me.</hi> 3. Their advantage againſt him, and his danger to be apprehended by them. It is not though they come to meete me, or though they make after me, for then by flight he might hope for ſafety, <hi>But though they ſhould beſet me round about,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David</hi> having made his peace with God, though now in a very great diſtreſſe, yea although (remembring Gods threathing) he might reade his ſcandalous ſinnes, in this heavy affliction, yet his confidence, courage and comfort is very remarkeable. If any of your conſciences now wring you upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſuch a ſinne, or ſuch a ſinne, (I name none, but leave it between God and your own hearts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it) goe home repeat, repent and make your peace with God to day, without any further delay, that you may be ſit for a ſtraight if it ſhould come to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Mind and trade your experience. God hath done already as much for <hi>England</hi> as is yet to be done, to ſet all things right and in order againe amongſt us. Not many Moneths ſince, our dayes were as darke, our feares as great, and our enemies as many as now. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember our ſelves, the Lord lives, the Almighty is in Heaven, he ſtill is mindfull of his covenant, and changeth not. The holy Scriptures yeeld us plentifull proofe of improving former experiences, to arme againſt future feares.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.36.</note> That of <hi>David</hi> is notable, <hi>Thy ſervant ſlew both the Lyon and the Beare, and this uncircumciſed Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine ſhall be as one of them.</hi>

               <hi>David</hi> ſaid moreover, <hi>The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the Lyon, and out of the paw of the Beare, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philiſtine.<note place="margin">Pſal. 61.2, 3.</note> When my heart is overwhelmed, leade me to the rock that is higher then I, for thou haſt bin a ſhelter for

               <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Lord ſtood with me and ſtrengthened me, and I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lyon.</hi> Conſider the words, <hi>Paul</hi> was not only in the Lyons denne, not only within the reach of the Lyons chaine, nor only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lyons paw, but in the Lyons mouth. Now his inference is obſerveable,<note place="margin">ver. 18.</note> 
               <hi>And the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evill worke, and will preſerve me unto his heavenly Kingdome.</hi> Againe note,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.9.</note> 
               <hi>We had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves,<note place="margin">ver. 10.</note> but in God which raiſeth the dead. Who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver, in whom we truſt that he will yet deliver us.</hi> Here for your helpe, I will hint one expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſtill freſh in our mindes, God ſetled peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and <hi>Scotland,</hi> when after great preparations for warre, the arymes were ſet in battell array, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet given, the skirmiſh begun, blood drawne, many ſlaine, the two Kingdomes ready to be broken in pieces, the one againſt the other. Conſider what great things God hath done, and trade your experiences for your future profit.</p>
            <p>Sixty, Cleere up your evidences for Heaven, and keep them ſo faire, that in the darkeſt day they may be legible, eaſie to be read without hacking and heſitancy. The uſefullneſſe hereof in evill times appeares in the Apoſtles experience, <hi>For which cauſe we faint not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor 4.16.</note> 
               <hi>but though our outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction that is but for a moment,</hi>

               <hi>we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternall in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> The heire apparent of Heaven, may hold up head and heart, and in this manner expreſſe himſelfe: come the worſt that can come, though my ſtate ſhall decay, my ſoule and body part, my ſelfe and deareſt naturall

               <hi>yet I have in Heaven, a better and more enduring ſubſtance:</hi> more and better friends, ſweeter and more ſatisfying communion. If they take away my traſh, the true treaſure, that is out of their reach. What if they take downe my tottering tabernacle of clay? I ſhall have a glorified, a beautified body to all eternity, in ſpight of hell and earth combining againſt me. What if they drive me out of houſe, and City, and Kingdome, the beſt is, they cannot expell me from my God, nor deprive me of a manſion, an abiding place in the City of God, the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64090:16"/>
ſpeake through want of time to this uſe, yet dare I not altogether be ſilent, conſidering the ſeaſon. Vnder two heads I will briefly aſſiſt your ſinking ſpirits by way of advice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Learne aright to make way for deſired comforts in times of diſtreſſe, that you may have this Texts, and this Sermons incouragement at hand, not only now, but hereafter when you may ſtand in need.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Improve the particulars compriſed in this title <hi>Jehovah,</hi> held forth for our uſe in the Text now handling, I may not now ſpeake under theſe heads, both unto our Nationall and Perſonall concernments diſtinctly. For the former, way is made for our refreſhing in the worſt of times that can poſſibly overtake us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By ſtudying the qualifications to which favour is promiſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By uſing the meanes of our good which by the Lord are preſcribed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Every one may not challenge propriety in the priviledge of the Text. Every looſe-liver may not come out and ſay, well I in the Mount God will be ſeene, and therefore I will feare no colours. No, no, for there is a peculiar gracious diſpoſition to be found upon the hearts of them who may expect that God will appeare in the Mount for them, for their conſolation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Your ſoules muſt be ſo ſeaſoned with Gods feare, that having his command, you will not draw backe from any ſervice put upon your hands, how hard, how heavy ſoever. Marke it in <hi>Abraham, Abraham</hi> now I know thou feareſt me, and how doth his feare diſcover it ſelfe, Vpon divine commiſſion he ſets upon a ſervice, the doing whereof, was againſt heart and haire, repugnant to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without all preſident, againſt the ſtreame of naturall affections, croſſing the conceit and opinion of the world. Can you imagine if <hi>Iſaack</hi> had bin ſlaine, and the fact known, what a hubbub would have bin in the Country? how many mouthes would have bin opened, in reporting <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſtrange and unheard of cruelty? <hi>Iſaak</hi> is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64090:17"/>
killed, and his own father, father <hi>Abraham,</hi> that religious man, he himſelfe hath killed him, how would this have rung in every corner? Doe but thinke what Mother <hi>Sarah</hi> would have ſaid upon her Husbands returne home, Husband where is <hi>Iſaak?</hi> and conjecture with what a ſad heart he might have made this anſwer, Wife I have killed him, and I have burnt him before God as a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Beloved, neither theſe things, nor any other which might be caſt in as diſcouragements, did take him off from duty. The feare of God carried him above all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, both from his naturall affections, his wives frownes, and the worlds clamours. And to this man, thus fearing God, God appeares in the Mount: Minde this I pray you, and labour herein to be like this gracious man, thus devoted to Gods feare.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You muſt, not dare to adventure upon any known ſinne, though it be to ſafeguard your perſons, your eſtates, your places of favour and honour, your any thing, your all things under the Sunne. A man of this make, is one who may expect to meet with the Almighty in the Mount. The proofe of this is faire in the experience of <hi>Daniell.</hi> The decree was ſigned, he muſt not for thirty dayes pray unto his God,<note place="margin">Dan. 6.7.</note> if he did, he muſt be throwne into the Lyons den, well ſaith <hi>Daniell,</hi> let the Lyons make a meale upon my body, I am reſolved I will not forbeare this worſhip due to my God, I will not thus interrupt my communion with my heavenly Father. The like you have in the three young Governours, the King he would have them fall down and worſhip the image he had ſet up.<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> If you will not, you muſt into the furnace.<note place="margin">ver 17. ver 18.</note> Marke their anſwer, <hi>Our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver, but if not, be is knowne unto thee, we will not ſerve thy gods.</hi> And the proofe of the point reported how God appeared in the dayes of their diſtreſſe for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, unto theſe experiments I might adde Promiſes. <hi>If thou take away from the midſt of thee the yoake,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa 58 9. ver. 10.</note> 
               <hi>the putting forth of the ſinger, and speaking vanity, and if thou draw out thy ſoule to the hungry, and ſatisfie the afflicted ſoule.</hi> The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64090:17"/>
is, if you will betake your ſelves to courſes of piety and mercy, contrary to your former wayes of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and violence, <hi>then ſhall your light breake forth in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, and your darkneſſe be as the noone-day.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 11.</note> 
               <hi>And the Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſatisfie thy ſoule in drought, and make fat thy bones, and thou ſhalt be like a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered garden, and like a spring of water, whoſe waters faile not. If iniquity be in thy hand put it farre away,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 11.14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>and let not wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe dwell in thy Tabernacle, for then ſhalt thou lift up thy face without ſpot, yea thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt, and thou ſhalt not feare.</hi> What incouragements ſhould theſe be to perſwade us to reforme our ſelves, and to endeavour the amendment of one another. Therefore goe home now, and thus ſay to God, and to your ſelves ſeriouſly and ſincerely, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved I will leave my cheating, and cozening, my oathes, lying, my hypocriſie and pride, and all my other known ſinnes. Away with theſe and all other diſcovered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations, promiſe God for future times to betake your ſelves unto a better courſe of living, as you deſire the ſweet and ſeaſonable diſcoveries of God, in the time of your greateſt need.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The meanes of your good muſt be uſed, and they are,
<list>
                  <item>1. Civill.</item>
                  <item>2. Sacred.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For Civill meanes, You muſt not ſay we care not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have any more watch in the City, night or day, we will trouble and charge our ſelves no further in this kind. But you muſt hold on in being ſerviceable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, otherwiſe you will tempt God. There is a notable example of <hi>Joab</hi> in this caſe both commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and imitable.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 10.9.</note> 
               <hi>When</hi> Joab <hi>ſaw the front of the battle was againſt him, before and behind, he choſe all the choice men of</hi> Iſraell, <hi>and put them in array againſt the</hi> Syrians,<note place="margin">ver 10.</note> 
               <hi>and the reſt of the people he delivered into the hand of his brother.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 11.</note> 
               <hi>And he ſaid, if the</hi> Aſſyrians <hi>be too ſtrong for me, then thou ſhalt helpe me, but if the children of</hi> Ammon <hi>be too ſtrong for thee then I will come and helpe thee. Now be of good courage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and let us
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64090:18"/>
play the men and fight for God and our country, and the Lord doe that which ſeemeth him good.</hi> Remember we have by ſolemne proteſtation bound our ſelves before God to doe our utmoſt in wayes lawfull for the honour of our King, the liberty of the Proteſtant Religion, for the peace and welfare of the three Kingdomes, and for the priviledges of our Parliament, and keeping within the limits of our callings, to oppoſe Popery, and popiſh innovations. Therefore every man according to the lawes of God and of the land, muſt unweariedly be induſtrious, night and day, for the Kingdomes good, in the uſe of meanes, both defenſive and offenſive, as neceſſity may require.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are meanes ſacred, Teares and Prayers are the Chriſtians beſt weapons, this munition let us make uſe of. <hi>Jeh ſhaphat</hi> ſurrounded with danger, when <hi>Moab, Ammon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 20.3.</note> 
               <hi>and the children of Mount Seir came out againſt him,</hi> what courſe doth he betake himſelfe to? <hi>he feared, and ſet himſelfe to ſeeke the Lord, and proclamed a faſt.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> being in danger to looſe both his Kingdome and his life, by the inſurrection of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> betooke himſelfe to prayer,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.31. Pſal. 3.</note> to breake the neck of <hi>Achitophels</hi> crafty coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and alſo to ſecure himſelfe from the hand of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, now ſtretched forth againſt him. Beloved, as Gods command, and the practiſe of his people, doe guide us unto this imployment, ſo Gods pretious promiſes, and our own glorious experiences, touching the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this ordinance, ſhould perſwade our perſeverance herein in theſe times of feare and danger.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What is the improvement of the originall word here uſed, <hi>In the Mount Jehovah ſhall be ſeene.</hi> This title hath much in it, a great deale more then I may men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus much I have obſerved from holy Scripture, that it both,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Advanceth God.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 68.3.</note>
               <hi>Let the righteous be glad, let them rejoyce before God, yea let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exceedingly rejoyce. Sing unto God, ſing praiſes to his name, extoll him that rideth on the Heavens by his Name</hi> Jah,<note place="margin">ver. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64090:18"/>
rejoyce before him.</hi> Foure things there be hinted in this title <hi>Jehovha,</hi> and they are all uſefull for our preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This title holdeth forth the Lords,
<list>
                  <item>1. Soveraignty.</item>
                  <item>2. Independancy.</item>
                  <item>3. Immutability.</item>
                  <item>4. Fidelity.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſuggeſteth the Lords unlimited Soveraignty, his abſolute and undoubted authority over all things. <hi>Jehovah</hi> he is the <hi>moſt high,</hi> not only high, or higher then many, or more high then the moſt, <hi>but the moſt high over all the earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 83.18.</note> It is <hi>Jehovah</hi> that ruleth Kings, and ordereth Crowns, joy in him, he can rule both the Kings heart and counſell, he governeth in the Country and in the City, at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and here within the walls: Therfore ſtill rejoyce in him, for he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the all-governing Majeſty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It noteth his independancy. All creatures for their continuance, have a kind of dependance upon one another. As the graſſe and plants upon the earth, the bruites upon the fruits of the earth, and our nutriment is from inferior creatures. But our <hi>Jehovah</hi> dependeth upon none, he is of, and from himſelfe, he needeth no ſervant, no ſervice. <hi>In him we all live, move and have our being,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17.28.</note> but his Majeſty is beholding to none, either men or Angels, either for being or wel-being. Thus much God intended to teach by his ſpeech to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and God ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, I am that I am.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 3.14.</note> We think verily that we ſhall be utterly undone if the Parliament breake up, or if our King divide himſelfe from this his body repreſentative. Beloved, my ſoule maketh out to God for the prevention of this ſad fraction. Yet I beſeech you remember this, whatſoever falls out, that whereas all men, and all ordinances, Kings and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments depend on God, yet our God Jehovah is an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Majeſty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It intimateth Gods Immutability, All other things change, As a ſnow ball melteth by our handling it, and the flower withereth by our ſmelling it, ſo theſe ſublunary contentments waſt and ware away by our uſing them.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64090:19"/>
But in the Lord <hi>Johovah there is everlaſting ſtrength,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 26.4.</note> or as the originall languange expreſſeth it, The Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> is a rock of ages, he abideth the ſelfe ſame, ſtrong, unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, unmoveable God throughout all generations.</p>
            <p>Mind this (my beloved) that though <hi>England Ireland</hi>-like ſhould be waſted, although there ſhould be ſad chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Church and Common-wealth, in City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in Towns and Families: Yet ſtill our <hi>Jehovah</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in himſelfe, and unto his people the ſelf-ſame All-ſufficient, All-ſatisfying God. Surely we who pitch our hearts and hopes upon this unchangeable foundation, the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> may abide ſteddy in our ſpirits and comforts in the midſt of the worſt alterations that can overtakes us.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">Exod. 6.3.</note>4. It expreſſeth Gods fidelity. <hi>And I appeared unto</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>unto</hi> Iſaack, <hi>and unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>by the Name of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, but by my Name</hi> Jehovah <hi>was I not known unto them.</hi> The true meaning is,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.13, 16 compared with Exod. 12.41.</note> that whereas God had manifeſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly his power by many glorious providences in former times, now he intended to prove himſelfe mindfull and carefull of his promiſes made unto his people. Now let us make improvement hereof for our comfort. Search divine records, conſider the various pretious promiſes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed by the Almighty unto the covenant of free grace and mercy. Chooſe out of thoſe Goſpell treaſures, ſuch pearles as you put the higheſt prizes upon, Collect thoſe particular promiſes, which you conceive moſt pertinent for your condition, and moſt full your ſatisfaction. And from this ſweet title <hi>Jehovah,</hi> you may comfortably and confidently inferre this concluſions.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever Promiſe is regiſtred in the book of God, either in the old or new Teſtament, that this <hi>Jehovah</hi> will ſet all his attributes on work, for the full and ſeaſonable accompliſhment thereof unto his own people by ſpeciall covenant. Therfore having evidenced your propriety in Goſpell Promiſes through Jeſus Chriſt, from this bottom build your comforts, in the darkeſt and moſt dolefull times. Is is <hi>Jehovah</hi> the all-governing, the independing, the immutable and faithfull God that will be ſeen in the Mount for his ſervants deliverance.</p>
