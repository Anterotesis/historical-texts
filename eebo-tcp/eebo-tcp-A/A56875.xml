            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE Care and Concern which His Majeſty expreſſes in His Letter, for the Welfare and Proſperity of this Kingdom, muſt needs be Satisfying to all of You: And as a further Evidence of it, He had certainly Held this <hi>Seſſion</hi> in Perſon, if His other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Affairs Abroad had not Deprived Us of that Happineſs.</p>
            <p>His Majeſties Acceſſion to the Throne was the moſt Seaſonable and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Deliverance, that ever happened to a Nation; and the Maintaining thoſe Bleſſings He then Procured Us, has ever ſince been the chief Deſign of his Reign.</p>
            <p>You ſee His Majeſty is firmly Reſolved to Preſerve your <hi>Religion, Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> of this Church, as it is Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; and is Deſirous, not only that You fall upon the moſt effe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tual Methods for Preventing the Growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> and Diſcouraging Vice and Immorality: But that you alſo Provide, what may be further needful for the Increaſe of Piety and Learning.</p>
            <p>The King gives You ſuch Convincing Reaſons for New Supplyes, for Maintaining the Troops, that little needs be added to Inforce ſo viſible a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, moſt of His Allayes are Involved in the preſent Commotions, and His and Our Enemies ready to lay hold on every Opportunity: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Majeſty is Confident, that You will Chearefully continue that dutiful Regard You have ever ſhowen to His Service and Your Own Safety.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty is very ſenſible of the Misfortunes and Diſappointments that has happened to Us, in the matter of Trade; and therefore has Inſtructed Me, to Concur in any thing that may Promote and Encourage Trade in this Nation: And I do ſo particularly know His Majeſties good Mind, in this Matter, that I can give You Aſſurance of Obtaining any thing that ſhall be reaſonably Propoſed.</p>
            <p>You have likewiſe now the Opportunity of Making what New Laws may be judged needful, for the better Securing and Settling your Civil Rights, as alſo for the Encouraging of Induſtry and Manufacturies. Relieving the Poor, and Supplving what elſe may be found Wanting: So that His Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done ſo much on his Part, it is not to be Doubted, but that You will do all that's proper on Yours, to bring this Seſſion to a happy Concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <label>My Lords and Gentlemen,</label>
            </p>
            <p>It is His Majeſties Pleaſure, that I ſhould have the Honour to Repreſent His Royal Perſon in this <hi>Seſſion of Pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
