            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have no other uſe for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to this Book, but to
give you a true excuſe for
its Publication. I wrote it for
my ſelf, unreſolved whether any
one ſhould ever ſee it, but at laſt
inclined to leave that to the will of
<pb facs="tcp:59339:5"/>
my Executors, to publiſh or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it when I am dead, as they
ſaw cauſe. But my Perſon being
ſeized on, and my Library, and
all my Goods diſtrained on by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables,
and ſold, and I conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to relinquiſh my Houſe (for
preaching and being in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi>)
I knew not what to do
with multitudes of Manuſcrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
that had long lain by me; having
no Houſe to go to, but a narrow
hired Lodging with ſtrangers:
Wherefore I caſt away whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes;
which I could not carry
away, both Controverſies and
Letters practical, and Caſes of
Conſcience, but having newly lain
<pb facs="tcp:59339:5"/>
divers Weeks, Night and Day,
in waking torments Nephritick,
and Colick, after other long pains
and languor, I took this Book
with me in my removal, for my
own uſe in my further ſickneſs.
Three Weeks after falling into
another extream fit, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
Death, where I had no Friend
with me to commit my Papers to,
meerly leſt it ſhould be loſt, I
thought beſt to give it to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
I think it is ſo much of the
work of all mens lives to prepare
to die with ſafety and comfort,
that the ſame Thoughts may be
needful for others that are ſo for
me: If any miſlike the Title as if
<pb facs="tcp:59339:6"/>
it imported that the Author is
Dead, let him know that I die
daily, and that which quickly
will be, almoſt is: It's ſuited to
my own uſe: They that it is unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to, may paſs it by. If thoſe
mens lives were ſpent in ſerious
preparing Thoughts of Death, who
are now ſtudying to deſtroy each
other, and tear in pieces a diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Land, they would prevent much
dolorous Repentance.</p>

INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PHIL. 1. 23.</bibl>
               <q>For I am in a ſtreight between two, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Write for my ſelf, and therefore ſuppoſing the ſenſe
of the Text, ſhall only obſerve what is uſeful to
my Heart and Practice.</p>
            <p>It was a happy ſtate into which Grace had brought
this Apoſtle, who ſaw ſo much not only tolerable but
greatly deſirable, both in living and dying. To live to
him was Chriſt, that is, Chriſt's intereſt, or work: To
die would be gain, that is, His own intereſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
His ſtreight was not whether it would be good
<pb facs="tcp:59339:11"/>
to live or good to depart: Both were good: But which
was more deſirable was the doubt.</p>
            <p>I. Queſt. <hi>But was there any doubt to be made between
Chriſt's intereſt and his own? Anſ.</hi> No, if it had been a full
and fixed competition: But by Chriſt or Chriſt's intereſt,
he meaneth his work for his Churches intereſt in this
World: But he knew that Chriſt alſo had an intereſt
in his Saints above; and that he could raiſe up more to
ſerve him here: Yet becauſe he was to judge by what
appeared, and he ſaw a defect of ſuch on Earth, this did
turn the Scales in his Choice; and for the work of
of Chriſt and his Churches good, he more inclined to
the delay of his reward, by ſelf-denial: Yet knowing
that the delay would tend to its increaſe. It's uſeful to
me here to note:</p>
            <p>That even in this World, ſhort of Death, there is ſome
good ſo much to be regarded, as may juſtly prevail with
Believers to prefer it before the preſent haſtning of their
reward.</p>
            <p>I the rather note this, that no temptation carry
me into that extream, of taking nothing but Heaven
to be worthy of our minding or regard; and ſo to caſt
off the World in a ſinful ſort, on pretence of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and a heavenly mind and life.</p>
            <p>I. As to the ſenſe, the meaning is not that any thing
on Earth is better than Heaven, or ſimply, and in itſelf
to be preferred before it: The end is better than the
means as ſuch: And perfection better than imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59339:11"/>
But the preſent uſe of the means may be preferred
ſomtimes before the preſent poſſeſſion of the end:
And the uſe of means for a higher end, may
be preferred before the preſent poſſeſſion of a
lower end: And every thing hath its ſeaſon: Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and Sowing, and Building are not ſo good
as Reaping; and Fruit gathering, and Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
But in their ſeaſon they muſt be firſt
done.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what is there ſo deſirable in this
Life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. While it continueth it is the fulfilling of the
will of God who will have us here: And that's beſt
which God willeth.</p>
            <p>II. The life to come dependeth upon this: As the
life of Man in the World, upon his Generation in the
Womb; Or as the reward upon the work; or the
Runners or Souldiers Prize upon his Race or Fighting:
Or as the Merchants gain upon his Voyage. Heaven
is won or loſt on Earth: The poſſeſſion is there, but
the preparation is here: Chriſt will judge all men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their works on Earth: [<hi>Well done good and
faithful Servant,</hi> muſt go before [<hi>Enter thou into the
joy of thy Lord: I have fought a good Fight, I have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
my Courſe</hi>] goeth before <hi>the Crown of Righteouſneſs
which God the righteous Judge will give:</hi> All that ever
muſt be done for Salvation by us, muſt here be donc: It
waron Earth that Chriſt himſelf, wrought the work of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Redemption, fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, became
<pb facs="tcp:59339:12"/>
our Ranſom: And paid the Price of our Salvation: And
it's here that our part is to be done.</p>
            <p>And the beſtowing of the reward of God's work, who
we are ſure will never fail: There is no place for the
leaſt ſuſpicion or fear of his miſdoing or failing in any
of his undertaken work, But the danger and fear is of
our own miſcarrying; leſt we be not found capable of
receiving what God will certainly give to all that are
diſpoſed Receivers. To diſtruſt God is heinous ſin and
folly: But to diſtruſt our ſelves we have great cauſe. So
that if we will make ſure of Heaven, it muſt be by
giving all diligence to make firm our Title, our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and our Election here on Earth. If we fear Hell,
we muſt fear being prepared for it.</p>
            <p>And it is great and difficult work that muſt be here
done: It's here that we muſt be cured of all damning
ſin: That we muſt be Regenerate and new Born; that
we muſt be pardoned and juſtified by Faith; It's here
that we muſt be united to Chriſt, made wiſe to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
renewed by his Spirit, and conformed to his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
It's here that we muſt overcome all the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all the duties toward God and Man, that muſt be
rewarded: It's here that Chriſt muſt be believed in
with the Heart to Righteouſneſs, and with the Mouth
confeſſed to Salvation: It's here that we muſt ſuffer with
him, that we may reign with him, and be faithful to
the Death, that we may receive the Crown of Life.
Here we muſt ſo run that we may obtain.</p>
            <p>III. Yea, we have greater work here to do than
meer ſecuring our own Salvation. We are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:59339:12"/>
of the World and Church, and we muſt labour to do
good to many: We are truſted with our Maſters Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
for his Service; in our places to do our beſt to
propaga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e his Truth, and Grace and Church; and to
bring home Souls, and Honour his cauſe, and edifie
his Flock, and further the Salvation of as many as we
can. All this is to be done on Earth, if we will ſecure
the end of all in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> I. It is then an errour (though it is but few I
think that are guilty of it) to think that all Religion
lieth in minding only the Life to come, and diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things in this preſent life: All true Chriſtians muſt
ſeriouſly mind, both the <hi>End,</hi> and the <hi>Means,</hi> or way:
If they mind not believingly the End, they will never
be faithful in the uſe of means: If they mind not
and uſe not diligently the Means, they will never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the End. None can uſe Earth well that prefer not
Heaven: And none come to Heaven (at Age) that are
not prepared by well uſing Earth. Heaven muſt have
the deepeſt eſteem and habituated love, and deſire, and
joy: But Earth muſt have more of our daily thoughts
for preſent practice. A Man that travelleth to the
moſt deſirable home, hath a habit of deſire to it all the
way: But his preſent buſineſs is his travel: And Horſe
and Company, and Inns, and Waies, and Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> may take up more of his ſenſible Thoughts,
and of his Talk, and Action, than his Home.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> II. I have oft marvelled to find <hi>David</hi> in the
<hi>Pſalms,</hi> and other Saints before Chriſt's coming, to
<pb facs="tcp:59339:13"/>
have expreſſed ſo great a ſenſe of the things of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
life, and to have ſaid ſo little of another. To have
made ſo great a matter of Proſperity, Dominions, and
Victories on one Hand, and of Enemies, Succeſs, and
Perſecution on the other, But I conſider that it was
not for meer Perſonal, Carnal intereſt, but for the
Church of God, and for his Honour, Word, and
Worſhip: And they knew that if things go well with
us on Earth, they will be ſure to go well in Heaven:
If the militant Church proſper in Holineſs, there is no
doubt but it will triumph in Glory: God will be ſure
to do his part in receiving Souls, if they be here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for his receipt. And Satan doth much of his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
work by men: If we eſcape their temptations we
eſcape much of our danger. If Idolaters proſpered, <hi>Iſrael</hi>
was tempted to Idolatry: The <hi>Greek</hi> Church is almoſt
ſwallowed up by <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Proſperity and Dominion.
Moſt follow the powerful and Proſperous ſide. And
therefore for God's cauſe, and for heavenly everlaſting
intereſt, our own ſtate, but much more the Churches
muſt be greatly regarded here on Earth.</p>
            <p>Indeed if earth be deſired only for Earth; and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirity
loved but for the preſent welfare of the Fleſh;
it is the certain Mark of damning carnality, and an
earthly mind. But to deſire Peace and Proſperity, and
Power to be in the hands of wiſe and faithful men, for
the ſake of Souls, and the increaſe of the Church, and
the Honour of God, that his Name may be hallowed,
his Kingdom come, and his Will done on Earth, as
it is in Heaven, this is to be the chief of our Prayers
to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> III. Be not unthankful then, O my Soul, for
<pb facs="tcp:59339:13"/>
the Mercies of this preſent life, for thoſe to thy Body
to thy Friends, to the Land of thy Nativity, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the Church of God.</p>
            <p>I. This Body is ſo nearly united to thee, that it,
muſt needs be a great help or hinderance: Had it been
more afflicted, it might have been a diſcouraging clog;
like a tired Horſe in a Journey, or an ill Tool to a
Workman, or an untuned Inſtrument in Muſick: A ſick
or bad Servant in an Houſe is a great trouble: And a
bad Wife much more. But thy Body is nearer thee
than either, and will be more of thy concern.</p>
            <p>And yet if it had been more Strong and Healthful,
Senſe, and Appetite would have been ſtrong; and
Luſt would have been ſtrong; and therefore danger
would have been greater, and Victory and Salvation
much more difficult. Even weak Senſes and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have too oft prevailed: How knoweſt thou then
what ſtronger might have done: When I ſee a
thirſty Man in a Feaver or Dropſie, and ſpecially
when I ſee ſtrong and healthful youths, bred up
in fulneſs, and among temptations, how mad they
are in ſin, and how violently they are carried to it,
bearing down God's rebukes, and Conſcience, and
Parents, and Friends, and all regard to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
it tells me how great a Mercy I had, even
in a Body not liable to their caſe.</p>
            <p>And many a bodily deliverance, hath been of great
uſe to my Soul, renewing my time and opportunity
and ſtrength for Service, and bringing frequent and
freſh reports of the Love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59339:14"/>
If bodily Mercies were not of great uſe to the Soul,
Chriſt would not ſo much have ſhewed his ſaving love,
by healing all manner of diſeaſes as he did. Nor
would God promiſe us a Reſurrection of the Body, if
a congruous Body did not further the welfare of the
Soul.</p>
            <p>2. And I am obliged to great thankfulneſs to God
for the Mercies of this life which he hath ſhewed to my
Friends; that which furthers their joy, ſhould increaſe
mine: I ought to rejoice with them that rejoice:
Nature and Grace teach us to be glad when our
Friends are well and proſper: Though all in order to
better things than bodily welfare.</p>
            <p>3. And ſuch Mercies of this life to the Land of our
Habitation muſt not be undervalued. The want of
them are parts of God's threatned Curſe; and godlineſs
hath the Promiſe of this life, and of that which is to
come; and ſo is profitable to all things. And when
God ſends on a Land the Plagues of Famine, Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
War, Perſecution, eſpecially a Famine of the
Word of God, it is a great ſin to be inſenſible of it:
If any ſhall ſay, while Heaven is ſure we have no
cauſe to accuſe God, or to caſt away comfort, hope or
duty, they ſay well: But if they ſay, Becauſe Heaven
is all we muſt make light of all that befalleth us on
Earth, They ſay amiſs.</p>
            <p>Good Princes, Magiſtrates and publick Spirited men
that promote the ſafety, Peace and true Proſperity of
the Common-wealth, do thereby very much befriend
<pb facs="tcp:59339:14"/>
Religion, and mens Salvation; and are greatly to be
loved and honoured by all. If the Civil State called
the Common-wealth, do miſcarry or fall into ruine and
calamity, the Church will fare the worſe for it, as the
Soul doth by the ruines of the Body. The <hi>Turkiſh,
Muſcovite,</hi> and ſuch other Empires tell us, how the
Church conſumeth and dwindles away into contempt
or withered Ceremony and Formality, where Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
brings Slavery, Beggary, or long Perſecution on the
Subjects. Doubtleſs divers paſſages in the Revelations
contain the Churches glorifying of God, for their
Power and Proſperity on Earth, when Emperors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Chriſtians: What elſe can be meant well by
<hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 10. [<hi>Hath made us Kings and Prieſts to God,
and we ſhall Reign on the Earth;</hi>] but that <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
ſhall be brought from under Heathen Perſecution, and
have Rule and Sacred Honour in the World, ſome of
them being Princes, ſome honoured Church Guides,
and all a peculiar honoured People. And had not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
found out that curſed way of getting wicked
men that hate true godlineſs and peace, into the Sacred
places of Princes and Paſtors, to do his work againſt
Chriſt as in Chriſt's Name, ſurely no good Chriſtians
would have grudged at the Power of Rulers of State
or Church: Sure I am that many called Fifth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
men, ſeem to make this their great Hope that Rule
ſhall be in the Hands of Righteous men: And I think
moſt Religious Parties would rejoice if thoſe had very
great Power, whom they take to be the beſt and truſtieſt
men: Which ſhews that it is not the greatneſs of Power
in moſt Princes, or ſound Biſhops that they diſlike, but
the badneſs (real or ſuppoſed) of thoſe whoſe Power

Sure the three firſt and great Petitions of the Lord's
Prayer include ſome temporal welfare of the World
and Church, without which the Spiritual rarely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpereth
extenſively (though intenſively in a few it may)
ſince Miracles ceaſed.</p>
            <p>4. Be thankful therefore for all the Churches Mercies
here on Earth: For all the protection of Magiſtracy,
the Plenty of Preachers, the perſervation from Enemies,
the reſtraint of Perſecution, the Concord of Chriſtians,
and increaſe of Godlineſs, which in this Land it hath
had in our Ages, notwithſtanding all Satan's malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
rage, and all the bloody Wars that have interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
our tranquillity. How many <hi>Pſalms</hi> of joyful
thankſgiving be there for <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s deliverances, and the
perſervation of <hi>Zion,</hi> and God's Worſhip in his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Pray for the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> They ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
that love it: ſpecially that the Goſpel is continued,
while ſo many rage againſt it, is a Mercy not to be
made light of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> IV. Be ſpecially thankful, O my Soul, that
God hath made any uſe of thee for the Service of
his Church on Earth. My God, my Soul for this
doth magnifie thee, and my Spirit rejoiceth in the
review of thy great undeſerved Mercy! O what am
I whom thou took'ſt up from the Dunghil, or low ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity,
that I ſhould live my ſelf in the conſtant reliſh
of thy Sweet and Sacred Truth, and with ſuch encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
ſucceſs communicate it to others? That I muſt
ſay now my publick work ſeems ended, that theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
three or Forty four years I have no reaſon to think
that ever I laboured in vain! O with what gratitude
<pb facs="tcp:59339:15"/>
muſt I look upon all places where I lived and laboured,
but above all that place that had my ſtrength. I bleſs
thee for the great numbers gone to Heaven, and for the
continuance of Piety, Humiliation, Concord and
Peace among them.</p>
            <p>And for all that by my Writings have received any
ſaving Light and Grace. O my God, let not my own
Heart be barren while I labour in thy Husbandry, to
bring others unto Holy fruit. Let me not be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Life and Power of that ſaving Truth which
I have done ſo much to communicate to others: O let
not my own Words and Writings condemn me as void
of that Divine and Heavenly Nature, and Life, which I
have ſaid ſo much for to the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> V. Stir up then, O my Soul, thy ſincere deſires
and all thy Faculties, to do the remnant of the work
of Chriſt appointed thee on Earth, and then joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wait for the heavenly Perfection in God's own time.</p>
            <p>Thou canſt truly ſay, <hi>To live to me is Chriſt:</hi> It is
his work for which thou liveſt: Thou haſt no other
buſineſs in the World: But thou doſt his work with
the mixture of many overſights and imperfections, and
too much troubleſt thy Thoughts diſtruſtfully about
God's part, who never faileth: If thy work be done,
be thankful for what is paſt, and that thou art come ſo
near the Port of reſt: If God will add any more to thy
daies, ſerve him with double alacrity, now thou art ſo
near the end: The Prize is almoſt within ſight: Time
is ſwift and ſhort: Thou haſt told others that there is
no working in the Grave, and that it muſt be now or
never: Though the conceit of meriting of commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb facs="tcp:59339:16"/>
Juſtice, be no better than madneſs, dream not that
God will ſave the wicked, no nor equally reward the
ſlothful and the diligent, becauſe Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was perfect. Paternal Juſtice maketh difference
according to that worthineſs which is ſo denominated
by the Law of Grace: And as ſin is its own puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Holineſs and Obedience is much of its own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
Whatever God appointeth thee to do, ſee that
thou do it ſincerely, and with all thy might: If ſin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe
men to be angry becauſe it is detected, diſgraced
and reſiſted, if God be pleaſed, their wrath ſhould be
patiently born, who will ſhortly be far more angry
with themſelves. If ſlander and obloquy ſurvive, ſo
will the better effects on thoſe that are converted: And
there is no compariſon between theſe. I ſhall not be
hurt when I am with Chriſt, by the Calumnies of men on
Earth: But the ſaving benefit will by converted Sinners
be enjoyed everlaſtingly. Words and actions are tranſient
things, and being once paſt are nothing: But the effect of
them on an immortal Soul, may be endleſs. All the
Sermons that I have preached are nothing now: But
the Grace of God on Sanctified Souls is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Eternal life. It is unſpeakable Mercy to be
ſincerely thus employed with ſucceſs; therefore I had
reaſon all this while to be in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtreight, and make
no haſt in my deſires to depart. The Crown will come
in its due time: And Eternity is long enough to enjoy
it, how long ſoever it be delayed: But if I will do that
which muſt obtain it for my ſelf and others, it muſt be
quickly done before my declining ſun be ſet.</p>
            <p>O that I had no worſe cauſes of my unwillingneſs
yet to die, than my deſire to do the work of life for my
own and other mens Salvation? And to finiſh my courſe
<pb facs="tcp:59339:16"/>
with joy, and the Miniſtry committed to me by the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> VI. And as it is on Earth that I muſt do good
to others, ſo it muſt be in a manner ſuited to their ſtate
on Earth. Souls are here cloſely united to Bodies, by
which they muſt receive much good or hurt: Do good
to mens Bodies if thou wouldſt do good to their Souls:
Say not, Things corporeal are worthleſs Trifles, for which
the receivers will be never the better: They are things
that nature is eaſily ſenſible of: And ſenſe is the paſſage
to the mind and will. Doſt not thou find what a help
it is to thy ſelf, to have at any time, any eaſe and al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
of Body: And what a burden and hinderance,
pains, and cares are? Labour then to free others from
ſuch burdens and temptations, and be not regardleſs of
them. If thou muſt rejoice, with them that rejoice,
and mourn with them that mourn, further thy own joy
in furthering theirs; and avoid thy own ſorrows in
avoiding or curing theirs.</p>
            <p>But, alas, what power hath ſelfiſhneſs in moſt? How
eaſily do we bear our Brethrens pains, reproaches, wants
and afflictions, in compariſon of our own: How few
thoughts, and how little coſt or labour do we uſe for
their ſupply, in compariſon of what we do for our
ſelves. Nature indeed teacheth us to be moſt ſenſible
of our own caſe: But Grace tells us that we ſhould
not make ſo great a difference as we do, but ſhould
love our Neighbours as our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> VII. And now, O my Soul, conſider how
mercifully God hath dealt with thee, that thy
ſtreight ſhould be between two conditions ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable?
I ſhall either die ſpeedily, or ſtay yet lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
upon Earth: Which ever it be, it will be
<pb facs="tcp:59339:17"/>
a Merciful and Comfortable ſtate. That it is deſirable to
depart and be with Chriſt, I muſt not doubt, and ſhall
anon more copiouſly conſider. And if my abode on
Earth yet longer be ſo great a Mercy as to be put in the
Ballance againſt my preſent poſſeſſion of Heaven,
ſurely it muſt be a ſtate which obligeth me to great
thankfulneſs to God, and comfortable acknowledgment:
And ſurely it is not my pain, or ſickneſs, my ſuffering<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
from malicious men, that ſhould make this Life on
Earth unacceptable, while God will continue it: <hi>Paul</hi>
had his Prick or Thorn in the Fleſh, the Meſſenger of
Satan to Buffet him, and ſuffered more from men
(though leſs in his Health) than I have done: And yet he
gloried in ſuch Infirmities, and rejoiced in his Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
and was in a ſtreight between living and dying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yea, rather choſe to live yet longer.</p>
            <p>Alas, it is another kind of ſtreight that moſt of the
World are in: The ſtreight of moſt is between the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of Life for fleſhly intereſt, and the fear of Death as
ending their felicity: The ſtreight of many is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a tiring World and Body which maketh them
aweary of living, and the dreadful proſpect of future
danger which makes them afraid of dying: If they live,
it is in miſery; if they muſt die they are afraid of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
miſery: which way ever they Look, behind or
before them, to this World, or the next, fear and
trouble is their Lot; yea, many an upright Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
through the weakneſs of their Truſt in God;
doth live in this perplexed ſtreight; aweary
of living and afraid of dying; between grief and
fear, they are preſt continually: But <hi>Paul</hi>'s
ſtreight was between two Joys; which of them he
ſhould deſire moſt: And if that be my caſe, what
<pb facs="tcp:59339:17"/>
ſhould much interrupt my Peace or Pleaſure. If I
live, it is for Chriſt; for his Work, and for his
Church, for Preparation, for my own and others ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſting
felicity: And ſhould any ſuffering which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
me not unſerviceable, make me impatient with
ſuch a work, and ſuch a life? If I die preſently it is my
gain: God who appointeth me my work, doth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
my time, and ſure his glorious reward can never
be unſeaſonable or come too ſoon, if it be the time
that he appointeth. When I firſt engaged my ſelf
to preach the Goſpel, I reckoned (as probable)
but upon one or two years: And God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
me it above Forty four: (with ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
as others in theſe times have had.) And what
reaſon have I now to be unwilling either to live
or die? God's Service hath been ſo ſweet to me,
that it hath overcome the trouble of conſtant pains
or weakneſs of the Fleſh, and all that men have ſaid or
done againſt me.</p>
            <p>But the following Crown exceeds this pleaſure,
more than I am here capable to conceive. There
is ſome trouble in all this pleaſant work, from which
the Soul and Fleſh would reſt: And bleſſed are the
dead that die in the Lord: Even ſo ſaith the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
for they reſt from their Labours, and their
Works follow them.</p>
            <p>But, O my Soul, what need'ſt thou be troubled
in this kind of ſtreight? It is not left to thee
to chooſe whether or when thou wilt live or die.
It is God that will determine it, who is infinitely
fitter to chooſe than thou: Leave therefore his own
work to himſelf, and mind that which is thine;
<pb facs="tcp:59339:18"/>
whilſt thou liveſt, live to Chriſt, and when thou
dieſt, thou ſhalt die to Chriſt; even into his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Hands; So live, that thou maiſt ſay, It is Chriſt
liveth in me, and the life that I live in the Fleſh,
I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved
me, and gave himſelf for me: And then as thou
haſt lived in the comfort of hope, thou ſhalt die
unto the comfort of Viſion and Fruition: And when
thou canſt ſay, he is the <hi>God whoſe I am, and
whom I ſerve,</hi> thou maiſt boldly add, <hi>and whom I
truſt; and to whom</hi> I commend my departing Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And I know whom I have truſted.</p>

            <p>§ 1. <hi>MAN that is born of a Woman, is of
few daies, and full of trouble; He
cometh forth like a Flower, and is cut
down: He fleeth alſo as a ſhadow,
and continueth not: And doſt thou open thine Eyes upon
ſuch a one, and bringeſt me into Judgment with thee?</hi>
ſaith <hi>Job, ch.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. As a Watch when it is
wound up, or as a Candle newly lighted; ſo Man
newly conceived or born, beginneth a motion, which
inceſſantly haſteth to its appointed period. And an
<hi>Action,</hi> and its <hi>Time,</hi> that is paſt, is <hi>Nothing:</hi> So vain
a thing would Man be, and ſo vain his Life, were it not
for the hopes of a more durable Life, which this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
to. But thoſe <hi>Hopes,</hi> and the <hi>Means,</hi> do not
only difference a <hi>Believer</hi> from an <hi>Infidel,</hi> but a <hi>Man</hi>
from a <hi>Beaſt.</hi> When <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribeth the difference
in reſpect to the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> of this Life only, he
truly tells us, that <hi>one end here</hi> befalling both, doth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59339:19"/>
ſhew that both are here but <hi>Vanity,</hi> but <hi>Man's Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is greater than the Beaſts. And <hi>Paul</hi> truly ſaith of
Chriſtians that <hi>if our hope were only in this life</hi> (that is,
in the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> of this life and world) <hi>we were
of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> Though even in <hi>this life,</hi> as
related to a <hi>better,</hi> and as we are exerciſed about things
of a higher nature, than the concerns of temporal life,
we are far happier than any worldlings.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Being to ſpeak to my ſelf, I ſhall paſs by all
the reſt of the <hi>matter</hi> of this Text, and ſuppoſe its
due Explication, and ſpread before my Soul only the
Doctrine and Uſes of theſe two Propoſitions contained
in it. I. <hi>That the Souls of Believers when departed
hence, ſhall be with Chriſt.</hi> II. <hi>That ſo to be with Chriſt
is far better for them, than to be here in the body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. I. <hi>Concerning the firſt, my Thoughts ſhall keep
this order. I. I ſhall conſider the</hi> Neceſſity of Believing
<hi>it.</hi> II. Whether it be beſt believing it, without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Proofs or Difficulties. III. The certainty of it
manifeſted for the exerciſe of Faith.</p>
            <p>§ 4. I. Whether the words ſignifie that we ſhall be
in the <hi>ſame place with Chriſt</hi> (which <hi>Grotius</hi> groundleſly
denieth) or only in <hi>his Hand,</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> I
will not ſtay to diſpute: Many other Texts concurring
do aſſure us, that <hi>we ſhall be with him where he is, Joh.</hi>
12. 26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24, &amp;c. At leaſt [<hi>with him</hi>] can
mean no leſs than a <hi>ſtate of communion, and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of felicity.</hi> And to believe ſuch a <hi>ſtate of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi>
for <hi>departed Souls,</hi> is of <hi>manifold neceſſity</hi> or uſe.</p>
            <p>§ 5. I. If this be not ſoundly believed, a man muſt
live beſides, or below the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Life:</hi> He muſt have
a <hi>falſe End,</hi> or be <hi>uncertain what ſhould be his End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know, it may be objected, that if I make it my</hi>
End to pleaſe God, by obeying him, and doing all the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59339:19"/>
good I can, and truſt him with my Soul and future
Eſtate, as one that is utterly uncertain what he will do
with me, I have an End intended, which will make me
godly, charitable, and juſt, and happy, ſo far as I am
made for happineſs: <hi>For the</hi> pleaſing of God <hi>is the</hi> right
End <hi>of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, 1. Muſt I deſire to <hi>pleaſe him no better</hi> than I
do in this <hi>imperfect ſtate,</hi> in which I have, and do ſo
much which is <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> to him? He that muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to <hi>pleaſe</hi> him, muſt deſire to <hi>pleaſe him perfectly:</hi>
And our deſires of our <hi>ultimate End</hi> muſt have no
<hi>bounds,</hi> or <hi>check.</hi> Am I capable of <hi>pleaſing God no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
than by ſuch a <hi>ſinful life</hi> as this?</p>
            <p>2. God hath made the deſire of our <hi>own felicity</hi> ſo
neceſſary to the Soul of Man, that it cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that our deſire to <hi>pleaſe him,</hi> ſhould be ſeparated from
this. 3. Therefore both in reſpect of <hi>God</hi> as the
<hi>End,</hi> and of our felicity as our <hi>ſecond End,</hi> we muſt
believe that he is the beatifying <hi>rewarder of them that
diligently ſeek him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, 1. If we make ſuch an ill <hi>deſcription of God,</hi> as
that <hi>he will turn our pleaſing him to our loſs, or will
not turn it to our gain, and welfare,</hi> or that we know
not whether he <hi>will do ſo or not,</hi> it will hinder our <hi>Love,</hi>
and <hi>Truſt,</hi> and <hi>Joy in him,</hi> by which we muſt <hi>pleaſe
him,</hi> and conſequently hinder the alacrity, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and conſtancy of our obedience.</p>
            <p>2. And it will much diſmiſs that <hi>ſelf-love</hi> which muſt
excite us, and it will take off part of our neceſſary End:
And I think the Objecters will confeſs, that if they
have no <hi>certainty</hi> what God will do with them, they
muſt have ſome <hi>Probability</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> before they
can be ſincerely devoted <hi>here to pleaſe him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 6. And 1. If a man be but <hi>uncertain</hi> what he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59339:20"/>
               <hi>ſhould make the End of his Life,</hi> or what he ſhould live
for, how can he pitch upon an <hi>uncertain End?</hi> And
if he waver ſo as to have <hi>no End,</hi> he can uſe no <hi>Means:</hi>
And if <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> be all laid by, the Man liveth
not as a <hi>Man,</hi> but as a <hi>Brute.</hi> And what a torment
muſt it be to a conſidering mind, to be <hi>uncertain</hi> what
to <hi>Intend</hi> and <hi>Do</hi> in all the tenour and actions of his
life? Like a man going out at his door, not knowing
whither, or what to do, or which way to go: Either
he will ſtand ſtill, or move as Brutes do by preſent
ſenſe, or a <hi>Windmill</hi> or <hi>Weathercok,</hi> as he is moved.</p>
            <p>§ 7. 2. But if he pitch upon a <hi>wrong End,</hi> it may
yet be <hi>worſe</hi> than <hi>none;</hi> for he will but <hi>do hurt,</hi> or
make work for Repentance: And all the actions of his
life muſt be <hi>formally wrong,</hi> (how good ſoever <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi>)
if the <hi>End</hi> of them be wrong.</p>
            <p>§ 8. 2. And if I fetch them not from <hi>this End,</hi> and
believe not in God as a <hi>Rewarder</hi> of his Servants, in a
<hi>better Life,</hi> what <hi>Motives</hi> ſhall I have which in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>difficulties,</hi> will be ſufficient to cauſe me to live
a <hi>holy,</hi> yea or a truly <hi>honeſt</hi> life? All piety and honeſty
indeed is good, and Goodneſs is deſirable for it ſelf: But
the goodneſs of a <hi>Means</hi> is its aptitude for the <hi>End;</hi>
and we have here abundance of impediments, compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors,
diverſions and temptations, and difficulties of
many ſorts; and all theſe muſt be overcome by him
that will live in piety or honeſty. And our Natures
(we find) are diſeaſed, and greatly indiſpoſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
duties; and will they ever diſcharge them,
and conquer all theſe difficulties and temptations, if
the neceſſary <hi>Motive</hi> be not believed? Duty to God
and Man is accidentally <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>coſtly</hi> to the fleſh,
though amiable in it ſelf: It may coſt us our <hi>Eſtates,</hi>
our <hi>Liberties,</hi> our <hi>Lives.</hi> The world is not ſo happy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59339:20"/>
as commonly to know good men from bad, nor to
encourage Piety and Virtue, or to forbear oppoſing
them. And who will let go his preſent welfare, without
ſome hope of better as a reward? Men uſe not to
ſerve God for nought; nor that think it will be their
<hi>loſs</hi> to ſerve him.</p>
            <p>§ 9. A <hi>life of ſin</hi> will not be avoided upon <hi>lower
Ends and Motives:</hi> Nay, thoſe <hi>lower Ends</hi> when
<hi>alone,</hi> will be a conſtant <hi>ſin themſelves:</hi> A preferring
Vanity to Glory, the Creature to God, and a ſetting
our heart on that which will never make us happy:
And when luſt and appetite incline men ſtrongly and
conſtantly to their ſeveral objects, what ſhall ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſtrain them, except the greater and more durable
delights or motives fetcht from preponderating things?
Luſt and Appetite diſtinguiſh not between lawful and
unlawful. We may ſee in the brutiſh Politicks of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus
Spinoſa,</hi> in his <hi>Tractat. Theolog. Polit.</hi> whither
the Principles of <hi>Infidelity</hi> tend. If ſin ſo overſpread
the Earth, that the <hi>whole world</hi> is as <hi>drowned in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,</hi>
notwithſtanding all the <hi>hopes and fears of a life
to come,</hi> what would it do were there <hi>no ſuch hopes and
fears?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 10. 3. And no <hi>Mercy</hi> can be truly <hi>known</hi> and
<hi>eſtimated,</hi> nor <hi>rightly uſed</hi> and improved by him that
<hi>ſeeth</hi> not its <hi>tendency</hi> to the <hi>End,</hi> and perceiveth not
that it leadeth to a <hi>better Life,</hi> and uſeth it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
God dealeth more bountifully with us than
worldlings underſtand: He giveth us all the mercies
of this life, as <hi>helps</hi> to an immortal ſtate of Glory, and
as <hi>earneſts</hi> of it. Senſualiſts know not what a Soul is,
nor what Soul-mercies are, and therefore not what the
<hi>Soul of all bodily mercies</hi> are; but take up only with
the <hi>carkaſs, ſhell,</hi> or <hi>ſhadow.</hi> If the King would give
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59339:21"/>
me a Lordſhip, and ſend me a <hi>Horſe</hi> or <hi>Coach</hi> to carry
me to it, and I ſhould only ride about the fields for my
pleaſure, and make no other uſe of it, ſhould I not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
and loſe the principal benefit of my Horſe or
Coach? No wonder if unbelievers be unthankful, when
they know not at all that part of God's mercies, which
is the <hi>life,</hi> and real excellency of them.</p>
            <p>§ 11. 4. And alas! how ſhould I bear with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of this wretched life, without the
hopes of a life with Chriſt? What ſhould ſupport and
comfort me under my bodily languiſhings and pains?
my weary hours, and my daily experience of the <hi>Vanity</hi>
and <hi>Vexation</hi> of all things under the Sun, had I not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of a comfortable end of all? I that have lived in
the midſt of <hi>great</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> mercies, have all my life
had ſomething to do, to overcome the temptation of
<hi>wiſhing that I had never been born,</hi> and had never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it, but by the <hi>belief</hi> of a <hi>bleſſed Life</hi> hereafter.
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſenſe of <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation,</hi> hath long made
all the buſineſs, and wealth, and honour, and pleaſure
of this world (as ſuch) appear ſuch a dream and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
to me, that were it not for the <hi>End,</hi> I could not
have much differenced men's <hi>ſleeping</hi> and their <hi>waking
thoughts,</hi> nor have much more valued the <hi>waking</hi>
than the <hi>ſleeping</hi> part of life, but ſhould have thought it
a kind of happineſs to have ſlept from the birth unto
the death. Children cry when they come into the
world; and I am often ſorry when I am wakened out
of a <hi>quiet ſleep,</hi> eſpecially to the buſineſs of an unquiet
day. We ſhould be ſtrongly tempted in our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
ſtate, to murmure at our Creator, as dealing
much hardlier by us than by the Brutes; if we muſt
have had all thoſe cares, and griefs, and fears, by the
knowledge of what we want, and the proſpect of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59339:21"/>
death, and future evils, which they are exempted from,
and had not withal had the hopes of a future felicity
to ſupport us. <hi>Seneca</hi> and his Stoicks had no better
Argument to ſilence ſuch murmurers who believed not
a better life, than to tell them, that if this life had more
evil than good, and they thought God did them
wrong, they might remedy themſelves by ending it
when they would: But that would not cure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinings
of a Nature, who found it ſelf neceſſarily
<hi>aweary</hi> of the <hi>miſeries</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> and yet <hi>afraid of dying.</hi>
And it is no great wonder that many thought that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent
Souls were put into theſe bodies as a puniſhment
of ſomething done in a former life, while they foreſaw
not the hoped End of all our fears and ſorrows. <hi>O how
contemptible a thing is man!</hi> ſaith the ſame <hi>Seneca, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he lift up himſelf above humane things? Therefore,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 17. (when he had glutted
himſelf with all temporal pleaſures) <hi>I hated life, becauſe
the work that is wrought under the Sun, is grievous to
me: For all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 12. II. I have often thought whether an <hi>Implicit
belief of a future happineſs, without any ſearch into its
nature, and thinking of any thing that can be ſaid againſt
it,</hi> or the <hi>ſearching, trying way</hi> be better. On the one
ſide, I have known many godly women that never
diſputed the matter, but ſerved God <hi>comfortably</hi> to a
very old Age, (between 80 and 100) to have lived
many years in a <hi>chearful readineſs</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> of death,
and ſuch as few Learned, ſtudious men do never attain
to in that degree; who, no doubt, had this as a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Reward</hi> of their long and faithful ſervice of God,
and truſting in him. On the other ſide, a ſtudious man
can hardly keep off all Objections, or ſecure his mind
againſt the ſuggeſtions of difficulties and doubts; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59339:22"/>
if they come in, they muſt be anſwered; ſeeing we give
them half a victory, if we caſt them off before we can
anſwer them. And a Faith that is not upheld by ſuch
evidence of Truth, as Reaſon can diſcern and juſtifie,
is oft joyned with much ſecret doubting, which men
dare not open, but do not therefore overcome: And
its weakneſs may have a weakening deficiency, as to all
the graces and duties which ſhould be ſtrengthened by
it. And who knoweth how ſoon a temptation from
Satan, or Infidels, or our own dark hearts, may aſſault
us, which will not, without ſuch evidence and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Light be overcome? And yet many that <hi>try,</hi> and
<hi>reaſon,</hi> and diſpute moſt, have not the ſtrongeſt, or moſt
powerful Faith.</p>
            <p>§ 13. And my thoughts of this have had this iſſue.
1. There is a great difference between that Light
which ſheweth us the <hi>Thing it ſelf,</hi> and that artificial
skill by which we have right <hi>Notions, Names, Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and formed Arguments, and Anſwers to Objections.
This <hi>Artificial, Logical, Organical kind of Knowledge</hi>
is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> in its kind, if right; like <hi>Speech</hi> it ſelf:
But he that hath <hi>much</hi> of <hi>this,</hi> may have
<hi>little</hi> of the <hi>former:</hi>

that have <hi>little of this,</hi> may have <hi>more</hi> of
the <hi>former,</hi> and may have thoſe inward
<hi>perceptions</hi> of the verity of the Promiſes &amp;
Rewards of God, which they cannot bring

or others; who are taught of God
by the effective ſort of Teaching, which

effective Teaching of God, when he hath got all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical
Knowledge, and Words and Arguments in
themſelves moſt apt, at his fingers ends (as we ſay?)
When I can prove the Truth of the Word of God,
and the Life to come, with the moſt convincing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Reaſons, I feel need to cry and pray daily
to God, to increaſe my Faith, and to give me that
Light which may ſatisfie the Soul, and reach the end.</p>
            <p>§ 14. 2. Yet man being a <hi>Rational wight,</hi> is not
taught by <hi>meer Inſtinct</hi> and <hi>Inſpiration:</hi> And therefore
this <hi>Effective Teaching</hi> of God doth ordinarily ſuppoſe
a <hi>Rational, Objective, Organical Teaching</hi> and <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
And the foreſaid unlearned Chriſtians are convinced
by good evidence, that <hi>God's Word is true,</hi> and <hi>his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
are ſure,</hi> though they have but a confuſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of this evidence, and cannot <hi>word</hi> it, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it to fit notions. And to drive theſe that have
<hi>fundamental evidence,</hi> unſeaſonably and haſtily to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute</hi>
their Faith, and ſo to puzzle them by <hi>words</hi> and
<hi>artificial</hi> Objections, is but to hurt them, by ſetting
the <hi>Artificial Organical lower part</hi> (which is the <hi>body</hi>
of Knowledge) againſt the <hi>real Light</hi> and <hi>Perception</hi> of
the <hi>Thing</hi> (which is as the <hi>Soul</hi>) even as carnal men
ſet the Creatures againſt God, that ſhould lead us to
God; ſo do they by <hi>Logical Artificial Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 15. But they that are <hi>prepared</hi> for ſuch Diſputes,
and <hi>furniſhed</hi> with all <hi>artificial</hi> helps, may make good
uſe of them for defending and clearing up the Truth
to themſelves and others; ſo be it they uſe them as a
<hi>means</hi> to the <hi>due end,</hi> and in a <hi>right manner,</hi> and ſet
them not up againſt, or inſtead of the real and effective
Light.</p>
            <p>§ 16. But the <hi>Revealed</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary</hi> part muſt

§ 18. I. The Soul which is an <hi>Immortal Spirit,</hi>
muſt be immortally in a Good or Bad condition: But
<hi>Man's Soul is an Immortal Spirit,</hi> and the good are not
in a bad condition: Its Immortality is proved thus: <hi rend="margQuotes">A
ſpiritual, or moſt pure inviſible ſubſtance naturally
endowed with the Power, Virtue, or Faculty of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal-Action,
Intellection and Volition, which is not
annihilated, nor deſtroyed by ſeparation of Parts, nor

Soul of Man, as ſhall be manifeſt by parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 19. I. The Soul is a <hi>ſubſtance:</hi> For that which is

and it is <hi>within us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 20. As to them that ſay, It is the <hi>Temperament of
ſeveral parts conjunct,</hi> I have elſewhere fully confuted
them, and proved, 1. That it is ſome <hi>one part</hi> that is
the <hi>Agent</hi> on the reſt, which all they confeſs that
think it to be the material ſpirits, or fiery part: It is
not bones and fleſh that underſtand, but a purer ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
as all acknowledge. 2. What part ſoever it
be, it can do no more than it is <hi>Able</hi> to do: And a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of many parts, of which <hi>no one</hi> hath the power
of <hi>Vitality, Intellection,</hi> or <hi>Volition, formally</hi> or <hi>eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
(ſomewhat as excellent) can never by contempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
do thoſe acts: For there can be no more in the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
than is in the <hi>cauſe;</hi> otherwiſe it were no <hi>effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vanity of their Objections, that tell us, a Lute,
a Watch, a Book, perform that by cooperation, which
no one part can do, I have elſewhere manifeſted.
1. Many ſtrings indeed have many motions, and ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59339:24"/>
have many effects on the Ear and Phantaſie, which in
us are <hi>ſound,</hi> and <hi>harmony:</hi> But all is but a percuſſion
of the Air by the ſtrings, and were not that motion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by a ſenſitive Soul, it would be <hi>no Muſick</hi> or
<hi>Melody;</hi> ſo that there is nothing done but what <hi>each
part</hi> had <hi>power</hi> to do. But <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Volition</hi>
are not the <hi>conjunct motions of all parts of the body,</hi>
receiving their form in a <hi>nobler Intellective nature,</hi> as
the ſound of the ſtrings maketh melody in man: If it
<hi>were ſo,</hi> that <hi>Receptive Nature</hi> ſtill would be as <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>
as the <hi>Effect</hi> importeth. 2. And the Watch or
Clock doth but move according to the action of the
<hi>ſpring</hi> or <hi>poiſe;</hi> but that it moveth in ſuch an <hi>order</hi> as
becometh to man a <hi>ſign</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> this is
from <hi>Man</hi> who ordereth it to that uſe. But there is
nothing in the <hi>motion,</hi> but what the parts have their
power to cauſe: And that it <hi>ſignifieth</hi> the hour of the
daies to us, is <hi>no Action,</hi> but an <hi>object</hi> uſed by a <hi>rational
Soul</hi> as it can uſe the ſhadow of a Tree or Houſe, that
yet doth nothing. 3. And ſo a Book doth nothing at
all, but is a meer objective ordination of <hi>paſſive ſigns,</hi>
by which Man's active Intellect can underſtand what
the Writer or Orderer did intend; ſo that here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
done beyond the power of the Agent, nor any
thing in the effect which was not in the cauſe, either
formally or eminently. But for a company of Atoms, of
which no one hath <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>reaſon,</hi> to become ſenſitive
and rational by meer conjunct motion, is an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffect
beyond the power of the ſuppoſed cauſe.</p>
            <p>§ 21. But as ſome think ſo baſely of our nobleſt
Acts, as to think that contempered agitated Atoms can
perform them, that have no natural intellective or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
virtue or power in themſelves, ſo others think ſo
<hi>highly</hi> of them, as to take them to be the <hi>Acts</hi> only of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59339:24"/>
               <hi>God</hi> (or ſome <hi>univerſal Soul</hi>) in the body of Man; and
ſo that there is <hi>no Life, Senſe or Reaſon</hi> in the World,
but <hi>God himſelf</hi> (or ſuch an <hi>univerſal Soul;</hi>) And ſo
that either every man is <hi>God,</hi> (as to his Soul) or that it
is the <hi>Body</hi> only that is to be called <hi>Man</hi> as diſtinct
from God. But this is the <hi>Self-enſnaring</hi> and <hi>ſelf-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing</hi>
temerity of buſie, bold and arrogant heads, that
know not their own capacity and meaſure. And on
the like reaſons they muſt at laſt come (with others) to
ſay, that all <hi>paſſive matter</hi> alſo is <hi>God,</hi> and that God is
the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> conſiſting of an <hi>Active Soul,</hi> and <hi>Paſſive
Body.</hi> As if God were <hi>no cauſe,</hi> and could <hi>make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
or nothing with <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Senſe,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 22. <hi>But why depart we from things</hi> certain, <hi>by
ſuch preſumptions as theſe? Is it not</hi> certain, <hi>that there
are</hi> baſer creatures <hi>in the World, than</hi> Men <hi>or</hi> Angels? <hi>Is
it not certain that</hi> one Man <hi>is not</hi> another? <hi>Is it not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that ſome men are in</hi> torment <hi>of body and mind?
And will it be a comfort to a man in ſuch torment to
tell him, that he is</hi> God? <hi>or that he is part of an</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Soul? <hi>Would not a man on the</hi> Rack, <hi>or in the</hi>

hath ſome parts which are Serpents, Toads, Devils, or
wicked or tormented men, you muſt give me other ſenſes,

I be one of them hereafter? And if I be a holy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

            <p>§ 24. II. As Man's Soul is a SUBSTANCE, ſo is
it a Subſtance differenced <hi>formally</hi> from all <hi>inferiour
Subſtances,</hi> by an <hi>Innate</hi> (indeed <hi>Eſſential</hi>) <hi>Power, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
or <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Vital-Action, Intellection,</hi> and <hi>Free-will:</hi>
For we find all theſe <hi>Acts</hi> performed by it, as <hi>Motion,
Light</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi> are by the Fire or Sun. And if any
ſhould think that theſe Actions are like thoſe of a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,</hi>
compounded of the <hi>Agents</hi> (principal and orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
ſeveral) parts, could he prove it, no more would
follow, but that the lower powers (the <hi>Senſitive</hi> or
<hi>Spirits</hi>) are to the <hi>higher</hi> as a <hi>Paſſive Organ,</hi> receiving
its <hi>operations;</hi> and that the <hi>Intellectual Soul</hi> hath the
<hi>power of cauſing Intellection and Volition</hi> by its Action

of his <hi>Lute,</hi> as ſhall be <hi>melody</hi> (not to <hi>it,</hi> but) to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi>
And conſequently, that as <hi>Muſick</hi> is but a <hi>lower</hi>
operation of man (whoſe proper acts of <hi>Intellection</hi> and
<hi>Volition</hi> are <hi>above</hi> it) ſo <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Volition</hi> in the
<hi>Body</hi> are not the <hi>nobleſt Acts</hi> of the Soul, but it perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them by an <hi>Eminent Power,</hi> which can do greater
things. And if this could be proved, what would it

our hopes and comforts?</p>

§ 25. III. That man's Soul at death is not <hi>anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilated;</hi>
even the Atomiſts and Epicurians will grant,
who think that no Atom in the Univerſe is annihilated:
And we that ſee not only the Sun and Heavens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,

are changed by diſſolution of parts, and rarefaction, or
migration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not by <hi>Annihilation,</hi> have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

            <p>§ 26. IV. And a deſtruction by the <hi>diſſolution</hi> of

thing to be <hi>feared,</hi> that it ſhould <hi>fall into pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And he that will ſay, that the God of <hi>Nature</hi>
will change, and overcome the Nature that he hath
made, muſt give us good proofs of it, or it is not to
be feared. And if he ſhould do it as a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59339:26"/>
muſt find ſuch a puniſhment ſomewhere threatened,
either in his <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>Supernatural Law,</hi> which we
do not; and therefore need not fear it.</p>
            <p>§ 27. 3. But if it were to be feared, that Souls were
partible, and would be broken into parts, this would
be no <hi>deſtruction</hi> of them, either as to their <hi>ſubſtance,
powers, form</hi> or <hi>action,</hi> but only a breaking of one
<hi>Soul</hi> into <hi>many:</hi> For being not compounded of Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal
parts, but as <hi>ſimple Elements</hi> of <hi>Homogeneal</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as every <hi>Atom</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> is <hi>Earth,</hi> and every <hi>drop</hi> of
<hi>Water</hi> in the Sea is <hi>Water,</hi> and every <hi>particle</hi> of <hi>Air</hi>
and <hi>Fire,</hi> is <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> and have all the properties
of <hi>Earth, Water, Air</hi> and <hi>Fire;</hi> ſo would it be with
every particle of an <hi>Intellectual Spirit.</hi> But who can ſee
cauſe to dream of ſuch a <hi>partition,</hi> never threatened by
God?</p>
            <p>§ 28. V. And that Souls loſe not their <hi>formal
Powers or Virtues,</hi> we have great reaſon to conceive;
becauſe they are their <hi>Natural Eſſence,</hi> not as <hi>mixt,</hi> but
<hi>ſimple ſubſtances:</hi> And though ſome imagine that the
<hi>Paſſive Elements may be attenuation,</hi> or <hi>incraſſation,</hi> be
<hi>tranſmuted</hi> one into another, yet we ſee that Earth is
ſtill Earth, and Water is Water, and Air is Air; and
their conceit hath no proof: And, were it proved, it
would but prove that none of theſe are a <hi>firſt</hi> or proper
<hi>Element:</hi> But what ſhould an <hi>Intellectual Spirit</hi> be
<hi>changed</hi> into? How ſhould it loſe its <hi>formal Power?</hi>
not by <hi>Nature;</hi> for its <hi>Nature</hi> hath nothing that tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to deterioration, or decay, or ſelf-deſtruction?
The Sun doth not decay by its wonderful Motion,
Light and Heat: And why ſhould Spirits? Not by
God's <hi>deſtroying</hi> them, or <hi>changing their Nature:</hi> For,
though all things are in conſtant motion or revolution,
he continueth the Natures of the <hi>ſimple</hi> Beings, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59339:26"/>
ſheweth us, that he delighteth in a conſtancy of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
inſomuch that hence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought the
world Eternal. And God hath made no <hi>Law that
threateneth</hi> to do it as a penalty. Therefore to dream that
<hi>Intellectual</hi> Spirits ſhall be turned into <hi>other things</hi> and
loſe their <hi>Eſſential formal Powers,</hi> which <hi>ſpecify</hi> them, is
without and againſt all ſober reaſon. Let them firſt but
prove that the Sun loſeth Motion, Light and Heat, and
is turned into Air, or Water or Earth. Such changes are
beyond a rational fear.</p>
            <p>§ 29. VI. But ſome men dream that Souls ſhall
<hi>ſleep,</hi> and <hi>ceaſe their Acts,</hi> though they doe not their
<hi>powers.</hi> But this is <hi>more unreaſonable</hi> than the former.
For it muſt be remembred that it is not a meer <hi>obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Paſſive power</hi> that we ſpeak of; but an <hi>Active
Power</hi> conſiſting in a great an <hi>Inclination</hi> to <hi>Act,</hi> as
<hi>Paſſive</hi> natures have to <hi>forbear action.</hi> So that if ſuch
a nature <hi>Act not,</hi> it muſt be becauſe its <hi>natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is hindred</hi> by a ſtronger; And who ſhall hinder
it?</p>
            <p>1. God would not <hi>continue</hi> an <hi>Active Power, Force</hi>
and <hi>Inclination</hi> in nature, and <hi>forcibly hinder</hi> the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that nature which he <hi>himſelf continueth;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
penally for ſome ſpecial cauſe; Which he never
gave us any notice of by any threatning, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Objects</hi> will not be wanting, for all <hi>the world</hi>
will be ſtill at hand, and <hi>God</hi> above all. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an unreaſonable conceit to think that God will <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi>
an <hi>Active Vital Intellective Volitive Nature, Form,
Power, Force, Inclination,</hi> in a <hi>noble ſubſtance,</hi> which
ſhall <hi>uſe none of theſe</hi> for many hundred or thouſand
years, and ſo <hi>continue them in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, 3. It is rather to be thought that ſome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59339:27"/>
               <hi>Action</hi> is their <hi>conſtant ſtate</hi> without which the ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their <hi>very form,</hi> would be inferred.</p>
            <p>§ 30. But all that can be ſaid with reaſon is that <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
Souls,</hi> and Souls hereafter in <hi>Spiritual Bodies,</hi>
will have <hi>Actions of another mode,</hi> and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from theſe that we now perceive in fleſh. And
be it ſo. They will yet be <hi>radically,</hi> of the ſame
Kind, and they will be <hi>formally</hi> or <hi>eminently</hi> ſuch as we
now call, <hi>Vitality, Intellection and Volition;</hi> And
they will be no <hi>lower</hi> nor leſs excellent if not
far <hi>more;</hi> And then what <hi>the difference will be,
Chriſt knoweth</hi> whom I truſt, and in <hi>ſeaſon I ſhall know.</hi>
But to talk of a <hi>Dead Life,</hi> an <hi>unactive activity,</hi> or
a <hi>Sleeping Soul,</hi> is fitter for a ſleeping than a waking
man.</p>
            <p>§ 31. It's true that <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> or <hi>Hurts</hi> do now hinder
the Souls <hi>Intellectual perceptions</hi> in the body, and in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy</hi>
and <hi>Sleep</hi> they are imperfect. Which proveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that the Acts commonly called <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition,</hi>
have now ſomthing in them alſo of <hi>ſenſation,</hi> and
that <hi>ſenſitive operations</hi> are diverſifyed by the <hi>Organs</hi>
of the ſeveral <hi>ſenſes.</hi> And that <hi>bare Intellection</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition</hi>
without any <hi>ſenſation</hi> is now ſcarce to be <hi>obſerved</hi>
in us, though the Soul may <hi>have</hi> ſuch acts <hi>intrinſecally</hi>
and in its <hi>profundity.</hi> For it is now ſo united to this
body, that it acteth on it as <hi>our form;</hi> And indeed the
<hi>Act,</hi> obſerved by us cannot be denied to be ſuch as
are <hi>ſpecified</hi> or <hi>modified</hi> at leaſt, by the <hi>Agents,</hi> and the
<hi>Recipients,</hi> and <hi>Sub-Agents</hi> parts conjunct. But, 1. As
the Sun would do the ſame thing <hi>ex parte ſui</hi> if <hi>in vacuo</hi>
only it ſent forth its beams, though this were no <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
or <hi>Calefaction,</hi> becauſe there were no <hi>Recipient,</hi>
to be <hi>Illuminated</hi> and <hi>Heated</hi> by it. And <hi>it</hi> would loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by the want of objects; ſo the Soul, had it no <hi>Body</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59339:27"/>
to act on, would have its <hi>profound Immanent Acts</hi> of <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living,
ſelf-perceiving,</hi> and <hi>ſelf loving,</hi> (and all its external
acts on other objects, which need not Organs of ſenſe
for their approximation.) And 2. Its <hi>ſenſitive faculty</hi> is
<hi>it ſelf,</hi> or ſuch as it is <hi>not ſeparated</hi> from, though the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſorts</hi> of ſenſation may be altered with their uſes:
And therefore it may ſtill act on or with the ſenſe:
And if one <hi>way of ſenſation</hi> be hindered, it hath <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
3. And how far this <hi>Lanthorn</hi> of fleſh doth <hi>help</hi> or
<hi>hinder</hi> its operations, we know not yet, but ſhall know
hereafter. <hi>Sondi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s de Orig. Animae</hi> (though an heretical
Writer) hath ſaid much to prove that the Body is a
hinderance, and not a help to the Soul's Intuition. And
if Ratiocination be a compound act yet Intuition may
be done for ever by the Soul alone. 4. But as we are
not to judge what Powers the Soul hath when the Acts
are hindered, but when they are <hi>done;</hi> nor what Souls
were made by God for, by their <hi>ſtate in the Womb</hi> or
<hi>Infancy,</hi> or <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> but by our <hi>ordinary mature</hi> ſtate of
life; ſo we have little reaſon to think that the <hi>ſame

here, will not continue the <hi>ſame Powers</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or as noble uſes hereafter, whether with Organs, or

were not unactive and uſeleſs, we have no reaſon to
think that they will be ſo hereafter, (and that for
ever.)</p>
            <p>§ 32. This <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>hardeſt</hi> of all Objections,
doth make us confeſs (with <hi>Contarenus, contra Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natium
de Anim. Immortalit.</hi>) that though by the <hi>Light
of Nature</hi> we may know the <hi>Immortality of Souls,</hi> (and
that they loſe not their <hi>Powers,</hi> or <hi>Activity</hi>) yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>ſupernatural Light,</hi> we know not <hi>what manner</hi> of
<hi>Action</hi> they will have in their ſeparated ſtate, or in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59339:28"/>
another world, becauſe here they act according to <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
Termination,</hi> and the <hi>Receptivity</hi> of the <hi>Senſe
and Phantaſie, &amp; Recipitur ad modum recipientis;</hi> and
in the <hi>Womb</hi> we perceive not that it acteth <hi>intellectually</hi>
at all.</p>
            <p>But we know, That, 1. If even then it differed
not in its <hi>formal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ower</hi> from the <hi>Souls of Brutes,</hi> it
would not ſo <hi>much afterward differ</hi> in <hi>Act:</hi> And it
would never be raiſed to that which was not <hi>virtually</hi>
in its Nature at the firſt. 2. And we find, that even
very little Children have quick and ſtrong knowledge
of ſuch Objects as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e brought within their reach:
And that their Ignorance is not for want of an <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Power,</hi> but for want of <hi>Objects,</hi> or <hi>Images</hi> of
things which <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>uſe,</hi> and <hi>converſation</hi> among
Objects, muſt furniſh their Phantaſies and Memories
with. And ſo a <hi>Soul in the Womb,</hi> or in an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi>
hath not <hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>Intellection</hi> within its reach to act
upon; but is as the <hi>Sun</hi> to a Room that hath no <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
to let in its light. 3. And what if its <hi>profound
Vitality, Self perception,</hi> and <hi>Self-love</hi> be by a kind of
<hi>Senſation</hi> and <hi>Intuition,</hi> rather than by <hi>Diſcurſive Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi>
I doubt not but ſome late Philoſophers make
ſnares to themſelves and others, by too much vilifying
<hi>ſenſe and ſenſitive Souls,</hi> as if ſenſe were but ſome <hi>loſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Accident</hi> of <hi>contempered Atoms:</hi> But <hi>Senſation</hi>
(though diverſified by <hi>Organs</hi> and <hi>Uſes,</hi> and ſo far
<hi>mutable</hi>) is the Act of a noble <hi>Spiritual Form</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
And as <hi>Chambre</hi> and ſome others make Brutes a
lower rank of <hi>Rationals,</hi> and Man another higher <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
as having his nobler Reaſon for <hi>higher Ends;</hi> ſo for
Man to be the <hi>nobleſt Order</hi> (here) of <hi>Senſitives,</hi> and to
have an <hi>Intellect</hi> to <hi>Order and Govern Senſations,</hi> and
<hi>connex</hi> them and <hi>improve</hi> them, were a noble work,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59339:28"/>
if we had no higher. And if <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Volition</hi>
were but a higher <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Internal Senſation,</hi> than
<hi>Imagination,</hi> and the <hi>Phantaſie</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> are, it
might yet be a height that ſhould ſet Man <hi>ſpecifically</hi>
above the Brutes. And I am daily more and more
perſuaded, that <hi>Intellectual Souls</hi> are <hi>eſſentially ſenſitive</hi>
and <hi>more,</hi> and that their <hi>Senſation</hi> never ceaſeth. 4. And
ſtill I ſay, that it is to Nature it ſelf a thing unlikely
that the God of Nature will long continue a Soul that
hath <hi>formally</hi> or <hi>naturally</hi> an <hi>Intellective Power,</hi> in a
ſtate in which it ſhall have <hi>no uſe</hi> of it. Let others that
will enquire whether it ſhall have a <hi>Vehicle</hi> or <hi>none</hi> to
act in, and whether <hi>aereal,</hi> or <hi>igneous,</hi> and <hi>ethereal,</hi> and
whether it be really an <hi>Intellectual ſort</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> as <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
as the <hi>ſolar Fire,</hi> whoſe (not <hi>compounding,</hi> but) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate-conceptus
objectivi</hi> are, an <hi>Igneous ſubſtance,</hi> and
a <hi>Formal Virtue of Life, Senſe,</hi> and <hi>Intellection,</hi> with
other ſuch puzzling doubts; it ſatisfieth me, that God
will not continue its nobleſt Powers in vain; and how
they ſhall be exerciſed, is known to him: And that
God's Word tells us more than Nature. And withal,
LIFE, INTUITION and LOVE (or Volition) are
Acts ſo natural to the Soul (as Motion, Light and
Heat, <hi>quoad actum</hi> to Fire) that I cannot conceive how
its Separation ſhould hinder them, but rather that its
Incorporation hindereth the two latter by hiding Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
whatever be ſaid of abſtractive knowledge and
memory.</p>
            <p>§ 33. VII. But the greateſt difficulty to <hi>Natural
Knowledge</hi> is, <hi>Whether Souls ſhall continue their indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duation,</hi>
or rather <hi>fall into one common Soul,</hi> or <hi>return</hi> ſo
<hi>to</hi> God that <hi>gave them,</hi> as to be <hi>no more divers</hi> (or
many) <hi>individuals</hi> as now; as extinguiſhed Candles are
united to the illuminated Air, or to the Sun beams. But of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59339:29"/>
this I have elſewhere ſaid much for others; and for my
ſelf I find I need but this: 1. That as I ſaid before,
either Souls are <hi>partible ſubſtances, or not:</hi> If not <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</hi>
how are they <hi>unible?</hi> If <hi>Many</hi> may be <hi>made
One</hi> by <hi>conjunction</hi> of <hi>ſubſtances,</hi> then <hi>that One</hi> may (by
God) be <hi>made Many</hi> again by <hi>partition.</hi> Either <hi>All</hi>
(or <hi>Many</hi>) Souls are <hi>now but One</hi> (individuate only by
<hi>Matter,</hi> as many gulfs in the Sea, or many Candles
lighted by the Sun) or <hi>not:</hi> If they are not <hi>One now</hi> in
ſeveral bodies, what reaſon have we to think that they
will be <hi>One hereafter,</hi> any more than <hi>now? Auguſtine
(de Anim.)</hi> was put on the queſtion, 1. Whether
Souls are <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>not Many:</hi> (and that he utterly
denieth.) 2. Whether they are <hi>Many,</hi> and not <hi>One;</hi>
(and that it ſeemeth he could not digeſt.) 3. Whether
they were at <hi>once</hi> both <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Many</hi> (which he
thought would ſeem to ſome ridiculous, but he ſeemeth
moſt to incline to:) And as God is the God of <hi>Nature,</hi>
ſo <hi>Nature</hi> (even of the <hi>Devils</hi> themſelves) dependeth
on him, as I ſaid, more than the Leaves or Fruit do on
the Tree: And we are <hi>all his Off-ſpring,</hi> and <hi>Live, and
Move, and Are in Him, Acts</hi> 17. But we are certain
for all this, 1. That we are <hi>not God;</hi> 2. That we
are yet <hi>many Individuals,</hi> and not <hi>all One Soul</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi>
I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our Union ſhould be as near as the <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi>
on the <hi>ſame Tree,</hi> yet thoſe <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi> are <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>
and <hi>individual Leaves and Fruits,</hi> though parts of
the Tree. And were this proved of our preſent, or
our future ſtate, it would not alter our <hi>Hopes</hi> or <hi>Fears:</hi>
For as Now, though we all <hi>Live, Move, and Be in
God,</hi> (and, as ſome dream, are parts of a <hi>common Soul</hi>)
yet it is certain that ſome are <hi>Better</hi> and <hi>Happier</hi> than
others; ſome wiſe and good, and ſome fooliſh and evil;
ſome in pain and miſery, and ſome at eaſe and in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59339:29"/>
and (as I ſaid) it is now no eaſe to the miſerable
to be told that radically all Souls are <hi>One;</hi> no more
will it be hereafter, nor can men reaſonably hope for,
or fear ſuch an <hi>Union,</hi> as ſhall make their ſtate the
ſame. We ſee in Nature (as I have elſewhere ſaid)
that if you graff many ſorts of Sciens (ſome ſweet, ſome
bitter, ſome Crabs) on the ſame Stock, they will be
<hi>One Tree,</hi> and yet have diverſity of fruit. If Souls be
not <hi>Unible,</hi> nor <hi>Partible</hi> ſubſtances, there is no place
for this doubt: If they be, they will <hi>be</hi> ſtill what they
are, notwithſtanding any ſuch Union with a common
Soul. As a drop of Water in the Sea is a ſeparable part,
and ſtill it ſelf; and as a Crab upon the foreſaid Stock
or Tree. And the good or bad quality ceaſeth not
by any Union with others.</p>
            <p>Sure we are, that <hi>all Creatures are in God,</hi> by cloſe
dependance, and yet that the <hi>good</hi> are <hi>good,</hi> and the
<hi>bad</hi> are <hi>bad,</hi> and that <hi>God is Good, and hath no Evil;</hi>
and that when <hi>Man</hi> is tormented or miſerable, God
ſuffereth nothing by it (as the <hi>whole Man</hi> doth when
but a <hi>Tooth</hi> doth ake.) (For he would not hurt himſelf
were he paſſive.) Therefore to dream of any ſuch ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of our <hi>Individuation</hi> by any Union with a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as ſhall make the <hi>Good</hi> leſs <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>happy,</hi> or the
<hi>Bad</hi> leſs <hi>Bad</hi> or <hi>miſerable,</hi> is a groundleſs folly.</p>
            <p>§ 34. Yet it is very probable that there will be a
<hi>Nearer Union</hi> of holy Souls with <hi>God and Chriſt, and
one another,</hi> than we can here conceive of: But this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
ſo far from being to be <hi>feared,</hi> that it is the <hi>higheſt</hi> of
our <hi>hopes.</hi> 1. God himſelf (though <hi>equally every
where</hi> in his <hi>Eſſence</hi>) doth <hi>operate</hi> very variouſly on his
<hi>Creatures.</hi> On the wicked he operateth as the firſt
<hi>Cauſe of Nature</hi> (as his Sun ſhineth on them:) On
ſome he operateth by <hi>common Grace:</hi> To ſome he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59339:30"/>
giveth <hi>Faith</hi> to prepare them for the Indwelling of
his <hi>Spirit:</hi> In <hi>Believers</hi> he <hi>dwelleth</hi> by <hi>Love,</hi> and
they in him: And if we may uſe ſuch a compariſon
as Satan acteth on ſome only by <hi>ſuggeſtions,</hi> but on
others ſo deſpotically as that it's called <hi>His Poſſeſſing
them;</hi> ſo God's Spirit worketh on holy Souls ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and conſtantly, as is called his <hi>Poſſeſſing them.</hi>
And yet on the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Divine
Nature of the Second Perſon hath ſuch a <hi>further extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Operation,</hi> as is juſtly called a <hi>Perſonal Union;</hi>
which is not by a more <hi>Eſſential Preſence</hi> (for that is
every where) but by a <hi>peculiar operation</hi> and <hi>relation:</hi>
And ſo holy Souls being under a more <hi>felicitating ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

that in our <hi>better ſtate,</hi> we ſhall <hi>perfectly Love others as
our ſelves,</hi> and the <hi>ſelfiſh Love</hi> will turn into a <hi>common</hi>
and a <hi>Divine Love,</hi> which muſt be by our <hi>preferring</hi> the
<hi>common</hi> and the <hi>Divine Good,</hi> and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>§ 37. And I am ſo ſenſible of the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>Plague</hi>
of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> and how it now <hi>corrupteth, tempteth</hi> and
<hi>diſquieteth</hi> me, that when I feel any <hi>fears</hi> leſt <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duation
ceaſe,</hi> and my Soul fall into one <hi>common Soul</hi> (as
the Stoicks thought all Souls did at death) I find great
cauſe to ſuſpect that this ariſeth from the power of <hi>this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
ſelfiſhneſs:</hi> For <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſeeth no cauſe at all to fear
it were it ſo.</p>
            <p>§ 38. 4. For I find alſo that the <hi>nature of Love</hi> is
to deſire as <hi>near a Union</hi> as is <hi>poſſible;</hi> And the <hi>ſtrongeſt
Love</hi> doth ſtronglieſt deſire it. <hi>Fervent Lovers</hi> think
they can ſcarce be too much <hi>One.</hi> And Love is our
Perfection, and therefore ſo is <hi>Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 39. 5. And I find that when Chriſtians had the firſt
and full pourings out of the Spirit they had the <hi>ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Love,</hi> and the <hi>neareſt Union,</hi> and the leaſt deſire of
<hi>propriety</hi> and <hi>diſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 40. 6. And I find that Chriſts prayer for the
felicity of his diſciples is a prayer for <hi>their Unity, Joh.</hi>
17. 22, 23. And in this he placeth much of their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 41. 7. And I find alſo that man is a <hi>ſociable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and that all men find by experience that <hi>conjunction</hi>
in <hi>ſocieties,</hi> is needful to their <hi>Safety, ſtrength</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 42. 8. And I find that <hi>my Soul</hi> would fain be <hi>nearer
God,</hi> and that <hi>darkneſs</hi> and <hi>diſtance</hi> is my miſery and <hi>near
communion</hi> is it that would anſwer all the tendencies
of my Soul: Why then ſhould I <hi>fear too near a Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 43. I think it <hi>utterly improbable,</hi> that my Soul
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59339:31"/>
ſhould become <hi>more nearly united to any creature,</hi> than
to <hi>God:</hi> (though it be of the <hi>ſame kind</hi> with <hi>other
Souls,</hi> and infinitely <hi>below God</hi>): For God is as <hi>near
me</hi> as I am to my ſelf: I ſtill depend on him as the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
upon its <hi>total conſtant cauſe;</hi> And that not as the
<hi>fruit</hi> upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> which borroweth all from the
<hi>Earth, Water, Air, and Fire</hi> which it communicateth to
its fruit; but as a <hi>creature</hi> on its <hi>Creator,</hi> who hath no
<hi>Being</hi> but what it receiveth <hi>totally from God,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>communication.</hi> Hence <hi>Autonine, Seneca,</hi> and the
reſt of the Stoicks thought that all the <hi>World was God,</hi>
or one <hi>Great Animal</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Divine Spirit and
Matter,</hi> as Man of <hi>Soul and body;</hi> Sometime calling
the ſuppoſed <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> GOD, and ſometime
calling the <hi>whole World, God;</hi> But ſtill meaning that
the <hi>Univerſe</hi> was but <hi>one Spirit and Body</hi> united and that
we all are parts of <hi>God,</hi> or of the <hi>Body of God,</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi>
at leaſt.</p>
            <p>§ 44. And even the Popiſh <hi>Myſtical Divines</hi> in their
pretenſions to the <hi>higheſt Perfection</hi> ſay the ſame in
ſenſe; ſuch as <hi>Benedict. Anglus</hi> in his <hi>Regula Perfectionis,</hi>
(approved by many Doctors,) who placeth much of his
<hi>Supereminent Life,</hi> in our <hi>Believing verily</hi> that <hi>there is
nothing but God,</hi> and <hi>Living accordingly;</hi> Maintaining
that all creatures are <hi>nothing diſtinct from God,</hi> but are
<hi>to God,</hi> as the <hi>Beams</hi> are to <hi>the Sun,</hi> and as the <hi>Heat</hi> is
to the <hi>Fire,</hi> (which really is it ſelf;) And ſo teaching
us to reſt in all <hi>things as Good,</hi> as being <hi>nothing but Gods
eſſential will,</hi> which is <hi>himſelf</hi> (reſolving even our
<hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>Imperfections,</hi> accordingly into God, ſo that they
are <hi>Gods</hi> or <hi>None.</hi>)</p>
            <p>§ 45. And all theſe men have as fair a pretence for
their conceits of ſuch a <hi>Union with God</hi> now, as for ſuch
an <hi>Union after death:</hi> For their Reaſon is, 1. That God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59339:31"/>
being <hi>Infinite,</hi> there can be no <hi>more Beings</hi> than <hi>his own</hi>
But God and the ſmalleſt <hi>Being</hi> diſtinct, would be <hi>more
Entity</hi> than <hi>God alone:</hi> But <hi>Infinity</hi> can have <hi>no additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
2. Becauſe <hi>Ens &amp; Bonum Convertuntur;</hi> But God
only is <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we are notwithſtanding all this, diſtinct <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
from God now, we ſhall be ſo then. For we ſhall
not be <hi>Annihilated,</hi> and we ſhall not be ſo advanced
as to be deified, and of creatures or diſtinct Beings, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a Being infinitely above us. If we be <hi>not Parts
of God now,</hi> we ſhall not be <hi>ſo then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if they could prove that we are ſo now, we
ſhould quickly prove to them, 1. That then God hath
<hi>material diviſible parts</hi> (as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> thought.) 2. And
that <hi>we</hi> are <hi>no ſuch parts,</hi> as are <hi>not diſtinct from one
another;</hi> but ſome are <hi>tormented,</hi> and ſome <hi>happy.</hi> And
3. That (as is ſaid) it will be no <hi>abatement</hi> of the
<hi>miſery</hi> of the <hi>tormented,</hi> nor of the felicity of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
to tell them that they are all parts of God: For,
though the <hi>manner</hi> of our Union with him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on him, be paſt our <hi>comprehenſion,</hi> yet that
we are <hi>diſtinct</hi> and <hi>diſtant</hi> from <hi>each other,</hi> and have
each one a <hi>joy or miſery of his own,</hi> is paſt all doubt.
Therefore there is no <hi>Union with God</hi> to be <hi>feared</hi> by
<hi>holy Souls,</hi> but the <hi>utmoſt poſſible</hi> to be <hi>highlieſt deſired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 46. And if our <hi>Union with God</hi> ſhall not ceaſe
our <hi>Individuation,</hi> or reſolve us into a <hi>Principle</hi> to be
feared, we may ſay ſo alſo of our Union with any <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Soul,</hi> or <hi>many:</hi> If we be <hi>Unible,</hi> we are <hi>Partible,</hi>
and ſo have a <hi>diſtinct,</hi> though not a <hi>divided</hi> ſubſtance,
which will have its <hi>proper Accidents.</hi> All <hi>Plants</hi> are
<hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Earth, really united</hi> to it, and <hi>radicated</hi> in
it, and <hi>live,</hi> and are nouriſhed by it: And yet a <hi>Vine</hi>
is a <hi>Vine,</hi> and an <hi>Apple</hi> is an <hi>Apple,</hi> and a <hi>Roſe</hi> is a <hi>Roſe,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59339:32"/>
and a <hi>Nettle</hi> is a <hi>Nettle.</hi> And few men would be
<hi>toiled Horſes</hi> or <hi>Toads,</hi> if it were proved that they are
animated by a <hi>common Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 47. But God letteth us ſee, that though the
<hi>World</hi> be <hi>One,</hi> yet he delighteth in a <hi>wonderful diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi>
and <hi>multiplicity</hi> of Individuals. How various and
numerous are they in the Sea, and on the Land, and in
the Air? And are there <hi>none</hi> in the <hi>other World?</hi> How
come the Stars therein to be ſo numerous, which are
of the ſame Element? And though perhaps <hi>Saturn,</hi> or
ſome other Planets, or many Stars, may ſend forth
their radiant <hi>Effluvia,</hi> or parts, into the ſame Air, which
the Sun Beams ſeem totally to fill and illuminate, yet
the Rays of the Sun, and of other Stars, are not the
ſame, how near ſoever in the ſame Air.</p>
            <p>§ 48. Were there now no more <hi>Contraction</hi> by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goity</hi>
or <hi>Propriety</hi> among men, nor <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine</hi> did
ſignify no more, nor the diſtance were greater than that
of the ſeveral drops of Water in the Sea, or particles of
of Light in the illuminated Air, but I had all my part
in ſuch a <hi>perfect unity</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with all others,
and knew that all were as happy as I, ſo that there were
no diviſions by croſs intereſts or minds, but all were
<hi>One,</hi> certainly it would make my own comforts greater
by far than they are now? Are not an hundred Candles
ſet together and united as ſplendid a flame as if they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be.</p>
            <p>§ 49. <hi>Object.</hi> But it is only the fomes <hi>that</hi> indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duateth
Lights; As when the ſame Sun by a burning
Glaſs lighteth a thouſand Candles, they are individuate
only by the matter contracting, being ſtill all united parts
of the ſame Sun Beams. And when they are extinct, they
are nothing, or all one again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59339:32"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> They were before they were extinct, both <hi>One</hi>
and <hi>many,</hi> none but fools think that <hi>extinction annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth</hi>
them, or any part of them: They are <hi>after,</hi> as <hi>much
Subſtance</hi> and as much <hi>ſolar Fire</hi> though <hi>diffuſed,</hi> and as
<hi>much</hi> and <hi>no more one</hi> than before, but not indeed <hi>Many</hi>
as <hi>before,</hi> but <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>one.</hi> Nature hath made the <hi>equal
diffuſed Sun Beams</hi> to be to the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>ſurface</hi> of the
Earth, as the <hi>blood equally moving</hi> in the <hi>Body:</hi> And
our <hi>Candles</hi> and <hi>Fires</hi> ſeem to be like the ſame blood
contracted in a <hi>bile</hi> or <hi>Inflammation,</hi> which indeed is
<hi>more felt</hi> than the <hi>equally diffuſed blood,</hi> but it is as the
<hi>pain</hi> of a <hi>diſeaſe.</hi> And ſo <hi>when</hi> our <hi>Fires</hi> go out they are
but like a <hi>healed Scattered Inflammation,</hi> &amp; the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is more <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>equally</hi> diffuſed. And if the
<hi>Individuation</hi> of Souls were only by <hi>Corporeal matter</hi> and
the <hi>Union</hi> thus as <hi>great</hi> at their <hi>departure,</hi> it would not
<hi>diminiſh,</hi> if it did not <hi>too much increaſe</hi> their <hi>perfection</hi>
and <hi>felicity:</hi> For there would be no <hi>diminution</hi> of any
<hi>Subſtance,</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Activity,</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>§ 50. And this would confute their fond Opinion,
who think that ſeparated Souls ſleep in <hi>nudâ potentiâ,</hi>
for want of an organized body to operate in: For, no
doubt but if all <hi>holy Souls were One,</hi> this <hi>World,</hi> either
in <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> hath a <hi>common Body, enough</hi> for
ſuch a <hi>Soul to operate in.</hi> Even thoſe <hi>Stoicks</hi> that think
departed <hi>Souls are One,</hi> do think that that <hi>One Soul</hi>
hath a <hi>nobler operation than ours,</hi> in our <hi>narrow Bodies,</hi>
and that when <hi>our Souls ceaſe animating this Body,</hi> they
have the <hi>nobler</hi> and <hi>ſweeter work</hi> in part, of <hi>animating
the whole World:</hi> And thoſe that thought <hi>ſeveral Orbs</hi>
had their <hi>ſeveral Souls,</hi> of which the particular wights
participated, ſaid the like of ſeparated Souls, as anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the bodies of their <hi>Globes</hi> or <hi>Orbs.</hi> And though
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59339:33"/>
all theſe men trouble their heads with their own vain
imaginations, yet this much the Nature of the <hi>Matter</hi>
tells us, which is conſiderable, that whereas the utmoſt
fear of the Infidel, is, that <hi>Souls departed loſe their Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduation</hi>
or <hi>Activity,</hi> and are reſolved into one <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Soul,</hi> or continue in a <hi>ſleepy Potentiality,</hi> for want
of a <hi>Body to operate in,</hi> they do but contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſeeing it is a notorious Truth, 1. That if all
<hi>holy Souls</hi> were <hi>One,</hi> no one would be a <hi>Loſer</hi> by the
<hi>Union,</hi> but it would be a <hi>greater Gain</hi> than we muſt
hope for: For a part of <hi>One</hi> is as <hi>much</hi> and as <hi>noble,</hi>
and as <hi>active</hi> a <hi>Subſtance,</hi> as if it were a <hi>ſeparated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi>
(And <hi>Annihilation,</hi> or loſs of <hi>ſpecifique Powers,</hi> is
not to be rationally feared.) 2. And <hi>that one Soul</hi> is
now either <hi>ſelf-ſubſiſting without a Body,</hi> or animateth
a <hi>ſuitable Body</hi> (as ſome Ancients thought the Angels
Stars.) If <hi>that One Soul</hi> can act without a <hi>Body,</hi> ſo may
<hi>Ours,</hi> whether as <hi>parts</hi> of it, or <hi>not:</hi> If <hi>that One Soul
animate a ſuitable Body,</hi> ours were they <hi>united parts</hi>
of it, would have part of that <hi>Employment;</hi> ſo that
hereby they confute themſelves.</p>
            <p>§ 51. <hi>Obj.</hi> But this would equalize the Good and
Bad, or at leaſt thoſe that were good in ſeveral degrees;
And where then were the Reward and Puniſhment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It would not equal them at all, any more than
<hi>diſtinct Perſonality</hi> would do: For, 1. The Souls of
all holy Perſons may be ſo united, as that the Souls of
the wicked ſhall have no part in that Union. Whether
the Souls of the wicked ſhall be united in one ſinful
miſerable Soul, or rather but in one ſinful Society, or be
greatlier <hi>ſeparate diſunited, contrary to each other, and
militant,</hi> as part of their ſin and miſery, is nothing to
this caſe. 2. Yet <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral Union</hi> muſt be
differenced. God is the <hi>Root of Nature</hi> to the <hi>worſt,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59339:33"/>
and however in one ſenſe it is ſaid, that <hi>There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in God but God,</hi> yet it is true, that, <hi>In Him all
Live, and Move, and have their Being.</hi> But yet the
wickeds <hi>Inbeing</hi> in God, doth afford them no <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi>
and <hi>Beatifying</hi> communion with him, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
ſheweth us in this life; which yet holy Souls
have, as being made capable Recipients of it. As I
ſaid, different Plants, Bryars and Cedars, the ſtinking
and the ſweet are implanted parts (or Accidents) of the
ſame <hi>World</hi> or <hi>Earth.</hi> 3. And the <hi>godly</hi> themſelves
may have as <hi>different</hi> a ſhare of happineſs in one <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Soul,</hi> as they have now of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and ſo as <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Rewards</hi> (even as <hi>Roſes,</hi> and <hi>Roſemary,</hi> and
other Herbs differ in the <hi>ſame Garden,</hi> and ſeveral
Fruits in the ſame <hi>Orchard,</hi> or on the <hi>ſame Tree.</hi>) For,
if Souls are <hi>Unible,</hi> and ſo <hi>Partible Subſtances,</hi> they
have neither <hi>more nor leſs of Subſtance or Holineſs</hi> for
their Union; and ſo will each have his proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
As a Tun of Water caſt into the Sea, will there
ſtill be the ſame, and more than a ſpoonful caſt into
it.</p>
            <p>§ 52. <hi>Obj.</hi> But Spirits are not as Bodies extenſive
<hi>and</hi> quantitative, <hi>and</hi> ſo not partible <hi>or</hi> diviſible, <hi>and</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your ſuppoſition is vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. My ſuppoſition is but the objectors: For
if they confeſs that <hi>Spirits</hi> are <hi>Subſtances</hi> (as cannot
with reaſon be denyed; For they that Specify their
operations by <hi>Motion</hi> only yet ſuppoſe a pure proper
ſubſtance to be the <hi>ſubject</hi> or thing <hi>Moved</hi>) then when
they talk of <hi>Many Souls becoming One,</hi> it muſt be by
<hi>conjunction</hi> and <hi>increaſe</hi> of the Subſtance of that <hi>one.</hi>
Or when they ſay that they were <hi>alwaies One,</hi> they
will confeſs withal that they now differ in <hi>number,</hi> as
<hi>individuate</hi> in the <hi>body:</hi> And who will ſay that <hi>Millions</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59339:34"/>
of <hi>Millios</hi> are <hi>no more</hi> than <hi>one</hi> of all thoſe <hi>Millions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Number</hi> is a ſort of <hi>Quantity:</hi> And all Souls in the
world are more than <hi>Cain</hi>'s or <hi>Abel</hi>'s only. One feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not what another feeleth. One knoweth not what
another knoweth. And indeed, though Souls have not
ſuch corporeal extenſion, as paſſive groſs bodily Matter
hath, yet as they are more noble, they have a more
noble ſort of Extenſion, Quantity or Degrees; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to which all Mankind conceive of all the Spiritual
Subſtance of the Univerſe, yea all the Angels, or all the
Souls on Earth, as <hi>being more, and having more Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
than one man's Soul alone. 2. And the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for the moſt part, eſpecially the Greeks (yea and
the Second Council of <hi>Nice</hi>) thought that Spirits crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
had a purer ſort of <hi>Material Being,</hi> which <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
called a <hi>Body;</hi> and doubtleſs all created Spirits
have ſomewhat of <hi>Paſſiveneſs;</hi> for they do <hi>Recipere vel
pati</hi> from the <hi>Divine Influx:</hi> Only God is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſive.
We are moved when we move; and acted
when we act: And it is hard to conceive that (when
<hi>Matter</hi> is commonly called <hi>Paſſive</hi>) that which is <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi>
ſhould have no ſort of <hi>Matter</hi> in a large ſenſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
And if it have any parts diſtinguiſhable, they
are by God <hi>diviſible.</hi> 3. But if the contrary be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that <hi>all Souls</hi> are no more than <hi>One,</hi> and ſo that
there is no place for <hi>uniting</hi> or <hi>partition,</hi> there is no place
then for the Objection of all Souls becoming One;
and of loſing Individuation, unleſs they mean by <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 53. But that God who (as is ſaid) delighteth
both in the Union, and yet in the wonderful <hi>multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi>
of Creatures, and will not make all Stars to be only
One; though <hi>Fire</hi> have a moſt uniting or aggregative
inclination, hath further given experimental notice that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59339:34"/>
there is <hi>Individuation</hi> in the other world as well as <hi>here,</hi>
even <hi>innumerable Angels and Devils,</hi> and not <hi>one only,</hi>
as Apparitions and Witches, and many other evidences
prove, of which more anon. So that all things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there is no reaſon to fear that Souls ſhall loſe their
Individuation or Activity (though they change their
manner of action) any more than their Being or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Power: And ſo it is naturally certain that they
are Immortal.</p>
            <p>§ 54. And if <hi>Holy Souls</hi> are ſo far Immortal, I need
not prove that they will be <hi>Immortally Happy:</hi> For
their <hi>Holineſs</hi> will infer it; And few will ever dream that
it ſhall there go ill with them that are good, and that the
moſt juſt and holy God will not uſe thoſe well whom he
maketh holy.</p>
            <p>§ 1. II. That holy Souls ſhall be hereafter happy ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be one of the common notices of Nature planted in
the conſciences of mankind; And it is therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by the generality of the world that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſe their underſtandings. Moſt, yea almoſt all the
Heathen Nations at this day believe it, beſides the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans;
And it is the moſt barbarous Cannibals
and Braſilians that do not, whoſe underſtandings have
had the leaſt improvement, and who have rather an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate
Neſcience of it, than a denying oppoſition.
And though ſome Philoſophers denyed it, they were a
ſmall and contemned party: And though many of the
reſt were ſomewhat dubious, it was only a <hi>certainty</hi>
which they profeſſed to want, and not a probability or
opinion that it was true. And both the Vulgar and the
deep ſtudyed men believed it, and thoſe that queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it were the half ſtudyed Philoſophers, who not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59339:35"/>
reſting in the Natural notice, nor yet reaching full
intellectual Evidence of it by diſcourſe, had found
out matter of difficulty to puzzle them, and came
not to that degree of wiſdom as would have reſolved
them.</p>
            <p>§ 2. And even among Apoſtates from Chriſtianity
moſt or many ſtill acknowledge the <hi>Souls Immortality,</hi>
and the <hi>Felicity</hi> and <hi>Reward</hi> of <hi>holy Souls,</hi> to be of the
<hi>common Notices,</hi> known by nature to mankind: <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
was ſo much perſwaded of it, that on that account
he exhorteth his Prieſts and Subjects to great ſtrictneſs
and holineſs of life, and to ſee that the Chriſtians did
not exceed them. And among us the Lord <hi>Herbert
de Veritate,</hi> and many others that ſeem not to believe
our ſupernatural Revelations of Chriſtianity, do fully
acknowledge it. Beſides thoſe Philoſophers who moſt
oppoſed Chriſtianity, as <hi>Porphyrius, Maximus Tyrius,</hi>
and ſuch others.</p>
            <p>§ 3. And we find that this notice hath ſo deep
a root in Nature, that few of thoſe that ſtudy
and labour themſelves into Beſtiality (or Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiſm)
are able to excuſs the <hi>fears</hi> of future miſery
but Conſcience overcometh or troubleth them much
at leaſt, when they have done the worſt they can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it. And whence ſhould all this be in man and
not in Beaſts, if man had no further reaſon of hopes and
fears then they? Are a few Sadduces wiſer by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
or crude conceits, than all the World that are taught
by Nature itſelf.</p>
            <p>§ 1. III. If the God of Nature have made it every
mans certain <hi>duty</hi> to make it his Chief care and work in
this life, to ſeek for happineſs hereafter, then ſuch a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59339:35"/>
there is for them that truly ſeek it. But the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
is certain, as I have elſewhere proved. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. As to the antecedent, The world is made up of
three ſorts of men, as to the belief of future retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
1. Such as take it for a certain Truth (ſuch are
Chriſtians; Mahometans, and moſt Heathens.) 2. Such
as take it for <hi>Uncertain,</hi> but moſt <hi>probable</hi> or <hi>likelieſt</hi> to
be true. 3. Such as take it for <hi>Uncertain,</hi> but rather
think it <hi>Untrue.</hi> (For as none can be <hi>certain</hi> that it is falſe
(which indeed is true) ſo I never yet met with one that
<hi>would ſay</hi> he <hi>was certain it was falſe.</hi>) So that I need
not trouble you with the mention of any other party
or opinion. But if any ſhould ſay ſo; it is eaſy to
prove that he ſpeaketh falſly of himſelf.</p>
            <p>§ 3. And that it is the Duty of <hi>all theſe,</hi> but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the two former ſorts, to make it their Chief
care and work to ſeek for happineſs in the life to come, is
eaſily proved thus: Natural reaſon requireth every man
to ſeek that which is <hi>Beſt</hi> for himſelf with the greateſt
diligence: But Natural reaſon ſaith that a <hi>Probability</hi> or
<hi>Poſſibility</hi> of the future everlaſting happineſs is better
and more worthy to be ſought, than any thing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
in this preſent life (which doth not ſuppoſe it.)
<hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. The Major is paſt doubt. Good and Felicity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neceſſarily deſired by the <hi>will</hi> of man, that which
is <hi>Beſt</hi> and known ſo to be, muſt be <hi>Moſt</hi> deſired.</p>
            <p>And the Minor ſhould be as far paſt doubt, to men
that uſe not their <hi>ſenſe</hi> againſt their reaſon. For 1. In
this life there is nothing <hi>certain</hi> to be continued one
hour. 2. It is certain that all will quickly end; and
that the longeſt life is ſhort. 3. It is certain that <hi>time and
pleaſure paſt</hi> are <hi>nothing, properly nothing;</hi> And ſo no
better to us than if they had never been. 4. And it is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59339:36"/>
certain that while we poſſeſs them, they are poor, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory
things, the pleaſure of the fleſh being no
ſweeter to a man than to a beaſt; And the trouble
that accompanieth it much more. Beaſts have not the
cares, fears and ſorrows upon <hi>foreſight</hi> which man hath:
They fear not death upon foreknowledge of it, nor
fear any miſery after death, nor are put upon any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
ſufferings or Tryals, to obtain a future happineſs,
or avoid a future miſery: All which conſidered, he
ſpeaketh not by reaſon, who ſaith this <hi>vain vexatious</hi>
life is better than the Poſſibility or Probability of the
everlaſting Glory.</p>
            <p>§ 5. Now as to the conſequence (or Major) of
the firſt Argument, it is evident of itſelf, from <hi>Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
and the <hi>Nature</hi> of his works. God maketh it
not mans natural Duty to lay out his chief care and
labour of all his life, on that which is not, or to ſeek
that which man was never made to attain; For then,
1. All his Duty ſhould reſult from meer Deceit and
falſhood, and God ſhould Govern all the World by a
Lie which cannot be his part who wanteth neither
<hi>Power, wiſdom,</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Rule</hi> them by Truth and
righteouſneſs; And who hath Printed his Image both
on his Laws and on his Servants; In which Laws
Lying is condemned; And the better any <hi>man</hi> is, the
more he <hi>hateth</hi> it; And <hi>Lyars</hi> are <hi>loathed</hi> by all
<hi>mankind.</hi> 2. And then the better any man is, and
the more he doth his duty, the more deluded, erroneous
and miſerable ſhould he be. For he ſhould ſpend that
care and labour of his life, upon deceit, for that which
he ſhall never have, and ſo ſhould loſe his time and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
And he ſhould deny his fleſh thoſe temporal
Pleaſures which bad men take, and ſuffer Perſecutions
and injuries from the wicked, and all for nothing, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59339:36"/>
on miſtake: And the wickeder or more unbelieving any
Man is, the <hi>wiſer</hi> and happier ſhould he be, as being in the
right, when he denieth the life to come, and all duty
and labour in ſeeking it, or in avoiding future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and while he taketh his utmoſt pleaſure here, he
hath all that Man was made for. But all this is utterly
unſuitable to God's Perfection, and to his other works:
For he maketh nothing in vain; nor can he Lie: much
leſs will he make Holineſs itſelf, and all that duty and
work of Life which Reaſon itſelf obligeth all men to,
to be not only vain, but hurtful to them. But of this
argument I have been elſewhere larger.</p>
            <p>§ 1. IV. Man differeth ſo much from Bruits in the
Knowledg of God, and of his future poſſibilities, that
it proveth that he differeth as much in his capacity
and certain hopes. 1. As to the Antecedent, Man
knoweth that there is a <hi>God</hi> by his <hi>works:</hi> He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that <hi>this God</hi> is our <hi>abſolute Lord,</hi> our <hi>Ruler,</hi> and <hi>our
End:</hi> He knoweth that naturally we owe him <hi>all our
Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience:</hi> He knoweth that <hi>Good men</hi> uſe
not to let their faithfulleſt Servants be loſers by their
Fidelity; nor do they uſe to ſet them to labour in vain: He
knoweth that Man's Soul is <hi>Immortal,</hi> (or at leaſt that it is
far moſt probable that it is ſo); and therefore that it muſt
accordingly be <hi>well or ill</hi> for ever; and that this ſhould
be moſt cared for. 2. And why ſhould God give him
all this <hi>Knowledge</hi> more than to the Bruits, if he were
made for no more enjoyment than the Bruits, of
what he knoweth: Every wiſe Man maketh his work
fit for the uſe that he intendeth it to: And will not
God? So that the conſequence alſo is proved from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Perfection: And if God were not Perfect, he were
not God: The denial of a God therefore is the reſult of
the denial of Man's future hopes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59339:37"/>
§ 2. And indeed, though it be but an Analogical
Reaſon that Bruits have, thoſe men ſeem to be in the
right, who place the difference between <hi>Man</hi> and
<hi>Bruits,</hi> more in the Objects, tend ency and work of our
Reaſon, than in our Reaſon itſelf as ſuch, and ſo make
<hi>Animal Religioſum</hi> to be more of his deſcription than
<hi>Animal Rationale.</hi> About their own low concerns, a
Fox, a Dog, yea, an Aſs, and a Gooſe have ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as we know not well how to aſcribe to any thing
below ſome kind of Reaſoning, or a perception of the
ſame importance. But they think not <hi>of God,</hi> and his
<hi>Government and Laws,</hi> nor of <hi>obeying, truſting</hi> or <hi>loving
him,</hi> nor of the <hi>hopes</hi> or <hi>fears</hi> of another life, nor of
the <hi>joyful proſpect</hi> of it: Theſe are that work that Man
was made for, which is the chief difference from the
Bruits. And ſhall we unman our ſelves?</p>
            <p>§ 1. V. The <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God as Governour of the
World, inferreth different Rewards hereafter, as I have
largely elſewhere proved. 1. God is not only a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
of all that <hi>Moveth,</hi> but a <hi>Moral Ruler</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> by
<hi>Laws,</hi> and Judgment, and Executions. Elſe there were
no proper Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> which few are ſo unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
as to deny: And Man ſhould have no proper <hi>Duty,</hi>
but only <hi>Motion,</hi> as he is moved: And then how
cometh a Government by Laws to be ſet up under God
by Men? And then there were no ſin or fault in any;
for if there were no Law and Duty, but only neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<hi>Motion,</hi> all would be moved as the Mover pleaſed,
and there could be no ſin: And then there would be no
Moral Good, but forced or neceſſary motion: But all
this is moſt abſurd: And experience telleth us that God
doth <hi>de facto, Morally Govern</hi> the World; and
his <hi>Right is</hi> unqueſtionable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59339:37"/>
§ 2. And if God were not the <hi>Ruler</hi> of the World, by
<hi>Laws and Judgment,</hi> the World would have no <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Laws;</hi> for there is <hi>no Man</hi> that is the <hi>univerſal
Ruler:</hi> And then <hi>Kings,</hi> and other <hi>Supream Powers,</hi>
would be utterly <hi>Lawleſs</hi> and <hi>ungoverned,</hi> as having
none above them to give them Laws, and ſo they would
be capable of no ſin or fault, and of no puniſhment;
which yet neither their Subjects intereſt, nor their own
Conſciences will grant, or allow them throughly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</p>
            <p>§ 3. And if God be a <hi>Ruler,</hi> he is <hi>Juſt:</hi> or elſe he
were not <hi>Perfect,</hi> nor ſo <hi>Good</hi> as he requireth <hi>Princes
and Judges</hi> on Earth to be. An unjuſt <hi>Ruler</hi> or <hi>Judge</hi>
is abominable to all Mankind. <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is the
great Attribute of the <hi>Univerſal King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. But how were he a Righteous Ruler. 1. If he
drew all men to obey him by deceit: 2. If he obliged
them to ſeek and expect a felicity or reward which he
will never give them. 3. If he make Man's duty his
miſery. 4. If he require him to labour in vain. 5. If
he ſuffer the wicked to proſecure his Servants to the
Death, and make duty coſtly, and give no after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.
6. If he let the moſt wicked on the Earth
paſs unpuniſhed, or to ſcape as well hereafter as the
beſt, and to live in greater pleaſure here. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
fetcht from the <hi>intrinſecal good of Duty,</hi> I have
elſewhere anſwered.</p>
            <p>§ 1. VI. But God hath not left us to the Light of
meer Nature, as being too dark for men ſo blind as
we: The Goſpel Revelation is the clear Foundation of
our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hopes.</hi> Chriſt hath brought Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
to Light: One from Heaven that is greater
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59339:38"/>
than an Angel was ſent to tell us what is there,
and which is the way, and to ſecure our hopes. He
hath riſen and conquered death, and entered before
us as our Captain and Forerunner into the Everlaſting
habitations. And he hath all power in Heaven and
Earth, and all Judgment is committed to him; that he
might give Eternal life to his Elect: he hath frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and expreſly promiſed it them, that
they ſhall live becauſe he liveth,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 18.</note> and
ſhall not periſh,<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 22.</note> but have Everlaſting
life.<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 2.</note> And how fully he hath proved

and in my Life of <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp;c. and ſince in my Houſhold
Catechizing, that I will not here repeat it.</p>
            <p>§ 2. And as all his Word is full of promiſes of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Glory at the Reſurrection, ſo we are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
aſſurance that at Death the departing Soul<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. 4. 6. They that died to (or in) the Fleſh according to Men, do live in the Spirit according to God.</note> doth
enter upon a State of Joy and Bleſſedneſs: For, 1.
He expreſly promiſed the penitent crucified Thief,
This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe, <hi>Luk.</hi>
23.</p>
            <p>2. He gave us the Narrative or Parable of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſenſualiſt, and of <hi>Lazarus, Luk.</hi> 16. to inſtruct us,
and not to deceive us.</p>
            <p>3. He tells the <hi>Sadduces</hi> that God is not the God of
the Dead (as his Subjects and Beneficiaries) but of the
Living, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 32.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were taken up to Heaven, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59339:38"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> that died appeared with <hi>Elias</hi> on the Mount
<hi>Mat.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>5. He telleth us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 4. that they that kill the

            <p>6. And Chriſt's own Soul was commended into his
Father's hands, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 46. and was in Paradiſe, when
his Body was in the Grave, to ſhew us what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of ours.</p>
            <p>7. And he hath promiſed that, <hi>Where he is, there
ſhall his Servant be alſo,</hi> Joh. 12. 26. And that the life
here begun in us is Eternal life, and that he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
in him ſhall not die, but ſhall live by him, as
he liveth by the Father; for he dwelleth in God, and
God in him, and in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.
3. &amp; 6. 54. &amp; 3. 16, 36. &amp; 6. 47, 56, 57, 50. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>

            <p>8. And accordingly <hi>Stephen</hi> that ſaw Heaven open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
prayed the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> to receive his Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.
5. 59.</p>
            <p>9. And we are come to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> &amp;c. to an
innumerable Company of Angels, and to the Spirits of
the Juſt made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23.</p>
            <p>10. And <hi>Paul</hi> here deſireth to depart and be with
Chriſt as far better. And to be abſent from the Body,
and be preſent with the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
            <p>11. And the dead that die in the Lord are bleſſed,
from henceforth, that they may reſt from their labours,
and their works follow them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59339:39"/>
12. And if the diſobedient Spirits be in Priſon, and
the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> ſuffer the vengeance
of eternal Fire, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Jude</hi> 7. then the Juſt
have eternal Life. (And if the <hi>Jews</hi> had not thought
the Soul immortal <hi>Saul</hi> had not deſired the Witch to
call up <hi>Samuel</hi> to ſpeak with him:) The reſt I now paſs
by. We have many great, and precious promiſes on
which a departed Soul may truſt.</p>
            <p>13. And <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 9. Chriſt expreſly ſaith, that
when we fail, (that is, muſt leave this World) we ſhall be
received into the Everlaſting habitations.</p>
            <p>§ 1. VII. And it is not nothing to encourage us to
hope in him that hath made all theſe Promiſes, when
we find how he <hi>heareth Prayers</hi> in this life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
aſſureth his Servants that he is their true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Saviour. We are apt in our diſtreſs to cry loud
for Mercy and deliverances; and when humane help
faileth to promiſe God, that if he now will ſave us, we
will thankfully acknowledg it his work; and yet when
we are delivered, to return not only to ſecurity, but to
ingratitude; and think that our deliverance came
but in the courſe of common Providence, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as an anſwer to our Prayers. And therefore
God in Mercy reneweth both our diſtreſſes and our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances,
that what once or twice will not convince us of,
many and great deliverances may. This is my own caſe.
O how oft have I cryed to him when men and means
were nothing, and when no help in ſecond Cauſes did
appear, and how oft and ſuddenly and mercifully
hath he delivered me? What ſudden eaſe, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of long afflictions have I had! ſuch extraordinary
changes, and beyond my own and others expectations,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59339:39"/>
when many plain-hearted upright Chriſtians have by
Faſting and Prayer ſought God on my behalf, as have
over and over convinced me of Special Providence,
and that God is indeed a hearer of Prayers. And won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
I have ſeen done for others alſo, upon ſuch Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
more than for my ſelf: Yea, and wonders for the
Church and publick Societies. Though I and others
are too like thoſe <hi>Iſraelites, Pſal.</hi> 78. who cried to God
in their troubles, and he oft delivered them out of their
diſtreſs, but they quickly for got this Mercies, and their
Convictions, Purpoſes and Promiſes, when they ſhould
have praiſed the Lord for his Goodneſs, and declared
his works with thankſgiving to the Sons of Men.</p>
            <p>And what were all theſe Anſwers and Mercies but
the fruits of Chriſt's Power, Fidelity, and Love, the
fulfilling of his Promiſes, and the earneſt of the greater
bleſſings of Immortality, which the ſame Promiſes give
me Title to.</p>
            <p>I know that no Promiſe of hearing Prayer, ſetteth
up <hi>our wills</hi> in abſoluteneſs, or above <hi>God's,</hi> as if every
<hi>will</hi> of <hi>our;</hi> muſt be fulfilled if we do but put it into a
fervent or confident Prayer: But if we ask any thing
through Chriſt, according to <hi>his will,</hi> expreſſed in his
<hi>Promiſe,</hi> he will hear us. If a ſinful love of this preſent
life, or of Eaſe, or Wealth, or Honour ſhould cauſe me to
pray to God againſt Death, or againſt all ſickneſs, want,
reproach or other Trials, as if I muſt live here in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
for ever if I ask it, this ſinful deſire and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
is not the work of Faith, but of Preſumption:
What if God will not abate me my laſt (or daily) pains?
What if he will continue my life no longer, who ever
pray for it, and how earneſtly ſoever? Shall I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> how
wonderfully he hath helped both me and others?
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59339:40"/>
My Faith hath oft been helpt by ſuch experiences, and
ſhall I forget them? or queſtion them without cauſe

            <p>§ 1. VIII. And it is a ſubordinate help to my belief
of Immortality with Chriſt, to find ſo much evidence

               <hi>Angels</hi> have friendly communion with us here,

Repentance: they are the regardful Witneſſes of our
behaviour; they are <hi>Miniſtring Spirits for our Good;</hi>
they are <hi>Our Angels beholding the Face of our heavenly

they will <hi>ſeparate the Juſt from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is not only the Teſtimony of Scripture, by
which we know their communion with us, but alſo
ſome degree of experience: Not only of Old did they
appear to the Faithful as Meſſengers from God, but of

and help, and make up one Society with us,
do he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> greatly encourage us to hope, that we are

It is not an uninhabited World which is above

to the Spirits of the perfected Juſt: who together have
diſcrete quantity, or numerical difference, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their happy Union and communion.</p>
            <p>§ 1. IX. And Satan himſelf, though unwillingly,
hath many ways helped my belief of our Immortality
and Future hopes: 1. I have had many convincing
proofs of <hi>Witches,</hi> the Contracts they have made with
Devils, and the Power which they have received from
them<note n="*" place="bottom">Of this ſee the Second Edition by Dr. <hi>More,</hi> of Mr. <hi>Glanvile</hi>'s Book of Apparitions called <hi>Atheiſmus Triumphatus.</hi>

            <p>§ 2. And I have had convincing Teſtimony of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions,</hi>

            <p>§ 3. From both theſe I gather, 1. that there are
<hi>Individual Inhabitants</hi> of the <hi>Inviſible World,</hi> and that
<hi>Spirits</hi> have their <hi>numerical</hi> differences, whatever <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
is among them: and therefore we have reaſon to
judge the ſame of <hi>ſeparated Souls.</hi> 2. That our Souls are
deſigned to future happineſs or miſery; which is implied
in the foreſaid contracts and endeavours of Devils for our
ruine: 3. That <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> are the way of Life,
and <hi>Unbelief</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> the way to miſery; which alſo is in
theſe implied.</p>
            <p>§ 3. 3. And I have both read and partly ſeen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
evidence, that there is ſuch an exerciſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical
power, as we commonly call <hi>Poſſeſſion:</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all or moſt mad men are under ſuch a <hi>Power</hi> as
ſome think, I determine not: But that ſome are under
it is evident: The motions of the Body, which I have
ſeen, ſeem beyond Man's Natural power: The telling
of ſecrets and things abſent, the ſpeaking Languages
never learnt, the vomiting of Nails, Glaſs, Hairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and other ſuch effects, which the moſt learned, ſober,
impartial Phyſicians profeſs to have ſeen, are credible
Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>§4. 4. And I have felt, and heard, and known
from others, of ſuch a ſort of <hi>Temptations,</hi> as ſhew
themſelves to be the acts of malicious Spirits, Enemies
to Mankind. The advantages that Satan taketh of a
corrupted Phantaſie, which hath once taken in ſuch an
Image as may be his matter to Work upon, is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.
I have known a worthy, learned, Pious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59339:41"/>
who from his youth to old Age, upon ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
hath been ſo tempted with <hi>Pleaſure</hi> to torment
<hi>himſelf,</hi> even his <hi>own Fleſh,</hi> as that for many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in a partial melancholy at divers fits he was not
able (though Conſcience alſo tormented him for it) to
forbear. Many by animmodeſt look or touch, have
given Satan ſuch a power upon their Phantaſies,
as no Reaſon, Conſcience, or reſolution could of a
long time overcome. Few men, I think that obſerve
themſelves, have not at ſometime had experience of ſuch
inward temptations, as ſhew that the Author of them is
an invincible Enemy. All which tell us, 1. That there are
<hi>Individual</hi> Spirits. 2. Yea, <hi>Devils</hi> that ſeek <hi>Man's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</hi>
3. And that by the way of <hi>ſin,</hi> and conſequently that
a future happineſs or miſery muſt be expected by us all.</p>
            <p>§ 1. X. But the great and ſure <hi>Pregnoſticks</hi> of our
<hi>Immortal Happineſs</hi> is from the <hi>Renewing Operations</hi> of
the <hi>Spirit of Holineſs</hi> on the Soul. 1. That ſuch a <hi>Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
work there is, all true Believers in ſome meaſure feel.
2. And that it is the earneſt of Heaven is proved thus.</p>
            <p>§ 2. 1. If it be a <hi>Change</hi> of greateſt <hi>Benefit</hi> to Man.
2. And if Heaven be the very <hi>Summ</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of it.
3. And if it overcome all <hi>fleſhly worldly</hi> Oppoſition.
4. And can be wrought by <hi>none</hi> but God. 5. And was
before <hi>promiſed by Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to all ſound believers.
6. And is <hi>univerſally wrought</hi> in <hi>them all,</hi> either only, or
eminently above all others. 7. And was promiſed them, as
a Pledge and Earneſt of Glory; then it can be no leſs than
ſuch a Pledge and Earneſt. But the former are all true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. 1. That the Change is of grand importance unto
Man appeareth in that it is the <hi>Renovation</hi> of his <hi>Mind,</hi>
and <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Life:</hi> It repaireth his depraved faculties:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59339:42"/>
It cauſeth <hi>Man</hi> to live as <hi>Man,</hi> who is degenerated to
a life too like to Bruits: By God's permitting many to
live in Blindneſs, Wickedneſs, and Confuſion, and to be
tormentors of themſelves and one another, by Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Injuries, Wars, and Cruelty, we the fullier ſee
what it is that <hi>Grace</hi> doth ſave men from, and what a
difference it maketh in the World. Thoſe that have
lived unholily in their youth, do eaſily find the difference
in <hi>themſelves</hi> when they are renewed: But to them
that have been piouſly inclined from their Childhood,
it is harder to diſcern the difference, unleſs they mark
the Caſe of others. If Man be worth any thing, it is
for the uſe that his Faculties were made: And if he be
not good for the Knowledg, Love and Service of his
Creator, what is he good for? And certainly the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of ungodly Worldlings: are undiſpoſed to all
ſuch works as this, till the Spirit of Chriſt effectually
change them. Men are Slaves to ſin till Chriſt thus
make them free, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 32, 33, 36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18.
<hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. But <hi>where the Spirit of the
Lord is, there is Liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 17. If the <hi>Divine
Nature</hi> and Image, and the <hi>Love of God ſhed abroad on
the Heart,</hi> be not our Excellency, Health, and Beauty,
what is? And that which <hi>is Born of the Fleſh, is
Fleſh, but that which is born of the Spirit is, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
Joh. 3. 6. Without Chriſt and his Spirit, <hi>we can
do nothing:</hi> Our dead Notions and Reaſon when we
<hi>ſee the Truth,</hi> have not power to <hi>overcome Temptations,</hi>
nor to raiſe up Man's Soul to its Original and End, nor
to poſſeſs us with the love and joyful hopes of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Bleſſedneſs. It were better for us to have no <hi>Souls,</hi>
than that thoſe Souls ſhould be void of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>§ 4. 2. And that HEAVEN is the <hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>End</hi>
of all the Spirits Operations, appeareth in all that

cauſeth us to obey, and the Doctrine which it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
us to believe, and by the deſcription of all God's

as conſiſting in the <hi>Glory and Love of God</hi> there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted,
and as purchaſed <hi>by Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>given</hi> by his
<hi>Covenant?</hi> What is our <hi>Hope</hi> but the <hi>Hope of Glory?</hi>
See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. and throughout. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. 21. <hi>Heb.</hi>
6, 11, 18, 19. &amp; 3. 6, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2 13. &amp; 3. 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 5,
23, 27. And through the <hi>Spirit we wait</hi> for all this
<hi>Hope,</hi> Gal. 5. 5. What is our Love but a deſire of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the bleſſed God initially here and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
hereafter. As the Sum of Chriſt's Goſpel was, [<hi>Take
up the Croſs, forſake all here, and follow me, and thou ſhalt
have a Reward in Heaven,</hi>] Luke 14. 26, 33. &amp; 18. 22,
23. and the Conſolation of his Goſpel is [<hi>Rejoice, and
be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven,</hi>
Matt. 5. 11, 12. So the ſame is the Sum of his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
Operations:</hi> For what he <hi>teacheth</hi> and <hi>commandeth</hi>
that he <hi>worketh:</hi> For he <hi>worketh</hi> by that <hi>Word:</hi> and
the <hi>impreſs</hi> muſt be like the <hi>Signet</hi> what arm ſoever ſet
it on. He ſendeth not his Spirit to make men craftier
than others for this World; but to make them <hi>wiſer
for Salvation;</hi> and to make them more <hi>Heavenly</hi> and
<hi>Holy:</hi> For <hi>the Children of this World are wiſer in their
Generation, than the Children of Light:</hi> Heavenlineſs
is the Spirits ſpecial work.</p>
            <p>§ 5. 3. And in working this it conquereth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
undiſpoſedneſs and averſneſs of a <hi>fleſhly, worldly
mind, and will,</hi> and the cuſtoms of a <hi>Carnal life;</hi> and
the outward <hi>Temptations</hi> of Satan, and all the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59339:43"/>
and teacheth and cauſeth us to overcome it; even its
flatteries and its frowns: Our Faith is our V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctory:
Whether this Victory be eaſie, and any honour to the
Spirit of Chriſt, let our experience of the <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of
the <hi>ungodly</hi> World, and of our <hi>own weakneſs,</hi> and of our
<hi>falls</hi> when the Spirit of God forſaketh us, be our informer.</p>
            <p>§ 6. 4. And that None but <hi>God</hi> can do this work
on the Soul of Man, both the knowledge of <hi>Cauſes</hi> and
Experience prove. The moſt learned, wiſe, and holy
<hi>Teachers</hi> cannot (as they confeſs, and ſhew:) The wiſeſt,
and moſt loving <hi>Parents cannot:</hi> and therefore muſt
pray to him that can: The greateſt Princes cannot;
Evil <hi>Angels</hi> neither can nor will. What <hi>Good Angels</hi>
can do on the Heart we know not; but we know that
they do nothing, but as the obedient Miniſters of God.
And (though we <hi>have</hi> ſome power on our ſelves; yet)
that we <hi>our ſelves</hi> cannot do it: that we cannot Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
Illuminate, or Sanctifie our ſelves, and that we
have nothing but what we have received, Conſcience
and Experience fully tell us?</p>
            <p>§ 7. 5. And that Chriſt promiſed this Spirit in a
ſpecial meaſure, to all <hi>true Believers,</hi> that it ſhould be
in them his <hi>Advocate, Agent, Seal,</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> is yet
viſible in the Goſpel; yea, and in the former Prophets,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 34. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. &amp; 37. 14. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28, 29.

Indeed the <hi>Spirit here,</hi> and <hi>Heaven hereafter,</hi> are the
chief of all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>§ 8. 6. And that this Spirit is given (not to <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi>
that abuſe Chriſt, and do not ſeriouſly believe
him, nor to meer pretending nominal Chriſtians, but)
to all that ſincerely believe the Goſpel, is evident not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59339:43"/>
only to <hi>themſelves</hi> in <hi>certainty</hi> (if they are in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to know themſelves,) but to <hi>others</hi> in <hi>part</hi> by the
effects: They have other Ends, other affections, other
lives, than the reſt of Mankind have; Though their
heavenly Nature and Deſign be the leſs diſcerned and
honoured in the World, becauſe their chiefeſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is out of the ſight of Man, in the Heart, and in
their ſecret actions, and becauſe their imperfections
blemiſh them, and becauſe the Malignant World is by
Strangeneſs and Enmity an incompetent judge, yet it is
diſcernable to others, that they live upon the hopes of a
better life, and their heavenly Intereſt is it that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleth
all the adverſe Intereſts of this World, and that
in order thereunto they live under the conduct of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority, and that God's will is higheſt and moſt
prevalent with them, and that to obey and pleaſe him
ſo far as they know it, is the greateſt buſineſs of their
lives, though ignorance and adverſe Fleſh, do make
their Holineſs and Obedience imperfect. The univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
noiſe and oppoſition of the World againſt them,
doth ſhew that men diſcern a very great difference,
which Error and croſs Intereſts, and Carnal inclinations,
render diſpleaſing to thoſe who find themſelves condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by their heavenly Deſigns and Converſations.</p>
            <p>§ 9. But whether <hi>others</hi> diſcern it, or deny it, or deteſt it,
the true Believer is conſcious of it in himſelf: Even when
he groaneth to be better, to believe, and truſt, and love
God more, and to have more of the heavenly life and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
thoſe very <hi>deſires</hi> ſignifie another <hi>Appetite,</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi>
than Worldlings have; and even when his frailties and
weakneſſes make him doubt of his own ſincerity, he
would not change his Governour, Rule or Hopes, for all
that the World can offer him. He hath the Witneſs <hi>in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
that there is in Believers a ſanctifying Spirit, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59339:44"/>
up their Minds to God and Glory, and warring

               <hi>will is preſent

they <hi>would fain be Perfect.</hi> This Spirit, and its renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
work, ſo greatly different from the temper and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of worldly men, is given by Chriſt to all ſound
believers.</p>
            <p>§ 10. It is true, that ſome that know not of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate
Saviour, have much in them that is very lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable;
whether it be real ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing Holineſs, and whether <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
were erroneous in thinking that even the <hi>Sodom</hi>'s
of the World were likely to have had <hi>fifty righteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens</hi>
in them, I am not now to enquire: But it is ſure,
1. That the World had really <hi>a Saviour,</hi> about Four
thouſand Years before Chriſt's Incarnation; even the
God of pardoning Mercy, who promiſed and undertook
what after was performed, and ſhall be to the end.
2. And that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of this Saviour did Sanctifie God's
Elect from the beginning: and gave them the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and heavenly diſpoſitions (in ſome degree) before
Chriſt's Incarnation, as is given ſince: yea it is called,
<hi>The Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> which was before given, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.
11. 3. That this Spirit was then given to more than
the <hi>Jews.</hi> 4. That Chriſt hath put that part of the
World that hear not of his Incarnation, into no worſe
a Condition than he found them in: That as the <hi>Jews
Covenant of Peculiarity</hi> was no repeal of the <hi>Univerſal
Law of Grace,</hi> made by God with fallen Mankind in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59339:44"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah;</hi> ſo the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> of the
<hi>Second Edition</hi> made with Chriſt's <hi>peculiar People,</hi> is no
repeal of the foreſaid Law in the <hi>firſt Edition,</hi> to them,
that hear not of the ſecond. 5. That all that wiſdom
and Goodneſs, that is in any without the Chriſtian
Church, is the work of the Spirit of the Redeemer; as
the light which goeth before Sun riſing, and after Sun
ſetting, and in a cloudy day, is of the ſame Sun which
others ſee, even to them that ſee not the Sun itſelf. 6. That
the liker any without the Church are to the Sanctified
Believers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the better they are; and the more unlike the
worſe; ſo that all theſe ſix things being undeniable, it
appeareth, that it is the <hi>ſame Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> which
now giveth all men what real goodneſs is any where
to be found. But it is notorious that no part of the
World, is in Heavenlineſs and Virtue comparable to
true and ſerious Chriſtians.</p>

thou draw back, as if the caſe were yet left doubtful?
Is not thy Foundation firm? Is not the way of <hi>Life,</hi>
through the Valley of <hi>Death,</hi> made <hi>ſafe</hi> by him that
conquered Death? <hi>Art</hi> thou not yet delivered from the
Bondage of thy fears, when the Jaylor and Executioner
who had the power of Death, hath by Chriſt been put
out of his power as to thee? Is not all this Evidence
true and ſure? Haſt thou not the Witneſs in thy ſelf?
Haſt thou not found the motions, the effectual Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the renewing changes of this Spirit in thee long
ago; and is he not ſtill the <hi>Agent</hi> and <hi>Witneſs</hi> of Chriſt,
reſiding and Operating in thee? Whence elſe are thy
groanings after God? Thy deſires to be nearer to
his glory? To know him better? To Love him more?
Whence came all the pleaſure thou haſt had in his Sacred
Truth, and Ways, and Service? Who elſe overcame
thy Folly, and Pride, and vain deſires, ſo far as they
are overcome? Who made it thy choice to ſit at the
Feet of Chriſt, and hear his Word, as the better part,
and to deſpiſe the Honours, and Preferments of the
World, and to account them all as Dung and Droſs?
Who breathed in thee all thoſe Requeſts that thou haſt
ſent up to God? Overvalue not corrupted Nature; it
bringeth not forth ſuch Fruits as theſe: If thou doubt
of that, remember what thou waſt in the Hour of
Temptation; even of poor and weak Temptations:
And how ſmall a matter hath drawn thee to ſin, when
God did but leave thee to thy ſelf: Forget not the Days
of youthful Vanity: Over-look not the caſe of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable

to all exceſs of riot, and as paſt feeling are greedily vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

hath made thee to differ? Thou haſt nothing to boaſt
of, and much to be humbled for; but thou haſt alſo
much to be thankful for. Thy <hi>Holy deſires</hi> are alas, <hi>too

it is <hi>God</hi> thou <hi>haſt</hi> hoped in, and his <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Glory</hi> that thou haſt hoped for: Thy prayers have been
too dull and <hi>interrupted:</hi> but it is <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi>
that thou haſt moſt prayed for: Thy <hi>labours</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
have been too <hi>ſloathful:</hi> but it is God and
Glory, and the <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> that thou haſt labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

preparing thee for the Light of Glory, as by Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

§ 13. I think it not needleſs labour to confirm my
Soul in the full perſuaſion of the truth of its own <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Nature,</hi> and of a future Life of Joy or Miſery
to Mankind, and of the <hi>certain Truth of the Chriſtian
Faith:</hi> The <hi>Being of God,</hi> and his Perfection hath ſo
great Evidence that I find no great <hi>Temptation</hi> to <hi>doubt</hi>
of it, any more than whether there be an <hi>Earth</hi> or a
<hi>Sun;</hi> and the Atheiſt ſeemeth to me to be in that no
better than <hi>Mad;</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian Verity</hi> is known only
by <hi>Supernatural Revelation;</hi> but by ſuch Revelation it
is ſo atteſted <hi>externally</hi> to the World, and <hi>internally</hi> to
Holy Souls, as maketh <hi>Faith</hi> the Ruling, <hi>victorious,
conſolatory</hi> Principle, by which we muſt live, and not by
ſight: But the <hi>Souls Immortality</hi> and <hi>Reward</hi> hereafter is
of a middle <hi>Nature; viz.</hi> Of <hi>Natural Revelation,</hi> but
incomparably <hi>leſs clear</hi> than the <hi>Being of a God;</hi> and
therefore by the addition of <hi>Evangelical (Supernatural)
Revelation,</hi> is made to us much <hi>more clear</hi> and <hi>ſure.</hi>
And I find among the <hi>Infidels</hi> of this Age, that moſt who
deny the <hi>Chriſtian Verity,</hi> do almoſt as much deny or
queſtion the <hi>Retribution</hi> of a <hi>future Life:</hi> And they that
are fully ſatisfied of <hi>this,</hi> do find <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<hi>Congruous</hi> to it, as greatly facilitateth the work
of Faith. Therefore I think that there is ſcarce any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
more needful to be throughly digeſted into <hi>a full
aſſurance,</hi> than this of the <hi>Souls Immortality</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> of
future happineſs.</p>
            <p>§ 14. And when I conſider the great unlikeneſs of mens
Hearts and Lives to ſuch a <hi>Belief</hi> as we all profeſs, I
cannot but fear that not only the <hi>ungodly,</hi> but <hi>moſt</hi>
that truly hope for Glory have a far <hi>weaker belief</hi> (in
<hi>habit</hi> and <hi>act</hi>) of the <hi>Souls Immortality</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi>
of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> than they ſeem to take notice of in
themſelves. Can I be <hi>certain</hi> or <hi>fully perſuaded</hi> (in <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59339:46"/>
and act</hi>) of the <hi>future Rewards,</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> of
Souls, and that we ſhall be all ſhortly judged as we
have lived here, and yet not deſpiſe all the Vanities of
this World, and ſet my heart with reſolution and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to the preparation which muſt be made by a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
heavenly, fruitful Life, as one whoſe Soul is taken
up with the hopes and fears of things of ſuch unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
importance. Who could ſtand dallying as moſt men
do, at the Door of Eternity, that did verily believe his
Immortal Soul muſt be ſhortly there? Though ſuch
a one had no certainty of his own particular Title to
Salvation, the <hi>certainty</hi> of ſuch a grand concernment
(that Joy or miſery is at hand) would ſurely awaken
him to try, to cry, to ſearch; to beg, to ſtrive, to
watch, to ſpare no care, or coſt, or labour to make all
ſure, in a matter of ſuch weight: It could not be but
he would do it <hi>with ſpeed,</hi> and do it with a full reſolved
Soul, and do it with earneſt zeal and diligence. What
Man that once ſaw the things which we hear of, even
Heaven and Hell, would not afterwards (at leaſt in
deep regard and ſeriouſneſs) exceed the moſt reſolved
Believer that you know: One would think in Reaſon
it ſhould be ſo thought: I confeſs a wicked Heart is very
ſenſleſs.</p>
            <p>§ 15. I do confeſs that there is much <hi>weakneſs</hi> of the
<hi>Belief</hi> of things unſeen where yet there is <hi>ſincerity:</hi> But
ſurely there will be ſome proportion between our <hi>Belief</hi>
and its <hi>Effects.</hi> And where there is little <hi>Regard,</hi> or
<hi>Fear,</hi> or <hi>Hopes,</hi> or <hi>Sorrow,</hi> or <hi>Joy,</hi> or reſolved <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
for the World to come, I muſt think that there
is, (in <hi>act</hi> at leaſt) but <hi>little belief of it,</hi> and that ſuch
Perſons little know themſelves how much they <hi>ſecretly
doubt</hi> whether it be true. I know that moſt complain
almoſt altogether of the uncertainty of <hi>their Title</hi> to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59339:47"/>
and little of their <hi>uncertainty</hi> of a <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell:</hi>
But were they <hi>more certain</hi> of <hi>this,</hi> and truly perſuaded of
it at the Heart, it would do more to bring them to that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
reſolved faithfulneſs in Religion, which would help
them more eaſily to be ſure of their <hi>Sincerity,</hi> than long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations,
&amp; many marks talked of, <hi>without this</hi> will do.</p>
            <p>§ 16. And I confeſs that the great Wiſdom of God
hath not thought meet that in the <hi>Body</hi> we ſhould have
<hi>as clear,</hi> and <hi>ſenſible,</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> apprehenſions of Heaven,
and Hell, as <hi>ſight</hi> would cauſe. For that would be to have
too much of <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell</hi> on Earth; for the <hi>guſt</hi>
would follow the <hi>perception,</hi> and ſo <hi>full a ſenſe</hi> would be
ſome ſort of a <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> which we are not fit for in this
World. And therefore it muſt be a <hi>darker Revelation</hi>
than <hi>ſight</hi> would be, that it may be a <hi>lower Perception,</hi>
leſt <hi>this World,</hi> and the <hi>next</hi> ſhould be confounded; and
<hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſhould be put out of Office, and not
duly tryed, exerciſed, and fitted for reward. But yet
<hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>Faith,</hi> and Knowledg is Knowledg; and he
that <hi>verily believeth</hi> ſuch great tranſcendent things,
though he <hi>ſee them not,</hi> will have ſome proportionable
affections and endeavours.</p>
            <p>§ 17. I confeſs alſo that <hi>Man's Soul</hi> in <hi>Fleſh</hi> is not
fit to bear ſo <hi>deep a ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> as <hi>ſight</hi>
would cauſe; becauſe it here operateth on and with
the <hi>Body,</hi> and according to <hi>its capacity,</hi> which cannot
<hi>bear ſo deep a ſenſe,</hi> without diſtraction, by ſcrewing up
the Organs too high, till they break, and ſo <hi>over doing</hi>
would <hi>undo all:</hi> But yet there is an <hi>over-ruling Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
which a <hi>certain belief</hi> of future things muſt needs
bring the Soul to, that truly hath it. And he that is
<hi>careful</hi> and <hi>ſerious</hi> for <hi>this World,</hi> and looketh after a
better, but with a <hi>ſlight, unwilling, half-regard,</hi> and
in the <hi>ſecond place,</hi> muſt give me leave to think that he <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59339:47"/>
but as he <hi>liveth,</hi> and that his <hi>doubting</hi> or <hi>unbelief</hi>
of the reality of a Heaven &amp; Hell, is greater than his Belief.</p>
            <p>§ 18. O then, for what ſhould my Soul more pray,
than for a <hi>clearer</hi> and a <hi>ſtronger Faith?</hi> I believe,
Lord help my unbelief! I have many a Thouſand times
groaned to thee under the burden of this remnant of
darkneſs and unbelief: I have many Thouſand times
thought of the <hi>Evidences</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian verity,</hi> and of
the great neceſſity of a lively, powerful, active Faith.
I have begged it: I have cryed to thee Night and Day,
Lord increaſe my Faith: I have written and ſpoken that
to others, which might be moſt uſeful to my ſelf, to
raiſe the apprehenſions of Faith, yet higher, and make
them liker thoſe of ſenſe: But yet, yet Lord, how dark is
this World? What a <hi>Dungeon</hi> is this <hi>Fleſh?</hi> How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
clearer is my ſight, and little quicker are my percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

               </gap> Man on Earth can reach? and that when I

more to be expected? Doth the Soul ceaſe its
increaſe in vigorous Perception, when the Body ceaſeth
its increaſe or vigor of ſenſation? Muſt I ſit down in ſo
low a meaſure, while I am drawing nearer to the
things believed? and am almoſt there where belief muſt
paſs into ſight and love? or muſt I take up with the
<hi>paſſive ſilence</hi> and <hi>inactivity,</hi> which ſome <hi>Fryars</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade

of <hi>Annihilation</hi> and <hi>Receptivity,</hi> let my fluggiſh Heart
alone, and ſay that in this neglect I wait for thy Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:
O let not a Soul that is driven from <hi>this</hi> World,

Spirit, by deſerting a Soul that cryeth for thy Grace,
ſo near its great and unconceivable change: Let me not

Which ſhould be the Seaſon of Triumphant

            <p>§ 19. But have I not expected more <hi>particular</hi> and

leſs ſatisfied, becauſe I expected ſuch <hi>diſtinct Perceptions</hi>
to my ſatisfaction which God doth not <hi>ordinarily</hi> give,

<hi>A diſtruſt of God,</hi> and a <hi>diſtruſtful deſire</hi> to <hi>know much</hi>
(Good and Evil) for <hi>our ſelves,</hi> as neceſſary to our <hi>quiet</hi>
and <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> was that ſin which hath deeply corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man's Nature, and is more of our common pravity
than is commonly obſerved: I find that this <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> and my Redeemer, hath had too great a hand in
my <hi>deſires</hi> of a <hi>diſtincter</hi> and <hi>more ſenſible</hi> Knowledg:
I know that I ſhould <hi>implicitely,</hi> and <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and
<hi>quietly,</hi> truſt my Soul into my Redeemers Hands; (of
which I muſt ſpeak more anon:) And it is not only <hi>for
the Body,</hi> but alſo <hi>for the Soul,</hi> that a <hi>diſtruſtful care</hi> is
our great ſin and Miſery. But yet we muſt deſire that
our <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi> may be as <hi>diſtinct</hi> and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:59339:48"/>
as <hi>God's Revelations</hi> are; and we can <hi>Love</hi> no

and <hi>Glory,</hi> the more we ſhall <hi>love, deſire and truſt</hi> him:
It is a <hi>known</hi> and not meerly an <hi>unknown God,</hi> and
<hi>happineſs</hi> that the Soul doth <hi>joyfully deſire.</hi> And if I
may not be ambitious of <hi>too ſenſible</hi> and <hi>diſtinct</hi> Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
here, of the things unſeen; yet muſt I deſire and
beg the moſt fervent and <hi>ſenſible Love</hi> to them that I am
capable of. I am willing (in part) to take up with that
<hi>unavoidable ignorance,</hi> and that low degree of ſuch
Knowledge, which God confineth us to in the Fleſh,
ſo be it he will give me but ſuch <hi>Conſolatory foretaſts in
Love and Joy,</hi> which ſuch a <hi>General imperfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
may conſiſt with, that my Soul may not paſs with
<hi>diſtruſt and terrour,</hi> but with ſuitable <hi>triumphant Hopes,</hi>
to the Everlaſting pleaſures.</p>
            <p>O Father of Lights, who giveſt Wiſdom to them
that ask it of thee, ſhut not up this ſinful Soul in darkneſs!
Leave me not to grope in unſatisfied doubts, at the
Door of the Celeſtial Light! Or if my Knowledg muſt
be <hi>General,</hi> let it be <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>powerful;</hi> and deny
me not now the <hi>lively exerciſe</hi> of FAITH, HOPE, and

the <hi>dawnings</hi> of the everlaſting Light, and the Earneſt
of the promiſed Inheritance.</p>
            <p>§ 20. But we are oft ready to ſay with <hi>Cicero,</hi> when

with <hi>Fear,</hi> leſt we ſhould be miſtaken, and our
Hopes be vain; and hereupon) and from the common
fear of Death, that even good men too often manifeſt) the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59339:49"/>
Infidels gather that we do but force our Selves into ſuch a
Hope as we deſire to be true, againſt the tendency of mans
Nature and that we were not made for a better World.</p>
            <p>§ 21. But this fallacy ariſeth from mens not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,
1. <hi>ſenſitive fears</hi> from <hi>Rational uncertainty,</hi>
or doubts. 2. And the mind that is in the darkneſs
of unbelief, from that which hath the <hi>Light of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find in my ſelf too much of <hi>fear,</hi> when I look into
<hi>Eternity,</hi> interrupting and weakening my <hi>Deſires</hi> and
<hi>Joy.</hi> But I find that it is very much an <hi>irrational ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Fear,</hi> which the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> of Man's mind, the
<hi>Greatneſs</hi> of the Change, the dreadful Majeſty of God,
and Man's Natural <hi>averſneſs to die,</hi> do in ſome degree
<hi>neceſſitate,</hi> even when <hi>Reaſon</hi> is fully ſatisfied that ſuch
fears are conſiſtent with certain ſafety. If I were bound
with the ſtrongeſt Chains, or ſtood on the ſureſt Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
on the top of a Caſtle or Steeple, I could not
poſſibly look down <hi>without fear,</hi> and ſuch as would go
near to overcome me; and yet I ſhould be <hi>rationally ſure,</hi>
that I am there <hi>faſt and ſafe</hi> and cannot fall. So is it
with our Proſpect into the Life to come: <hi>Fear</hi> is oft a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
Paſſion:</hi> When a Man is <hi>certain</hi> of his ſafe
<hi>Foundation,</hi> it will violently rob him of the comfort
of that Certainty: Yea it is a paſſion that irrational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth much to <hi>corrupt our Reaſon</hi> it ſelf, and
would make us <hi>doubt</hi> becauſe we <hi>fear,</hi> though we <hi>know
not why:</hi> And a <hi>fearful</hi> Man doth hardly truſt <hi>his own
apprehenſions</hi> of his ſafety, but among other <hi>Fears,</hi> is ſtill
ready to fear leſt <hi>he be deceived:</hi> Like timorous <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi>
Perſons about their Bodies, who are ready ſtill to
think that every little Diſtemper is a <hi>mortal Symptom,</hi>
and that worſe is ſtill near them than they feel, and
they hardly <hi>believe</hi> any words of hope.</p>
            <p>§ 22. And Satan knowing the power of theſe <hi>paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:59339:49"/>
and having eaſier acceſs to the <hi>Senſitive,</hi> than to the
<hi>Intellective</hi> Faculties, doth labour to get in at this back
Door, and to <hi>frighten poor Souls</hi> into <hi>doubts and unbelief:</hi>
and in <hi>timorous</hi> Natures he doth it with too great ſucceſs,
as to the <hi>Conſolatory</hi> acts of Faith. Though yet God's
Mercy is wonderfully ſeen in preſerving many honeſt
tender Souls, from the <hi>damning</hi> part of <hi>unbelief,</hi> and by
their fears preſerveth them from being bold with ſin:
When many bold and impudent Sinners turn Infidels or
Atheiſts, by forfeiting the helps of Grace.</p>
            <p>§ 23. And indeed <hi>Irrational fears</hi> have ſo much
power to <hi>raiſe Doubts,</hi> that they are ſeldom ſeparated;
inſomuch that many ſcarce know or obſerve the <hi>difference</hi>
between <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Fears:</hi> And many ſay they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>fear</hi> but <hi>doubt</hi> when they can ſcarce <hi>tell why,</hi> as if it
were no <hi>intellectual</hi> act which they meant, but an <hi>irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Paſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 24. If therefore my Soul ſee <hi>undeniable Evidence</hi>
of <hi>Immortality;</hi> and if it be able by irrefragable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to prove the future bleſſedneſs expected, and if
it be convinced that God's promiſes are true, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ſealed and atteſted by him, to warrant the moſt
confident belief, and if I truſt my Soul and all my
hopes upon this word, and evidences of Truth, it is not
then our <hi>averſneſs to die,</hi> nor the <hi>ſenſible fears</hi> of a Soul
that looketh into Eternity, that invalidate any of the
<hi>Reaſons</hi> of my Hope, nor prove the unſoundneſs of my
Faith.</p>
            <p>§ 25. But yet theſe <hi>Fears</hi> do prove <hi>its weakneſs,</hi> and
were they <hi>prevalent</hi> againſt the <hi>Choice, Obedience, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,</hi>
and <hi>Endeavours</hi> of Faith, they would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
againſt the <hi>Truth</hi> of Faith, or prove its <hi>nullity;</hi>
for <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>Truſt;</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> is a <hi>ſecuring, quieting thing:
Why are ye fearful, O ye of little Faith?</hi> was a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59339:50"/>
of Chriſt to his Diſciples, when ſenſible dangers

<hi>political</hi> or imperfect, though not a <hi>deſpotical and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power</hi> over our <hi>Paſſions.</hi> And therefore our <hi>fears</hi>
do ſhew us our <hi>unbelief,</hi> and ſtronger Faith is the beſt
means of conquering even <hi>irrational fears; Why art thou
caſt down O my Soul; and why art thou ſo diſquieted in
me? Truſt in God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. is a needful way of
chiding a timorous Heart.</p>
            <p>§ 26. And though many ſay that <hi>Faith hath not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
and think that it is an <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded by the Empire of the <hi>Will,</hi> without a
knowledg of the <hi>Verity</hi> of the Teſtimony; yet certainly
the ſame <hi>Aſſent</hi> is ordinarily in the Scriptures called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently,
<hi>Knowing</hi> and <hi>Believing:</hi> And as a bare
<hi>Command,</hi> will not cauſe <hi>Love,</hi> unleſs we <hi>perceive</hi> an
<hi>Amiableneſs in</hi> the Object, ſo a bare <hi>Command</hi> of
the Law or of the <hi>Will,</hi> cannot alone cauſe <hi>Belief,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we perceive a <hi>truth</hi> in the Teſtimony believed:
For it is a Contradiction; or an <hi>act</hi> without its <hi>Object.</hi>
And Truth is perceived only ſo far as it is ſome way
<hi>Evident:</hi> For <hi>Evidence</hi> is nothing but the <hi>objective per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibility</hi>
of <hi>Truth;</hi> or that which is Metaphorically
called <hi>Light.</hi> So that we muſt ſay that <hi>Faith</hi> hath <hi>not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Evidence</hi> of the <hi>inviſible things believed;</hi> but <hi>Faith</hi>
is nothing elſe but the <hi>willing Perception of the Evidence
of Truth</hi> in the <hi>word</hi> of the <hi>Aſſertor,</hi> and a <hi>Truſt</hi> therein.
We have and muſt have <hi>Evidence</hi> that Scripture is <hi>God's

of the <hi>Word or Will,</hi> we can <hi>believe</hi> it.</p>
            <p>§ 27. I do therefore neither <hi>deſpiſe Evidence</hi> as <hi>unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi>
nor <hi>truſt to it alone</hi> as the <hi>ſufficient total cauſe</hi> of my

II. From Grace, III. From other works of Gracious
Providence.</p>
            <p>1. From the Nature of Man: 1. Made capable of
it. 2. Obliged even by the Law of Nature to ſeek it
before all. 3. Naturally deſiring Perfection, 1. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual.
2. Active. 3. And Objective.</p>
            <p>2. And from the Nature of God. 1. As Good and
Communicative. 2. As Holy and Righteous. 3. As
<hi>Wiſe:</hi> making none of his works in vain.</p>
            <p>§ 29. II. From Grace, 1. Purchaſing it. 2. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
it by a Meſſenger from Heaven, both by Word
and by Chriſt's own (and others) Reſurrection.
3. Promiſing it. 4. Sealing that Promiſe by Miracles

end of the World.</p>
            <p>§ 30. III. By ſubordinate Providence, 1. God's
actual Governing the World by the hopes and fears of
another Life. 2. The many helps which he giveth us for a
heavenly Life, and for attaining it (which are not vain.)
3. Specially the Miniſtration of Angels, and their Love

to us, and Communion with us, 4. And by accident,
Devils themſelves convince us, 1. By the Nature of
their Temptations. 2. By Apparitions and haunting
Houſes. 3. By Witches. 4. By Poſſeſſions: Which
though it be but a Satanical <hi>Operation</hi> on the Body,
yet is ſo <hi>Extraordinary</hi> an Operation, that it differeth
from the more uſual, as (if I may ſo compare them)
<hi>God's Spirit</hi> ſo operateth on the <hi>Saints</hi> that it is called
his <hi>dwelling</hi> in them, or poſſeſſing them, as different
from his <hi>lower</hi> Operations on others.</p>

            <p>§ 4. 1. We ſhall be <hi>Preſent</hi> with the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of Chriſt: <hi>Queſt. But are we not always ſo? And
are not all Creatures ſo?</hi> Anſw. Yes, as his <hi>Eſſence</hi>
comprehendeth all <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Beings:</hi> But not, as it is
<hi>Operative and Manifeſted</hi> in and by <hi>his Glory.</hi> Chriſt
directeth our <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Tongues</hi> to pray [<hi>Our Father
which art in Heaven:</hi>] And yet he knew that <hi>all Place</hi>
is in and <hi>with God:</hi> Becauſe it is in <hi>Heaven</hi> that he
<hi>Gloriouſly operateth and ſhineth forth to holy Souls:</hi> Even
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59339:51"/>
as <hi>Man's Soul</hi> is eminently ſaid to be in the <hi>Head,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it underſtandeth, and reaſoneth in the Head, and
not in the <hi>Foot</hi> or <hi>Hand,</hi> though it <hi>be</hi> alſo <hi>there.</hi> And
as we look a Man in the <hi>Face</hi> when we <hi>talk</hi> to him, ſo
we look up to <hi>Heaven</hi> when we <hi>pray to God.</hi> God
who <hi>is</hi> and <hi>operateth</hi> as the <hi>Root</hi> of. <hi>Nature</hi> in all the
works of Creation (for <hi>in Him, we Live, and Move,
and Are,</hi>) and by the way of <hi>Grace</hi> in all the <hi>Gracious,</hi>
doth <hi>Operate</hi> and <hi>Is</hi> by the works and ſplendour of his
<hi>Glory</hi> eminently in <hi>Heaven:</hi> By which <hi>Glory</hi> therefore
we muſt mean ſome <hi>Created Glory:</hi> For his <hi>Eſſence</hi> hath
no inequality.</p>
            <p>§ 5. 2. We ſhall be preſent with the <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of Chriſt both <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body:</hi> But here our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
narrow Thoughts muſt not too boldly preſume to
reſolve the difficulties, which to a diſtinct under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of this ſhould be overcome: For we muſt not
here expect any more than a dark and general Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them: As, 1. What is the formal difference
between Chriſts <hi>glorified Body,</hi> and his <hi>Fleſh on Earth.</hi>
2. <hi>Where</hi> Chriſt's <hi>glorified Body</hi> is, and how far it extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
3. VVherein the Soul and the <hi>Glorified Body</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
ſeeing it is called <hi>A Spiritual Body:</hi> Theſe things
are beyond our preſent reach.</p>
            <p>§ 6. 1. For what conceptions can we have of a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Body?</hi> ſave that it is <hi>Pure,</hi> incorruptible, <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi>
to mortal Eyes, and fitted to the moſt perfect ſtate
of the Soul: How near the Nature of it is to a <hi>Spirit</hi> (and ſo
to the Soul) and how far they agree or differ in ſubſtance,
extenſiveneſs, diviſibility, or activity, little do we know.</p>
            <p>§ 7. 2. Nor do we know <hi>where</hi> and <hi>how far</hi> Chriſt's
Body is <hi>preſent</hi> by extent. The <hi>Sun</hi> is commonly taken for
a <hi>Body,</hi> and its <hi>Motive, Illuminative, and Calefactive
Beams</hi> are by the moſt probable Philoſophy taken to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59339:52"/>
be a <hi>real emanant part</hi> of its <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and ſo that it is <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially</hi>
as <hi>extenſive</hi> as thoſe <hi>Beams;</hi> that is, It at once
filleth all <hi>our Air,</hi> and toucheth the ſurface of the <hi>Earth,</hi>
and how much further it extendeth we cannot tell:
And what difference there is between <hi>Chriſt's glorified
Body,</hi> and the <hi>Sun,</hi> in <hi>Purity, Splendour, Extent,</hi> or
<hi>Excellency</hi> of Nature, little do poor Mortals know. And
ſo of the reſt.</p>
            <p>§ 8. Let no Man therefore cavil, and ſay, <hi>How can a
whole World of glorified Bodies</hi> be all <hi>preſent</hi> with the <hi>One
Body of Chriſt,</hi> when each muſt poſſeſs its proper room?
For as the Body of the <hi>ſolar Beams,</hi> and the <hi>extenſive
Air,</hi> are ſo compreſent, as that none can diſcern the
difference of the places which they poſſeſs, and a World
of Bodies are preſent with them both, ſo may all our
Bodies be with Chriſt's Body, and that without any
true confuſion.</p>
            <p>§ 9. 2. Beſides Preſence with Chriſt, there will be
ſuch an <hi>Union</hi> as we cannot now diſtinctly know. A
<hi>political Relative Union</hi> is <hi>paſt doubt,</hi> ſuch as Subjects
have in one <hi>Kingdom</hi> with their <hi>King:</hi> But little know
we how <hi>much more.</hi> We ſee that there is a wonderful
<hi>Corporeal continuity</hi> or <hi>contact</hi> among the <hi>material
works of God:</hi> And the more <hi>Spiritual,</hi> pure and
noble, the more inclination each Nature hath to <hi>Union.</hi>
Every Plant on Earth hath a <hi>Union</hi> with the <hi>whole
Earth</hi> in which it liveth; they are <hi>real parts</hi> of it. And
what <hi>Natural Conjunction our Bodies</hi> ſhall have to
<hi>Chriſt's</hi> and what <hi>influence</hi> from it, is paſt our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
Though his ſimilitudes in <hi>Joh.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. ſeem to extend far, yet being but
<hi>ſimilitudes,</hi> we cannot fully know how far.</p>
            <p>§ 10. The ſame (<hi>variatis variandis</hi>) we may ſay
of our <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt's humane Soul.</hi> Seeing <hi>Souls</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59339:52"/>
are more inclinable to union than <hi>Bodies,</hi> when we ſee
all <hi>Vegetables</hi> to be <hi>united parts</hi> of <hi>one Earth,</hi> and yet
to have each one its proper <hi>individuating form and
matter,</hi> we cannot (though <hi>Animals</hi> ſeem to walk
more <hi>diſjunct</hi>) imagine that there is <hi>no kind</hi> of Union or
Conjunction of <hi>inviſible Souls;</hi> though they retain their
ſeveral <hi>ſubſtances and forms.</hi> Nor yet that our <hi>Bodies</hi>
ſhall have a <hi>nearer Union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt's Body,</hi> than our
<hi>Souls</hi> with <hi>his Soul:</hi> But the <hi>nature, manner,</hi> and <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of it,</hi> we know not.</p>
            <p>§ 11. Far be it from us to think that Chriſt's <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Spiritual Body</hi> is ſuch in <hi>form, parts, and dimenſions,</hi>
as his <hi>earthly Body</hi> was: That it hath <hi>Hands, Feet,
Brains, Heart, Stomach, Liver, Inteſtines,</hi> as on Earth:
Or that it is ſuch a <hi>Compound</hi> of <hi>Earth, Water,</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi>
as here it was, and of ſuch <hi>confined extent;</hi> for then as
his Diſciples and a few <hi>Jews</hi> only were preſent with
him, and all the World beſides were abſent, and had
none of his Company, ſo it would be in Heaven. But
it is not ſuch only as <hi>Paul,</hi> but all true Believers in
the World, from the Creation to the end, ſhall
<hi>be with Chriſt, and ſee his Glory.</hi> And though inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Fitneſs (or Degrees of Holineſs) will make an
inequality of Glory, no Man can prove an inequality
by <hi>local diſtance</hi> from Chriſt; Or if ſuch there be (for
it's beyond our reach) yet none in Heaven are at ſuch
a diſtance from him, as not to enjoy the Felicity of his
Preſence.</p>
            <p>§ 12. Therefore when we diſpute againſt them that
hold <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and the <hi>ubiquity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Body,</hi>
we do aſſuredly conclude that <hi>Senſe is Judge,</hi> whether
there be <hi>real Bread and Wine preſent,</hi> or <hi>not:</hi> But it is
no Judge, whether Chriſt's <hi>Spiritual Body</hi> be preſent or
not, no more than whether an <hi>Angel</hi> be preſent: And
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59339:53"/>
we conclude that <hi>Chriſt's Body</hi> is not Infinite or Immenſe
as is his <hi>Godhead;</hi> but what are its <hi>dimenſions, Limits</hi> or
<hi>extent,</hi> and where it is <hi>abſent,</hi> far be it from us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
when we cannot tell how far the <hi>Sun</hi> extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
its <hi>ſecondary</hi> ſubſtance, or <hi>emanant Beams;</hi> nor
well what <hi>Locality</hi> is as to Chriſt's <hi>Soul</hi> or any <hi>Spirit,</hi> if
to a <hi>Spiritual Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 13. Their fear is vain and carnal, who are afraid
leſt their <hi>Union</hi> with Chriſt or one another will be <hi>too
near;</hi> even leſt thereby they loſe their <hi>individuation,</hi> as
Rivers that fall into the Sea, or extinguiſhed Candles
whoſe Fire is after but a Sun-beam, or part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Element of Fire in the Air; or as the Vegetative
Spirits which in <hi>Autumn,</hi> retire from the Leaves into
the Branches and Trunk of the Tree: I have proved
before, that our Individuation or numerical Exiſtence
ceaſeth not: And that no Union is to be feared, were
it never ſo ſure, which deſtroyeth not the <hi>Being,</hi> or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<hi>Powers</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> of the Soul; and that it is the great
radical diſeaſe of SELFISHNESS and want of Holy
LOVE to God and our Saviour, and one another, which
cauſeth theſe unreaſonable Fears; Even that <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi>
which now maketh men ſo <hi>partially</hi> deſirous of their
<hi>own wills</hi> and pleaſure in compariſon of God's, and
their <hi>own Felicity</hi> in compariſon of other, and which
maketh them ſo eaſily bear <hi>God</hi>'s injuries, and the <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi>
of a <hi>Thouſand others,</hi> in compariſon of <hi>their own.</hi>
But he that put a great deſire of the <hi>Bodies preſervation</hi>
into the <hi>Soul</hi> while it is its form, will <hi>abate</hi> that deſire
when the time of <hi>ſeparation</hi> is come, becauſe there is then
no uſe for it till the Reſurrection: Elſe it would be a
<hi>torment</hi> to the Soul.</p>
            <p>§ 14. 3. And as we ſhall have UNION, ſo alſo <hi>COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MUNION</hi>
with the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59339:53"/>
Chriſt, reſpectively. Both as they will be the <hi>Objects</hi> of our
Souls moſt noble and Conſtant acts, and as they will be
the <hi>Fountain</hi> or <hi>Communicative</hi> cauſe of our <hi>receptions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 15. 1. We find <hi>now</hi> that our <hi>various Faculties</hi> have
<hi>various Objects</hi> ſuitable to their Natures: The Objects of
<hi>Senſe</hi> are things <hi>ſenſible;</hi> and the Objects of <hi>Imagination</hi>
things <hi>Imaginable,</hi> and the Objects of <hi>Intellection</hi> things
<hi>Intelligible,</hi> and the Objects of the <hi>Will</hi> things <hi>amiable:</hi>
The Eye that is a nobler Senſe than ſome others, hath
<hi>Light</hi> for its Object, which to other Senſes is <hi>none:</hi> and
ſo of the reſt. Therefore we have cauſe to ſuppoſe, that
as far as our <hi>Glorified Souls,</hi> and our <hi>Spiritual Glorified
Bodies,</hi> will differ, ſo far <hi>Chriſt's Glorified Soul and Body</hi>
will reſpectively be their <hi>ſeveral Objects:</hi> And behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Glory of both</hi> will be part of <hi>our Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 16. Yet is it not hence to be gathered that the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
Soul</hi> before the Reſurrection ſhall not have
<hi>Chriſt's Glorified Body</hi> for its Object: For the Objects
of the <hi>Body</hi> are alſo the Objects of the <hi>Soul,</hi> or to ſpeak
more properly, the Objects of <hi>Senſe</hi> are alſo the Objects of
<hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> though all the Objects of the <hi>Intellect</hi>
and <hi>Will</hi> are not Objects of <hi>Senſe.</hi> The <hi>Separated Soul</hi>
can know Chriſt's <hi>Glorified Body,</hi> though our preſent <hi>Bodies</hi>
cannot <hi>ſee a Soul.</hi> But how much our <hi>Spiritual Bodies</hi>
will excel in Capacity and Activity theſe <hi>paſſive Bodies,</hi>
that have ſo much Earth and Water we cannot tell.</p>
            <p>§ 17. And though now our Souls are as a <hi>Candle in a
Lanthorn,</hi> and muſt have extrinſick Objects admitted
by the <hi>Senſes</hi> before they can be <hi>understood,</hi> yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
not that therefore a <hi>ſeparated Soul</hi> cannot know
ſuch Objects: 1. Becauſe it now knoweth them <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractively
per ſpecies,</hi> becauſe its act of <hi>Ratiocination</hi> is
<hi>Compound</hi> as to the Cauſe (<hi>Soul and Body.</hi>) But it
will <hi>then know</hi> ſuch things Intuitively (as now it can do
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59339:54"/>
               <hi>it ſelf</hi>) when the Lanthorn is caſt by. 2. And (what
ever many of late, that have given themſelves the title
of <hi>Ingenious</hi> have ſaid to the contrary) we have little
reaſon to think that the <hi>ſenſitive faculty</hi> is not an <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential,
inſeparable</hi> power of the ſame Soul that is <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual,</hi>
and that <hi>ſenſation</hi> ceaſeth to ſeparated Souls,
(however the <hi>modes</hi> of it may ceaſe with their ſeveral
<hi>Uſes</hi> and <hi>Organs:</hi>) To <hi>Feel Intellectually,</hi> or to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
and will feelingly,</hi> we have cauſe to think will be
the <hi>Action</hi> of <hi>ſeparated Souls:</hi> And if ſo, why may
they not have communion with Chriſt's <hi>Body and Soul</hi>
as their <hi>Objects</hi> in their <hi>ſeparated State?</hi> 3. Beſides that
we are uncertain whether the ſeparated Soul have no
Vehicle or Body at all: Things unknown to us muſt not
be ſuppoſed True or Falſe: Some think that the <hi>ſenſitive
Soul</hi> is <hi>Material,</hi> and as a <hi>Body</hi> to the <hi>Intellectual,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeparated: I am not of <hi>their Opinion</hi> that make them
<hi>two ſubſtances;</hi> but I cannot ſay, <hi>I am certain</hi> that they
err: Some think that the Soul is <hi>Material,</hi> of a <hi>purer
ſubstance</hi> than things viſible, and that the common Notion
of its <hi>ſubstantiality</hi> meaneth nothing elſe but a pure
(as they call it <hi>Spiritual</hi>) <hi>Materiality:</hi> Thus thought
not only <hi>Tertullian,</hi> but almoſt all the old <hi>Greek</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the Church that write of it, and moſt of the
<hi>Latine,</hi> or very many, as I have elſewhere <hi>ſhewed;</hi> and
as <hi>Faustus</hi> reciteth them in the Treatiſe anſwered by
<hi>Mammertus:</hi> Some think that the Soul (<hi>as Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>)
is an <hi>Igneous Body,</hi> ſuch as we call <hi>Aether</hi> or <hi>Solar
Fire,</hi> or rather of a <hi>higher purer kind,</hi> and that <hi>Senſation</hi>
and <hi>Intellection</hi> are thoſe <hi>formal Faculties</hi> which <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically</hi>
difference it from inferior <hi>meer Fire</hi> or <hi>Aether.</hi>
There were few of the Old Doctors that thought it not
ſome of theſe ways <hi>Material:</hi> And conſequently <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi>
and <hi>diviſible per potentiam Divin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59339:54"/>
               <hi>Naturally</hi> or of its own inclination, becauſe moſt
<hi>ſtrongly inclined to Unity.</hi> And if any of all theſe uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Opinions ſhould prove true, the Objections in hand
will find no place. (To ſay nothing of their conceit
who ſay, that as the <hi>Spirit</hi> that retireth from the <hi>falling

               </hi> continueth to <hi>animate the Tree,</hi> ſo
<hi>Man's Soul</hi> may do when departed, with that to which
it is <hi>United,</hi> to animate ſome more <hi>Noble univerſal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi>)
But as all theſe are the <hi>too bold</hi> Cogitations of men
that had better let unknown things alone, ſo yet they
may be mentioned to refel that more perillous boldneſs,
which denyeth the <hi>Souls Action</hi> which is certain, upon
(at beſt) uncertain Reaſons.</p>
            <p>§ 18. I may boldly conclude notwithſtanding ſuch
Objections, that Chriſt's Divine and Humane Nature,
Soul and Body, ſhall be the felicitating Objects of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition</hi>
and <hi>holy Love</hi> to the ſeparated Soul before the
Reſurrection; and that to be <hi>with Chriſt,</hi> is to have
ſuch communion with him, and not only to be preſent
where he is.</p>
            <p>§ 19. 2. And the chief part of this communion will
be that in which we are <hi>Receptive;</hi> even Chriſt's <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications</hi>
to the Soul. And as the Infinite <hi>Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible
Deity</hi> is the <hi>Root</hi> or <hi>firſt Cauſe</hi> of all <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,

is <hi>Creative;</hi>) ſo God uſeth <hi>Second Cauſes</hi> in his <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications</hi>
to <hi>inferiour Natures:</hi> and it is more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the <hi>Humane Soul</hi> of <hi>Christ primarily</hi> and his

               <hi>Communication</hi> both of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> both to <hi>Man</hi> in

Head,</hi> and to be the <hi>conveying cauſe</hi> of <hi>Everlaſting
Life,</hi> and <hi>Light, and Love</hi> to all his Members: As now
<hi>we live becauſe he liveth,</hi> even as the <hi>Branches in the
Vine,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit that quickneth, enlightneth,</hi> and
<hi>ſanctifieth</hi> us, is firſt the Spirit of Chriſt before it is
ours, and is communicated from God by him to us;
ſo will it be in the ſtate of <hi>Glory:</hi> For we ſhall have
our Union and Communion with him perfected, and
not deſtroyed or diminiſhed. And unleſs I could be ſo
proud as to think that I am or ſhall be the moſt <hi>excellent</hi>
of all the <hi>Creatures</hi> of God, and therefore <hi>neareſt him,</hi> and
<hi>above all others,</hi> how could I think that I am under
the Influence of no <hi>ſecond Cauſe,</hi> but have either <hi>Grace</hi>
or <hi>Glory</hi> from <hi>God alone?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. So far am I from ſuch arrogancy as to think
that I ſhall be ſo <hi>near to God,</hi> as to be <hi>above the need</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59339:55"/>
and <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Communications,</hi> as that I dare
not ſay that I ſhall be above the need and help of <hi>other
ſubordinate Cauſes:</hi> As I am now <hi>lower</hi> than <hi>Angels,</hi> and
<hi>need their help,</hi> and as I am under the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>my
Superiors,</hi> and as a <hi>poor weak Member</hi> am little worth in
compariſon of the <hi>whole Body,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt,
and receive continual help from the whole: So how far
it will be thus in Glory I know not; but that God
will ſtill uſe <hi>ſecond Cauſes</hi> for <hi>our Joy,</hi> I doubt not; and
alſo that there will not be an <hi>equality:</hi> and that it will be
conſiſtent with God's <hi>Allſufficiency</hi> to us and our <hi>felicity
in Him,</hi> that we ſhall for ever have uſe for <hi>one another,</hi>
and that to <hi>ſit down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in
the Kingdom of God,</hi> and to be in <hi>Abraham's Boſom,</hi> and ſit
<hi>at Chriſt's Right,</hi> and <hi>Left hand in his Kingdom,</hi> and to be
<hi>Ruler over ten Cities,</hi> and to join with the <hi>heavenly Host</hi>
or Chore in the joyful Love and Praiſe of God, and of
the Lamb, and many ſuch like, are not falſe, nor uſeleſs
notes, and notions of our Celeſtial Glory.</p>
            <p>§ 21. And certainly if I be <hi>with Christ,</hi> I ſhall be
<hi>with all that are with</hi> Chriſt: Even with all the <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Society:</hi> Though theſe Bodies of <hi>groſs paſſive Matter</hi>

enough for all its Inhabitants; and thoſe at the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes</hi>

and that all the <hi>Glorified ſhall know each other,</hi>
or at leaſt be <hi>far leſs distant,</hi> and <hi>leſs strange,</hi> than now

and puzzle them that ſay that all Bodies are <hi>impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi>
when I ſee how little they hinder the <hi>placing</hi> or
<hi>preſence</hi> of other Creatures, and how intimately they
mix themſelves with all; and ſeem to poſſeſs the whole
Region of the Air, when yet the Air ſeemeth it ſelf to
fill it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I dare not think that <hi>glorified Spirits,</hi> (no nor
<hi>Spiritual Bodies</hi>) will be ſuch Strangers to one another
as we are here on Earth.</p>
            <p>§ 22. And I muſt needs ſay that it is a <hi>pleaſant
Thought to me,</hi> and greatly helpeth my willingneſs to
die, to think that I <hi>ſhall go to all the Holy ones, both
Christ and Angels,</hi> and <hi>departed bleſſed Souls.</hi> For
1. God hath convinced me, that they are <hi>better than I,</hi>
(each ſingly) and therefore more amiable than my ſelf:
2. And that <hi>many</hi> are <hi>better</hi> than <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>whole</hi> than a
poor <hi>ſinful part,</hi> and the <hi>New Hieruſalem</hi> is the Glory
of the Creation. 3. God hath given me a <hi>Love to all
his Holy Ones</hi> as ſuch. 4. And a <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>work of
Love</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> which they continually and perfectly
perform to God. 5. And a Love to <hi>the Celeſtial Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
as it is compleat, and to his Glory ſhining in
them. 6. And my old acquaintance with many a holy
Perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gone to Chriſt, doth make my Thoughts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the more <hi>familiar</hi> to me. O how many of them
could I name. 7. And it is no ſmall encouragement to
one that is to enter upon an <hi>unſeen World,</hi> to think that
he goeth not an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

[TO DEPART.]</p>
            <p>§ 1. But I muſt be <hi>Looſed</hi> or <hi>Depart</hi> before I can
thus <hi>be with</hi> Chriſt. And I muſt here conſider, I. <hi>From
what</hi> I muſt <hi>depart.</hi> II. And <hi>How,</hi> or in what <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi>
And I muſt not refuſe to know the worſt.</p>
            <p>§ 2. I. And, 1. I know that I muſt <hi>Depart from</hi>
this <hi>Body</hi> itſelf, and the Life which conſiſteth in the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
of it. Theſe <hi>Eyes</hi> muſt here <hi>ſee</hi> no more; this
<hi>Hand</hi> muſt <hi>move</hi> no more; theſe <hi>Feet</hi> muſt <hi>go</hi> no more;
this <hi>Tongue</hi> muſt <hi>ſpeak</hi> no more, As much as I have loved
and overloved this Body, I muſt leave it to the Grave.
<hi>There</hi> muſt it lie and rot in darkneſs, as a neglected and
a loathed thing.</p>
            <p>§ 3. This is the <hi>Fruit of Sin,</hi> and Nature would not
have it ſo: I mean the Nature of this <hi>compound MAN:</hi>
But what though it be ſo? 1. It is but my <hi>Shell</hi> or <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi>
&amp; the <hi>cloathing</hi> of my Soul, and not it ſelf. 2. It is but
an <hi>elementary Compoſition</hi> diſſolved; and Earth going to
Earth, and Water to Water, and Air to Air, and
Fire to Fire, into that Union which the elementary
Nature doth incline to.</p>
            <p>3. It is but an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> laid by when all its work
<hi>is done,</hi> and a <hi>Servant</hi> diſmiſſed when his <hi>Service</hi> is at
an end. And what ſhould I do with a <hi>Horſe</hi> when I
ſhall need to <hi>ride</hi> or <hi>travel</hi> no more, or with a <hi>Pen</hi>
when I muſt <hi>write</hi> no more? It is but the laying by
the <hi>Paſſive receiver</hi> of my <hi>Souls Operations,</hi> when the
Soul hath no more to do upon it: As I caſt by my <hi>Lute</hi>
or other inſtrument when I have better employment
than <hi>Muſick</hi> to take up my time!</p>
            <p>4. Or at moſt it is but as <hi>Flowers</hi> die in the <hi>fall,</hi> and
<hi>Plants</hi> in Winter, when the <hi>retiring Spirits</hi> have done
their work, and are undiſpoſed to dwell in ſo <hi>cold</hi> and

               <hi>unmeet</hi> a Habitation, as the <hi>Seaſon</hi> maketh their <hi>former
matter</hi> then to be. And its retirement is not its <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
but its taking up a fitter <hi>place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. It is but a ſeparation from a <hi>troubleſome Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and putting off a <hi>Shoe</hi> that <hi>pinched</hi> me; many a
<hi>ſad</hi> and painful Hour I have had in this frail and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
fleſh. Many a weary Night and Day: What
cares, what fears, what griefs, what groans hath this
<hi>Body</hi> coſt me? Alas, how many Hours of my precious
time, have been ſpent to maintain it, pleaſe it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
it? How conſiderable a part of all my life hath
been ſpent in neceſſary ſleep and reſt! And how much
in eating, drinking, dreſſing, phyſick? And how
much in labouring or uſing means to <hi>procure</hi> theſe and
other neceſſaries? Many a hundred times I have
thought, that it coſteth me ſo <hi>dear to live,</hi> yea to live
a <hi>painful weary life,</hi> that were it not for the <hi>work</hi> and
<hi>higher ends</hi> of life, I had little Reaſon to be much in
love with it, or to be loath to leave it. And had not
God put into our <hi>Nature</hi> itſelf a <hi>neceſſary, unavoidable,
ſenſitive Love of the Body, and of Life,</hi> (as he puts into
the <hi>Mother,</hi> and into every <hi>Bruit,</hi> a love of their <hi>young
Ones,</hi> how <hi>unclean, and impotent, and troubleſome</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)
for the propagation and continuance of Man
on Earth? Had God but left it to <hi>meer Reaſon,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this <hi>neceſſary pre-engagement</hi> of our <hi>Natures,</hi> it would
have been a matter of more doubt and difficulty than it
is, whether this life ſhould be <hi>loved</hi> and <hi>deſired,</hi> and no
ſmall number would daily wiſh that they had never
been Born! A wiſh which I have had much a do to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
even when I have known that it is <hi>ſinful,</hi> and
when the <hi>work</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> of my life have been ſuch
to overcome the evils of it, as few have had.</p>
            <p>6. Yea, to depart from ſuch a Body is but to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59339:57"/>
from a very <hi>foul, uncleanly</hi> and <hi>ſordid</hi> Habitation.
I know that the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Man and Bruits</hi> is the <hi>curious
wonderful work of God,</hi> and not to be <hi>deſpiſed,</hi> nor injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<hi>diſhonoured,</hi> but <hi>admired</hi> and <hi>well uſed:</hi> But yet
it is a wonder to our Reaſon that ſo <hi>noble</hi> a Spirit ſhould
be ſo <hi>meanly houſed:</hi> And we may call it, <hi>Our vile Body,</hi>
as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. It is made up of the
<hi>Airy, Watery,</hi> and <hi>Earthly</hi> parts of our daily food, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
and actuated by the <hi>fiery part,</hi> as the inſtrument
of the Soul. The greater part of the ſame food (which
with great coſt, and pomp, and pleaſure, is firſt upon
our <hi>Tables,</hi> and then in our <hi>Mouths</hi> to day) is to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a <hi>fetid</hi> loathſom <hi>excrement,</hi> and caſt out into the
draught, that the <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>ſmell</hi> of that annoy us not,
which yeſterday was the <hi>ſumptuous</hi> fruit of <hi>our abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi>
&amp; the glory of that which is called <hi>great houſekeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and the pleaſure of our <hi>Eyes and Taſte.</hi> And is not the
<hi>reſt</hi> that turneth into <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Fleſh,</hi> of the ſame general
<hi>kind</hi> with that which is turned into loathſom <hi>filth?</hi> The
difference is, that it is fitter for the <hi>Soul</hi> by the <hi>fiery Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
yet <hi>longer</hi> to <hi>operate</hi> on and keep from corruption:
Our <hi>blood,</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> are as <hi>ſtinking</hi> and <hi>loathſom</hi> a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
as our <hi>filthieſt excrements,</hi> ſave that they are <hi>longer
kept</hi> from putrefaction. Why then ſhould it more grieve
me that <hi>one part</hi> of my <hi>food</hi> which turned into <hi>fleſh,</hi>
ſhould <hi>rot</hi> and <hi>stink</hi> in the Grave, than that <hi>all the reſt</hi>
ſhould <hi>daily ſtink</hi> in the draught? Yea while it is <hi>within
me,</hi> were it not covered from my ſight, what a loathſom
maſs would my Inteſtines appear? If I ſaw what is in the
Guts, the Meſentery, the Ventricles of the Brain, what filth,
what bilious or mucous matter, and perhaps crawling
Worms there are in the moſt proud or comely Perſon,
I ſhould think that the cover of a cleaner Skin, and the
borrowed Ornaments of Apparel, make no <hi>great</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59339:58"/>
between ſuch a Body and a Carkaſs (which may be
alſo covered with an adorned Coffin and Monument, to
deceive ſuch Spectators that ſee but out-ſides:) the change
is not ſo great of <hi>corruptible Fleſh,</hi> repleat with ſuch fetid
Excrements into <hi>corrupted Fleſh,</hi> as ſome Fools imagine.</p>
            <p>7. Yet more, to <hi>Depart</hi> from ſuch a <hi>Body,</hi> is but to be
looſed from the <hi>Bondage</hi> of <hi>Corruption,</hi> and from a <hi>Clog</hi>
and <hi>Priſon</hi> of the Soul. I ſay not that God put a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent
Soul</hi> into this <hi>Priſon Penally,</hi> for former faults:
I muſt ſay no more than I can prove, or than I know:
But that <hi>Body</hi> which was an apt Servant to <hi>innocent
Man</hi>'s Soul, is become as a <hi>Priſon</hi> to him now: What
alteration ſin made upon the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Body, as
whether it be more <hi>terrene</hi> and <hi>groſs</hi> than elſe it would
have been, I have no reaſon to aſſert: Of <hi>Earth,</hi> or <hi>Dust,</hi>
it was at firſt, and to <hi>Dust</hi> it is ſentenced to return.
But no doubt but it hath its part in that diſpoſitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation
which is the fruit of ſin. we find that the
Soul as ſenſitive, is ſo impriſoned or ſhut up in Fleſh, that
ſometimes it is more than <hi>one Door</hi> that muſt be opened
before the <hi>Object</hi> and the <hi>Faculty</hi> can meet: In the <hi>Eye</hi>
indeed, the Soul ſeemeth to have a Window to look
out at, and to be <hi>almost</hi> itſelf <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ible</hi> to others: And
yet there are many <hi>interpoſing tunicles,</hi> and a <hi>ſuffuſion,</hi>
or <hi>winking,</hi> can make the cleareſt ſight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
for the time as if it were none: And if <hi>ſenſe</hi> be thus
ſhut up from its Object, no wonder if <hi>Reaſon</hi> alſo be
under difficulties from coporeal impediments; and if the
Soul that is yoaked with ſuch a Body, can go no <hi>faster</hi>
than <hi>its</hi> heavy pace.</p>
            <p>8. Yet further, To Depart from ſuch a <hi>Body</hi> is but
to be ſeparated from an <hi>accidental Enemy,</hi> and one of
our <hi>greatest</hi> and <hi>most hurtful</hi> Enemies: Though ſtill
we ſay, That it is not by any default in the work of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59339:58"/>
our <hi>Creator,</hi> but by the <hi>effects of ſin,</hi> that it is ſuch: What
could Satan or any other Enemy of our Souls, have done
againſt us without <hi>our fleſh?</hi> What is it but the <hi>Intereſt
of this Body,</hi> that ſtandeth in <hi>competition</hi> againſt the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of our <hi>Souls and God?</hi> What elſe do the prophane ſell
their heavenly Inheritance for, as <hi>Eſau</hi> his Birthright? No
Man loveth evil, as evil, but as ſome way a real or ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>good?</hi> And what <hi>good</hi> is it but that which ſeemeth
<hi>good for the Body?</hi> What elſe is the Bait of Ambition, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
and Senſuality, but the <hi>Intereſt and Pleaſure</hi> of
this <hi>Fleſh.</hi> What taketh up the <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> which
we ſhould lay out upon things <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Heavenly,</hi>
but this Body and its Life? What <hi>Pleaſures</hi> be they that
ſteal away mens Hearts from the heavenly Pleaſures of
Faith, Hope, and Love, but the <hi>Pleaſures of this Fleſh?</hi>
This draweth us to ſin: This hindereth us from and in
our duty. This <hi>Body</hi> hath its <hi>intereſt</hi> which <hi>muſt</hi> be <hi>mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and its inordinate Appetite which muſt <hi>be pleaſed;</hi> or
elſe what murmurings and diſquiet muſt we expect?
Were it not for <hi>Bodily Interest,</hi> and its <hi>Temptations,</hi> how
much more innocently and holily might I live?
I ſhould have nothing to care for, but to pleaſe God
and to be pleaſed in him, were it not for the care of <hi>this
Bodily life?</hi> What Employment ſhould my <hi>Will</hi> and

<hi>Intereſt,</hi> were it not for the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> and its

All the ſweet <hi>draughts,</hi> and <hi>morſels,</hi> and <hi>ſports,</hi> and
<hi>laughters,</hi> all the ſweet <hi>Thoughts</hi> of thy <hi>worldly Poſſeſſions,</hi>
or thy <hi>Hopes,</hi> that ever thou hadſt till this preſent Hour,
are paſt by, dead, and gone already. All that Death
doth to ſuch as theſe is to prevent ſuch, that on Earth
thou ſhalt have no more.</p>
            <p>2. And is not that the Caſe of <hi>every Bruit,</hi> that hath
no comfort from the <hi>proſpect of another Life,</hi> to repair
his loſs: And yet as our dominion diminiſheth their
pleaſure while they live, by our keeping them under
fear and labour, ſo at our will their lives muſt end:
To pleaſe a Gentleman's Appetite for half an hour or
leſs, Birds, Beaſts, and Fiſhes muſt loſe life itſelf, and
all the pleaſure which life might have afforded them for
many Years; yea perhaps <hi>many</hi> of theſe (Birds and
Fiſhes at leaſt) muſt die to become but <hi>one Feast</hi> to a
rich Man, if not <hi>one ordinary Meal.</hi> And is not <hi>their
ſenſual pleaſure</hi> of the ſame <hi>Nature</hi> as ours? <hi>Meat</hi> is as
<hi>ſweet</hi> to them, and <hi>eaſe</hi> as welcome, and <hi>lust</hi> as ſtrong
(in ſeaſon;) And the pleaſure that Death depriveth our
<hi>Fleſh</hi> of, is ſuch as is common to Man with Bruits:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59339:60"/>
Why then ſhould it ſeem hard to us to loſe that in the
Courſe of <hi>Nature,</hi> which <hi>our Wills</hi> deprive them of at
<hi>our Pleaſure?</hi> When if we are Believers we can ſay
that <hi>we</hi> do but <hi>exchange</hi> theſe delights of Life, for the
<hi>greater delights</hi> of a Life with Chriſt, which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
which our <hi>fellow Creatures</hi> (the <hi>Bruits</hi>) have
not!</p>
            <p>3. And indeed the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of Life are uſually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered
with ſo much <hi>pain,</hi> that to a great part of the
World doth ſeem to <hi>exceed</hi> them: The <hi>Vanity</hi> and
<hi>Vexation</hi> is ſo great and grievous, as the pleaſure ſeldom
countervaileth. It's true that <hi>Nature deſireth Life</hi> even
under <hi>Sufferings</hi> that are but tolerable, rather than to die:
But that is not ſo much from the ſenſible <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of life, as
from <hi>meer Natural Inclination;</hi> which God hath laid ſo
deep that free will hath not full power againſt it. As
before I ſaid, that the <hi>Body of Man</hi> is ſuch a thing,
that could we ſee through the Skin (as men may look
through a Glaſs Hive upon the Bees) and ſee all the
parts and motion, the filth and excrements that are in
it, the Soul would hardly be willing to actuate, love and
cheriſh ſuch a maſs of unclean matter, and to dwell in
ſuch a loathſom place, unleſs God had <hi>neceſſitated</hi> it by
<hi>Nature</hi> (deeper than <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>ſenſe</hi>) to ſuch a Love,
and ſuch a labour by the <hi>Pondus</hi> or <hi>Spring</hi> of <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
Even as the Cow would not elſe <hi>lick</hi> the <hi>unclean
Calf,</hi> nor <hi>Women</hi> themſelves be at ſo much labour and
trouble with their <hi>Children,</hi> while there is little of them
to be pleaſant, but <hi>uncleanneſs,</hi> and <hi>crying,</hi> and helpleſs
<hi>impatiency</hi> to make them <hi>weariſom,</hi> had not <hi>neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Inclination</hi> done more hereto than any other <hi>ſenſe</hi>
or <hi>reaſon:</hi> Even ſo I now ſay of the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of Living,
that the <hi>ſorrows</hi> are ſo much greater to Multitudes than
the <hi>ſenſible delight,</hi> that life would not be ſo commonly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59339:60"/>
choſen and endured under ſo much trouble, were not men
<hi>determined</hi> thereto by <hi>Natural neceſſitating Inclination;</hi>
(or deterred from Death by the fears of miſery to the
ſeparated Soul;) And yet all this kept not ſome counted
the beſt and wiſeſt of the Heathens, from taking it for
the Valour and Wiſdom of a Man to make away his
life in time of extremity, and from making this the
great anſwer to them that grudge at God, for making
their lives ſo miſerable [<hi>If the miſery be greater than the
good of life, Why doſt thou not end it? Thou maiſt do
that when thou wilt.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Our Meat and Drink is pleaſant to the healthful; but
it coſteth poor men ſo much toil, and labour, and care, &amp;
trouble to procure a poor Diet for themſelves and their
families, that I think, could they live without eating,
and drinking, they would thankfully exchange the
pleaſure of it all, to be eaſed of their <hi>care and toil</hi> in
getting it: And when <hi>ſickneſs</hi> cometh, even the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt</hi>
Food is <hi>loathſom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And do we not willingly interrupt and lay by
theſe <hi>Pleaſures, every Night</hi> when we betake our ſelves
to <hi>ſleep?</hi> It's poſſible indeed a Man may then have
<hi>pleaſant Dreams:</hi> But I think few go to <hi>ſleep</hi> for the
<hi>pleaſure of Dreaming:</hi> Either no <hi>Dreams,</hi> or <hi>vain,</hi> or
troubleſom <hi>Dreams</hi> are much more common. And to
ſay that <hi>Reſt</hi> and <hi>Eaſe</hi> is my <hi>pleaſure,</hi> is but to ſay that
my daily labour and cares are ſo much greater than my
waking pleaſure, that I am glad to lay by both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
For what is <hi>Eaſe</hi> but deliverance from <hi>wearineſs</hi>
and pain? For in deep and dreamleſs ſleep there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>poſitive ſenſe</hi> of the Pleaſure of Reſt itſelf. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is more from Natures neceſſitated inclination to
this ſelf-eaſing and repairing means, than from the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
pleaſure of it, that we deſire ſleep. And if we
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59339:61"/>
can thus be contented every Night to die as it were to
all our waking pleaſures, why ſhould we be unwilling
to die to them at once.</p>
            <p>5. If it be the <hi>inordinate pleaſures forbidden</hi> of God,
which you are loath to leave, thoſe muſt be left <hi>before</hi>
you die, or elſe it had been better for you never to
have been born? Yea every <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> Man doth caſt
them off with deteſtation: You muſt be againſt <hi>Holineſs</hi>
on that account as well as againſt <hi>Death?</hi> And indeed
the ſame Cauſe which maketh men unwilling to <hi>live a
Holy life,</hi> hath a great hand in making them unwilling
to <hi>die;</hi> even becauſe they are loth to leave the <hi>pleaſure
of ſin:</hi> If the wicked be converted, he muſt be <hi>gluttonous
and drunken</hi> no more, he muſt live in Pride, Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
Worldlineſs and ſenſual pleaſures no more; and
therefore he draweth back from a Holy life, as if it
were from Death itſelf. And ſo he is the lother to die,
becauſe he muſt have no more of the pleaſures of his
Riches, Pomp, and Honours, his Sports, and Luſt,
and pleaſed Appetite; no more for ever; but what's
this to them that have <hi>mortified</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> with the <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and luſts thereof?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Yea it is theſe <hi>forbidden pleaſures</hi> which are the great
impediments both of our <hi>Holineſs</hi> and our trueſt pleaſures:
And one of the Reaſons why God forbiddeth them, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they hinder us from <hi>better.</hi> And if for our own
good we muſt <hi>forſake</hi> them when we turn to God, it
muſt be ſuppoſed that they ſhould be no reaſon againſt
our <hi>willingneſs to die,</hi> but rather that to be free from the
danger of them, we ſhould be the more willing.</p>
            <p>7. But the great ſatisfying Anſwer of this Objection
is, that Death will paſs us to <hi>far greater pleaſures</hi> with
which all theſe are not worthy to be compared. But of
this more in due place.</p>

§ 5. III. When I die, I muſt depart not only from ſenſual
delights, but from the more manly Pleaſures of my Studies,
knowledge and converſe with many wiſe and godly men,
and from all my pleaſure in Reading, Hearing, publick and
private Exerciſes of Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I muſt leave my Library,
and turn over thoſe pleaſant Books no more: I muſt no more
come among the Living, nor ſee the faces of my faithful
Friends, nor be ſeen of Man, Houſes and Cities and Fields:
and Countreys, Gardens and Walks, will be nothing as to me.
I ſhall no more hear of the Affairs of the World, of Man or Wars,

            </p>

                  </gap>ners,</hi> yet alas, how low and little are they? How
ſmall is our knowledg in compariſon of our <hi>Ignorance?</hi>
And how little doth the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Learned Doctors</hi>
differ from the thoughts of a <hi>ſilly Child?</hi> For from our
Childhood we take it in but by <hi>drops;</hi> and as trifles
are the <hi>Matter</hi> of childiſh knowledge, ſo <hi>Words,</hi> and
<hi>Notions,</hi> and <hi>artificial Forms</hi> do make up more of the
<hi>Learning</hi> of the World, than is commonly underſtood;
and many ſuch <hi>Learned</hi> men know little more of any
<hi>Great</hi> and <hi>excellent Things</hi> themſelves, than <hi>Ruſticks</hi> that
are contemned by them for their ignorance. God and
the Life to come are little better known by them, if
not much leſs, than by many of the unlearned. What
is it but a Child-game that many Logicians, Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
Grammarians, yea Metaphyſicians, and other
Philoſophers in their eagereſt Studies and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
are exerciſed in? Of how little uſe is it to
know what is contained in many Hundred of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
that fill our Libraries? Yea, or to know many
of the moſt glorious Speculations in Phyſicks, Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which have given ſome the Title of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſi
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59339:62"/>
&amp; Ingenioſi</hi> in theſe times, who have little the more
<hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Virtue</hi> to <hi>Live to God,</hi> or <hi>overcome Temptations</hi>

Man,</hi> to know almoſt any of their Trifles.</p>
            <p>2. Yea, it were well if much of our <hi>Reading</hi> and
<hi>Learning</hi> did us <hi>no harm,</hi> and more than good: I fear
leſt <hi>Books</hi> are to ſome but a more honourable kind of
temptation than <hi>Cards and Dice:</hi> Leſt many a precious
Hour be loſt in them, that ſhould be employed on much
higher matters: And leſt many make ſuch knowledge
but an <hi>unholy, natural,</hi> yea carnal <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> as Worldings
do the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of their <hi>Lands and Honours;</hi> and leſt
they be the more dangerous by how much the <hi>leſs
ſuſpected:</hi> But the beſt is, it is a pleaſure ſo fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed from
the ſloathful with <hi>Thorny labour</hi> of hard and long Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that <hi>lazineſs</hi> ſaveth more from it than <hi>Grace,</hi> and
<hi>holy Wiſdom</hi> doth. But doubtleſs <hi>Fancy</hi> and the <hi>Natural
Intellect</hi> may with as little Sanctity live in the pleaſure
of <hi>Reading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Knowing, Diſputing,</hi> and <hi>Writing,</hi> as others ſpend
their time at a Game at <hi>Cheſs,</hi> or other ingenious ſport.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I know that the Knowledg of
Natural things is valuable, and may be Sanctified;
much more Theological Theory: And when it is ſo,
it is of good uſe; and I have little knowledge which I
find not ſome way uſeful to my higheſt ends. And
if <hi>Wiſhing</hi> or <hi>Money</hi> would procure more, I would
<hi>wiſh</hi> and empty my Purſe for it; but yet if many ſcore
or hundred Books which I have read, had been all <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>read,</hi>
and I had that <hi>time</hi> now to lay out upon <hi>higher
thing,</hi> I ſhould think my ſelf much richer than now I
am. And I muſt earneſtly pray, The Lord forgive
me the Hours that I have ſpent in reading Things leſs
profitable, for the pleaſing of a Mind that would fain
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59339:62"/>
know all, which I ſhould have ſpent for the increaſe of
<hi>Holineſs</hi> in my ſelf and others: And yet I muſt thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
acknowledge to God, that from my youth he
taught me, to begin with things of <hi>greateſt weight,</hi>
and to refer moſt of my other Studies thereto, and to
ſpend my days under the <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Neceſſity and Profit</hi>
to my ſelf, and thoſe with whom <hi>I</hi> had to do. And <hi>I</hi>
now think better of the Courſe of <hi>Paul</hi> that determined
to <hi>know nothing</hi> but a <hi>Crucified Chriſt among</hi> the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
that is, ſo to converſe with them as to <hi>Uſe,</hi>
and <hi>Glorying</hi> as if he knew nothing elſe: And ſo of the
the reſt of the Apoſtles and Primitive Ages: And
though I ſtill love and honour the fulleſt Knowledge
(and am not of Dr. <hi>Collets</hi> mind, who as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith
moſt ſlighted <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) yet I leſs cenſure even that
<hi>Carthage Council</hi> which forbad the reading of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
Books</hi> of <hi>Learning and Arts,</hi> than formerly I have
done. And I would have men <hi>ſavour</hi> moſt that <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in their <hi>Health</hi> which they will or ſhould ſavour
moſt in <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> and near to Death.</p>
            <p>3. And alas how <hi>dear a Vanity</hi> is <hi>this Knowledge!</hi>
That which is but <hi>Theorical</hi> and <hi>Notional</hi> is but a <hi>tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
delectation</hi> of the Phantaſie or Mind, little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from a pleaſant dream: But how many <hi>Hours,</hi> what
<hi>gazing</hi> of the wearied Eye, what <hi>ſtretching Thoughts</hi> of
the <hi>impatient</hi> Brain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt it coſt us, if we will attain
to any <hi>Excellency.</hi> Well ſaith <hi>Solomon, Much reading
is a wearineſs to the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>He that increaſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
increaſeth ſorrow.</hi> How many hundred ſtudious
Days and Weeks, and how many hard and tearing
Thoughts, hath my little, very little knowledg coſt me?
And how much infirmity and painfulneſs to my Fleſh,
increaſe of painful Diſeaſes, and loſs of Bodily eaſe and
health? How much pleaſure to my ſelf of other kinds,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59339:63"/>
and how much <hi>acceptance with men,</hi> have I loſt by it,
which I might eaſily have had in a more Converſant
and plauſible way of life? And when all is done, if I
reach to know any <hi>more than others,</hi> of my <hi>place</hi> and
<hi>order,</hi> I muſt <hi>differ ſo much</hi> (uſually) from them: And
if I <hi>manifeſt</hi> not that <hi>difference,</hi> but <hi>keep</hi> all that <hi>knowledge</hi>
to my <hi>ſelf,</hi> I ſin againſt <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> it
ſelf: The Love of <hi>Man,</hi> and the Love of <hi>Truth</hi> oblige
me to be <hi>ſoberly Communicative:</hi> Were I ſo indifferent
to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Knowledg,</hi> as eaſily to forbear their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation,
I muſt alſo be ſo indifferent to them, as not
to think them worth ſo dear a Price as they have coſt
me (Though they are the free Gifts of God:) As Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is univerſally inclined to the propagation of the
kind by Generation; ſo is the <hi>Intellectual Nature</hi> to the
Communication of Knowledge (which yet hath its
<hi>Luſt,</hi> and <hi>inordinacy</hi> in <hi>proud ignorant haſty Teachers,</hi>
and <hi>Diſputers,</hi> as the Generating faculty hath in <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators</hi>
and <hi>Adulterers.</hi>)</p>
            <p>But if I obey <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> in <hi>Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
that Knowledge which containeth my <hi>difference</hi>
aforeſaid, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> too often take themſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparaged
by it, how peaceably ſoever I manage it: And
as bad men take the <hi>Piety</hi> of the <hi>godly</hi> to be an accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their impiety, ſo many <hi>Teachers</hi> take themſelves
to be accuſed of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> by ſuch as condemn their
<hi>Errours</hi> by the light of Truth? And if you meddle not
with <hi>any Perſon,</hi> yet take they their <hi>Opinions</hi> to be ſo
much their <hi>Intereſt,</hi> as that all that is ſaid againſt them,
they take as ſaid againſt themſelves. And then alas
what envyings, what whiſpering diſparagements, and
what backbitings. if not malicious ſlanders and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minings
do we meet with from the Carnal Clergy: And
O that it were all from them alone, and that among
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59339:63"/>
the Zealous and <hi>Suffering</hi> Party of faithful Preachers,
there were not much of ſuch iniquity, and that none
of them <hi>preached Chriſt in ſtrife and envy:</hi> It is ſad that
Errour ſhould find ſo much ſhelter under the ſelfiſhneſs,
and pride of pious men; and that the Friends of Truth
ſhould be tempted to reject and abuſe ſo much of it in
their ignorance as they do: But the matter of fact is
too evident to be hid.</p>
            <p>But eſpecially, if we meet with a Clergy that are
high, and have a great deal of Worldly intereſt at the
ſtake: Or if they be in Councils and Synods, and have
got the Major Vote, they too eaſily believe that either
their <hi>Grandure, Reverence, Names,</hi> or <hi>Numbers</hi> muſt
give them the reputation of being Orthodox and in the
right, and will Warrant them to account and defame
him as Erroneous, Heretical, Schiſmatical, Singular,
Factious, or Proud, that preſumeth to contradict them,
and to know more than they: Of which not onely the
caſe of <hi>Nazianzene, Martin, Chryſoſtome</hi> are ſad proofs,
but alſo the proceedings of too many General and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Councils. And ſo our hard ſtudies and <hi>darling
Truth</hi> muſt make us as <hi>Owls</hi> or reproached Perſons
among thoſe <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> who are <hi>ignorant</hi> at
<hi>eaſier rates,</hi> and who find it a far <hi>ſofter kind</hi> of life to
think and ſay as the <hi>moſt</hi> or <hi>beſt</hi> eſteemed do, than to
purchaſe reproach and obloquy ſo dearly.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>religious People</hi> of the ſeveral parts, will ſay
as they hear their Teachers do, and be the Militant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of their too Militant Leaders: And it will be
their Houſe talk, their Shop talk, their Street talk, if
not their Church talk, that ſuch a one is an <hi>Erroneous,
dangerous Man,</hi> becauſe he is not as Ignorant and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
as they, eſpecially if they be the followers of a
<hi>Teacher much exaſperated</hi> by <hi>confutation,</hi> and engaged
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59339:64"/>
in the Controverſie; and alſo if it ſhould be <hi>ſuffering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Confeſſors</hi> that are contradicted, or men moſt highly
eſteemed for extraordinary degrees of Piety: Then
what cruel cenſures muſt he expect who never ſo tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would ſuppreſs their Errours.</p>
            <p>O what ſad Inſtances of this are, 1. The Caſe of
the <hi>Confeſſors</hi> in Cyprians <hi>Days,</hi> who as many of his
Epiſtles ſhew, became the great diſturbers of that
Church. 2. And the <hi>Egyptian Monks</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
in the Days of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> who turned <hi>Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites,</hi>
and raiſed abominable Tumults, with woful
ſcandal and odious bloodſhed. 3. And O that <hi>this
Age</hi> had not yet greater Inſtances to prove the matter,
than any of theſe.</p>
            <p>And now ſhould a Man be loth to die, for fears of
leaving ſuch troubleſome coſtly Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as the wiſeſt men can here attain?</p>
            <p>4. But the chief Anſwer is yet behind. No <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is loſt, but perfected,</hi> and changed for much <hi>nobler,
ſweeter, greater Knowledg:</hi> Let men be never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
in particular <hi>de modo, Whether acquired Habits</hi>
of <hi>Intellect and Memory die with us,</hi> as <hi>being dependant
on the Body:</hi> Yet (by what <hi>Manner</hi> ſoever) that a <hi>far
clearer Knowledge</hi> we ſhall have, than is here attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is not to be doubted of. And the ceſſation of our
<hi>preſent Mode</hi> of knowing, is but the ceſſation of our
<hi>ignorance and imperfection:</hi> As our <hi>wakening</hi> endeth a
<hi>dreaming Knowledge,</hi> and our <hi>Maturity</hi> endeth the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
Knowledge of a <hi>Child:</hi> For ſo ſaith the Holy
Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Love never
faileth,</hi> (and we can Love no more than we know:)
But <hi>whether there be Propheſies they ſhall fail:</hi> (that is,
<hi>Ceaſe:) Whether there be Tongues they ſhall ceaſe: Whether
there be Knowledge</hi> (Notional and Abſtractive ſuch as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59339:64"/>
we have now) <hi>it ſhall vaniſh away: When I was a
Child I ſpake as a Child, underſtood as a Child, I thought as
a Child; but when I became a Man, I put away childiſh
things: For now we ſee through a Glaſs (per ſpecies) dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

or Riddle) <hi>but then Face to Face</hi> (even <hi>Creatures

in which ſenſe <hi>Sanchez</hi> truly ſaith, <hi>Nihil ſcitur:) But
then ſhall I know, even as I am known:</hi> (Not a <hi>God

both now and for ever: we ſhall both <hi>know</hi> and be

            <p>If a Phyſician be to deſcribe the parts of Man, and
the latent Diſeaſes of his Patient, he is fain to ſearch
hard, and beſtow many Thoughts of it, beſides his long
reading and converſe to make him capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and when all is done, he goeth much upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
and his knowledge is mixt with many <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,</hi>
yea and <hi>miſtakes;</hi> but when he openeth the
Corps, he ſeeth all, and his knowledg is more <hi>full, more
true,</hi> and more certain, beſides that it is <hi>eaſily,</hi> and
<hi>quickly</hi> attained, even by a <hi>preſent look:</hi> A Countrey
Man knoweth the Town, the Fields, and Rivers
where he dwelleth (yea, and the Plants and Animals)
with eaſe and certain clearneſs; when he that muſt
know the ſame things by the ſtudy of Geographical
Writings and Tables, muſt know them but with a
<hi>General,</hi> an <hi>unſatisfactory,</hi> and oft a much miſtaking
kind of knowledge: Alas, when our preſent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
hath coſt a Man the ſtudy of Forty, or Fifty, or
Sixty Years, how lean and poor, how doubtful and
unſatisfactory is it after all? But when God will <hi>ſhew
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59339:65"/>
us himſelf</hi> and all things, and when Heaven is known
as the Sun by its own Light, this will be the clear, ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
and ſatisfactory knowledge: <hi>Bleſſed are the Pure in
Heart, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5. <hi>And without
Holineſs, none can ſee him,</hi> Heb. 12. 14.) This <hi>ſight</hi>
will be worthy the Name of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> when our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
glympſe is but <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> a love and deſire of
Wiſdom: So far ſhould we be from fearing Death
through the fear of loſing our knowledge, or any of the
means of knowledge, that it ſhould make us rather long
for the World of Glorious Light, that we might get
out of this darkneſs, and know all that with an eaſie
look, to our joy and ſatisfaction, which here we know
with troubleſome doubtings, or not at all. Shall we be
afraid of darkneſs in the Heavenly Light, or of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
when we ſee the Lord of Glory.</p>
            <p>§ 6. And as for the loſs of <hi>Sermons, Books,</hi> and
other means, ſurely it is no loſs to ceaſe the means
when we have attained the end: Cannot we ſpare our
Winter Clothes as troubleſom in the heat of Summer,
and ſit by the hot Fire without our Glores. Cannot
we ſit at home without a Horſe or Coach? Or ſet them
by at our Journeys end? Cannot we lie in Bed without
Boots and Spurs? Is it grievous to us to ceaſe our Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
when we are well: Even here, he is happier that
hath leaſt of the Creature, and <hi>needeth</hi> leaſt, than he
that hath much and needeth much: Becauſe all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
commodities and helps have alſo their diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and troubleſomneſs: And the very <hi>applying</hi> and
<hi>uſing</hi> ſo many remedies of our want; is tedious of itſelf.
And as God only needeth nothing, but is ſelf-ſufficient,
and therefore only perfectly and eſſentially happy, ſo
thoſe are likeſt God that need leaſt from without, and
have the greateſt plenitude of internal goodneſs. What
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59339:65"/>
need we to preach, hear, read, pray, to bring us
to Heaven when we are there?</p>
            <p>§ 7. And as for our <hi>Friends</hi> and our converſe with
them, as Relations, or as <hi>wiſe, religious,</hi> and <hi>faithful
to us,</hi> he that believeth not that there are far <hi>More</hi>
and far <hi>Better</hi> in Heaven than are on Earth, doth not
believe as he ought that there is a Heaven: Our Friends
here are <hi>wiſe,</hi> but they are <hi>unwiſe</hi> alſo: They are
Faithful, but partly unfaithful; they are holy, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
alas too ſinful: They have the Image of God, but
blotted and diſhonoured by their faults: They do God
and his Church much ſervice; but they alſo do too
much againſt him, and too much for Satan, even when
they intend the Honour of God: They promote the
the Goſpel; but they alſo hinder it: Their weakneſs,
ignorance, errour, ſelfiſhneſs, pride, paſſion, diviſion,
contention, ſcandals and remiſneſs, do oft ſo much hurt,
that it is hard to diſcern whether it be not greater than
their good to the Church or to their Neigbours. Our
Friends are our helpers and comforters; but how oft
alſo are they our hinderers, troubles and grief? But
in Heaven they are altogether <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
and <hi>concordant,</hi> and have nothing in them, nor
there done by them, but what is amiable to God and
Man.</p>
            <p>And with our faithful Friends, we have here a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
partly of uſeleſs and burdenſom Perſons, and
partly of unfaithful Hypocrites, and partly of ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
factious Wranglers, and partly of malicious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
underminers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and partly of implacable Enemies:
And how many of all theſe ſet together is there for one
worthy faithful Friend? And how great a number i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
there to trouble you? For one that will indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
you? But in Heaven there are none but the <hi>Wiſe,</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:59339:66"/>
and <hi>Holy:</hi> No Hypocrites, no burdenſom Neighbours,
no treacherous, or oppreſſing or perſecuting Enemies
are there? And is not all <hi>good</hi> and amiable better than
a little <hi>good</hi> with ſo troubleſome a mixture of noiſome
Evils?</p>
            <p>Chriſt loved his Diſciples, his Kindred; yea, and
all Mankind, and took pleaſure in doing good to all;
and ſo did his Apoſtles: But how poor a requital had
he or they from any but from God? Chriſt's own
Brethren believed not in him, but wrangled with him;
almoſt like thoſe that ſaid to him on the Croſs, If thou
be the Son of God, come down and we will believe.
<hi>Peter</hi> himſelf was once a Satan to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.
and after with Curſing and Swearing denied him: And
all his Diſciples forſook him and fled: And what then
from others could be expected?</p>
            <p>No Friends have a perfect ſuitableneſs to each other:
and roughneſs and inequalities that are neareſt us are
moſt troubleſom. The wonderful variety and contrariety
of apprehenſions, intereſt, educations, temperaments, and
occaſions, and temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſuch that whileſt we
are ſcandalized at the diſcord &amp; confuſions of the World,
we muſt recal our ſelves and admire that all ruling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
which keepeth up ſo much order and concord
as there is: We are indeed like People in crowded
Streets, who going ſeveral ways moleſt each other with
their joſtling oppoſitions: Or like Boys at Foot-ball
ſtriving to overthrow each other for the Ball: But it is a
wonder of Divine Power and Wiſdom that all the
World is not continually in mortal War.</p>
            <p>If I do men no harm, yet if I do but croſs their <hi>Wills,</hi> it
goeth for a provoking injury: And when there are as
many <hi>Wills</hi> as <hi>Perſons,</hi> who is it that can pleaſe them
all: Who hath <hi>Money</hi> enough to pleaſe all the Poor
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59339:66"/>
that need it, or the Covetous that deſire it. Or who
can live with diſpleaſed men, and not feel ſome of the
fruits of their diſpleaſure? What day goeth over my
Head in which abundance deſire not or expect not
impoſſibilities from me? And how great is the number
of them that expect unrighteous things? By nothing
do I diſpleaſe ſo many as by not diſpleaſing God and my
Conſcience. And for nothing am ſo deeply accuſed of
ſin as for not ſinning: And the World will not think
well of any thing that croſſeth their Opinion and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
intereſt, be it never ſo conform to God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
I muſt confeſs that while I ſuffer from all ſides,
few men have more common and open Praiſes from their
Perſecutors than I: But while they praiſe me in the
general, and for other particulars, they aggravate my
Non-conformity to their <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Wills,</hi> and take
me to be ſo much the more hurtful to them. The
greateſt Crimes that have been charged on me,
have been for the things which I thought to be my
greateſt duties; and for thoſe parts of my obedience to
my Conſcience and God, which coſt me deareſt: And
where I pleaſed my Fleſh leaſt, I pleaſed the World
leaſt. At how cheap a rate to my Fleſh could I have
got the Applauſe of factious men, if that had been my
end and buſineſs? Would I have conformed to their
<hi>Wills,</hi> and taken a Biſhoprick, and the Honour and
Riches of the World, how good a Man had I been
called by the Dioceſan party? And O what praiſe I
ſhould have with the Papiſts, could I turn Papiſt! And
all the backbitings and bitter Cenſures of the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,
Anabaptiſts and Separatiſts, had been turned
into praiſe, could I have ſaid as they, or not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
them. But otherwiſe there is no eſcaping
their accuſations. And is this tumultuous, militant,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59339:67"/>
yea, malignant World, a place that I ſhould be loth
to leave?</p>
            <p>Alas, our darkneſs, and weakneſs, and paſſions are ſuch,
that it's hard for a Family or a few faithful Friends,
to live ſo evenly in the exerciſe of Love, as not to have
oft unpleaſant Jars! What then is to be expected from
Strangers and from Enemies? Ten thouſand Perſons
will judge of abundance of my <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> who
never knew the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of them: Every ones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
are as the report and conveyance of the
matter to them is: And while they have a various Light,
and falſe Reports (and defectiveneſs will make them
falſe) what can be expected but falſe injurious Cenſures?</p>
            <p>§ 8. And though no outward thing on Earth is more
precious than the Holy Word, and Worſhip, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of God, yet even here I ſee that which point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me up higher, and telleth me it is much better to be
with Chriſt. 1. Shall I love the Name of Heaven, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Heaven itſelf? The Holy Scriptures are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
becauſe I have there the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Glory; but
is not the Poſſeſſion better than the Promiſe? If a Light
and Guide thither through this Wilderneſs be good,
ſurely the <hi>End</hi> muſt needs be better! And it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God that all things on Earth, and therefore even
the Sacred Scriptures, ſhould bear the Marks of our
ſtate of imperfection: Imperfect Perſons were the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and imperfect humane Language is the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſignal, organical part of the matter. And the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and Phraſe (though true and blameleſs) are far
ſhort of the heavenly Perfection. Elſe ſo many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators
had not found ſo hard a task of it to expound
innumerable difficulties, and reconcile ſo many ſeeming
contradictions, nor would Infidels find matter of ſo
ſtrong temptation, and ſo much cavil as they do; nor
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59339:67"/>
would <hi>Peter</hi> have told us of the difficulties of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and ſuch occaſions of mens wreſting them to their
own deſtruction. Heaven will not be made to perfect
Spirits, the occaſion of ſo many Errors, and Controverſies,
and quarrels as the Scriptures are to us imperfect men on
Earth. Yea Heaven is the more deſirable, becauſe there I
ſhall better underſtand the Scriptures, than here I can ever
hope to do. All the hard paſſages now miſunderſtood,
will there be made plain, and all the ſeeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
reconciled; and which is much more, that
God, that Chriſt, that New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that Glory,
and that Felicity of Souls, which are now known but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
darkly and enigmatically in the Glaſs, will then be
known intuitively as we ſee the Face itſelf, whoſe
Image only the Glaſs firſt ſhewed us. To leave my Bible,
and go to the God, and the Heaven that is revealed, will
be no otherwiſe a loſs to me, than to lay by my Crutches
or Spectacles when I need them not, or to leave his Image
for the preſence of my Friend.</p>
            <p>2. Much leſs do I need to fear the loſs of all other
Books, or Sermons, or other Verbal informations.
Much reading hath oft been a wearineſs to my Fleſh;
and the pleaſure of my Mind is much abated by the
great imperfection of the means. Many Books muſt
be partly read, that I may know that they are ſcarce
worth the reading: And many muſt be read to enable
us to ſatisfie other mens expectations, and to confute
thoſe who abuſe the authority of the Authors againſt
the Truth: And many good Books muſt be read, that
have little to add, to what we have read in many others
before; and many that are blotted with enſnaring Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
Which if we detect not, we leave ſnares for
ſuch as ſee them not: And if we detect them (never
ſo tenderly, if truly) we are taken to be injurious to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59339:68"/>
the Honour of the Learned godly Authors, and proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to overvalue our own conceipts. And ſo lamentable
is the Caſe of all Mankind, by the imperfections of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Language, that thoſe Words which are invented
for communication of conceptions, are ſo little fitted to
their uſe, as rather to occaſion miſunderſtandings
and contentions: There being ſcarce a Word that hath
not <hi>many ſignifications,</hi> and that needeth not <hi>many more
words</hi> to bring us to the true notice of the ſpeakers
Mind: And when every word is a <hi>Signum</hi> that hath
three relations, 1. To the <hi>Matter ſpoken of.</hi> 2. To
the <hi>Mind</hi> of the <hi>Speaker</hi> as ſignifying his conceptions of
that matter. 3. And to the <hi>Mind</hi> of the <hi>Hearer</hi> or <hi>Reader</hi>
which is to be informed by it, it is ſo hard to find and
uſe <hi>words</hi> that are fitted <hi>indeed</hi> to all theſe uſes, and to
have ſtore of ſuch, and mix no other, that few if any
in the World were ever ſo happy as to attain it. 1. And
if words be not <hi>fitted</hi> to the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Things,</hi> they are
<hi>falſe</hi> as to their firſt and proper uſe: And yet the <hi>penury</hi>
of <hi>apt words,</hi> and the <hi>redundancy</hi> of others, and the
<hi>Authority</hi> of the Maſters of Sciences impoſing <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Terms</hi> and <hi>Notions</hi> on their Diſciples, and the
Cuſtom of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> who have the Empire as to the
fenſe of Words, have all conſpired to make words <hi>inept,</hi>
and of very uncertain ſignification. So that when Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
have learnt <hi>words</hi> by long and hard Studies, they
are oft little the nearer the true knowledg of the <hi>Things;</hi>
and too oft by their ineptitude miſled to falſe concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And ſo their ſaying is too often true, that a <hi>great
Book</hi> is a <hi>great Evil,</hi> while it containeth ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of uncertain words, which become the matter of
great contentions.</p>
            <p>2. And when the <hi>Mind</hi> of the <hi>Speaker</hi> or <hi>Writer</hi> is
no better informed by ſuch Notions, but his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59339:68"/>
of Things are ſome falſe, ſome confuſed and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
what wonder if his words do no otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
his mind to others: When even men of cleareſt
underſtanding find it difficult to have words ſtill ready
to communicate their conceptions with truth and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
To form true ſentiments of <hi>Things</hi> into apt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
words, is a matter of meer Art, and requireth
an apt Teacher, &amp; a ſerious Learner, and long uſe: (And
too many take their <hi>Art of Speaking</hi> in <hi>Prayer, Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
or Preaching,</hi> to have more in it of Wiſdom, and
Piety, than it hath; and ſome too much Condemn the
unaccuſtomed that want it.)</p>
            <p>3. And if we could fit our <hi>words</hi> well to the <hi>Matter</hi>
and to <hi>our Minds</hi> (with that double verity) yet ſtill it
is hard to fit them to the Reader or Hearer: For want
of which they are loſt as to him: And his information
being <hi>our End,</hi> they are therefore ſo far loſt to us. And
that which is ſpoken moſt <hi>congruouſly</hi> to the <hi>Matter,</hi> is
ſeldom fitted to the capacity of the <hi>receiver.</hi> And <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur
ad modum recipient is, &amp; pro captu Lectoris, &amp;c.</hi>
Some Readers or Hearers (yea, almoſt all) are ſo uſed
to unapt Words and Notions, obtruded on Mankind
by the Maſters of Words, that they cannot underſtand
us if we change their terms and offer them fitter, and
yet leaſt underſtand thoſe which they think that they
beſt underſtand: And all men muſt have long time to
learn the <hi>Art of Words,</hi> before they can <hi>underſtand</hi>
them, as well as before they can readily <hi>uſe</hi> them. And
the duller any Man is, and of leſs underſtanding,
<hi>the more Words are neceſſary</hi> to make him underſtand:
And yet his <hi>Memory</hi> is the leſs capable of retaining
many. This is our difficulty not only in Catechizing,
but in all our Writings and Teaching, a ſhort <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,</hi>
or a ſhort <hi>Style,</hi> the ignorant underſtand not;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59339:69"/>
and a long one they remember not. And he that will
accommodate one judicious Reader or Hearer, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
matter or an accurate Style, muſt incommodate
Multitudes that are uncapable of it. And therefore
ſuch muſt be content with few approvers, and leave
the Applauſe of the Multitude to the more popular,
unleſs he be one that can ſeaſonably ſuit himſelf to both.</p>
            <p>A Man that reſolveth not to be deceived by ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
words, and maketh it his firſt work in all his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and diſputings to difference between <hi>Words,</hi> and <hi>Senſe,</hi>
and <hi>Things,</hi> and ſtrictly to examine each diſputed term,
till the Speakers meaning be diſtinctly known, will ſee the
lamentable caſe of the Church, and all Mankind, and
what ſhaddows of knowledg deceive the World, and
in what uſeleſs dreams the greateſt part of men, yea of
Learned men do ſpend their days: Much of that which
ſome men unweariedly ſtudy, and take to be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their underſtandings, and their lives, and much
of that which Multitudes place their Piety and Hopes
of Salvation in, being a meer <hi>game at words,</hi> and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Notions; and as truly to be called <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
as is the reſt of the <hi>Vain ſhew</hi> that moſt men walk
in. My ſad and bitter Thoughts of the Heathen, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel,
Mahomet World, and of the common corruptions
of Rulers and Teachers, Cities and Countries, Senates
and Councils, I will not here open to others, leſt they
offend; nor cry out as <hi>Seneca, Omnes mali ſumus,</hi> or
<hi>ſtultorum plena ſunt omnia,</hi> nor deſcribe the furious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Clergy, and their ignorance, and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Calumnies and Schiſms, as <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi>
and others do, nor voluminouſly lament the ſeeming
hopeleſs caſe of Earth, by the boldneſs, blindneſs, and
fury of men that make uſe of ſuch ſad conſiderations, to
looſen my love from ſuch a World, and make me will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:59339:69"/>
9. And if other mens <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Writings</hi> are ble
miſhed with ſo much imperfection, why ſhould
think that my own are blameleſs? I muſt for ever be
thankful for the holy <hi>Inſtructions</hi> and <hi>Writings</hi> of others,
notwithſtanding humane frailty, and contentious mens
abuſe of words: And ſo I muſt be thankful
that God hath made any uſe of my own, for the
good of Souls, and his Churches Edification. But
with how many allays are ſuch comforts here mixed?
We are not the Teachers of a well ruled School, where
Learners are ranked into ſeveral Forms, that every one
may have the teaching which is agreeable to his capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
But we muſt ſet open the Door to all that will
crowd in, and publiſh our Writings to all ſorts of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
And there being as <hi>various degrees</hi> of <hi>Capacity</hi> as
there are Men, and Women, and conſequently great
<hi>variety</hi> and <hi>contrariety</hi> of apprehenſions, it's eaſie <hi>ab an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedente</hi>
to know what various reception we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect:
We caſt out our Doctrine almoſt as a Foot-ball is
turned out among Boys in the Street, in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations:
Few underſtand it, but every one cenſureth
it. Few come as Learners or teachable Diſciples, but
moſt come to ſit as Judges on their Teachers words:
and yet have neither the <hi>Skill,</hi> or the <hi>Patience,</hi>
or the <hi>diligence</hi> which is neceſſary in a juſt Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
to a righteous judgment. But as our <hi>words
agree</hi> or <hi>diſagree</hi> with the former conceptions of every
Hearer, ſo are they judged to be wiſe or fooliſh, ſound
or unſound, true or falſe, fit or unfit. Few Sermons
that I preach but one extolleth them, and wiſheth they
were printed, and another accuſeth them of ſome hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
fault: Some men are pleaſed with clearneſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatneſs
of Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others account it <hi>too high,</hi>
and ſay we ſhoot over the hearers Heads, and like nothing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59339:70"/>
but the fervent Application of what they knew before
moſt Hearers are diſpleaſed with that which they moſt
need: If they err, they reproach that Doctrin as erroneous
that would cure them: If they are guilty of any prevailing
Diſtemper and ſin, they take that Application to be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to them, which would convince them, and ſave
them from that guilt. Moſt are much pleaſed with
plain and zealous reproof of ſin; but it muſt be other
mens ſins, and not their own. The poor love to hear
of the evil of oppreſſion and unmercifulneſs, of Pride,
Fulneſs and Idleneſs, and all the ſins of the Rich: Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
love to hear of their Rulers faults, and ſay, O this
Man is no flatterer; he dares tell the greateſt of their
ſins: But if they hear of their own, they take for it an
injury. Rulers like a Sermon for ſubmiſſion and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
but how few love to hear of the evil of injuſtice
and oppreſſion, or pride, and ſenſuality, or to read,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. or 12. or <hi>James</hi> 5. or to hear of the neceſſity
of Holineſs, Juſtice and temperance, and of Death, and
Judgment and the Life to come. Every Sectary and
Dogmatiſt delighteth to have his own Opinion cryed
up, and his Party praiſed as the chiefeſt Saints: But
all that tendeth to the praiſe of thoſe that he diſſenteth
from, and accounteth adverſaries to the Truth, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtful
to him, as a complying with iniquity, and a
ſtrengthning of the Enemies of Chriſt: And all that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs
which he expecteth from us againſt
others, is as much expected by others, as againſt him
and ſuch as he.</p>
            <p>This Day while I am writing theſe words, my Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
are too full of Letters ſent me, on one ſide impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
charging it on me as my duty to conform (to
the Oaths, Declarations, Covenants and Practiſes, now
impoſed) or elſe to give over preaching (which would
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59339:70"/>
pleaſe them;) and on the other ſide vehemently cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
me as guilty of grievous ſin, for declaring my
judgment for ſo much of Conformity as I have done;
and charging me by Predictions as guilty of the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of all that are otherwiſe minded, for communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the Sacrament, and the common Prayers of the
Church; and others in the mid way, perſuading me
equally to bear my Teſtimony againſt unjuſt <hi>Separation</hi>
and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and to endeavour ſtill if poſſible to ſave
a ſelf deſtroying People, from the tearing fury of theſe
two extreams: And how ſhould I anſwer theſe contrary
expectations, or eſcape the Cenſures of ſuch expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctants?</p>
            <p>And it hath pleaſed God, who Thirty Years and
more hath tryed me by humane Applauſe, of late in this
City (where multitudes of Perſons of contrary Minds
are like Paſſengers in crowded Streets, ſtill joſtling
and offending one another) to exerciſe me with mens
daily backbitings and cavils: And ſo many have choſen
me for the ſubject of their Diſcourſe, that I may ſay as
<hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c. [We are made a Spectacle</hi>
(or Theatre) <hi>to the World,</hi> and <hi>to Angels,</hi> and <hi>to men:
We are Fools for Chriſts ſake, but ye are wiſe in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.]
Did I not live out of the noiſe in retirement, and taken
up with pain and expectations of my change, what an
annoyance to me would it be to hear Religious Perſons
that have a God, a Chriſt, a Heaven to talk of, to abuſe
their Time and Tongues in ſo much talking of one ſo
inconſiderable, and that hath ſo little to do with them,
or they with him; while with ſome overvaluing me
and others ſtill quarrelling, I am the matter of their
idle ſinful talk. The Perſecutors for divers Years after
firſt ſilencing (if not ſtill) and the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> for two or
three Years laſt paſt, have been poſſeſſed with ſo ſtrange
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59339:71"/>
a jealouſie and quarrelſom a diſpoſition againſt me, that
they ſeem to take it for <hi>their Interest</hi> to promote my
defamation? and for much of their work to ſearch what
may afford them any matter of accuſation in every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
that I preach, and every Book that I write. And
though the <hi>fury</hi> of the <hi>Perſecutors</hi> be ſuch as maketh
them much uncapable of ſuch <hi>converſe</hi> and <hi>ſober conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
as is needful to their true information and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
yet moſt of the more <hi>Religious Cavillers</hi> are
ſatisfied as ſoon as I have ſpoken with them, and all
endeth in a <hi>putarem</hi> or <hi>non putarem:</hi> For want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curateneſs
and patience, they judge raſhly before they
underſtand, and when they underſtand confeſs their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
and yet many go on and take no warning after
many times conviction of their miſtake. Even in Books
that are ſtill before their Eyes (as well as in tranſient
words in Sermons) they heedleſly leave out, or put in,
or alter, and miſreport plain words, and with confidence
affirm thoſe things to have been ſaid that never were ſaid,
but perhaps the contrary. And when all People will judg
of the good or evil of our words as they think we have
Reaſon to uſe them or forbear them, how can we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
men that are out of our hearing, and to whom we
cannot tell our Reaſons: Moſt men are of private narrow
obſervation, &amp; judge of the good or hurt that our words
do, by thoſe that they <hi>themſelves</hi> converſe with: And
when I convince them that my deciſions of many queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(which they are offended at) are <hi>true,</hi> they ſay, It is an
<hi>unſeaſonable</hi> and a <hi>hurtful truth:</hi> and when I have called
them to look further abroad in the World, and told them
my Reaſons; they ſay, <hi>Had theſe been all ſet down, men
would have been ſatisfied.</hi>] And on how hard <hi>terms</hi> do
we inſtruct ſuch Perſons whoſe narrow underſtandings
cannot know obvious Reaſons of what we ſay till they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59339:71"/>
are particularly told them? And ſo to tell men the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of all that ſuch can quarrel with, will make every
Book to ſwell with Commentaries to ſuch a bigneſs as
they can neither buy nor read: And they come not
to us to know our Reaſons; nor have we leiſure to
open them to every ſingle Perſon: And thus
ſuſpicious men, when their underſtandings want
the humbling acquaintance with their ignorance
and their Conſciences that tenderneſs which ſhould
reſtrain them from raſh judging, go on to accuſe ſuch
needful Truths of which they know not the uſe and
reaſon. And what Man living hath the leiſure and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to acquaint all the ignorant Perſons in City
and Countrey with all the Reaſons of all that he ſhall
ſay, write or do? Or who that writeth not a Page inſtead
of a Sentence, can ſo write that every unprepared Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſhall underſtand him: And what hopes hath that
Tutor or School-maſter of preſerving his reputation,
who ſhall be accounted erroneous and accuſed of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound
or injurious Doctrine, by every Schollar that
underſtandeth not his words, and all the reaſons of them?</p>
            <p>But God in great Mercy to me hath made this my
Lot (not cauſing but permitting the ſins of the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious)
that I might before death be better weaned from
all below: Had my temptations from inordinate Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
had no allay, they might have been more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
ſtrong. Even yet while Church-Dividers on
both extreams do make me the Object of their daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy,
the continued reſpects of the ſober and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
are ſo great as to be a temptation ſtrong enough,
to ſo weak a Perſon, to give a check to my deſires to
leave the World. It is long ſince Riches and worldly
Honour appeared to me as they are, as not rendring
the World much lovely or deſireable. But the Love
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59339:72"/>
and Concord of Religious Perſons hath a more amiable
Aſpect: There is ſo much Holineſs in theſe, that I was
loth to call them Vanity and Vexation: But yet as
Fleſh and Blood would refer them to ſelfiſh Ends, and
any way value them as a Carnal intereſt, I muſt ſo call
them, and number them with the things that are <hi>Loſs</hi>
and <hi>Dung, Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8. Selfiſhneſs can ſerve itſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
things good and holy: And if good men, and good
Books, and good Sermons would make the World
ſeem overlovely to us, it will be a Mercy of God to
abate the temptation: And if my Soul looking toward
the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> be hindred as <hi>Paul</hi> was in his
Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem, Act.</hi> 20. &amp; 21. by the Love of
ancient Friends and Hearers, I muſt ſay, <hi>What mean
you to weep and break my Heart! I am ready</hi> to leave
the deareſt Friends on Earth, and life, and all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of life, for the preſence of far better Friends with
Chriſt, and the ſweeter pleaſures of a better life. That lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
amiableneſs which is in things below, is in <hi>godly men</hi>
as life in the Heart, which dieth laſt: When that's all gone,
when we are dead to the <hi>Love of the godly themſelves,</hi>
and to <hi>Learning, Books,</hi> and mediate Ordinances, ſo far as
they ſerve a ſelfiſh intereſt, and tempt down our Hearts
from heavenly aſpirings, the World then is Crucified
to us indeed, and we to it: I rejoice to tread in the
Footſteps of my Lord, who had ſome indeed weeping
about his croſs, but was forſaken by all his Diſciples,
while in the Hour of Temptation they all fled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
is far leſs, for it is leſs that I am fit to bear. If God
will juſtifie, who ſhall condemn? If he be for me, who
ſhall be againſt me? O may I not be put to that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
caſe, to cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt
thou forſaken me?</hi> And may nothing ſeparate me from
his Love! And then were I forſaken of the <hi>ſober</hi> and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59339:72"/>
               <hi>peaceable,</hi> as I am in part of ſome <hi>quarrelſom Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
how tolerable a tryal would it be? Man is as duſt
in the Ballance, that addeth little to it, and ſignifieth
nothing when God is in the other end. But I ſuſpect
ſtill that I make too much account of Man, when this
caſe hath taken up too much of my obſervation.</p>
            <p>1. And of all things ſurely a departing Soul hath
leaſt cauſe to fear, the loſing of its <hi>notice</hi> of the <hi>Affairs
of the World?</hi> Of Peace or Wars, or Church, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
For, 1. If the Sun can ſend forth its material
Beams, and operate by motion, light, and heat, at
ſuch a diſtance as this Earth, why ſhould I think that
bleſſed Spirits are ſuch local, confined and impotent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
as not to have notice of the things of Earth?
Had I but bodily Eyes I could ſee more from the top
of a Tower or Hill, than any one that is below can do.
And ſhall I know leſs of Earth from Heaven than I do
now? It's unlike that my Capacity will be ſo little: And
if it were, it is unlike that Chriſts and all the Angels will
be ſo ſtrange to me, as to give me no notice of things
that ſo much concern my God and my Redeemer (to
whom I am united) and the Holy Society of which I
am a part, and my ſelf as a Member of Chriſt and that
Society! I do not think that the Communion of the
Celeſtial Inhabitants is ſo narrow and ſlow, as it is of
walking Clods of Earth, and of Souls that are confined
to ſuch dark Lanthorns as this Body is? Stars can ſhine
one to another. And we on Earth can ſee them ſo far
off in their Heaven: And ſure then if they have a ſeeing
faculty each of them can ſee many of us; even the
Kingdoms of the World. Spirits are moſt active, and
of powerful and quick communication. They need not
ſend Letters, or write Books to one another, nor lift up a
voice to make each other hear: Nor is there any unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59339:73"/>
diviſion, or unſociable ſelfiſhneſs among them, which
may cauſe them to conceal their notices or their joys:
But as <hi>Activity, ſo Unity is Greateſt,</hi> where there is moſt
Perfection: They will ſo be <hi>Many,</hi> as yet to be <hi>One;</hi> and
their <hi>Knowledge</hi> will be <hi>One Knowledge,</hi> and their <hi>Love
One Love,</hi> and their <hi>Joy One Joy:</hi> Not by ſo perfect a
Unity as in <hi>God</hi> himſelf, who is <hi>One</hi> and <hi>but One;</hi> but
ſuch as is ſuitable to created imperfection, which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
of the Perfection of the Creator, as the <hi>Effect</hi>
doth of the virtue of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and therefore hath
ſome participation of <hi>his Unity.</hi> (O fooliſh Soul! if I
ſhall fear this Unity with <hi>God, Chriſt,</hi> and all <hi>the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
leſt I ſhould loſe my preſent ſeparate Individuation,
when <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> are ſo near akin.) In a word
I have no cauſe to think that my Celeſtial advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be a diminution of any deſirable Knowledge
even of things on Earth; but contrarily that it will be
unconceivably increaſed.</p>
            <p>2. But if indeed I ſhall know leſs of things below, it
will be becauſe that the knowledge of them is a part of
<hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation,</hi> which hath no place in Heaven.
So much knowledge of good and evil in lower matters,
as came to us by ſin, is <hi>unworthy</hi> of our fond tenaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and fear of loſing it? Surely the ſad tidings which
we have Weekly in our News Books, our lamentable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
of Heathen and Infidel Kingdoms of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading
prevalency of Barbarouſneſs, Idolatry, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Infidelity; of the rage and ſucceſs of cruel
Tyrants; of the bloody Wars of proud, unquiet world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, of the miſery of the oppreſſed deſolate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
the diſſipated Churches, the perſecuted innocent
Chriſtians, are no ſuch pleaſing things as that we
ſhould be afraid to hear of ſuch no more. To know or
hear of the poor in Famine, the rich in Folly, the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59339:73"/>
Church diſtracted, the Kingdom diſcontented; the godly
ſcandalous by the effects of their Errours, imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and diviſions, the wicked outrageous and waxing
worſe, the falſeneſs or miſcarriages or ſufferings of
Friends, the fury or ſucceſs of Enemies, is this an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
which I cannot ſpare? What is the daily
tidings that I hear but of bloody Wars, the undone
Countreys, the perſecuted Churches, the ſilenced, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
or impriſoned Preachers, of the beſt removed in
judgment from an unworthy World by Death, and
worſe ſucceeding in their rooms, of the renewed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
and endeavours of the Churches Enemies; the
implacable rage of the worldly and unquiet Clergy,
and the new diviſions of ſelf-conceited Sectaries, and
the obloquy and backbitings of each Party againſt the
other? How oft hear I the ſad tidings of this Friends
ſickneſs or Death, and that Friends diſcontent, and of
anothers fall, and of many, very many's Sufferings?
My Ears are daily filled with the cryes of the poor
whom I cannot relieve, with the endleſs complaints of
fearful Melancholy deſpairing Perſons; with the
wranglings of the ignorant and proud Profeſſors, and
contentious Divines, who cenſure moſt boldly where
they are moſt Erroneous or dark: Or with the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
diſcontents of thoſe that I converſe with: And
ſhould I be afraid of the ending of ſo ſad a Tragedy,
or of awaking out of ſuch an unpleaſant dream. Have
I not many times thought of the Priviledge of the deaf,
that hear not theſe troubleſom and provoking things;
<hi>and of the Blind</hi> that ſee not the <hi>Vanities</hi> and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this World: It is one part of the benefit of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
or a private life and habitation, to free me from
<hi>many</hi> of theſe unpleaſing Objects; and a great part of
the benefit of ſleep, that with my Cloaths I may lay by
theſe troubleous Thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:59339:74"/>
§ 11. <hi>But other men tell me,</hi> The Church cannot yet
ſpare you: There is yet this and that neceſſary work to be
done: There is this and that need, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, 1. <hi>Is it we or God that muſt chooſe his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and cut out their work? Whoſe work am I doing?
Is it my own, or his?</hi> If <hi>his,</hi> is it not he that muſt tell
me <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>how long?</hi> And will not his will
and <hi>choice be beſt?</hi> If I be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>eve not this, how do I take
him for my God? Doth God or I know better <hi>what he</hi>
hath yet to do? And who is fitteſt to do it? The
Churches Service and benefits muſt be meaſured out
by our <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Benefactor,</hi> and not by our
ſelves.</p>
            <p>2. What am I to thoſe more excellent Perſons whom
in all Ages he hath taken out of the World? And
would mens Thoughts of the Churches needs detain
them? The poor Heathen, Infidel, Mahometane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have <hi>no Preachers</hi> of the Goſpel? And if their
need prove not that God will ſend them ſuch, no
Countreys <hi>need</hi> will prove that God will continue them
ſuch. Many more <hi>uſeful</hi> Servants of Chriſt have
died in their youth: <hi>John Janeway</hi> preached but one
Sermon: <hi>Joſeph Allen</hi> (and many another excellent
Men) died young in the midſt of his vigorous ſucceſsful
labours: Both of them far more fit for God's work and
likely to win Souls, and glorifie God, than I am or
ever was (However their greater Light was partly
kindled from my leſſer.) Yet did both theſe under pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
conſuming languiſhings of the Fleſh, die as they
had long lived in the <hi>lively triumphant Praiſes of their
Redeemer, and joyful deſires and hopes of Glory?</hi> And
ſhall I at Sixty ſeven Years of Age, after ſuch a life of
unſpeakable Mercies, and after almoſt Forty four Years
of comfortable help in the Service of my Lord,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59339:74"/>
be now afraid of my reward, and ſhrink at the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Death, and ſtill be deſiring to ſtay here, upon
pretence of <hi>further ſervice:</hi> We know not what is beſt
for the Church as God doth: The Church and the
World are not Ours, but his: not our deſires, but his
<hi>will,</hi> muſt meaſure out its Mercies: We are not ſo <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
as <hi>he is:</hi> It is not unmeet for us to <hi>deſire</hi> many things
which God will not <hi>give,</hi> nor ſeeth it <hi>meet</hi> to grant
the particulars of ſuch deſires. Nothing ever lay ſo
heavy on my Heart as the ſin and miſery of Mankind,
and to think how much of the World lyeth in folly
and wickedneſs? And for what can I pray ſo heartily
as for the Worlds recovery: And it is his will that I
ſhould ſhew a <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Univerſal Love</hi> by praying,
<hi>Let thy Name be hallowed, Thy Kingdom come,</hi> and
<hi>Thy will be done on Earth as it is done in Heaven:</hi> And
yet alas, how unlike is <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and what Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
Sin, Confuſions and Cruelties here reign
and proſper? And unleſs there be a wonderful change
to be expected, even as by a general Miracle, how little
hope appeareth that ever theſe Prayers ſhould be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the things? It maketh us <hi>better</hi> to deſire that others
may be better: But God is the free diſpoſer of his own
gifts: And it ſeemeth to be his <hi>will,</hi> that the permitted
Ignorance and Confuſions of this World, ſhould help us
the more to value, and deſire that World of Light, Love
and Order, which he calleth us to prefer and hope for.</p>
            <p>And if I am any way <hi>uſeful</hi> to the World, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved
Mercy that hath made me ſo; for which I muſt
be thankful: But <hi>How long</hi> I ſhall be ſo is not my
buſineſs to determine, but my Lords. My many ſweet
and beautiful Flowers ariſe and appear in their beauty
and ſweetneſs, but for one Summers time, and they
murmur not that they flouriſh for ſo ſhort a ſpace. The
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59339:75"/>
Beaſts, and Birds, and Fiſhes, which I feed on, do
live till I will have them die: And as God will be
ſerved and pleaſed by wonderful variety at once (of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
and Vegetables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) So will he by many
ſucceſſive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Generations: If one Flower fall or die, it
ſufficeth that others ſhall Summer after Summer ariſe
from the ſame root: And if my Pears, Apples,
Plums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fall or ſerve me when they are ripe, it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
that (not they, but) others the next Year ſhall
do the ſame; God will have other Generations to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
us: Let us think him that we have had our time:
And could we overcome the Grand (too little obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
Crime of SELFISHNESS, and could <hi>Love others</hi>
as <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>God as God</hi> above all the World, it
would comfort us at Death, that <hi>others</hi> ſhall <hi>ſurvive us,</hi>
and the <hi>World ſhall continue,</hi> and God will be ſtill God,
and be glorified in his works: And Love will ſay, I
ſhall live in my ſucceſſors, and I ſhall more than Live
in the Life of the World; and yet moſt of all in the
eternal Life and Glory of God.</p>
            <p>And God, (who made us not gods but poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as it pleaſed him) doth know beſt our meaſures:
And he will not try us with too long a Life of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
leſt we ſhould grow too familiar where we
ſhould be Strangers, and utterly Strangers to our home:
No wonder if that World was ready for a deluge, by a
deluge of ſin, in which men lived to Six, Seven, Eight and
Nine hundred Years of Age: Had our Great Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
any hope of ſo long a life, they were like to be
like incarnate Devils, and there would be no dwelling
near them for the Holy Seed? If Angels were among
them, they would like the <hi>Sod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mites</hi> ſeek furiouſly to
abuſe them.</p>
            <p>Nor will God tire us out with too long a life of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59339:75"/>
earthly ſufferings: We think ſhort cares, and fears, and
ſorrows, perſecutions, ſickneſs, and croſſes to be long:
And ſhall we grudge at the Wiſdom and Love which
ſhortneth them. Yea, though holy duty it ſelf be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and ſweet, yet the weakneſs of the Fleſh maketh
us liable to wearineſs, and abateth the willingneſs of
the Spirit: And our wiſe and merciful God will not
make our warfare or our race too long, leſt we be
wearied and faint, and fall ſhort of the prize. By our
wearineſs, and complaints, and fears and groans, one
would think that we thought this life too long, and yet
when we ſhould yield to the call of God, we draw back
as if we would have it everlaſting.</p>
            <p>§ 12. Willingly ſubmit then O my Soul: It is not
thou, but this Fleſh that muſt be diſſolved; this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom,
vile and corruptible Fleſh: It is but the other
half thy meat and drink, which thy preſence kept
longer uncorrupted, going after the excremental part.
Thou dieſt not when Man (the <hi>compoſitum</hi>) dieth, by
thy departure. And as thou liveſt not to thy ſelf, I die
not to my ſelf; whether I live or die, I am the Lords:
He that ſet up the Candle, knoweth how long he hath
uſe for the light of it. Study thy duty, and work
while it is Day, and let God chooſe thy time, and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
ſtand to his diſpoſal. The Goſpel dieth not
when I die: The Church dieth not: The Praiſes of God
die not; the World dieth not: And perhaps it ſhall grow
better, and thoſe Prayers ſhall be anſwered which ſeemed
loſt: Yea, &amp; it may be ſome of the Seed that I have ſowen,
ſhall ſpring up to ſome benefit of the dark unpeaceable
World when I am dead. And is not this much of the end
of life? &amp; is not that Life <hi>good,</hi> which attaineth its End? If
my <hi>End</hi> was to do <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Glorifie God,</hi> if <hi>Good</hi> be <hi>done,</hi>
and <hi>God</hi> be <hi>Glorified,</hi> when I am dead, yea though I were
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59339:76"/>
annihilated, is not my <hi>End</hi> attained: Feign not thy ſelf
to be <hi>God,</hi> whoſe Intereſt (that is, the pleaſing of his
<hi>Will</hi>) is the <hi>End</hi> of all things: And whoſe <hi>will</hi> is the
<hi>meaſure</hi> of all <hi>Created good:</hi> Feign not thy ſelf to be
<hi>All the World: God</hi> hath not loſt his work; the <hi>World</hi>
is not diſſolved, when I am diſſolved! O how ſtrong
and unreaſonable a Diſeaſe is this inordinate SEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FISHNESS!
Is not <hi>God's Will Infinitely</hi> better than
<hi>mine?</hi> And fitter to be fulfilled: Chooſe the fulfilling
of his <hi>Will,</hi> and thou ſhalt always have thy choice: If
a Man be well that can always have his will, let this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be thy <hi>Will,</hi> that God's <hi>Will</hi> may be done, and
thou ſhalt always have it.</p>
            <p>Lord, let thy Servant <hi>Depart in Peace:</hi> even in <hi>Thy
Peace,</hi> which paſſeth underſtanding, and which Chriſt
the Prince of Peace doth give, and nothing in the
World can take away! O give me that <hi>Peace</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemeth
a Soul, which is ſo near the Harbour, even
the World of endleſs PEACE and LOVE! where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
UNION (ſuch as I am capable of) will free me
from all the ſins and troubles, which are cauſed by the
convulſions, divulſions, and confuſions of this divided
SELFISH World. Call home this Soul by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
Voice of Love, that it may joyfully hear,
and ſay, It is my <hi>Fathers Voice:</hi> Invite it to thee by
the heavenly Meſſenger: Attract it by the <hi>tokens</hi> and
the <hi>foretaſts</hi> of Love: The Meſſengers that invited me
to the <hi>Feaſt of Grace, compelled me to come in</hi> without
conſtraint: Thy effectual call did make me willing:
And is not <hi>Glory</hi> better than preparing Grace? Shall
I not come more <hi>willingly</hi> to the Celeſtial Feaſt? What
was thy Grace for, but to make me <hi>willing</hi> of Glory, and
the <hi>way</hi> to it? Why didſt thou dart down thy Beams
of Love, but to make me Love thee, and to call me
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59339:76"/>
up to the everlaſting Center! Was not the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of
of Grace, as a Sacrament of the Feaſt of Glory: Did I
not take it in remembrance of my Lord until he come?
Did not he that told me, <hi>All things are ready,</hi> tell
me alſo that <hi>He is gone to prepare a place for us,</hi> and it
<hi>is his will</hi> that we ſhall be with him and ſee his
Glory. They that are <hi>Given</hi> him, and <hi>Drawn</hi> to him
by the Father on Earth, do come to Chriſt: <hi>Give</hi> now
and <hi>Draw</hi> my <hi>Departing Soul</hi> to my Glorified Head:
And as I have Glorified thee on Earth in the meaſure
that thy Grace hath prevailed in me, pardon the ſins
by which I have offended thee, and Glorifie me in the
beholding and participation of the Glory of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;

<hi>Dark,</hi> and <hi>Diſaffected Soul,</hi> that it may come with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
willingneſs unto thee.</p>
            <p>§ 13. Willingly <hi>Depart</hi> O lingring Soul! It is from a
<hi>Sodom,</hi> though in it there be righteous <hi>Lots,</hi> who yet
are not without their woful blemiſhes! Haſt thou ſo oft
groaned for the general blindneſs and wickedneſs of the
World, and art thou loth to leave it for a better? How
oft wouldſt thou have rejoyced to have ſeen but the
dawning of a Day of Univerſal <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Reformation?</hi>
And wouldſt thou not ſee it, where it ſhineth forth in
fulleſt Glory? Would a light at Midnight have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thee ſo well: Haſt thou prayed and laboured for it
ſo hard? And would thou not ſee the Sun? Will the
things of Heaven pleaſe thee no where but on Earth,
where they come in the leaſt and weakeſt influences,
and are terminated in groſs, terrene, obſcure, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
recipients? Away, away, the vindictive Flames
are ready to conſume this ſinful World? Sinners that
blindly rage in ſin, muſt quickly rage in the effects of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59339:77"/>
ſin, and of God's Juſtice: The pangs of Luſt, prepared
for theſe pangs! They are treaſuring up wrath againſt
this Day: Look not then behind thee: Away from this
unhappy World! Preſs on unto the Mark, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.
<hi>Looking towards, and haſtning to the coming of the Day
of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>As this World hath uſed thee, it would uſe thee ſtill,
and it will uſe others? If thou haſt ſped well in it, no
thanks to it, but unto God! If thou haſt had manifold
deliverances, and marvellous preſervations, and haſt
been ſed with Angels food, love not this Wilderneſs
for it, but God and his Angel which was thy Guide,
Protector and Deliverer.</p>
            <p>And hath this troubleſome Fleſh been ſo comfortable
a companion to thee, that thou ſhouldſt be ſo loth to
leave it? Have thy pains, thy wearineſs, thy languiſhings,
thy labours, thy cares and fears about this Body, been
pleaſing to thee? And art thou loth that they ſhould have
an end? Didſt thou not find a need of patience to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
them? And of greater Patience than m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r Nature gave
thee? And canſt thou hope now for <hi>better,</hi> when Nature
faileth, and that an aged, conſumed, more diſeaſed
Body, ſhould be a pleaſanter habitation to thee, than it
was heretofore? If from thy youth up it hath been
both a <hi>tempting</hi> and a <hi>troubling</hi> thing to thee, ſurely
though it be leſs <hi>tempting,</hi> it will not be leſs <hi>troubling,</hi>
when it is falling to the Duſt, and above ground ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
of the Grave! Had things ſenſible been never
ſo pleaſant in thy youth, and hadſt thou glutted thy ſelf
in health with that ſort of delight, in Age thou art to
ſay by Nature, <hi>I have no pleaſure in them.</hi> Doth God
in great Mercy make <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>feebleneſs</hi> the Harbingers
of Death, and wilt thou not underſtand their buſineſs?
Doth he mercifully before hand take away the pleaſure
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59339:77"/>
of all fleſhly things, and worldly vanities, that there
may be nothing to relieve a departing Soul, (as the ſhell
breaketh when the Bird is hatched, and the Womb
relaxed when the Infant muſt be Born;) and yet ſhall
<hi>we</hi> ſtay when nothing holdeth us, and ſtill be loth to
come away? Wouldſt thou dwell with thy beloved
Body in the Grave, where it will rot and ſtink in loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
darkneſs? If not, why ſhould it now in its pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
languor, ſeem to thee a more pleaſant habitation
than the glorious preſence of thy Lord? In the Grave
it will be at reſt, and not tormented as now it is, nor
wiſh at Night, O that it were Morning; nor ſay at
Morning, when will it be Night? And is this a dwelling
fit for thy delight? Patience in it while God will ſo
try thee, is thy duty? But is ſuch <hi>Patience</hi> a better and
ſweeter life, than <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>joy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 14. But alas, how deaf is Fleſh to Reaſon? Faith
hath the Reaſon which eaſily may ſhame all contrary
Reaſoning; but <hi>ſenſe</hi> is <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> and eſpecially this
inordinate tenacious <hi>Love</hi> of preſent Life. I have
Reaſon enough to be willing to depart, even much
more <hi>willing</hi> than I am: O that I could be as
<hi>willing</hi> as I am convinced, that I have Reaſon to be?
Could I <hi>Love God</hi> as much as I <hi>know that I ſhould
Love him,</hi> then <hi>I</hi> ſhould <hi>deſire</hi> to <hi>depart</hi> and <hi>to
be with Chriſt,</hi> as much as <hi>I</hi> know that <hi>I</hi> ſhould deſire
it: But God in Nature hath here laid upon me ſome
neceſſity of <hi>averſation,</hi> (though the inordinateneſs came
from ſin:) Elſe Chriſt had not ſo <hi>feared,</hi> and deprecated
the Cup: Death muſt be a penalty, even where it is a
gain! and therefore it muſt meet with ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs:
Becauſe we <hi>willingly</hi> ſinned, we muſt
unwillingly ſuffer! The Gain is not the pain or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
in itſelf, but the happy conſequents of it.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59339:78"/>
All the Faith and Reaſon in the World, will not make
Death to be no penalty, and therefore will not take
away all <hi>unwillingneſs.</hi> No Man ever yet Reaſoned or
Believed himſelf into a Love of <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> as ſuch:
But ſeeing that the gain is unſpeakably Greater than the
<hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Loſs,</hi> Faith and Holy Reaſon may make our
<hi>willingneſs</hi> to be <hi>Greater</hi> than our <hi>unwillingneſs,</hi> and our
<hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> than our <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Sorrow:</hi> And it is
the deep and effectual notice of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> which is God's
way in Nature and Grace, to change and draw the <hi>Will</hi>
of Man: Come then my Soul, and Think believingly
what is BEST for thee: And wilt thou not <hi>Love</hi>
and <hi>Deſire</hi> moſt, that which is certainly the BEST?</p>
            <div type="part">

               <p>§ 2. The Socinians who would interpret this of the
ſtate of Reſurrection only, againſt plain evidence vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Text: Seeing <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly ſpeaketh of <hi>his
Gain</hi> by <hi>Death,</hi> which will be his abode <hi>with Chriſt,</hi>
and this upon his <hi>departure</hi> hence: which in

16. in the Parable of the Steward, Chriſt intimateth to us,
that wiſe preparers when they go hence are received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Everlaſting habitations; as he there further tells

               <p>§ 3. <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is <hi>primaria &amp; menſurans vel ſecunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria

<hi>Will.</hi> The ſecond is either <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>ſimply Good,</hi> or
<hi>Analogical.</hi> The former is the Creatures conformity
to the <hi>Will</hi> of God, or its <hi>Pleaſingneſs</hi> to his will: The
later is, 1. The <hi>Greater,</hi> which is the <hi>wellfare</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Univerſe. 2. The <hi>Leſſer,</hi> which is
the Perfection of the <hi>ſeveral parts</hi> of the Univerſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
1. In the nobler reſpect, as they are <hi>Parts</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting

I. Properly and ſimply, as it is the fulfilling of <hi>God's
will.</hi> II. Analogically, as it tendeth to the <hi>Perfection</hi>
of the <hi>Univerſe</hi> and the Church? III. And as it will
be our own good or felicity. IV. And as it will be <hi>Good</hi>
to our inferiour fellow Creatures; though this laſt be
moſt queſtionable, and ſeemeth not included in the
meaning of this Text: Somewhat of theſe in order.</p>
               <p>§ 5. I. It is an odious effect of Idolatrous SELFISH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS,
to acknowledge no <hi>Goodneſs</hi> above our own
FELICITY, and accordingly to make the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of
God to be but formally his <hi>Uſefulneſs, Benovolence</hi> and
<hi>Beneficence</hi> to his Creatures, which is by making the
Creature the ultimate End, and God but the <hi>Means,</hi> to
make the Creature to be God, and deny God indeed,
while we honour his Name: As alſo it is, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no higher goodneſs formally in the Creature, than
its own <hi>felicity</hi> as ſuch: As if neither the <hi>pleaſing</hi> of God's
will, nor the Perfection of the Church and World,
were better than we are: We are not of our ſelves, and
therefore we are not chiefly for our ſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have a <hi>higher Good</hi> to <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is <hi>ſimply Beſt</hi> which God <hi>willeth.</hi> Therefore to
<hi>Live</hi> here is <hi>Beſt</hi> whileſt <hi>I do live here:</hi> and to <hi>depart</hi> is
<hi>beſt</hi> when the <hi>time</hi> of my <hi>departure</hi> cometh: That is <hi>Beſt</hi>
which is, (which is the work of God:) The World
cannot be <hi>Better</hi> at this <hi>Inſtant</hi> than it is, nor <hi>any thing
Better</hi> (which is of God:) becauſe it is as he <hi>willeth</hi>
it to be: But when God hath changed them, it will
<hi>then be Beſt</hi> that they are changed. Were there no
other Good in my departure hence, but this <hi>ſimple
Good,</hi> the fulfilling of <hi>God's will,</hi> my Reaſon telleth me
that <hi>I</hi> ſhould be fully ſatisfied in it: But there is alſo a

§ 6. II. For my change will tend to the perfection of
the <hi>Univerſe:</hi> even that <hi>Material Good</hi> or Perfection, which

§ 7. III. But lawful <hi>ſelf-love</hi> is yet further herein
gratified: The <hi>Goodneſs expreſſed</hi> in the Text, is that
Analogical ſubordinate Good, which is <hi>mihi Bonum,
my own Felicity,</hi> and that which <hi>tendeth thereunto:</hi> It

And have I not reaſon to believe it?</p>
               <p>§ 8. The Reaſons of it I will conſider in this order:

               <p>§ 9. And 1. That is beſt for me, which Love itſelf,
my heavenly Father deſigneth and chooſeth for my
good: I hope I ſhall never dare to think or ſay, that he
is miſtaken, or that he wanted <hi>Skill</hi> or <hi>Love:</hi> Or that
I could have choſen better for my ſelf than he doth, if
he had left all to my choice. Many a time the <hi>wiſe</hi>
and <hi>good-will</hi> of God, hath croſſed my fooliſh rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
will on Earth: And afterward I have ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that it was beſt; uſually for my ſelf, but always
for a higher good than mine. It is not an <hi>Enemy,</hi> nor
a <hi>Tyrant</hi> that made me, that hath preſerved me, and
that calls me hence. He hath not <hi>uſed</hi> me as an Enemy:
The more I have tried him, the better I have found
him: Had I better obeyed his <hi>Ruling will,</hi> how happy
had I been: And is not his <hi>diſpoſing</hi> and <hi>rewarding will</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:59339:80"/>
as good? Man's work is like Man, and evil corrupteth
it; but God's work is like God, and uncorrupted: If
I ſhould not die till my <hi>dearest Friend</hi> would have it,
much more till I my ſelf would chooſe it (not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by miſery) <hi>I</hi> ſhould rejoyce, and think my life
were ſafe! O fooliſh ſinful Soul, if <hi>I</hi> take it not to be
<hi>far better</hi> to be at <hi>God's choice</hi> than at my own or any
Mans! And if <hi>I</hi> had not rather that he chooſe the time
than <hi>I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be of good cheer then O my Soul; it is thy Fathers
voice that calls thee hence: His voice that called thee
into the World, and bid thee live, that called thee out
of a ſtate of ſin and death, and bid thee live hereafter
unto him: That called thee ſo oft from the Grave,
and forgiving thy ſins, renewed thy ſtrength, reſtored
thee to the comforts of his Houſe and Service; and
hath ſo graciouſly led thee through this howling Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
and brought thee almoſt to the ſight of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Land. And wilt thou not willingly go, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
fatherly Love doth call thee? Art thou not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of his preſence? Art thou afraid to go to him
who is the only cure of thy fears? What was it but this
Glory to which he did (finally) Elect thee? Where
doſt thou read that he <hi>Elected</hi> thee to the Riches and
Honours of this World: or to the pleaſures of the

<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed he Elected thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to bear the Croſs, and to manifold ſufferings here:
But is it that which thou preferreſt before the Crown?
That was but as a <hi>Means</hi> unto the Kingdom, that thou

And is it not better for me to have the End of all

preſent life, <hi>I</hi> miſtake them, and underſtand them not,
but unthankfully vilifie them, and loſe their End, and
life and ſweetneſs: Every word and work of God,
every Days mercies, and changes, and Uſages, do look
at Heaven, and intend Eternity: God leadeth me no
other way: If I follow him not, I forſake my hope in
forſaking him: If I follow him, ſhall I be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be at home, and come to the End of all this
way?</p>
               <p>§ 14. 6. Surely that is Beſt for me, which God
hath <hi>required me principally</hi> to <hi>value, love,</hi> and <hi>ſeek,</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:59339:82"/>
and that as the buſineſs of all my life, referring all
things elſe thereto: That this is my <hi>Duty,</hi> I am fully
certain, as is proved elſewhere and before, Is my buſineſs
in the World only for the <hi>things</hi> of this World? How
vain a Creature then were Man; and how little were
the difference between waking and ſleeping? Life and
Death: No wonder if he that believeth that there is no
Life but this, to ſeek or hope for, do live in uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
deſpair, and only ſeek to palliate his miſery
with the brutiſh pleaſures of a wicked life, and if he
ſtick at no villany which hisfleſhly Luſts incline him to!
Eſpecially <hi>Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Multitudes</hi> who have none but
God to fear. And it is my <hi>certain duty</hi> to ſeek Heaven
with all the fervour of my Soul, and diligence of my
life: And is it not Beſt to <hi>find it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 15. 7. That muſt needs be <hi>Beſt</hi> for me, which
<hi>all other things</hi> muſt be <hi>forſaken for:</hi> It is folly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the <hi>Better</hi> for the <hi>worſe:</hi> But <hi>Scripture, Reaſon,</hi> and
<hi>Conſcience</hi> tell me, that all this World, when it ſtands
in competition or oppoſition, ſhould be forſaken for
Heaven; yea, for the leaſt hopes of it: A <hi>poſſible ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Glory</hi> ſhould be preferred before a certainly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Vanity: I am ſure this life will ſhortly be <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
to me; and therefore it is next to nothing now.
And muſt I forſake all for my everlaſting Hopes, and
yet be unwilling to paſs unto the poſſeſſion of them.</p>
               <p>§ 16. 8. That is like to be our <hi>Beſt,</hi> which is our
<hi>Matureſt</hi> ſtate: Nature carrieth all things towards their
perfection: Our Apples, Pears, Grapes and every Fruit
is beſt when it is ripe: And though they then haſten to
corruption, that is, through the incapacity of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
materials, any longer to retain the Vegetative
Spirit, which is not annihilated at its ſeparation; and
being not made for its <hi>own</hi> felicity, but <hi>for Mans,</hi> its
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59339:82"/>
ripeneſs is the ſtate in which Man uſeth it, before it
doth corrupt of itſelf, that its <hi>corruption</hi> may be for his
nutriment; and the <hi>Spirits</hi> and beſt <hi>matter</hi> of his ſaid
food doth become his very ſubſtance. And doth God cauſe
Saints to grow up unto <hi>ripeneſs,</hi> only to periſh and drop
down unto uſeleſs rottenneſs? It is not credible.
Though our Bodies become but like our filthieſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
our Souls return to God that gave them:
And though he <hi>need them not,</hi> he <hi>uſeth</hi> them in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
ſtate; and that to ſuch <hi>heavenly</hi> uſes, as their
heavenly Maturity and Mellowneſs hath diſpoſed them
to. Seeing then Love hath ripened me for itſelf, ſhall
I not willingly drop into its hand?</p>
               <p>§ 17. 9. That is like to be the <hi>Best</hi> which the
<hi>Wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>Holiest</hi> in all Ages of the World have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before all, and have moſt deſired: And which

ſhould be moſt deceived, and be put upon fruitleſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and ſufferings by this deceit, and be undone by
their duty; and that God ſhould by ſuch deceits rule
all or almoſt all Mankin? And alſo that the common
notices of humane Nature, and Conſciences laſt and
cloſeſt documents, ſhould be all in vain. But it is paſt
all doubt, that no men uſually are <hi>worſe,</hi> than thoſe
that have no Belief or Hopes of any Life but this: And
that none are ſo <hi>Holy, Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Sober,</hi> ſo charitable
to others, and ſo uſeful to Mankind, as thoſe that firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
believe and hope for the ſtate of immortality:
And ſhall I fear that ſtate which all that were wiſe and
holy, in All Ages, have preferred and deſired?</p>
               <p>§ 18. 10. And it is not unlike that my <hi>Beſt</hi> ſtate is

               <p>§ 1. II 1. Is it not <hi>far better to dwell with GOD
in Glory,</hi> than with ſinful men in ſuch a World as this?
Though he be every where his Glory, which we muſt
behold to our Felicity, and the perfecting Operations
and Communications of his Love, are in the glorious
World, and not on Earth. As the Eye is made to ſee
the Light, and then to ſee other things by the Light, ſo is
mans mind made to ſee God, and to Love him; and other
things as in, by, and for him. He that is our beginning
is our end: And our <hi>End</hi> is the firſt Motive of all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralaction,
and <hi>for</hi> It, it is that all means are uſed. And
the <hi>End</hi> attained is the <hi>Reſt</hi> of Souls! How oft hath
my Soul groaned under the ſenſe of <hi>Diſtance,</hi> and <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and <hi>Eſtrangeneſs</hi> from God! How oft hath it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, and gaſped after him, and ſaid, O when ſhall I
be nearer and better acquianted with my God? <hi>As the
Heart panteth after the water Brooks, ſo panteth my Soul
after thee O God: My Soul thirſteth for God, for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God: When ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi>
Pſa. 40. 12. And would I not have my Prayers heard,
and my deſires granted? What elſe is the ſumm of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59339:83"/>
lawful Prayers, but God himſelf? If I deſire any
thing more than God, what ſinfulneſs is in thoſe deſires,
and how ſad is their ſignification? How oft have I
ſaid, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee, and there is
none on Earth I deſire beſides Thee? It is good for me to
draw near to God, Pſal.</hi> 73. 25: 28. Woe to me, if I
did diſſemble: If not, Why ſhould my Soul draw
back? Is it becauſe that Death ſtands in the way?
Do not my fellow Creatures die for my daily Food?
And is not my paſſage ſecured by the Love of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Reſurrection and Interceſſion of my Lord?
Can <hi>I</hi> ſee the Light of heavenly Glory, in this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſhell and womb of Fleſh?</p>
               <p>§ 2. All Creatures are more or leſs excellent and
glorious, as God is more or leſs <hi>Operative</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgent</hi>
in them, and by that <hi>Operation</hi> communicateth
moſt of himſelf unto them: Though he be immenſe
and indiviſible, his Operations and Communications
are not equal: And that is ſaid to be <hi>Neareſt</hi> to <hi>Him,</hi>
which hath moſt of thoſe Operations on it, and that
without the intervenient cauſality of any ſecond created
Cauſe; and ſo all thoſe are in their Order <hi>Near unto

and ſo that <hi>I</hi> ſhall be ſo near him, as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the influx of no ſecond or created Cauſes; (of
which more anon.) But to be as <hi>Near</hi> as my Nature
was ordained to approach, is but to attain the End and
Perfection of my Nature.</p>
               <p>§ 3. And as <hi>I</hi> muſt not look to be the <hi>Neareſt</hi> to
<hi>Him,</hi> as he is the <hi>firſt Efficient,</hi> no more muſt <hi>I</hi> as he is
the <hi>firſt Dirigent</hi> or <hi>governing Cauſe:</hi> As now <hi>I</hi> am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the government of his Officers on Earth, <hi>I</hi> look for
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59339:84"/>
ever to be under <hi>ſubgovernours</hi> in Heaven: My glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Saviour muſt be my Lord and Ruler; and Who elſe
under him <hi>I</hi> know not: If Angels are not equal in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
nor as is commonly ſuppoſed equal in Power,
nor without ſome regimental order among themſelves,
<hi>I</hi> muſt not conclude that no created Angel or Spirit,
ſhall have any government over me: But it will be ſo
Pure and Divine, as that the bleſſed Effects of God's own
Government will beſweetly powerful therein. If the Law
was given by Angles, and the Angel of God was in the
burning Buſh, and the Angel conducted the People
through the Wilderneſs, and yet all theſe things are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to God, much more near and glorious will the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Regiment there be, whoever are the Adminiſtrators.</p>
               <p>§ 4. And as <hi>I</hi> muſt expect to be under ſome created
<hi>Efficient</hi> and <hi>Dirigent</hi> Cauſes there, ſo muſt <hi>I</hi> expect to
have ſome <hi>ſubordinate Ends:</hi> Elſe there would not be a
proportion and harmony in cauſalities; whatever no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
Creatures are <hi>above me,</hi> and have their <hi>Cauſalities</hi>
upon me, <hi>I</hi> muſt look to be <hi>finally</hi> for thoſe <hi>nobler Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
When <hi>I</hi> look up and think what a world of
glorious Beings are now over me, <hi>I</hi> dare not preſume to
think that <hi>I</hi> ſhall <hi>finally</hi> any more than <hi>Receptively;</hi> be the
<hi>Neareſt unto God,</hi> and that <hi>I</hi> am made for <hi>None</hi> but
<hi>Him. I</hi> find here that <hi>I</hi> am made, and ruled, and
ſanctified, for the <hi>Publick</hi> or <hi>Common Good</hi> of many as
<hi>above my own</hi> (of which <hi>I</hi> am paſt doubt:) And <hi>I</hi> am
ſure that <hi>I</hi> muſt be <hi>finally</hi> for my <hi>glorified Redeemer;</hi>
and for what other Spiritual Beings or Intelligences
that are above me, little do <hi>I</hi> know: And God hath ſo
ordered all his creatures, as that they are mutually <hi>Ends</hi>
and <hi>Means for</hi> and <hi>to</hi> one another, though not in an
Equality, nor in the ſame reſpects. But whatever nearer
Ends there will be, <hi>I</hi> am ſure that he who is the <hi>firſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59339:84"/>
Efficient</hi> and <hi>Dirigent,</hi> will be the <hi>ultimate final Cauſe</hi>
And <hi>I</hi> ſhall be in this reſpect as <hi>near him,</hi> as is due to
he rank and order of my Nature. <hi>I</hi> ſhall be uſeful to
he Ends which are anſwerable to my Perfection.</p>
               <p>§ 5. And if it be the honour of a Servant to have an
honourable Maſter, and to be appointed to the moſt
honourable work: If it be ſome honour to a <hi>Horſe</hi>
above a Swine, or a Worm, or Fly, that he ſerveth
more nearly for the uſe of Man, yea for a Prince, will
it not be alſo my advancement to be <hi>ultimately</hi> for God,
and ſubordinately for the higheſt created Natures, and
this in ſuch Services as are ſuitable to my Spiritual and
Heavenly State?</p>
               <p>§ 6. For <hi>I</hi> am far from thinking that <hi>I</hi> ſhall be
above Service, and have none to do! For <hi>Activity</hi>
will be my Perfection and my Reſt: And all ſuch <hi>Activity</hi>
muſt be <hi>Regular</hi> in <hi>harmony</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of Cauſes, and
for its proper uſe. And what though <hi>I</hi> know not now
fully <hi>what ſervice</hi> it is that <hi>I</hi> muſt do? <hi>I</hi> know it will be
good, and ſuitable to the bleſſed ſtate which I ſhall be in:
And it is enough that God and my Redeemer know it;
and that <hi>I</hi> ſhall know it in due time, when <hi>I</hi> come to
practice it: (of which more afterward.)</p>
               <p>§ 7. The inordinate Love of this <hi>Body and preſent
compoſition</hi> ſeduceth Souls to think that all their uſe and
work is for its maintenance and proſperity, and when the
Soul hath done that, and is ſeparated from Fleſh, it hath
nothing to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but muſt lie idle, or be as nothing, or
have no conſiderable <hi>work</hi> or <hi>pleaſure:</hi> As if there were
nothing in the whole World, but this little fluid maſs
of matter, for a Soul to work upon? As if itſelf, and
all the Creatures, and God were nothing, or no fit Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
for a Soul? And why not hereafter as well as
now? Or as if that which in our compounded ſtate,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59339:85"/>
doth Operate on and by its Organs, had no other way
of Operation without them? As if the Muſician loſt all
his power, or were dead, when his Inſtrument is out
of tune or broken, and could do nothing elſe but play
on that! As if the fiery part of the Candle were anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated
or tranſmutate (as ſome <hi>following</hi>-Philoſphers
imagine) when the Candle goeth out; and were not
<hi>fire,</hi> and in <hi>action</hi> ſtill: Or as if that Sun beam which
I ſhut out, or which paſſeth from our Horizon, were
<hi>annihilated,</hi> or <hi>did nothing,</hi> when it ſhineth not with
us? Had it no other individual to illuminate or to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
its beams or action, were it nothing to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
the <hi>common Air?</hi> Though I ſhall not always
have a <hi>Body</hi> to Operate <hi>in</hi> and <hi>upon,</hi> I ſhall <hi>always</hi> have
<hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and a world of fellow-Creatures;
and when I ſhine not in this Lanthorn, and ſee not by
theſe Spectacles, nor imaginarily in a Glaſs, I ſhall yet
ſee things ſuitable <hi>intuitively</hi> and as <hi>Face to Face.</hi> That
which is eſſentially Life (as a Living Principle) will
Live: And that which is eſſentially an <hi>Active, Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective,
Volitive</hi> principle, force and <hi>Virtue,</hi> will ſtill
be ſuch while it is itſelf, and is not <hi>annihilated</hi> or
<hi>changed into another thing?</hi> (which is not to be feared:)
And that which is ſuch can never want an Object, till
all things be annihilated.</p>
               <p>§ 8. Reaſon aſſureth me, that were my <hi>will</hi> now
what it ſhould be, and fully obſequious herein to my
underſtanding, to <hi>fulfil Gods will</hi> would be the <hi>fulfilling
my own will</hi> (for <hi>my will</hi> ſhould perfectly comply
with <hi>His</hi>) and to <hi>pleaſe him perfectly</hi> would be <hi>my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
pleaſure:</hi> And it is the unreaſonable adheſion to
<hi>this Body,</hi> and ſinful <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> which maketh any one
think otherwiſe now. I am ſure that my Soul ſhall Live
(for it is <hi>Life</hi> itſelf) and I am ſure that I ſhall live <hi>to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59339:85"/>
God,</hi> and that I ſhall <hi>fulfil</hi> and <hi>pleaſe</hi> his bleſſed will;
and this is (as ſuch) incomparably better than <hi>my Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi>
(as ſuch:) And yet ſo far as I <hi>am pleaſed</hi> in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it will be <hi>my Felicity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 9. I begin now to think, that the <hi>ſtrange Love</hi> which
the <hi>Soul</hi> hath to <hi>this Body</hi> (ſo far as it is not inordinate)
is put into us of God, partly to ſignifie to us the <hi>great
Love which Chriſt hath to his</hi> Myſtical Political <hi>Body,</hi> and
to every member of it, even the leaſt: He will gather all
his Elect out of the World, and none that come to him
ſhall be ſhut out, and none that are given him ſhall be
loſt: As his Fleſh is to them Meat indeed, and his
Blood is to them Drink indeed, and he nouriſheth them
for Life eternal: (His <hi>Spirit</hi> in them, turning the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt himſelf in eſſe objectivo</hi>
as <hi>Believed</hi> in, into <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> to us, as the <hi>Soul</hi>
and our Natural. <hi>Spirits</hi> turn our food into <hi>Fleſh,
and Blood, and Spirits,</hi> which in a <hi>dead Body,</hi> or
any <hi>lifeleſs repoſitory,</hi> it would never be;) ſo as we
delight in the eaſe and proſperity of our Body and
each Member, and have pleaſure in the pleaſant food
that nouriſheth it, and other pleaſant Objects which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
it; Chriſt alſo delighteth in the welfare of
his Church and of all the Faithful, and is pleaſed when
they are fed with good and pleaſant Food, and when
hereby they proſper: <hi>Chriſt Loveth the Church,</hi> not
only as a Man muſt <hi>love his Wife,</hi> but as we <hi>Love our
Bodies;</hi> And <hi>no Man ever hated his own Fleſh,</hi> Eph. 5.
27, &amp;c. And herein I muſt allow my Saviour the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence,
to overgo me in powerful faithful Love! He
will ſave me better from pain and death, than I can ſave
my Body; and will more inſeparably hold me to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
If it pleaſe my Soul to dwell in ſuch a Houſe of
Clay, and to operate on ſo mean a thing as Fleſh, how
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59339:86"/>
greatly will it pleaſe my glorified Lord, to dwell with
his glorified Body, the triumphant Church, and to
cheriſh and bleſs each Member of it? It would be a
kind of death to Chriſt to be ſeparated from his Body,
and to have it die: Whether <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and the reſt of
the Fathers were in the right or no, who thought that
as our Bodies do not only ſhed their Hairs, but by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and waſt loſe much of their very Fleſh, ſo Chriſt's
<hi>Militant Body</hi> doth not only loſe Hypocrites, but alſo,
ſome <hi>living juſtified Members,</hi> yet certain it is that
<hi>confirmed Members,</hi> and more certain that <hi>glorified
Members</hi> ſhall not be loſt! Heaven is not a place for
Chriſt or us to ſuffer ſuch loſs in. And will Chriſt love
me better than I love my Body? Will he be lother to
loſe me than I am to loſe a Member or to die? Will he
not take incomparably greater pleaſure in <hi>animating</hi>
and <hi>actuating</hi> me for ever, than my Soul doth in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
and <hi>actuating</hi> this <hi>Body?</hi> O then let me long to
be with him? And though I am naturally loth to be
abſent from the Body, let me be by his Spirit more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to be abſent from the Lord? And though I
would not be unclothed had not ſin made it neceſſary, let
me groan to be clothed upon with my heavenly Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and to become the delight of my Redeemer, and
to be perfectly loved, by Love itſelf.</p>
               <p>§ 10. And even this bleſſed <hi>Receptivity</hi> of my Soul,
in terminating the Love and Delight of my glorified
Head, muſt needs be a felicity to me! The inſenſible
Creatures are but <hi>Beautified</hi> by the <hi>Suns</hi> communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of its Light and Heat; but the <hi>ſenſitives,</hi> have alſo
the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of it? Shall my Soul be <hi>ſenſleſs?</hi> will it be a
Clod or Stone? Shall that which is now the form of
be then more Lifeleſs, Senſleſs, or uncapable
than the form of Bruits is now? Doubtleſs it will be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59339:86"/>
a <hi>living, perceiving, ſenſible Recipient,</hi> of the
felicitating <hi>Love</hi> of God and my Redeemer? I ſhall <hi>be
loved</hi> as a <hi>living Spirit,</hi> and not as a <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi>
thing, that doth not comfortably perceive it.</p>
               <p>§ 11. And if I muſt rejoice with my fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
that rejoice, ſhall I not be glad to think that my
bleſſed Lord will rejoice in me, and in all his glorified
Ones? Union will make his pleaſure to be much mine?
And it will be aptly ſaid by him to the faithful Soul,
<hi>Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord,</hi> Mat. 25. 21. His
<hi>own active Joy,</hi> will <hi>objectively</hi> be <hi>Ours,</hi> as <hi>Ours</hi> will
be <hi>Efficiently His</hi> (or <hi>from Him.</hi>) Can that be an ill
condition to me, in which my Lord will <hi>moſt rejoice:</hi> It
is <hi>Best</hi> to <hi>Him,</hi> and therefore Beſt to me.</p>
               <p>§ 12. And the heavenly Society will joyfully wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Holy Soul.<note place="margin">Luke 15. 10.</note> If there be now <hi>Joy
in Heaven among the Angels for one Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that Repenteth</hi> (who hath yet ſo little
Holineſs and ſo much Sin:) What joy will there be
over a perfected glorified Soul! Surely if <hi>Our Angels
there behold our Fathers Face,</hi> they will be glad in Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of our Company: The Angels that carried <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, no doubt rejoiced in their
work and their ſucceſs. And is the <hi>Joy of Angels</hi> and
the <hi>heavenly Hoſt</hi> as nothing to me? Will not <hi>Love</hi>
and <hi>Union</hi> make <hi>their Joy</hi> to be <hi>my own:</hi> if <hi>Love here</hi>
muſt make all my Friends and Neighbours comforts to
become my own? And as their Joy according to their
Perfection, is greater than any that I am now capable
of, ſo the participation of ſo great a Joy of <hi>theirs,</hi> will
be far better than to have my little ſeparated apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Surely that will be my beſt condition which
Angels and bleſſed Spirits will be beſt pleaſed in, and I
ſhall rejoice moſt in that which they moſt rejoice in.</p>

But, 1. The Soul will be ſtill eſſentially a <hi>Vital Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
ſubſtance, diſpoſed to act naturally,</hi> and that is, to
thoſe acts which it is <hi>formally inclined to</hi> (as <hi>fire</hi> to <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate</hi>
and <hi>heat.</hi>) And as it cannot <hi>die</hi> (while it is
what it is in Eſſence) becauſe it is <hi>Life itſelf,</hi> that is,
<hi>The Vital ſubſtance;</hi> ſo it cannot but be <hi>Intellective</hi> (as
to an <hi>Inclined Power,</hi>) becauſe it is ſuch <hi>Eſſentially</hi>
(though God can change or annihilate any thing if he
would.) 2. And it will be among a world of <hi>Objects.</hi>
3. And it will ſtill have its dependence on the <hi>firſt
cauſe,</hi> and receive his continual actuating influx. 4. And
no Man can give the leaſt ſhew of true Reaſon, to
prove that it ſhall ceaſe <hi>ſenſation,</hi> (whether the <hi>ſenſitive
Faculties</hi> be in the <hi>ſame ſubſtance</hi> which is <hi>Intellective,</hi>
which is moſt probable, or in <hi>one conjunct</hi> as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine)
though the <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>Modes</hi> of Senſation ceaſe
which are denominated from the various Organs.
5. Yea, no Man can prove that the departing Soul
doth not carry with it its <hi>igneous Spirits,</hi> which
in the Body it did immediately actuate: (If it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59339:87"/>
ſo certain that thoſe <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers were miſtaken (as
well as <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) who took the Soul itſelf to be a
<hi>ſublime Intellectual Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the Objection, ſome hold that the Soul
preexiſted before it was in the Body; others and moſt
that it then received its firſt being. If the firſt were true,
it would be true that the Soul had its Intellectual Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
before, though the Soul itſelf incorporate remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it not, becauſe it Operateth but <hi>ut forma hominis,</hi>
(and its Oblivion they take to be part of its penalty:)
And they that think it a <hi>radius</hi> of the <hi>Anima mundi vel
ſyſtematis</hi> muſt think that then it did Intellectually ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<hi>hunc mundum, vel mundi partem:</hi> And to do ſo
again, is the worſt they can conjecture of it: As the rays
of the Sun which heat a burning Glaſs, and by it ſet a
Candle on fire, are the ſame rays ſtill diffuſed in
the Air, and illuminating, heating and moving it, and
terminated on ſome other Body, and not annihilated
or debilitated when their contracted Operation ceaſeth
by breaking the Glaſs or putting out the Candle: And
as the Spirit of a Tree ſtill animateth the Tree, when
it retireth from the Leaves and lets them fall. But this
being an unproved imagination of mens own Brains, we
have no further uſe of it, than to confute themſelves. But
if the Soul exiſted not till its incorporation, what wonder
if it Operate but <hi>ut forma,</hi> when it is united to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for that uſe? What wonder if its initial Operations
like a ſpark of Fire in Tinder, or the firſt lighting of a
Candle, be weak and ſcarce by us perceptible? What
wonder if it operate but to the uſes that the Creation
did appoint it; and firſt as <hi>vegetative</hi> fabricate its own
Body as the Makers inſtrument, and then <hi>feel,</hi> and
then <hi>underſtand?</hi> And what wonder if it Operate no
further than Objects are admitted? And therefore
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59339:88"/>
what wonder if in Apoplexies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch Operations
are intercepted? But the departing Soul is, 1. in its
<hi>Maturity.</hi> 2. No more united to this Body, and ſo not
confined to ſenſe and imagination in its Operations,
and the admiſſion of its Objects. 3. And it is <hi>ſub ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
meriti,</hi> and as a governed ſubject is ordinate to its
reward; which it was not capable of receiving in the
Womb or in an Apoplexy. And as we have the Reaſons
before alledged to hold, 1. That it ſhall not be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
2. Nor diſſolved. 3. Nor loſe its eſſential Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
or Powers. 4. Nor thoſe eſſential Powers be
continued uſeleſs by the wiſe and merciful Creator,
though by <hi>Natural revelation</hi> we know not in what
manner they ſhall act; whether on <hi>any other Body,</hi> and
by <hi>what conjunction,</hi> and <hi>how far;</hi> ſo by <hi>Supernatural
Revelation</hi> we are aſſured, that there is a reward for
the Righteous, and that holy Souls are ſtill members of
Chriſt, and live becauſe he liveth, and that in the Day
of their departure they ſhall be with him in Paradiſe,
and being abſent from the Body, ſhall be preſent with
the Lord; and that Chriſt therefore died, roſe and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that he might be Lord both of the Dead and of the
Living, that is, of thoſe that being Dead, hence do
Live with him, and of thoſe that yet live in the Body:
For he that ſaid, <hi>God is not the God of the dead but
of the Living,</hi> that is, ſtands not related to them as
his People as a King to Subjects, is not himſelf the
<hi>Lord of the abſolute Dead, but of the Living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore (as <hi>Contarenus</hi> againſt <hi>Pomponatius de Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.
Anim:</hi> ſaith) the Immortality of the Soul is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
by the Light of Nature, but the manner of its
future Operation muſt be known by Faith. And bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be the <hi>Father</hi> of Spirits, and our Redeemer, who hath
ſent and ſet up this excellent Light, by which we ſee
further than purblind Infidels can do.</p>

§ 2. But I deny not but even the Scripture itſelf,
doth tell us but little of the <hi>Manner</hi> of our Intellection
when we are out of the Body; and it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that there is more Imperfection in this <hi>Mode</hi> of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
Organical, Abſtractive knowledge which the
Soul exerciſeth in the Body, than moſt conſider of: And
that as the Eye hath the viſive Faculty in ſleep, and

I leave to wiſer men to judge: But I am very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious
that the Body is more a Lanthorn to the Soul,
than ſome will admit; and that this <hi>Luſus notionum ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundarum,</hi>
or <hi>abſtractive knowledge</hi> of <hi>Things</hi> by <hi>Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Images, Names,</hi> and <hi>Notions,</hi> is occaſioned by the
Union of the Soul with the Body <hi>ut formae;</hi> and is that
Childiſh knowledge which the Apoſtle ſaith ſhall be
done away: And how much of Mans fall might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in ſuch a knowing of good and evil I cannot tell
(or in the overvaluing ſuch a knowledge:) And I
I think that when vain Philoſophy at <hi>Athens</hi> had called
the thoughts and deſires of Mankind from <hi>great Realities</hi>
to the Logical and Philological game at Words and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59339:89"/>
Notions, it was <hi>Socrates</hi> his wiſdom to call them to
more concerning Studies, and <hi>Pauls</hi> greater Wiſdom
to warn men to take heed of ſuch vain Philoſophy, and
to labour to know God and Jeſus Chriſt, and the things
of the Spirit, and not to overvalue this ludicrous dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
worldly Wiſdom. And if I have none of this kind
of Notional childiſh knowledge when I am abſent from
the Body, the Glaſs and Spectacles may then be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
when I come to ſee with open Face, (or as face to
Face.) Our future knowledge is uſually in Scripture
called SEEING, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart,
for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. <hi>We ſhall ſee Face
to Face,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 2. <hi>We ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> Joh. 17.
24. <hi>Father, I will that thoſe which thou haſt given me,
be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory
which thou haſt given me,</hi> &amp;c. An <hi>Intuitive</hi> knowledge of
all things as in themſelves immediately is a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſort of knowledge than this by ſimilitudes, Names
and Notions, which our Learning now conſiſteth in,
and is but an Art acquired by many acts and uſe.</p>
               <p>§ 3. If the Sun were, as the Heathens thought it, an
<hi>Intellective Animal, and its</hi> emitted rayes were <hi>vitally
viſive,</hi> and when one of thoſe rayes were received by
prepared ſeminal matter (as in Inſects) it became the
Soul of an inferiour Animal, in this caſe the ſaid ray
would <hi>operate in that Inſect</hi> or <hi>Animal</hi> but according to
the Capacity of the recipient matter; whereas the <hi>Sun
itſelf</hi> by all its emitted rays would <hi>ſee</hi> all things <hi>Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
and <hi>with delight,</hi> and when that <hi>Inſect</hi> were dead,
<hi>that Ray</hi> would be what it was, an Intellective Intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
emanation: And though the Soul in Fleſh do not
know itſelf, <hi>how</hi> it ſhall be united to Chriſt and to all
other holy Souls and to God himſelf, nor <hi>how near,</hi> or
juſt of <hi>what ſort</hi> that union will be, yet <hi>united</hi> it will
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59339:89"/>
be; and therefore will participate accordingly of the
the univerſal Light or underſtanding to which it is
united. The Soul now as it is or operateth in the Foot
or Hand doth not <hi>underſtand,</hi> but only as it is and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
in the Head: And yet the ſame Soul which is in
the <hi>Hand</hi> underſtandeth in the <hi>Head;</hi> and the Soul
operateth not ſo ſelfiſhly or dividedly in the <hi>Hand,</hi> as
to repine there becauſe it <hi>underſtandeth</hi> not there;
but it is quiet in that it underſtandeth in the Head, and
performeth its due Operation in the Hand. But this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of Operations ſeemeth to be from the Organs and
the Bodies uſe or need: But Souls diſmiſſed from the
Body ſeem to be as <hi>all Eye,</hi> or <hi>Intuitive Light.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though it might content us to ſay that our <hi>Head
ſeeth all things, and we are united to him,</hi> yet we may ſay
further that <hi>we our ſelves ſhall ſee God, and all things that
are meet for us to ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. And ſeeing it is moſt certain that the Superior
glorious Regions are full of bleſſed Spirits who do ſee
God and one another, having much more perfect
Operations than we have (whoſe effects we Mortals
find here below) why ſhould I that find an <hi>Intellective
Nature</hi> in my ſelf, make any doubt of my more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Operations when I am diſmiſſed hence (being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that a Soul will not loſe its ſimple Eſſence.) Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thoſe ſuperiour Spirits have ethereal Bodies to act
in (or are ſuch themſelves) or not: If they are or
have ſuch, why ſhould I doubt of the like; and think
that my <hi>Subſtance</hi> or <hi>Vehicle</hi> will not be according to
the Region of my abode. If not, why ſhould I think that
my departed Soul may not <hi>know</hi> or <hi>ſee</hi> without an igne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or ethereal Body or Vehicle, as well as all thoſe
worlds of Spirits. And the certainty of <hi>Apparitions,
Poſſeſſions,</hi> and <hi>Witches</hi> do tell us, not only that there
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59339:90"/>
are ſuch Inhabitants of other Regions, Ordinarily invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to us, but alſo that we are in the way to that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
or Miſery which is in our inviſible ſtate.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Theſe things reviewed (being partly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before) aſſuring me that I ſhall have <hi>actual Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi>
in my ſeparated ſtate, the Region, with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but above all the Holy Scriptures, will tell me as
much as it is meet that I ſhould here know, what it is
that I ſhall intuitively underſtand. The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
13. 10, 11, 12. doth diſtinguiſh our <hi>knowing in part</hi> and
<hi>knowing Perfectly, knowing as a Child, and as a
Man, knowing darkly and enigmatically as in a Glaſs,
and knowing Face to Face as we are known:</hi> The great
Queſtion is, <hi>When this Time of Perfection is?</hi> Whether
he mean at <hi>Death,</hi> or at the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>
If Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> obſervation hold that

<hi>Body</hi>] is not joined with it, ſignifies that
Life which the Soul doth enter upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after our Death, and ſo that the
Soul hath that [after <hi>living</hi>] which is ſinified by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
word which we Tranſlate <hi>Reſurrection</hi>] then it will
lead men to think that there is leſs difference between
Mansſtate at his firſt departure and at his laſt Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than moſt think (even than <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf thought:)
But the difference between our <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> ſtate of <hi>after
life</hi> (or <hi>Reſurrection</hi>) cannot be now diſtinctly known.
What difference there is now between <hi>Henoch, Elias,</hi>
and thoſe who roſe at Chriſts Reſurrection, and the
reſt of the Saints, even the <hi>Spirits of the perfected Juſt,</hi>
and whether the <hi>firſt</hi> have as much greater Glory than
the reſt, as it is conceived that we ſhall have at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
above that which immediately followeth
Death, what mortal Man can tell? I am paſt doubt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59339:90"/>
that <hi>Fleſh and Blood (formally</hi> ſo called, and not only
<hi>ab accidente,</hi> as <hi>ſinful) ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of
God</hi> (vid. <hi>Hammond</hi> in loc.) but that our <hi>Natural
Bodies</hi> ſhall be made <hi>Spiritual Bodies:</hi> And how a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Body</hi> differeth from a Spirit or Soul, I pretend
not well to underſtand, but muſt ſtay till God by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
or fuller Light inform me. But ſurely the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is not like to be ſo great, as that a Soul in
Fleſh ſhall know <hi>in part,</hi> and a <hi>Soul in a Spiritual Body</hi>
ſhall know <hi>perfectly,</hi> and a Soul between both ſhall not
<hi>know at all.</hi> If it be <hi>Perfection</hi> which we ſhall have in
our <hi>Spiritual Body,</hi> it is like that we are <hi>nearer</hi> to that
Perfection (in Knowledge and Felicity) while we are
between both, than we are in the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>§ 6. And ſure a <hi>Soul,</hi> that even <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>goeth
upward, and to God that gave it,</hi> is liker to know God,
than that which is terminated in Fleſh, and operateth <hi>ut
forma</hi> according to its capacity and ſtate: And a Soul
that is <hi>with Chriſt,</hi> is liker to know Chriſt, and the
Father in him, than that which is preſent with the
Body, and abſent from the Lord. What leſs can the
Promiſe of being <hi>with him</hi> ſignifie?</p>
               <p>§ 7. And, 1. as to the <hi>Kind</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

Our <hi>Artes loquendi, dicendi, &amp; diſſerendi?</hi> To learn
our <hi>Wordy</hi> Rules and Axioms, in Metaphyſicks, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks,

which ſignifie God, and are made to lead them up
to him, to intangle them and be the greateſt and moſt
pernicious diverſion of their Souls from God; ſo do too
many Learned men do by their <hi>Organical ſignal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
They uſe it as men do Cards, and Romances,
and Plays, to delight their Phantaſies; but they know
leſs of the <hi>Things</hi> that are worth their knowing, than
many unlearned Perſons do, as I ſaid before. Had not
much of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Learning been then a meer
Game, for men to play away their precious time at, and
to grow proud of, while they were ignorant of ſaving
Realities, Chriſt and his Apoſtles had not ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
it as they did, nor <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much warned men
to take heed of being deceived by that vain kind of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;
in which he ſeemeth to me to have greater
reſpect to the univerſally eſteemed <hi>Athenian</hi> Arts, than, as
Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> Thought, to the meer <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> pretenſions.</p>
               <p>This poor dreaming ſignal Artificial Knowledge is,
1. Coſtly, 2. Uncertain. 3. Contentious. 4. Unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
in compariſon of Intuitive Knowledge.</p>
               <p>1. It is coſtly, as to the hard labour and precious
time, which muſt be laid out for it, as aforeſaid; we
grow old in getting us Horſes, and Boots, and Spurs
for our Journey, and it's well if we begin it at the laſt:
Like a Man that would ſtudy the new found Planets,
and the ſhape of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s <hi>Satellites,</hi> and the
<hi>Viam Lacteam,</hi> &amp;c, and he ſpends his whole life in
getting him the beſt Tubes or Teleſcopes, &amp; never uſeth
them to his ends: Or like one that inſtead of learning to
write doth ſpend his life in getting the beſt Ink, Paper &amp;
Pens: Or rather like one that learneth to <hi>Write</hi> and <hi>Print</hi>
exactly, and not to underſtand what any of his words do
ſignifie. Men take their Spectacles in ſtead of Eyes.</p>

                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:59339:92"/>
2. And when this Learning is got, how uncertain
are we whether the words have no ambiguity? Whether
they give us the true notice of the <hi>Speakers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

or Arbitrary deſign? Sometime by the Vulgar uſe, and
ſometime by Learned men, that being conſcious of the

to God, and diverting them from the great and holy
Things, which ſhould be the matter of our Thoughts
and Joys; and filling the Church with Sects and Strife,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59339:93"/>
while every one ſtriveth for the preeminence of his Wit
and Notio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, and few ſtrive for holy Love, and Unity,
and good works.</p>
               <p>4. And all this while, alas, too many Learned men
do but lick the outſide of the Glaſs, and leave the Wine
within untaſted: To know God, and Chriſt, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Holineſs, do give the Soul a <hi>nouriſhing</hi> and
<hi>ſtrengthning</hi> kind of <hi>pleaſure,</hi> like that of the Appetite
in its food: But this <hi>game at Words</hi> is but a knowing
of <hi>Images, Signs, and Shadows,</hi> and ſo is but an
image and ſhadow of true Knowledge: It is not that
Grace which <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s definition ſaith, <hi>Nemo male uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi>
but it is that which the Sanctified uſe well, and the
Unſanctified are puffed up by, and uſe to the oppoſition
of Truth, the Oſtentation of a Fooliſh Wit, and the
deceit of their own Souls: And if it be ſanctified know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
it is but <hi>Mediate</hi> in order to our knowledge of
the Things thus ſignified: And it is the real Good
which contenteth and beatifieth, though the <hi>Notions</hi>
may be a ſubordinate recreation. And Intuition feaſteth
on theſe Realities.</p>
               <p>§ 9. II. And as to the Objects of this Intuition,
their excellency will be the excellency of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
I. I ſhall know <hi>God</hi> better. II. I ſhall know
the <hi>Univerſe</hi> better. III. I ſhall know <hi>Chriſt better.</hi>
IV. I ſhall know the Church his Body better, with the
holy Angels. V. I ſhall better know the Methods and
Perfection of the Scripture and all God's <hi>Dirigent
Word,</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi> VI. I ſhall know the Methods and
Senſe of <hi>Diſpoſing</hi> Providence better. VII. I ſhall
know the Divine Benefits which are the Fruits of <hi>Love</hi>

                  <hi>Evil, Sin, Satan, and Miſery,</hi> from which I am delivered.</p>
               <p>§ 10. I. <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and many others took it for the
chief Natural proof of the Souls Immortality, that Man
by Nature deſireth not only to know Effects, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Cauſes, but to riſe up to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>firſt
Cauſe;</hi> and therefore was made for ſuch Knowledge in
the ſtate of his Perfection: But <hi>Grace</hi> hath much more
of this deſire than <hi>Nature:</hi> Not that we muſt not
be content to be without a great deal of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which would be unmeet for us, uſeleſs, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
or dangerous to us; nor muſt we aſpire to that
which is above our capacity; and to know the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable
things of God: But not to <hi>know God</hi> is to
<hi>know nothing;</hi> and to have an underſtanding worſe
than none. I preſume not to pry into the ſecrets of
the Almighty, nor to pretend to know more of God
than indeed I know; but O that I might know more
of his glorious Perfections, of his Will, and Love, and
Ways, with that knowledge which is Eternal Life!
Bleſſed be that Love that ſent the Son of God from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to reveal him to us in the Goſpel as he hath done:
But all that hear the ſame Words and Believe them,
have not the ſame degree of Light or Faith? If an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
from Heaven came down on Earth to tell us all of
God that we would know, and might lawfully deſire
and ask him, who would not turn his Back on Libraries
and Univerſities, and the Learned men, to go and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with ſuch a Meſſenger? What travel ſhould I
think too far? What coſt too great for one Hours talk
with ſuch a Meſſenger? But we muſt have here but ſuch
intimations as will exerciſe Faith and excite deſire, and
try us under the Temptations of the World and Fleſh:
The glorious Light is the reward of the Victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the conduct of the Light of Grace. God in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59339:94"/>
great Mercy even here beginneth the reward: They
that are true to the initial Light, and faithfully follow
on to know the Lord, do find uſually ſuch increaſe
of Light, (not of vain Notions, but of quickning and
comforting knowledge of God) as greatly encourageth
them, and draweth them ſtill on to ſeek for more: It
is very pleaſant here to increaſe in holy Knowledge,
though it uſually bring an increaſe of malignant op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and ſo of ſorrows to the Fleſh. The pleaſure
that the mind hath in common knowledge brings men
through a great deal of labour to attain it: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years travel over Land and Sea do ſome men take,
to ſee and know more of this lower World? Though
it's little that they bring home, but more acquaintance
with <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Vanity,</hi> and <hi>Vexation.</hi> How many more
Years do Thouſands ſpend in the reading of multitudes
of tedious Volumes, that they may know what others
knew before them. Printers and Bookſellors live by our
deſire of Knowledge. What Soul then on Earth can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
conceive how great a pleaſure it will be for a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
Soul to ſee the <hi>Lord?</hi> Though I cannot now
conceive what that intuition of God himſelf will
be, and whether it will not be a glorious kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
or abſtractive knolwedge; whether the Glory
which we ſhall ſee be only a created appearance of God,
or be his very Eſſence, it ſatisfieth me that it will be as
perfect a knowledge as is fit for me to deſire; and I ſhall
then deſire no more than is fit: And what it is I ſhall then
know by itſelf, for it is not otherwiſe to be clearly known.
And all the pleaſure that I ſhall have in Heaven in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any of the works of God, will be in my beholding
God himſelf, his Being, his Vital power and action, his
Wiſdom, and his Love, and Goodneſs, in thoſe works:
For he is the Life, and Glory of them all. <hi>Bleſſed are
the pure in Heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:59339:94"/>
II. And doubtleſs it will be no ſmall part of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
to ſee and know God's perfect works, I mean,
the <hi>Univerſe</hi> itſelf; I cannot ſay that I ſhall have ſo
large a Capacity as to comprehend all the World, or
know it perfectly and with an adequate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
But I ſhall know it in ſuch Perfection as is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to my capacity: It is exceeding pleaſant to know
the leaſt Particles of the works of God: With what
diligence and delight have men endeavoured to Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize
a Body, yea a ſmall part of a Carkaſs, and to
know and deſcribe poor Worms and Inſects, Plants
and Minerals? And no Man ever yet perfectly knew
the leaſt of them all; no Herbaliſt or Phyſician ever
yet knew the Nature, and uſes of any one Herb with
an adequate knowledge! With what delight and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
are Phyſical ſearches carryed on in the World,
though ſtill we are all but groaping in the dark, and
ignorant of many things for one that we know (and
therefore know no one perfectly becauſe we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of reſt.) But if indeed we were above our dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
erroneous Hypotheſes, and ſaw the Nature of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Creature, even in Sea and Land (this little Spot of
God's Creation,) and the compages of all, Oh, what a
delightful Spectacle would it be? How much more to
ſee the whole Creation, yea or one <hi>Vortex</hi> or <hi>Syſteme</hi> of
the Globes, and to know their union and communion,
and to behold their beauteous Symmetry, and hear
them in concord and melodious Harmony praiſing the
the Glory of their Great, Wiſe, Amiable Creator, this
were a delectable ſight indeed: I ſhall have as much of
this as I ſhall be capable of: And the wonders and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Works of God, ſhall wrap up my Soul in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
joyful praiſe for ever: And though here it be
but little of God's Works that we know, I have great
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59339:95"/>
reaſon to think that it will be far otherwiſe there.
1. Becauſe the ſtate of <hi>Perfection</hi> muſt far excel our
dark and infant ſtate of imperfection: We have now
<hi>deſires</hi> after ſuch a knowledge: <hi>His Works are great,
ſought out of them that have pleaſure therein.</hi> And theſe
deſires being of God, ſhall not be fruſtrate. 2. Becauſe
there will be a proportionableneſs of the parts of our
Perfection; and therefore as our Love to God and his
works will be there perfected, ſo will be our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
3. Becauſe we ſhall know God himſelf as
much as we are capable, and therefore we ſhall know
his works, in him, or by a ſubordinate knowledge, the
leſs being in the greater, 4. Becauſe God hath <hi>made</hi>
his works to be <hi>known</hi> to his glory: But it is little that
is here known of them by Mortals; therefore they are
known by them in Heaven, who are fitted to improve
that knowledge to his praiſe.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt who is the wiſdom of God, will teach me
the true Philoſophy, how to love God, and live here in
all well pleaſing unto him, I ſhall quickly in Heaven be
a perfect Philoſopher; and experience will tell me,
that the ſureſt way to be truly Learned, and know the
wonderful works of God, was to know, love, and
ſerve the Great Creator, and in Him we ſhall <hi>have all,</hi>
and without him we <hi>know nothing,</hi> and <hi>have</hi> nothing
at all.</p>
               <p>Satan tempted Chriſt by ſhewing him the <hi>Kingdoms
and glory of the World,</hi> and promiſing them <hi>all</hi> to him if
he would have worſhipped him: But God will ſhew me
more than Satan could ſhew, and give me more of that
which is beſt, than Satan could give.</p>
               <p>III. And that in Heaven I ſhall better know Jeſus
Chriſt, and all the Myſtery of our Redemption by him,
will not be the leaſt of my felicity! For in him are
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59339:95"/>
hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom: And to know the
Myſtery of his Eternal Godhead, in the ſecond Perſon,
and his created Nature, and the Union of theſe, and to
ſee God's wonderful deſign and work of grace in him
laid open to our cleareſt view; O what beatifying
knowledge will this be? All dark Texts concerning
his Perſon, his Office, and his Works will be then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
and fully underſtood: All thoſe ſtrange and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
things which were the great exerciſe and honour
of Faith, will then be plain: Difficulties will no more
be Satans advantage to tempt us to unbelief or doubting.
The ſight of the Glory of my Lord will be my Glory,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. If <hi>Paul</hi> had not then attained to <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in the <hi>knowledge of Chriſt, and the power of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi>
but was <hi>preſſing forward</hi> to reach that
Crown in the life to come (which he calleth <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of the dead,</hi>) Phil. 3. 9, 10, 11, 12. Such
as I muſt not expect here to attain it; but when that
which is <hi>Perfect is come,</hi> this imperfect knowledge of
Faith will be done away, as childiſh knowledge is in
manly: And the <hi>Glaſs</hi> and <hi>Riddle</hi> ſhall be laid aſide,
when we <hi>ſhall ſee Face to Face, and ſhall know as we
are known,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 10, 11, 12. (as to our ſight
and knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his Triumphant Body:</hi> For
I dare not apply that Phraſe to the ſight and knowledg
of the Divine eſſence; nor yet deny it.)</p>
               <p>If now though we ſee not Chriſt, yet <hi>believing</hi> we
<hi>love</hi> him, and <hi>rejoice</hi> in <hi>him</hi> with <hi>unſpeakable glorying
joy:</hi> What love, and joy will the Everlaſting ſight of
our bleſſed head, excite there in the Souls of all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified?</p>
               <p>IV. I ſhall better (O much better) know the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Triumphant Church,</hi> the <hi>Bleſſed
Angels</hi> and <hi>glorified Saints:</hi> And as my <hi>love to them,</hi> ſo
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59339:96"/>
my <hi>knowledge of them</hi> will not be the leaſt part of my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
delight. As ſtrangely as I now look upward to that
World, becauſe I cannot ſee it with theſe Eyes, it ſhall
be my well known Everlaſting habitation! O what
a ſight, what a joyful ſight will Death ſhew me by
drawing aſide the vail? Or rather the Lord of Life by
turning Death to my advantage! When I am there at
home, I ſhall no more think with confuſion, fear or
doubting of that bleſſed place or ſtate. My fears
which now come from the ſmalneſs of my Faith, will
end when Faith is turned into Viſion. As I now know
the ſeveral Rooms in my Houſe, and Houſes in the
Street, and Streets in the City, ſo ſhall I then know
the <hi>many Manſions,</hi> which Chriſt hath ſaid are in his
Fathers Houſe. Words now give me ſo poor imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a conception of the World and things which I
never ſaw, as that ſomtimes I can ſcarcely tell, whether
the <hi>Joy</hi> of my <hi>Faith,</hi> or the <hi>trouble</hi> of my <hi>dark appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,</hi>
be the greater: But when I ſhall <hi>ſee</hi> the Place,
the Perſons, the Glory which I heard of, that will be
the delightful ſatisfying, and poſſeſſing kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
If <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and the godly <hi>Jews,</hi> made ſo
great a matter of ſeeing the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
and others of the imperfect reedifying of the
Temple, O what a joyful ſight to me, will the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> then be: The moſt glorious ſight will be
at the great Marriage day of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt
ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all
them that</hi> now <hi>believe:</hi> But the next to that will be the
Day of my particular deliverance, when I ſhall <hi>come to
Christ,</hi> and ſee the Saints admiring him in Glory.</p>
               <p>If I were of the Opinion of thoſe <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, who
thought that Stars were Angels or had intellectual Souls
(matters unknown to us) I ſhould love them as my
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59339:96"/>
Guardians, and take it to be yet more of my concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be advanced to the fuller knowledge of them.
But ſeeing I know that Angels love us, and by
Office do attend and keep us, and rejoice at our good,
and at our repentance, and (which is far more) are
more holy and excellent Creatures than we are, it is
therefore my comfort to think that I ſhall better know
them, and live in near and perpetual acquaintance and
communion with them, a more ſenſible and ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
than we can have with them here. Devils are
aereal and near to this dark and ſinful World, and ofter
appear to men than Angels: But the Angels affect not
ſuch deſcending appearances, till Love and Obedience
to their Lord, make it pleaſing to them. And therefore
we have but little knowledge, even of thoſe that know,
and love, and keep us: But when we come home to
their neareſt ſociety and converſe, to know them will be
ſweet and joyful knowledge: For they are more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Creatures than the moſt glorious that are below
the Intellective Nature: They are full of Light, and
full of Love to God and Man! Had God bid me pray
to them I would not have refuſed it, but taken it for
my honour: But ſeeing he hath not, I will do that
which he hath bid me, even <hi>Love</hi> them, and rejoice
in my relation to the innumerable Company of them,
in the City of the Living God, the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,
Heb.</hi> 12. 22. and long to know and love them more;
expecting long to bear my part in the Praiſes of God
and of the Lamb, in the ſame Chore where they are
the Precentors.</p>
               <p>And that I ſhall know the Spirits of the perfected
Juſt, and be of their communion, will be no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to my joy. How ſweet hath one wiſe and holy
(though weak and blemiſhed) companion been to me
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59339:97"/>
here on Earth? And how lovely have God's Graces in
ſuch (though ſmutted) appeared to me. O then what
a ſight will it be when we ſhall ſee the Millions of Souls
that ſhine in perfect Wiſdom and Holineſs with Chriſt:
To ſee a Garden that hath ſome beautiful Flowers in
it, is ſomthing: But if you ſaw whole Fields and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
ſhining with them, it would be a glory (though
fading) to the Earth. A well built City is a pleaſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſight, than a ſingle Houſe; and a Navy than a
Ship; and an Army than one Man: And if this poor low
World did all conſiſt of Wiſe, and Juſt, and Holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
O what an orderly, lovely World would it be!
If <hi>one Kingdom</hi> conſiſted (Prince, Magiſtrates, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
and People) all of ſuch, what a bleſſed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
would that be: The plague of wicked mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
and falſhoods, oppreſſions and iniquities, may
help to make us ſenſible of this: It would be a great
temptation to us to be loth to die, and leave ſuch a
Countrey, were it not that the more the beauty of
goodneſs appeareth, the more the ſtate of Perfection is
deſired: It is pleaſant to me to pray in hope as Chriſt
hath commanded me, that <hi>Earth may be made liker un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven,</hi> which now is become ſo like to Hell: But
when I ſhall ſee the Society perfected, in <hi>Number,</hi> in
<hi>Holineſs,</hi> in <hi>Glory,</hi> in <hi>heavenly Employment,</hi> the joyful
Praiſes of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Glory of God and the Lamb
ſhining on them, and God rejoicing over them as his
delight, and my ſelf partaking of the ſame, that will
be the truly bleſſed day! And why doth my Soul im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
in Fleſh no more deſire it?</p>
               <p>V. I ſhall better underſtand all the World of God!
The Matter, and the Method of it! Though I ſhall
ſhall not have that uſe for it as I have now in this Life
of Faith, yet I ſhall ſee more of God's Wiſdom and his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59339:97"/>
Goodneſs, his Love, Mercy, and Juſtice appearing in
it, than ever Man on Earth could do! As the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
ſo the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are perfectly known only by
perfect Spirits. I ſhall then know how to ſolve all doubts,
and reconcile all ſeeming contradictions, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the hardeſt Propheſies: That light will ſhew
me the admirable Methods of thoſe Sacred words,
where dark minds now ſuſpect confuſion! How evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and clear then will every thing appear to me?
Like a ſmall print when the light comes in, which I
could not read in the glimmering twilight. How
eaſily ſhall I then confute the cavils of all our preſent
Unbelievers? And how joyfully ſhall I praiſe that God
and Saviour, that gave his Church ſo clear a light to
guide them through this darkſom World, and ſo ſure a
promiſe to ſupport them till they came to life Eternal?
How joyfully ſhall I bleſs him that by that immortal
Seed did regenerate me to the hopes of Glory? And
that ruled me by ſo Holy and Juſt a Law?</p>
               <p>VI. In that World of Light I ſhall better underſtand
God's <hi>preſent and paſt works of Providence,</hi> by which he
ordereth the matters of this World: The Wiſdom and
Goodneſs of them is little underſtood in little parcels; It
is the union and harmony of all the parts which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the beauty of them; when the ſingle Parcels ſeem
deformed, or are not underſtood. And no one can ſee
the <hi>whole</hi> together but God, and they that ſee it in the
light of his Celeſtial Glory: It is a proſpect of that
<hi>End,</hi> by which we have here any true underſtanding
of ſuch Parcels as we ſee. Then I ſhall know clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>why</hi> (or to <hi>what uſe</hi>) God proſpered the wicked,
and tryed the Righteous by ſo many afflictions? I ſhall
know why he ſet up the ungodly, and put the humble
under their Feet: Why he permitted ſo much igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59339:98"/>
ungodlineſs, pride, luſt, oppreſſion, perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
falſhood, deceit, and other ſins in the World: I
ſhall know why the faithful are ſo few: And why ſo
many Kingdoms of the World, are left in Heatheniſm,
Mahometaniſm and Infidelity. The ſtrange permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which now ſo puzzle me, and are the matter of my
aſtoniſhment, ſhall all be then as clear as day: I ſhall
know why God diſpoſed of me as he did through all
my life; and why I ſuffered what I did; and how
many great deliverances I had, which I underſtood not
here; and how they were accompliſhed. All our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations
of God's works and permiſſions, will be
then rectified: And all our Controverſies about them,
which Satan hath made ſo great advantage of (by a
pretended zeal for ſome Truths of God) will then be
reconciled, and at an end: And all the works of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence from the beginning of the World,
will then appear, a moſt delectable beauteous frame.</p>
               <p>VII. And among all theſe works, I ſhall ſpecially know
more, the nature and excellency of Gods mercies and gifts
of Love, which here we too unthankfully undervalued &amp;
and made light of! The ſpecial works of <hi>Love,</hi> ſhould
be the matter of our moſt conſtant, ſweet and ſerious
Thoughts, and the fuel of our conſtant Love and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude!
The lively ſenſe of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> maketh
lively Chriſtians, abounding in Love to God, and
Mercy to others: But the Enemy of God and Man
moſt laboureth to obſcure, diminiſh, and diſgrace God's
Love and <hi>Mercys</hi> to us, or to put us out of reliſh to
them, that they be unfruitful as to their excellent ends
and uſes. Little do moſt Chriſtians know how much
they wrong God and themſelves, and how much they
loſe, by the diminutive poor Thoughts which they have
of God's Mercies: Ingratitude is a grievous miſery to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59339:98"/>
the Sinner, as gratitude is a very pleaſant work. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a Thouſand Mercies we now receive, which we
greatly undervalue. But when I come to the ſtate and
work of perfect gratitude, I ſhall have a more perfect
knowledge of all the Mercies which ever I received in
my Life, and which my Neighbours and Friends, and
God's Church and the World did ever receive: For
though the <hi>thing</hi> be paſt, the <hi>uſe</hi> of it is not paſt: Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
remembred muſt be the matter of our everlaſting
thanks: And we cannot be perfectly thankful for them,
without a perfect knowledge of them: The worth of
a Chriſt, and all his grace, the work of the Goſpel, the
worth of our Church-priviledges, and all God's Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the worth of our Books, and Friends, and Helps of our
Life and Health, and all conveniences will be better
underſtood in Heaven, than the moſt holy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Chriſtian here underſtandeth them.</p>
               <p>VIII. And it will be ſome addition to my future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
that <hi>I</hi> ſhall then be much better acquainted with
<hi>my ſelf:</hi> Both with my <hi>Nature,</hi> and with my <hi>Sin</hi> and
<hi>Grace. I</hi> ſhall then better know the Nature of a Soul,
and its formal Faculties (Three in One:) <hi>I</hi> ſhall know
the nature and way of its Operations, and how far its
acts are ſimple or compound, or organical! <hi>I</hi> ſhall
know how far Memory, Phantaſie, and Senſe internal
and external belong to the rational Soul, and whether
the ſenſitive and rational are two or one; and what
Senſes will periſh and what not? <hi>I</hi> ſhall know how the
Soul doth act upon it ſelf, and what acts it hath that
are not felt, in ſleep in Apoplexies, and in the Womb?
<hi>I</hi> ſhall know whether the vegetative nature be any
thing elſe than Fire; and whether it be of the ſame Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
with the Soul (ſenſitive, or rational:) (and
whether Fire <hi>eminenter</hi> be a common fundamental ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

Satan did moſt againſt it, and God will do moſt for it.
And will it not be better with Chriſt than here?</p>
               <p>1. It will not there by tyed to a body of croſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts

love, and care, and fears, and ſorrows, to and for it
ſelf, and turning them from my higheſt intereſt. How
great a deliverance will it be, to be freed from the

not ſeduce me; nor reputation or reverence of the

in any ſin.</p>
               <p>3. I ſhall there have none of Satans ſolicitations, to
pervert my will: He will not have that advantage by
my Senſe and Phantaſie, nor that acceſs unto me as now
he hath. But of this I ſpake before.</p>
               <p>§ 2. My WILL ſhall there be <hi>better than here,
I. Negatively,</hi> becauſe, 1. There will be nothing in
it that is diſpleaſing to God: No ſinful inclination, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
or act: Nothing to ſtrive againſt God's Spirit:
Nor grudge at any word or work of God: No Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Enmity or Rebellion left. 2. There will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59339:101"/>
that is againſt the good of others: No inclinations
to injury, or any thing that is againſt my Neighbours
or the common good. 3. There will be nothing in it
that is croſs to <hi>itſelf;</hi> no more war or ſtriving in me;
not a Law in my Mind, and a Law in my Members
that are contrary to each other: No croſsneſs between
Senſe and Reaſon, nor between the ſenſitive <hi>Appetite</hi>
and the rational: All will be at unity and peace within.</p>
               <p>§ 3. II. Poſitively; Chriſt will have finiſhed his
cure on my will: The work of Sanctification will be
perfect: And I. <hi>My will</hi> ſhall there by union and
communion be made conformable to the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and ſo unto the <hi>Fathers will.</hi> This muſt needs be
meant (whatever more) in the Prayer of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi>
17. 21, 22. Where he prayeth [that they may be <hi>One</hi>
as <hi>thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they may
be one in us, that they may be one, even as we are one.</hi>]
The <hi>will</hi> of Chriſt and of the Father <hi>will be my will,</hi>
that is, I ſhall love and <hi>will</hi> (diſpoſitively and actually)
the ſame that God loveth and <hi>willeth</hi> (in the meaſure
of a Creature, infinitely below him:) And if ſo, 1. How
can the <hi>will</hi> of Man have <hi>greater honour,</hi> than to be
the ſame with the will of God? Aſſimilation to a King
among us poor Mortals goeth for Honour: Aſſimilation
to Angels is much more: That we ſhall be <hi>like</hi> or <hi>equal</hi>
to the Angels, is a high part of the Bleſſeds praiſe:
But how much more is it, to be thus far <hi>like to God!</hi>
Indeed <hi>God's Image</hi> and the <hi>Divine</hi> in us <hi>here,</hi> can be
no leſs, than this <hi>ſimilitude</hi> to God's will in the degree
that we have it: But, alas, that degree is ſo very low,
as that we can hardly tell whether our ſimilitude or
our diſſimilitude be the more; I mean, whether our
<hi>wills</hi> are <hi>for more</hi> that God willeth, or againſt
more. O how many Thouſand wiſhes and deſires
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59339:102"/>
have we had, which are againſt the will of God! But
<hi>there</hi> we ſhall have the full impreſſion of God's will
upon our wills, as Face anſwereth Face in a Glaſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or as the Wax anſwereth the Seal: As the Finger on
the outſide, anſwereth the motion of the Clock within,
ſo in all things which belong to our duty and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we ſhall anſwer the will of God. As the Eccho
anſwereth the Voice, defectively, but truly, without
contradiction or diſcord, ſo will our wills be as the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
of God's will.</p>
               <p>2. And then I am ſure that there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in my will but good! For God willeth no evil.</p>
               <p>3 And this will be <hi>virtually all obedience!</hi> For all ſin
is voluntary, and all Moral good is primarily in the will.</p>
               <p>4. And then there can be no matter of diſquiet in
me, but all will be in perfect Peace; for all that is like
God will be pleaſing both to God and me: No trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
croſsneſs will remain.</p>
               <p>5. And how eaſy and ſweet then will all my <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
be, when I ſhall perfectly will it, without any
reluctancy or averſneſs? All will be my very pleaſure,
that I do.</p>
               <p>§ 4. II. And ſeeing my will ſhall be the ſame with
the will of God, it followeth that it ſhall never be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
but I ſhall have all whatſoever I would have,
and ſhall be and do whatſoever I would be and do?
For I ſhall deſire nothing but what God willeth; and
God's will ſhall certainly be done: I ſhall have as much
Love and Joy as I would have: I ſhall be as happy as I
would be: I ſhall deſire nothing for others but it ſhall be
done: Indeed if God's will were there unknown to me, I
might ignorantly go againſt it, as I do here: But there
before <hi>I will</hi> or deſire any thing, I ſhall know whether
it be <hi>God's will</hi> or not: So that I ſhall never wiſh any
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59339:102"/>
thing, which ſhall not be accompliſhed: An I as it is
God's Perfection to have his will alway done (though
all his Laws be not obeyed,) ſo my Perfection ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in this likeneſs unto God, that my will ſhall be ſtill
fulfilled. And then Chriſt's promiſes will be perfectly
performed, <hi>Whatſoever ye ask the Father in my Name
he will give it you,</hi> Joh. 15. 16. &amp;. 16. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>. &amp;. 14. 13, 14. &amp;
15. 7. <hi>Ye ſhall ask what you will, and it ſhall be done
unto you:</hi> While their will was the ſame with the will of
Chriſt: But he ſaith not that it ſhall all be given us <hi>here:</hi>
we ask for Perfection, and we ſhall have it, but not here.</p>
               <p>§ 5. III. Yea my <hi>will</hi> it ſelf ſhall be my <hi>Fruition:</hi> For
it ſhall not be the <hi>will</hi> of one <hi>in need;</hi> a deſire of what
I <hi>want;</hi> for I ſhall <hi>want nothing:</hi> Therefore it is ſaid
that we ſhall <hi>Thirſt no more:</hi> But it will be a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency</hi>
in what I do <hi>poſſeſs:</hi> And in this alſo my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
will be the <hi>Image</hi> of God's perfection: Not but
that all Creatures ſtill <hi>Receive</hi> from God, and in that
ſenſe may be ſaid to <hi>need,</hi> in that they have nothing of
themſelves, but all by gift and communication from
him: But being ſtill and full <hi>poſſeſſours</hi> they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be ſaid to want<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Complacency</hi> in that which we
poſſeſs is <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in one act: And indeed
<hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are the ſame thing: To <hi>Love</hi> any thing
is to have that thing to be <hi>Pleaſing</hi> to my mind. Even
when it is <hi>wanted,</hi> it is thought on a <hi>pleaſing</hi> thing, and
therefore <hi>deſired;</hi> ſo that the <hi>deſiring</hi> act of the <hi>Will</hi> is
but a ſecond act occaſioned by want, and following the
firſt act, which is <hi>Complacency</hi> or ſimple <hi>Love.</hi> I <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi>
it becauſe I love it. Rightly therefore is the <hi>Will</hi>
itſelf called LOVE; for in the firſt act, <hi>Love, Will,</hi>
and <hi>Rational Appetite</hi> are all words of the ſame ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
My will therefore muſt needs be perpetually
full of perfect JOY, when <hi>enjoying Love</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:59339:103"/>
will be my <hi>will itſelf:</hi> Thus ſhall I have in me the
<hi>Spring of Living Waters;</hi> and the <hi>Comforter</hi> will then
perfectly do his work; when my conſtant <hi>will itſelf</hi>
ſhall be <hi>Comfort:</hi> well therefore is Glory ſaid to be the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erfection of ſanctifying Grace: when this Grace is
the beginning of that Love and Joy which Glory is
the Perfection of: And Perfection is the Spirits
work.</p>
               <p>§ 6. IV. And it will be much of my felicity that <hi>my
Will</hi> ſhall be <hi>confirmed and fixed in</hi> this conformity to
the will of God, and holy LOVE will be its <hi>Nature.</hi>
Now both underſtanding and will are ſo lamentably
mutable, that further than God promiſeth to uphold
us, we know not one day, what we ſhall think, judge
or <hi>Will</hi> the next. But when Love is as a fixed <hi>Nature</hi>
in us, we ſhall be ſtill the ſame, adhering to amiable
goodneſs, without intermiſſion or Ceſſation: It will be
as eaſy to us (and more) to love God and Holineſs, as
it is to the Hungry and Thirſty to love meat and drink,
or to the proud to love praiſe or domination; yea or to
any Man to love his life. And we ſhall be no more
<hi>weary</hi> of <hi>Loving,</hi> than the Sun is of ſhining, or than the
Hungry is of Feaſting, or a Friend of friendly love and
converſe: Nay the Compariſon is quite too low; for
all Creatures here have a fading vanity which wearieth
the ſatiated or failing Appetite; but there is no ſuch
thing in Heaven.</p>
               <p>§ 7. II. And as from the nature of that act, ſo much
more from the nature of the <hi>Object,</hi> my <hi>love</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be my happineſs: The <hi>Objects</hi> (which are as
the <hi>Matter</hi> of the act) will be theſe.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>GOD</hi> himſelf will be the full and everlaſting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of my Love. And he that could but underſtand
as well as thoſe in Heaven do, what this word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59339:103"/>
[<hi>to LOVE GOD and be BELOVED of him</hi>] would
ſay that there needs no other deſcription of perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs!
<hi>Perfect joyful Complacency in God</hi> is the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
which I deſire and hope for. This is my <hi>Felicity,</hi>
and <hi>much more.</hi> As I am the <hi>Agent</hi> of Love to <hi>God,</hi>
and the Object of <hi>God's Love</hi> to me, it is my <hi>Felicity:</hi>
As <hi>God</hi> is the ultimate <hi>Object of my Love,</hi> and the <hi>Agent</hi>
of his <hi>Love</hi> to me (that is, of the effects of it,) ſo it is
unſpeakably more high and <hi>excellent</hi> than to be <hi>my fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity:
Love</hi> is the cloſure of the <hi>Wills of God and Man:</hi>
And as it is God's <hi>part</hi> or <hi>intereſt (efficiently</hi> or <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively</hi>)
it is infinitely more excellent, than as it is
<hi>my part and intereſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 8. In GOD there is all that Love can deſire for
its full everlaſting Feaſt. 1. He is <hi>Infinitely good in
himſelf,</hi> that is <hi>moſt amiable:</hi> And the nature of Man's
will is to <hi>love Good as Good:</hi> Could we love God with
a Love that is adequate to the <hi>Object,</hi> we ſhould be
<hi>God our ſelves</hi> which is impoſſible; none but God can
adequately <hi>know God</hi> or <hi>Love him:</hi> In <hi>God's Love</hi> to
<hi>Himſelf,</hi> both the <hi>Act and Object are Infinite,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are both one, there being not that formally which
we know by the <hi>name of Act and Object;</hi> but [<hi>Act
and Object</hi>] are our analogical inadequate conceptions
of that <hi>Act</hi> of God which is his Eſſence. But in our
<hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> is <hi>finite</hi> and infinitely below the
Object: Yea, the <hi>Object</hi> which in <hi>reality <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

yet proximately as the <hi>eſſe Cognitum</hi> is the Object of our
Love, is <hi>finite there:</hi> It is the <hi>Conception</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> of God
in the Intellect, which is the proper and neareſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the <hi>Will:</hi> And this is as a Face in a Glaſs, a

And when thou ſhalt feel thy ſelf poſſeſt of perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,

Yea the remembrance of all his former Love; what he

how he called thee with a Holy calling, how he waſhed
thee in his Blood from all thy ſins, how he kindled in
thee thoſe deſires which tended to that perfect Glory,
how he renewed thy Nature, how he inſtructed, and
guided, and preſerved thee from thy Childhood, and
how many and how great ſins, enemies, dangers, and

Everlaſtingly to love him: Thus, (though he give the

and ſaying all manner of evil falſly of them, for

as they once falſly charged on Chriſt himſelf; this is the

When I think with what fervent love to God, to Jeſus

But the remnants of dividing Principles (viz. <hi>Pride,

Society with <hi>imperfect</hi> Saints is ſweet: The <hi>imperfect</hi>
Image of God upon them is amiable: But their frailties
here are ſo vexatious, that it is hard to live with ſome
of them in Peace. But perfect Love will make them
one, and O how delightful will that communion of Saints
be. I can never forget how ſweet God hath made the
courſe of my Pilgrimage, by the fragrancy and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of his Servants graces: How ſweet have my
boſom Friends been, (though mutable?) How ſweet
hath the Neighbourhood of the godly been? How
ſweet have the holy Aſſemblies? And how many hours
of comfort have I there had? How profitable have
their Writings, their Conference, and their Prayers
been? What then will it be to live in the union of
perfect Love with perfect Saints in Heaven for ever,
and with them concordantly to love the God of
Love?</p>
               <p>§ 18. III. And as the <hi>Act</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi> of LOVE
will conſtitute my <hi>felicity,</hi> ſo will my <hi>Reception</hi> from
the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and his Creatures be ſweeter to me
than my own activity can be: For it is <hi>Mutual Love</hi>
that makes it up. I ſhall not be the Fountain of my
own delights; nor can I act till I am acted, nor offer
any thing to God, but what I have firſt received from
him. And <hi>Receive</hi> I ſhall abundantly and continually,
and from thence ſhall overflow to God, and <hi>Receiving</hi>
and <hi>Returning</hi> (are now and) will be, the circular end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
motion, and our true perpetual Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>§ 19. I. All my Receivings ſhall be <hi>from God.</hi> His
LOVE is not a meer <hi>Immanent Will,</hi> nor a <hi>Wiſh</hi> which
toucheth not the Object: But it is what <hi>Heat</hi> is in or
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59339:107"/>
from the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Fire:</hi> It is an <hi>efflux of Goodneſs:</hi> It is
the moſt <hi>powerful, ſweet, communicating</hi> Principle or
Work. All <hi>Love</hi> is communicative; but none in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of Gods: As there is none primitive and ſimply
good but God. How much doth <hi>Love</hi> in the affairs of
men? All that is pleaſant in the World is it, or its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
Were it not for <hi>ſenſual Love</hi> there would be
no <hi>Generation</hi> of Man or Bruits: God hath made it a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating
Principle:</hi> Hatred cauſeth not congreſs, but
fighting with or flying from one another: Were it not
for <hi>Natural Love,</hi> Mothers would never endure the
pain, and trouble, and care, which is neceſſary to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Birth and Education: Were it not for <hi>Love,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
would never labour all their lives to leave their
Children well inſtructed and well provided for when
they are gone. My Food would not pleaſe me, did I
not <hi>love it,</hi> and I ſhould neglect it to the neglect of my
life: Did I not <hi>love my</hi> Books and Learning itſelf, I
ſhould never have beſtowed ſo much of Threeſcore
Years in poring on them, and ſearching for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as I have done: Did I not <hi>love</hi> my <hi>Houſe,</hi> my
<hi>Conveniences</hi> and neceſſaries I ſhould neglect them;
and they would be to me of ſmall uſe: Did I not
love my Friends, I ſhould be leſs profitable to them
and they to me: Did not I love my Life, I ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
it, and never have endured the labour and coſt
about it as I have done! If a Man love not his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
Poſterity and the common good, he will be as a
burdenſom Drone in the Hive, or as pernicious Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
What is done in the World that is good, but
by LOVE?</p>
               <p>And if <hi>created Love</hi> be ſo neceſſary, ſo <hi>active,</hi> ſo
<hi>communicative,</hi> how much more will the <hi>infinite Love</hi>
of the <hi>Creator be?</hi> His Love is now the <hi>Life</hi> of the

World: His <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>Life</hi> of Nature in the <hi>Living,</hi>
the life of <hi>Holineſs</hi> in Saints; and the life of glory in
the Bleſſed. <hi>In this infinite Love</hi> it is that <hi>I</hi> and all the
Saints ſhall <hi>dwell</hi> for ever more. And if <hi>I dwell</hi> in
LOVE, and LOVE in me, ſurely <hi>I</hi> ſhall have its ſweet
and plenteous communication; and ſhall ever drink of
the Rivers of Pleaſure. It is pleaſant to Nature to be

Love, in converſe and gifts, in plenty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
which may be ſtill expreſſing it to our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

infinite Eternal Love? He now ſhineth on me by the

is as through a Lanthorn, or the creviſes of my darkſom
Habitation: But then he will ſhine on me, and in me,

Alas how oft would Love have ſpoken comfortably to

               <p>Study this heavenly work of Love, O my Soul;
theſe are not dead or barren ſtudies: Theſe are not ſad,

preach of God, and Chriſt and heavenly Glory with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Love? But gazing upon the face of Love in Chriſt,
and taſting of its gifts, and looking up to its glorious
reign, is the way to kindle the Sacred Fire in thee.
Look upwards if thou wouldſt ſee the Light that muſt
lead thee upwards! It is not for nothing that Chriſt

that is <hi>every where,</hi> doth not every where <hi>glorifie his

ſome part of theſe: Mercy ſaw it good for me, as neceſſary
to prevent my more dangerous deceits and lapſes! And

that muſt make us like it, and kindle it in us
here: The burning Glaſs muſt be turned directly to
the Sun, if you will have it ſet any thing on fire.
There is a carnal or common love to God, which is
kindled in men by carnal pleaſures: But a <hi>Holy love</hi> like
that in <hi>Heaven</hi> muſt be ſtudiouſly fetcht from Heaven,
and kindled by the fore ſight of what is there, &amp; what we

thy God, and Saviour, and thy hopes: The fire that muſt
warm thee is in Heaven, and thou muſt <hi>come near</hi> it,
or open thy ſelf to its influence, if thou wilt feel its

§ 21. II. But though all my <hi>Receivings</hi> will be
from God, they will not be from him alone: We muſt
live in perfect Union alſo with one another, and with
all the heavenly Society; and therefore as we muſt love
them all, ſo ſhall we be <hi>beloved by</hi> them all: And this
will be a ſubordinate part of our bleſſedneſs: God
there will make uſe of ſecond cauſes, even in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
his Love and Glory.</p>
               <p>§ 22. 1. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt will not only be
the Object of our delightful love, but will alſo love us
with an effectual operative love for ever: His love will
be as the <hi>Vital Heat and Motion</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi> to all the
Members; the Root of our Life and Joy. The Love
of our Redeemer will flow out into us all as the Vital
Spirits, and his Face of Glory will be the Sun of the
heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and will ſhine upon us, and
ſhew us God: And in his light we ſhall have light.
Did his tears for a dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> make men ſay, Behold
how he loved him! O then what will the reviving
Beams of heavenly life, make us ſay of that love, which
filleth us with the pleaſures of his preſence, and turneth
our Souls into JOY it ſelf! He comforteth us now by
the teaching of his Word; but ſurely the fruition of
Salvation will be more gladding then the <hi>tidings</hi> of it!
When he that told us of Glory in his Goſpel ſhall give it
us, we ſhall not only <hi>believe</hi> but feel that he loveth us.</p>
               <p>§ 23. <hi>Believe,</hi> O my Soul, thy Saviours Love that
thou maiſt <hi>foretaſt</hi> it and be fit to <hi>feel</hi> it. We were
uncapable in ſinful Fleſh of ſeeing him otherwiſe than
as cloathed with Fleſh; and his conſolations were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
by a word of Promiſe ſuitable to his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
But when he withdrew his bodily preſence, the
Comforter was ſent with a fuller Conſolation: But all
that was but the earneſt and the firſt fruits of what he
will be to us for ever: Be not ſeldom, not unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59339:110"/>
nor ſlight in the thoughts of thy Saviours love;
for it is he that is the <hi>way</hi> to the Infinite love: Let thy
believing be ſo much of thy daily work, that thou
maiſt ſay, that he <hi>dwelleth in thy Heart by Faith,</hi> Eph.
3. 17. and that while thou liveſt here it is <hi>Chriſt
that liveth in thee; and that thy life</hi> in the <hi>Fleſh</hi> is not a

loved thee and given himſelf for thee,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. And

               <p>Look upon the Sun and think thus with thy ſelf,

What if all theſe beams of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat,</hi> were propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
beams of perfect <hi>Knowledge, Love,</hi> and <hi>Joy?</hi>
and that all Creatures that are under the Sun had from
its influx as much <hi>Wiſdom, Love,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> as they
have <hi>Light, Heat,</hi> and <hi>Motion:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> Would not then this
Earth be as a World of Angels, and a Heaven? O
what a bleſſed World would it be? And what a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor

ſuch will Jeſus Chriſt be to the Celeſtial World! He is
the Sun of Glory: His Influence will ſend forth LIFE,
and LIGHT and JOYFUL LOVE upon all the bleſſed
from the Face of the God, as the <hi>Sun</hi> ſends forth from
God, its <hi>Motion, Light,</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> upon this World.
Now therefore begin and live upon him: live upon the
influence of his Grace, his <hi>Teaching, Love-kindling,</hi>
and <hi>Quickning</hi> Grace, that thou maiſt have his Name
and Mark, and he may find in thee ſomething of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
or of his own, when thou comeſt to his Righteous

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59339:110"/>
It is not meet it ſhould be ſo: But he hath not
bid me ſeek and beg in vain: If he had never told
me that he will give it me, it is equal to a promiſe if he
do but bid me <hi>ſeek</hi> and <hi>ask:</hi> But I have more! He
teacheth me to pray: He maketh my Prayers: He
writeth me out a Prayer Book on my Heart: He giveth
me deſires, and he loveth to be importuned by them!
His Spirit is firſt a Spirit of ſupplication, and after of
Conſolation, and in both a Spirit of Adoption: ſo far
is he from being loth to be troubled with my importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that he ſeeketh to me to ſeek his grace, and is

ſhineth upon the Stars as well as on the Earth, and the
Stars on one another. If Angels are greatly uſeful to
me here, it's like they will be much more there, where
I ſhall be a more capable receiver. It will be no dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
to Chriſt's honour that he there maketh uſe of

The whole Creation will be ſtill one compaginated
frame; and the heavenly Society will for ever retain
their Relation to each other, and their aptitude and

And as we ſhall be far ſitter for them than here we are,
ſo ſhall we have far more comfort in them: How glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
will God ſhine in the glory of the Bleſſed? How
delightful will it be to ſee their Perfection in <hi>Wiſdom,
Holineſs, Love</hi> and <hi>Concord?</hi> What Voices they uſe, or
what Communication inſtead of Voices we ſhall ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know: But ſurely there is a bleſſed harmony of
<hi>Minds,</hi> and <hi>Wills,</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> All are not equal,
but all accord to love and praiſe their glorious God,
and readily to obey him, and perfectly to love each
other: There is no jarring or diſcordant Spirit that
is out of tune: no ſeparation or oppoſition to each
other! As God's love in Chriſt is our full and final hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;
ſo Nature which hath made us ſociable teacheth
us to deſire to be loved of each other: but eſpecially
by wiſe and worthy Perſons: Saints and Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
will love incomparably better than our deareſt
Friends on Earth can do; and better than they did them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
when we were on Earth: For they will love that beſt
which is beſt; and where there is moſt of God appearing:
Elſe it were not intellectual love! And therefore they will
love us as much better when we come to Heaven, as we
ſhall be better. If we go from loving friends on Earth,
we ſhall go to them that love us far more: The love of
theſe here doth but pitty us in our pains, and go weeping
with our Carkaſſes to the Grave: But the love of thoſe
above will joyfully convoy or welcome out Souls, to
their triumphing Society: All the holy Friends that we
thought we had loſt, that went before us, we ſhall
find rejoicing there with Chriſt.</p>

adheſion. Art thou a Lover of Wiſdom, and wouldſt
thou not be united to the Wiſe? Art thou a Lover of

united to the Holy who are made of Love? Art thou
a hater of enmity, diſcord and diviſions, and a Lover of

but it is One heavenly LIFE, and LIGHT, and LOVE
which is the true felicitating Union.</p>
               <p>We diſpute here whether the Aggregative Motion
of ſeparated parts (as <hi>in deſcenſu gravium</hi>) be from a

the <hi>whole,</hi> or by any <hi>external impulſe.</hi> It is like that
there is ſomewhat of all theſe: But ſure the greateſt
cauſe is like to do moſt to the effect: The body of the
Earth hath more power to attract a Cload or Stone,
than the intrinſick Principle to move it downwards:
But intrinſick Gravity is alſo neceſſary. The ſuperior
<hi>attractive Love</hi> and <hi>Lovelineſs</hi> muſt do more to draw
up this mind to God, than my intrinſick <hi>Holineſs</hi> to

would not be capable of feeling that attractive influx. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Grace cometh from God to fit and lead up my Soul

and Natural Conſtitution, which rendereth ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
<hi>Propriety</hi> neceſſary to us: Every Man hath his
own bodily parts, and inherent accidents, and every
Man muſt have his own Food, his own Place, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Acquiſitions; his own Children, and therefore
his own Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that the greateſt Perfection
is moſt for <hi>Community</hi> as far as Nature is capable of it,
God would ſhew us in making the firſt Receivers of the
extraordinary pourings out of his Spirit, to ſell all and
voluntarily make all <hi>common,</hi> none ſaying, This or

Law,</hi> but by the Law or Power of <hi>uniting Love:</hi>
They were firſt all as <hi>of one Heart and Soul,</hi> Act. 4. 32.</p>
               <p>Take not then thy inordinate deſire of <hi>Propriety</hi> for
thy <hi>Health,</hi> but for thy <hi>Sickneſs:</hi> Cheriſh it not, and
be not afraid to loſe it, and meaſure not the heavenly

And why elſe are Learned men ſo deſirous to propagate
their Learning, and Godly men ſo deſirous to make all
others wiſe and godly: It ſeemeth one of the greateſt
calamities of this life; that when a Man hath with the
longeſt, and hardeſt ſtudy attained to much knowledge,
he cannot bequeath it, or any part of it, to his Heir,
or any Perſon when he dieth, but every Man muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it for himſelf: And when God hath ſanctified
the Parents, they cannot communicate their Holineſs
to their Children (though God promiſe to bleſs them
on their account.) Much leſs can any Man make his
<hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Knowledge</hi> common: Nature and Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
us to deſire it: but we cannot do it. For this
end we Talk, and Preach, and Write; for this
end we ſtudy to be as plain and convincing and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
as we can, that we may make our <hi>Knowledge</hi> and
<hi>Affections</hi> as common to our Hearers and Readers as we
can: And O what a bleſſed work ſhould we take
<hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Writing</hi> for, if we could make them all
know but what we know, and love what we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading
them to love? There would then be no need of
Schools and Univerſities: A few Hours would do more
than they do in an Age. But alas, how rare is it for
a Father of excellent Learning and Piety, to have one
Son like himſelf, after all his induſtry!</p>
               <p>Is not the heavenly communion then deſirable,
where every Man ſhall have his <hi>Own,</hi> and yet his
Own be common to all others? My knowledge ſhall
be mine own, and other mens as well as mine: My
goodneſs ſhall be my own and theirs: My glory and

felicity ſhall be mine and theirs: And theirs alſo ſhall
be mine as well as theirs: The Knowledge, the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the Glory of all the heavenly Society, ſhall be <hi>Mine</hi>
according to my Capacity: Grace is the Seed of ſuch a
ſtate, which maketh us <hi>all one</hi> in Chriſt, (neither <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian,</hi>
nor <hi>Scythian,</hi> Circumciſion, nor Uncircumciſion,
Bond, nor Free;) by giving us to love our Neighbours
as our ſelves and to love both our Neighbours and our
ſelves for Chriſt, and Chriſt in all: Well might
<hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>All things yours,</hi> But it is here but as in the
Seed; the perfect union and communion is hereafter.
Earth and Heaven muſt be diſtinguiſhed: We muſt
not extend our hopes or pretenſions here beyond the
Capacity of our Natures: As perfect Holineſs and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
ſo perfect <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> is proper to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and is not here to be expected: The Papal preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of an impoſſible Union in one Governour of all the
Earth, is the means to hinder that Union which is poſſible.
But the ſtate of Perfection is the ſtate of perfect union
&amp; communion. Haſten then upwards, O my Soul, with the
ferventeſt deſires, and breath after that ſtate with the
ſtrongeſt Hopes; where thou ſhalt not be rich, and ſee
thy Neighbours poor about thee, nor be poor while they
are rich; nor be well while they are ſick, or ſick while
they are well: But their Riches, their Health, their
Joy will be all thine, and thine will be all theirs, as the
common Light; and none will have the leſs for the
participation of the reſt: Yea, <hi>Communion</hi> will be part
of every ones felicity: It conſtitueth the very being of

§ 3. And ſomwhat of them is particularly deſcribed

4. &amp; 4. 7, 11. &amp; 5. 13. &amp; 7. 12. &amp; 19. 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4,

activity and exultation as to Man in Fleſh is not to
be clearly underſtood, is not fit for us here to preſume
to determine: It will be ſomwhat more high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
than <hi>our vocal Praiſe,</hi> and <hi>Singing</hi> is; and of
which this beareth ſome analogical reſemblance or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
As all Paſſions earneſtly deſire vent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
ſo ſpecially do our holy affections, of Love,
Joy and Admiration of God Almighty! And there is
in us a deſire of communion with many in ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and expreſſions: Methinks when we are ſinging or
ſpeaking God's praiſe in the great Aſſemblies, with
joyful and fervent Souls, I have the livelieſt foretaſt of
Heaven on Earth: And I could almoſt wiſh that our
Voices were loud enough to reach through all the
World, and unto Heaven itſelf: Nor could I ever be
offended (as many are) at the Organs and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Muſick, ſoberly and ſeaſonably uſed, which
excite and help to tune my Soul, in ſo holy a work, in
which no true aſſiſtance is to be deſpiſed. No work
more comforteth me in my greateſt ſufferings, none
ſeemeth more congruous and pleaſant to me while I
wait for Death, than Pſalms and words of Praiſe to
God; nor is there any exerciſe in which I had rather
end my life: And ſhould I not then willingly go to
the heavenly Chore, where God is praiſed with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Love, and Joy, and harmony? Had I more of a
Praiſing frame of Soul, it would make me long more
for that Life of Praiſe. For I never find my ſelf more
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59339:117"/>
willing to be there, than when I moſt joyfully ſpeak or
ſing God's praiſe. Though the <hi>Dead praiſe not God in

Souls in Heaven do it joyfully, while their fleſhly

And though my ſins here make a loathed jar and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

pained Fleſh, I ſhall offer thee that which is more

<hi>Superiour Spirits</hi> will be of uſe to the Inhabitants of the

               <p>§ 5. But I think it not meet to venture here upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
conjectures beyond the revelation of God's
Word, and therefore ſhall add no more, but conclude
that God knoweth what uſe to make of us hereafter as
well as here, and that if there were no more for us to
do in Heaven, but with perfect Knowledg, Love and
Joy, to hold communion with God and all the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Society, it were enough to attract a ſenſible and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
Soul to fervent deſires to be at home with God.</p>
               <p>§ 6. And here I muſt not overpaſs my rejection of
the injurious opinion of too many Philoſophers and
Divines, who exclude all <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> from Heaven,
and acknowledge nothing there but <hi>Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will:</hi>
And this is becauſe they find <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> in the
Bruits, and they think that the ſouls of Bruits are but
ſome quality or periſhing temperament of Matter; and
therefore that <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> is in us no better.</p>
               <p>§ 7. But, 1. What felicity can we conceive of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>affection</hi> of <hi>delight</hi> or <hi>joy:</hi> Certainly bare <hi>Volition</hi>
now without theſe doth ſeem to be no felicity to us: Nor
knowledg neither, if there were no delight in knowing.</p>
               <p>§ 8. 2. Yea, I leave it to mens experience to judge,
whether there be now any ſuch thing in us as proper
willing which is not alſo ſome internal ſenſe of and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the good which we will? If it be <hi>Complacency</hi>
or the <hi>Pleaſedneſs</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> this ſignifies ſome <hi>Pleaſure,</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:59339:119"/>
and Love in the firſt act is nothing elſe but ſuch an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite:
If it be <hi>Deſire,</hi> it hath in it a <hi>Pleaſedneſs</hi> in the
thing deſired as in <hi>eſſe cognito,</hi> as it is thought on by
us; and what Love is without all ſenſe and affection?</p>
               <p>§ 9. 3. Why doth the Scripture aſcribe Love and
Joy to God and Angels if there were not ſome reaſon
for it? Doubtleſs there is great difference between the
heavenly Love and Joy, and ours here in the Body:
And ſo there is alſo between their knowledge and ours,
and their <hi>Will</hi> and ours: But it is not that theirs is leſs or
lower than ours, but ſomwhat more excellent, which ours
giveth us ſome analogical (or imperfect formal) notice of.</p>
               <p>§ 10. 4. And what though Bruits have <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
doth it follow therefore that we have none now? Or
that we ſhall have none hereafter? Bruits have Life:
And muſt we therefore have no Life hereafter, becauſe it

Bruits, and <hi>more.</hi> Is not God the <hi>Living God?</hi> Shall
we ſay that he liveth not becauſe Bruits live? Or rather
that they live a ſenſitive life, and Man a Senſitive and
Intellectual, becauſe God is Eſſential, Tranſcendent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Life, that makes them live.</p>
               <p>§ 11. 5. But if they ſay that there is no <hi>Senſation</hi> or
<hi>Affection</hi> but by <hi>bodily Organs,</hi> I anſwered before to
that; the Body feeleth nothing at all, but the Soul in
the Body: The Soul uniteth itſelf moſt nearly to the
<hi>Igneous-aereal</hi> parts called <hi>the Spirits;</hi> and in them it
<hi>feeleth, ſeeth, taſteth, ſmelleth,</hi> &amp;c. And that Soul
that feeleth, and ſeeth, doth alſo inwardly love, deſire,
and rejoice: And that Soul which doth this in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
hath the ſame <hi>power</hi> and <hi>faculty</hi> out of the Body:
And if they judge by the ceſſation of ſenſation when
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59339:119"/>
the Organs are undiſpoſed or dead, ſo they might as
well conclude againſt our future <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi>
whoſe operation in an Apoplexy, we no more perceive
than that of Senſe. But I have before ſhewed
that the Soul will not want exerciſe for its Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
faculties, for want of Objects or bodily Organs;
and that men conclude baſely of the ſouls of Bruits, as
if they were not an <hi>enduring ſubſtance,</hi> without any
proof or probability: And tell us idle dreams, that they
are but <hi>vaniſhing temperaments,</hi> &amp;c. which are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on another Dream, that FIRE (or the Motive-Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative-Calefactive
Cauſe) is no ſubſtance neither;
and ſo our unnatural Somatiſts know none of the moſt
excellent ſubſtances, which actuate all the reſt, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the more baſe and groſs which are actuated by

without underſtanding what any Living <hi>Active-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

what God doth with the ſouls of Bruits, (whether
they are only <hi>one common ſenſitive ſoul of a more common
Body,</hi> or whether <hi>Individuate</hi> ſtill and Tranſmigrant
from Body to Body, or what elſe:) Therefore they
make Ignorance a plea for Errour, and feign them to
be <hi>no ſubſtances,</hi> or to be <hi>Annihilate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 12. I doubt not but <hi>Senſation</hi> (as is aforeſaid) is
an excellent Operation of the Eſſential faculties of real
ſubſtances called <hi>Spirits;</hi> and that the higheſt and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
Creatures have it in the higheſt excellency: and
though God that fitteth every thing to its uſe, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>e. g.</hi> a Dog a more perfect Senſe of Smelling than
a Man, yet Man's internal Senſe is far more excellent
than the Bruits, and thereby is an advantage to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection,
Volition and Joy here in the Fleſh: And
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59339:120"/>
that in Heaven we ſhall have not leſs, but more, even
more excellent Senſe and Affections of Love and Joy, as
well as more excellent Intellection and Volition: but
ſuch as we cannot now clearly conceive of.</p>
               <p>§ 13. Therefore there is great reaſon for all thoſe
Analogical collections which I have mentioned in my
Book called, <hi>The Saints Reſt;</hi> from the preſent opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
and pleaſures of the Soul in Fleſh, to help our
Conceptions of its future pleaſures: And though we
cannot conclude that they will not unconceivably differ
in their manner from what we now feel, I doubt not
but <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>rejoice</hi> we ſhall, as certainly as <hi>Live</hi> (and
the Soul is <hi>Eſſential Life</hi>) and that our <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>Joy,</hi> will be unconceivably better.</p>

more than ſuch conviction neceſſary to bring up my

want of more lively <hi>fortaſts</hi> in a heavenly mind and

               <p>§ 2. There is a <hi>Special</hi> ſort of the <hi>Teaching of God</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:59339:120"/>
by which we muſt learn ſo to <hi>number our Days as to
apply our Hearts to Wiſdom:</hi> Without which we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
effectually, practically and ſavingly learn either this
or any the moſt common and obviouſ eaſie Leſſon. When
we have read, and heard, and ſpoken, and written the
ſoundeſt Truth, and certaineſt Arguments, we know
yet as if we knew not and believe as if we believed
not, with a ſlight and dreaming kind of apprehenſion,
till God by a <hi>ſpecial Illumination</hi> bring the ſame things
clearly to our Minds, and <hi>awaken</hi> the Soul by a ſpecial
<hi>ſuſcitation,</hi> to <hi>feel</hi> what we know, and <hi>ſuit</hi> the Soul to
the Truth revealed, by an influx of his Love, which
giveth us a pleaſing ſenſe of the Amiableneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
of the things propoſed. Since we ſeparated our
ſelves from God, there is a hedge of ſeparation between
our <hi>Senſes</hi> and our <hi>Underſtandings,</hi> and between our
<hi>Underſtandings</hi> and our <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> ſo that
the communion between them is violated, and we are
divided in our ſelves, by this Schiſm in our Faculties.
All men ſtill ſee the demonſtrations of Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
in the World and every part thereof;
and yet how little is God known. All men
may eaſily know that there is a God, who is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
Omniſcient, Goodneſs itſelf, Eternal, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent,
the Maker, Preſerver, and Governour of
all, who ſhould have our whole <hi>Truſt,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and
<hi>Obedience;</hi> and yet how little of this knowledge is to
be perceived in mens <hi>Hearts</hi> to themſelves, or in their
Lives to others? All men know that the World is <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
that Man muſt die, that Riches then profit not, that
<hi>time</hi> is precious, and that we have only this little time to
prepare for that which we muſt receive hereafter: And
yet how little do men ſeem to know indeed, of all ſuch
things as no Man doubts of? And when God doth
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59339:121"/>
come in with his powerful awakening <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi>
then all theſe things have another appearance of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

began to know them: Words, Doctrines, Perſons,
Things do ſeem as newly known to us.</p>
               <p>All my beſt Reaſons for our Immortality and future
Life, are but as the New-formed Body of <hi>Adam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God breathed into him the Breath of Life: It is he
that muſt make them <hi>Living Reaſons.</hi> To the Father
of Lights therefore I muſt ſtill look up, and for his
Light and Love I muſt ſtill wait; as for his bleſſing
on the Food which I have eaten, which muſt concoct
it into my living ſubſtance: Arguments will be but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted
Food, till God's effectual influx do digeſt
them. I muſt learn both as a <hi>Student</hi> and a <hi>Beggar:</hi>
when I have thought and thought a Thouſand times,
I muſt beg thy Bleſſing, Lord, upon my Thoughts,
or they will all be but <hi>dulneſs</hi> or <hi>ſelf-diſtraction.</hi> If
there be no <hi>Motion, Light,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> here without

and all its Thoughts will be uſeleſs or

O ſhine the Soul of thy Servant into a clearer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               <p>§ 3. 1. And why ſhould I ſtrive by the <hi>fears of
Death,</hi> againſt the common courſe of Nature, and
againſt my only hopes of Happineſs? Is it not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for all men once to die? Would I have God to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this determinate Courſe, and make ſinful Man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59339:121"/>
upon Earth? When we are ſinleſs we ſhall be
immortal. The love of life was given to teach me to
preſerve it carefully and uſe it well, and not to torment
me with the continual troubling foreſight of Death:
Shall I make my ſelf more miſerable than the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Bruits? Neither they nor I do grieve that
my Flowers muſt fade and die, and that my ſweet and
pleaſant Fruits muſt fall, and the Trees be uncloathed
of their beauteous leaves, until the Spring. Birds, and
Beaſts, and Fiſhes, and Worms, have all a ſelf-preſerving
fear of Death, which urgeth them to fly from danger:
But few if any of them have a <hi>tormenting</hi> fear ariſing
from the <hi>fore-thoughts</hi> that they muſt die. To the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
death</hi> is leſs troubleſom than ſleep: For in ſleep I
may have diſquieting pains or dreams: And yet <hi>I</hi> fear
not going to my bed. But of this before.</p>
               <p>If it be the miſery after Death that's feared, O what
have I now to do, but to receive the free reconciling
Grace which is offered me from Heaven, to ſave me
from ſuch miſery, and to devote my ſelf totally to him,
who hath promiſed, that thoſe that come to him he will
in no wiſe caſt out.</p>
               <p>§ 4 But this cometh by my <hi>ſelfiſhneſs:</hi> Had I ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
<hi>my duty,</hi> and then remembred that I am <hi>not mine
own,</hi> and that it is <hi>God's part</hi> and not mine to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of the duration of my life, I had been quiet from
theſe fruitleſs fears: But when I fell to my ſelf from
God, I am faln to <hi>care</hi> for my ſelf, as if it were my
work to meaſure out my Days, and now I truſt not
God as I ſhould do with his own. And had my reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and devotedneſs to him been more <hi>abſolute,</hi> my
truſt in him would have been more eaſy! But Lord,
thou knoweſt that I would fain be thine, and wholly
thine; and it is to thee that I deſire to live: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59339:122"/>
let me quietly Die to Thee, and wholly Truſt
Thee with my Soul.</p>
               <p>§ 5. II. And why ſhould my want of <hi>formal Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the future ſtate of <hi>ſeparated Souls,</hi> and my
ſtrangeneſs to the <hi>manner</hi> of their <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> and <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
induce me to doubt of thoſe <hi>generals,</hi> which are
evident, and beyond all rational doubting? That
Souls are <hi>ſubſtances,</hi> and <hi>not annihilated,</hi> and <hi>eſſentially</hi>
the ſame when they forſake the Body, as before, I doubt
not. Otherwiſe neither the Chriſtians <hi>Reſurrection,</hi>
nor the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> tranſmigration were a poſſible
thing. For if the Soul ceaſe <hi>to be,</hi> it cannot paſs into
<hi>another Body,</hi> nor can it re-enter into <hi>this?</hi> If God raiſe
this Body then it muſt be by <hi>another Soul!</hi> For the
ſame Soul to be <hi>Annihilated,</hi> and yet to begin again <hi>to
be,</hi> is a contradiction: For the ſecond beginning would
be by <hi>Creation,</hi> which maketh a <hi>new Soul,</hi> and not the
ſame that was before. It is the <hi>Inviſible</hi> things that
are excellent, active, operative and permanent: The
<hi>Viſible</hi> (excepting <hi>Light</hi> which maketh all things elſe
viſible) are of themſelves but lifeleſs droſs: It is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
part of Plants and Flowers which cauſeth all their
growth and beauty, their fruit and ſweetneſs: Paſſive
Matter is but moved up and down by the inviſible active
Powers, as Cheſs-men are moved from place to place
by the Gameſters hands: What a loathſom Corps were
the World without the inviſible Spirits and Natures that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate,
actuate or move it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To doubt of the being or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of the moſt excellent Spiritual parts of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when we live in a World that is actuated by
them, and where every thing demonſtrates them as
their effects, is more fooliſh than to doubt of the being
of theſe groſs materials which we ſee.</p>
               <p>§ 6. How oft have I been convinced that there are
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59339:122"/>
                  <hi>good Spirits</hi> with whom our Souls have as certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
(though not ſo ſenſible) as our Life hath with
the Sun, and as we have with one another? And that there
are evil and envious Spirits that fight againſt our Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Peace, as certain Narratives of Apparitions
and Witches, and too ſad experience of Temptations do
evince. And the marvellous diverſity of Creatures on
Earth, for kind and number, yea, the diverſity of
Stars in Heaven, as well as the diverſities of Angels, and
Devils, do partly tell me, that though All be <hi>of One,</hi>
and through One, and to One, yet <hi>abſolute Unity</hi> is the
divine Prerogative, and we muſt not preſume to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſuch Perfection, as to loſe our <hi>ſpecifique</hi> or <hi>numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
diverſity</hi> by any <hi>Union</hi> which ſhall befall our Souls.
Nor can I reaſonably doubt that ſo noble and active a
Nature as <hi>Souls,</hi> dwelling above in the lucid Regions,
in communion with their like, and with their betters,
ſhall be without the activity, the pleaſure, and felicity,
which is ſuitable to their <hi>Nature,</hi> their <hi>Region,</hi> and
their <hi>Company.</hi> And my Saviour hath entered into the
Holieſt, and hath aſſured me that there are many Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in his Fathers Houſe, and that when we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from the Body we ſhall be preſent with the Lord.</p>
               <p>§ 7. Organical ſight is given me for my uſe here in the
Body: And a Serpent or a Hawk hath as much or more
of this than I have: Mental knowledge reacheth
further than ſight, and is the act of a nobler Faculty,
and for a higher uſe: Though it be the Soul itſelf
embodied in the igneous Spirits that ſeeth, yet it is by
a higher and more uſeful Faculty, that it underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
And Faith is an underſtanding act: It knoweth
things unſeen becauſe they are revealed. Who can
think that all believing holy Souls, that have paſſed
hence from the beginning of the World, have been
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59339:123"/>
deceived in their Faith and Hope? And that all the

To ſay this, is to deny humanity, and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

Shall I not abhor every ſuggeſtion that containeth ſuch
inhumane abſurdities as theſe? Wonderful! that Satan
can keep up ſo much Unbelief in the World, while he
muſt make men ſuch fools, that he may make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers
and ungodly.</p>
               <p>§ 8. III. That my Soul is <hi>no more heavenly,</hi> and
my <hi>foretaſt</hi> of future Bleſſedneſs is ſo ſmall, is partly the
fruit of thoſe many wilful ſins, by which I have quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Spirit that ſhould be my Comforter: And it is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59339:123"/>
partly from our common ſtate of darkneſs and ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
while the Soul is in Fleſh, and operateth as the
Bodies form, according to its Intereſt and Capacity:
Affections are more eaſily ſtirred up to things ſeen, than
to things that are both unſeen, and known only very
defectively, by <hi>general,</hi> and not by <hi>clear diſtinct</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions.
And yet this, O this is the miſery and
burden of my Soul! Though I can ſay that I love
<hi>God's Truth</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> his <hi>Work,</hi> and his <hi>Servants,</hi>
and whatever of God I ſee in the World, and that this
is a love of God in his Creatures, Word and Works;
yet that I have no more <hi>deſiring</hi> and <hi>delightful Love</hi> of
<hi>Heaven,</hi> where his Lovelineſs will be more fully opened
to my Soul, and that the thoughts of my ſpeedy appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, are no more joyful to me, than they are, is
my ſin, and my calamity, and my ſhame: And if I
did not ſee that it is ſo with other of the Servants of
Chriſt, as well as with me, I ſhould doubt whether
affections ſo unproportionable to my Profeſſion, did
not ſignifie unſoundneſs in my belief. It is ſtrange and
ſhameful that one that expecteth quickly to ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
World, and to enter the Holy Celeſtial Society,
ſhould be no more joyfully affected with theſe hopes:
And that I ſhould make any great matter of the pain
and langiſhing and periſhing of the Fleſh, when it is
the common way to ſuch an end? O hateful ſin that
hath ſo darkned and corrupted Souls, as to eſtrange and
undiſpoſe them to the only ſtate of their hoped happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
Alas, what did Man when he forſook the Love
and Obedience of his God? How juſt it is that this Fleſh
and World ſhould become our Priſon, which we
would make our home, and would not uſe as our Lord
appointed us, as our Servant and way to our better
ſtate? Though <hi>our way</hi> muſt not be <hi>our home,</hi> our Father
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59339:124"/>
would not have been ſo ſtrange to us in <hi>the way,</hi> if we had
not unthankfully turned away from his Grace and Love.</p>
               <p>§ 9. It is to us that know not the Myſteries of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Wiſdom, the ſaddeſt thought that ever doth poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
our Minds, to conſider that there is no more Grace
and Holineſs, knowledge of God, and communion
with him in this World! That ſo few are Saints, and
thoſe few ſo lamentably defective and imperfect! That
when the Sun ſhineth on all the Earth, the Sun of
Righteouſneſs ſhineth on ſo ſmall a part of it, and ſo
few live in the Love of God, and the joyful hopes of
future Bleſſedneſs; and thoſe few have ſo low a meaſure
of it, and are corrupted and troubled with ſo many contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
affections. Infinite goodneſs is not undiſpoſed to do good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He that made us capable of Holy and Heavenly affections,
gave us not that Capacity in vain. And yet, alas, how little
of God and Glory taketh up the Hearts of men!</p>
               <p>But Man hath no cauſe to grudge at God! The
Devils before their fall were not made indefectible!
Divine Wiſdom is delighted in the diverſity of
his Works, and maketh them not all of equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.
Free will was to act its part! Hell is not
to be as good as Heaven! And ſin hath made Earth to
be next to Hell! So much Sin, ſo much Hell! What
is ſin but a willful forſaking of God? And can we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him and yet love him and enjoy his love! God's
Kingdom is not to be judged of by his Jail, or Gibbets.
We willfully forſook the Light, and made the World
a Dungeon to our ſelves! And when recovering Light
doth ſhine unto us, how unthankfully do we uſually
entertain it! We cannot have the conduct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of it while we ſhut our Eyes and turn away. And
what though God give not to all men an overcoming
meaſure, nor to the beſt ſo much as they deſire? The Earth
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59339:124"/>
is but a ſpot or point of God's Creation; not ſo much as
an Ant hillock to a Kingdom, or perhaps to all the Earth:
And who is ſcandalized becauſe the World hath an heap
of Ants in it, yea, or a Neſt of Snakes, that are not men!
The vaſt unmeaſurable Worlds of Light which be
above us are poſſeſſed by Inhabitants ſuitable to their
Glory! A Caſement or Creviſe of Light, or a Candle
in this darkſom World, is an unſpeakable Mercy! yea,
that we may but <hi>hear</hi> of a better World, and may ſeek
it in Hope! we muſt not grudge that in our Priſon we have
not that preſence of our King, and pleaſures of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as innocent and free Subjects have hope of Pardon, &amp;
of a ſpeedy deliverance are great Mercies to Malefactors.</p>
               <p>§ 10. And if my want of the Knowledge and Love
of God, and joyful communion with the heavenly So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
by my Priſon and as the Suburbs of Hell, ſhould
it not make me long for the Day of my Redemption, and
the glorious liberty of the Sons of God? My true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of deliverance, and of Holineſs and Perfection, are
my Evidences that I ſhall obtain them. As the <hi>Will</hi> is
the Sinner, ſo it is the obſtinate continuance of a <hi>Will</hi>
to ſin, which is the bondage, and the cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſin: And a continued Hell, is continued ſin,
as to the firſt part at leaſt: Therefore they that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in Hell, do continue in a ſinning Will, and ſo
continue in a Love and willingneſs of ſo much of Hell.
So far as God maketh us <hi>willing</hi> to be delivered from
ſin, ſo far we are delivered: And our initial imperfect
deliverance is the way to more. If pains then make
me groan for eaſe, and ſickneſs make me wiſh for
Health, why ſhould not my remnants of Ignorance,
Unbelief, and Strangeneſs to God, occaſion me to long
for the Day of my Salvation? This is the greateſt of
all my troubles: And ſhould it not then be the greateſt
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59339:125"/>
wearying burden from which I ſhould earneſtly deſire
to be eaſed: As Grace never doth hurt efficiently, and
yet may be ill uſed and do hurt <hi>objectively</hi> (as to
them that are proud of it) ſo ſin never doth good effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
and of itſelf, and yet <hi>objectively</hi> may do good:
For ſin may be the Object of Grace, and ſo to uſe it is
not ſin. My unbelief, and darkneſs, and diſaffection,
and inordinate love of this life, do of <hi>themſelves</hi> moſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my deſires of deliverance and of a better life; but <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively</hi>
what more fit to make me a weary of ſuch a
grievous ſtate? Were my unbelief and earthly mind
predominant, they would chain my affections to this
World; or if I were conſtrainedly weary of a miſerable
life, I ſhould have no comfortable hopes of a better.
But as it is the Nature of my ſin to draw down my
Heart from God and Glory, it is the nature of my
<hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to carry it upward, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the heavenly Perfection: Not to love <hi>Death,</hi> but to
love that which is beyond it. And have I been ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years in the School of Chriſt, learning both how to
live and die, begging and ſtudying for this Grace, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
it againſt this ſinful Fleſh, and ſhall I now after
all find <hi>Fleſh</hi> more powerful to draw me downward, than
Faith, Hope and Love to carry my deſires up to God!</p>
               <p>§ 11. <q>O God forbid! O thou that freely gaveſt
me thy Grace, maintain it to the laſt againſt its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and make it finally victorious! It came from
thee; it hath been preſerved by thee; it is on thy
ſide, and wholly for thee; O let it not now fail, and
be conquered by blind and baſe Carnality, or by the
temptations of a helliſh conquered Enemy! without
it I had lived as a Beaſt, and without it I ſhould die
more miſerably than a Beaſt! It is thine Image which
thou loveſt; it is a Divine Nature, and heavenly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59339:125"/>
Beam; what will a Soul be without it, but a <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi>
of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> a <hi>Devil</hi> for malignity, and <hi>dead</hi>
to Holineſs and Heaven? without it, who ſhall plead
thy Cauſe againſt the Devil, World and Fleſh?
without thy <hi>Glory</hi> Earth is but Earth; without thy
<hi>Natural Efficacy,</hi> it would be <hi>nothing;</hi> without thy
<hi>wiſe</hi> and potent <hi>Ordination,</hi> it would be but a <hi>Chaos;</hi>
and without thy <hi>Grace,</hi> it would be a <hi>Hell.</hi> O ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deny me the Light of the Sun, than the Light
of thy Countenance! Leſs miſerable had I been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> than without thy <hi>Grace.</hi> Without
thee and my Saviour's help I can do nothing; I did
not live without thee, I could not <hi>pray</hi> or <hi>learn</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thee; I never could conquer a temptation without
thee; and can I <hi>die,</hi> or be <hi>prepared to die</hi> without
thee? Alas! I ſhall but ſay as <hi>Philip</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>I
know not whither my Soul is going, and how then ſhall
I know the way.</hi> My Lord having loved his own in
the World, did love them to the end. Thou loveſt
fidelity and perſeverance in thy Servants, even thoſe
that in his ſufferings forſook him and fled, yet are
commended and rewarded by Chriſt, for continuing
with him in his temptations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 28. And wilt
thou forſake a ſinner in his extremity, who conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to thy Covenant, and would not forſake thee?
My God, I have often ſinned againſt thee, but yet
thou knoweſt I would fain be thine: I have not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thee with the reſolution, fidelity and delight, as
ſuch a Maſter ſhould have been ſerved, but yet I
would not forſake thy ſervice, nor change my Maſter
or my Work; I can ſay with thy Servant <hi>Paul, Act.</hi>
27. 23. that thou art the GOD WHOSE I AM,
and WHOM I SERVE; and O that I could ſerve
thee better! For to <hi>ſerve thee,</hi> is but to <hi>Receive thy
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59339:126"/>
Grace, and to uſe it for my own, and others good, and
ſo to glorifie thee, and pleaſe thy will,</hi> which being
LOVE it ſelf, is pleaſed beſt when we <hi>receive and
do moſt good.</hi> I have not loved thee as Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Love it ſelf, and fatherly Bounty ſhould
have been loved; but yet I would not forſake thy
Family; and nothing in this World is more my grief
than that I love thee no more; forſake not then a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that would not forſake thee, that looketh every
hour towards thee, that feeleth it as a piece of Hell
to be ſo dark and ſtrange unto thee, that gropeth, and
groaneth, and gaſpeth after thee; feeling to his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
ſorrow, (though thou art every where) that
while he is preſent in the body, he is abſent from the
Lord. My Lord, I have nothing to do in this World,
but to ſeek and ſerve thee; I have nothing to do
with a Heart and its affections, but to breath after
thee? I have nothing to do with my <hi>Tongue</hi> and

thy Glory and thy Will? What have I to do with all
my Reputation, and Intereſt in my Friends, but to
increaſe thy Church, and propagate thy holy Truth
and Service? What have I to do with my remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Time,</hi> even theſe laſt and languiſhing hours, but
to look up unto thee, and wait for thy Grace, and
thy Salvation? O pardon all my carnal thoughts,
and all my unthankful neglects of thy precious Grace,
and Love, and all my wilful ſin againſt thy Truth
and thee! and let the fuller Communications of thy
forfeited Grace, now tell me by experience that thou
doſt forgive me! Even under the terrible Law thou
didſt tell Man thy very Nature, by proclaiming thy
Name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34 6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59339:126"/>
goodneſs and Truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
iniquity, and tranſgreſſion and ſin;</hi> and is
not the <hi>Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> revealed in
the Goſpel for our more abundant Faith and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?
My God, I know, as I cannot Love thee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thy Lovelineſs, ſo I cannot Truſt thee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thy Faithfulneſs: I can never be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
confident of thy alſufficient <hi>Power,</hi> thy <hi>Wiſdom,</hi>
and thy <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> When I have ſaid, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 7.
<hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? and will he be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever?
doth his Promiſe fail to Generations? hath God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
to be gracious? hath he in anger ſhut up his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
mercies?</hi> Conſcience hath replied, that <hi>This is
my infirmity?</hi> I never wanted comfort, becauſe thou
wantedſt mercy, but becauſe I wanted <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
to <hi>receive</hi> it, and perceive it. But haſt thou not
mercy alſo to give me, even that <hi>Fitneſs,</hi> and that
<hi>Faith?</hi> My God, all is <hi>of thee,</hi> and <hi>through thee,</hi> and
<hi>all is to thee,</hi> and <hi>when I have the felicity,</hi> the Glory of
all for ever will be thine. None that truſteth in thee
(according to thy Nature and Promiſe) ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
If I can live and die in <hi>Truſting</hi> in thee, ſurely
I ſhall not be confounded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ 12. Why then ſhould it ſeem a difficult Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
how I may willingly leave this World, and my
Soul depart to Chriſt in Peace. The ſame Grace which
regenerated me, muſt bring me to my deſired end, as
the ſame Principle of Vegetation which cauſeth the
Bud muſt bring the Fruit to ſweet maturity. 1. BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEVE
and TRUST thy Father, thy Saviour, and
thy Comforter. II. And HOPE for the joyful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
of his Love, and for the bleſſed ſtate which
he hath promiſed. III. And long by LOVE for nearer
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59339:127"/>
                  <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with him; and thus, O my
Soul, thou mayeſt <hi>depart in Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. How ſure is the Promiſe of God? How ſuitable
to his Love, and to the Nature of our Souls, and to the
operations of every Grace? It is initially <hi>performed
here,</hi> whilſt our deſires are turned towards him, and
the heavenly ſeed and ſpark is here ingenerated in a
Soul that was <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>dark,</hi> and <hi>diſaffected.</hi> Is it any
ſtrange thing for <hi>Fire</hi> to <hi>aſcend?</hi> yea or the fiery Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Vegetation in a Tree, to carry up the earthy
matter to a great procerity? Is it ſtrange that Rivers
ſhould haſten to the Sea? Whither ſhould Spirits go
but to the Region, or World of Spirits? and whither
ſhould Chriſt's Members, and holy Spirits go, but to
himſelf, and the heavenly Society? And is not that a
more holy and glorious place and ſtate, than this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?
Earth is between Heaven and Hell; a place of
groſs and paſſive matter, where Spirits may indeed
operate upon that which needeth them, and where they
may be detained a while in ſuch operation, or as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
Forms, if not incarcerate Delinquents; but
it is not their <hi>center, end,</hi> or <hi>home.</hi> Even ſight and
reaſon might perſuade me, that all the noble Inviſible
powers that operate on this lower World, do princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
belong unto a higher; and what can <hi>Earth</hi> add
to their Eſſence, Dignity or Perfection?</p>
               <p>§ 13. But why, O my Soul, art thou ſo vainly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous,
to have formal, clear, diſtinct, conceptions of
the Celeſtial World, and the individuation, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of ſeparated Souls, any more than of the Angels?
While thou art the formal Principle of an animated
Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy conceptions muſt be but ſuitable to their
preſent ſtate and uſe: When thou art poſſeſſed of a
better ſtate, thou ſhalt know it as a poſſeſſor ought to do:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59339:127"/>
For ſuch a knowledge as thou lookeſt after, is part of
the poſſeſſion: And to long to <hi>Know</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> in
Clearneſs and Perfection, is to long to poſſeſs. It is thy
Saviour and his glorified Ones, that are comprehenſors
and poſſeſſors! And it is <hi>his knowledge</hi> which muſt now
be moſt of thy ſatisfaction. To ſeek his Prerogative to
thy ſelf is vain uſurping arrogance? Wouldſt thou be
a God and Saviour to thy ſelf? O conſider how
much of the <hi>fall</hi> is in this <hi>ſelfiſh care</hi> and deſire to be as
God, in knowing that of Good and Evil which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
not to thee but to God to know. Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
paſt doubt that there is a God of Infinite Perfection,
who is the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him:
Labour more to know thy duty to this God, and <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
Truſt him</hi> as to the particularities of thy felicity
and reward. Thou didſt truſt thy Parents to provide
thee food and raiment, when thou didſt but dutifully
obey them: Though they could have forſaken thee or
killed thee every hour, thou didſt never fear it. Thou
haſt truſted Phyſicians to give thee even ungrateful
Medicines, without enquiring after every ingredient, or
fearing leſt they ſhould wilfully give thee Poyſon! I
truſt a Barber with my Throat: I truſt a Boatman or
Shipmaſter with my life: Yea, my Horſe that might
caſt me; becauſe I have no reaſon to diſtruſt them,
(ſaving their inſufficiency and uncertainty as Creatures.)
If a Pilote undertake to bring thee to the <hi>Indies,</hi> thou
canſt truſt his conduct, though thou know thy ſelf,
neither the Ship, nor how to govern it, neither the
way, nor the place to which thou art conveyed. And
muſt not thy God and Saviour be truſted to bring thee
ſafe to Heaven, unleſs he will ſatisfie all thy enquiries,
of the individuation and operation of Spirits? Leave
unſearchable and uſeleſs Queſtions to him that can eaſily
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59339:128"/>
reſolve them, and to thoſe to whom the knowledge of
them doth belong. Thou doſt but entangle thy ſelf
in <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>ſelf-vexation,</hi> while thou wouldſt take God's
work upon thee, and <hi>wouldſt know that</hi> for thy ſelf,
which he muſt know for thee: Thy <hi>knowledge</hi> and
<hi>care</hi> for it, did not precede nor prepare for thy Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
nor for the motion of one Pulſe or Breath, or
for the Concoction of one bit of all thy Food, or the
continuance of thy life one hour; ſuppoſing but thy
care to <hi>uſe</hi> the means which God appointed thee, and
to avoid things hurtful, and to beg his Bleſſing. The
command of being <hi>careful for nothing, and caſting all
thy care on God, who careth for us,</hi> obligeth us in all
things that are <hi>God's part;</hi> and for our <hi>Souls</hi> as well as
for our <hi>Bodies:</hi> Yea, to Truſt him with the <hi>greateſt</hi> of
our concerns, is our greateſt duty; ſuppoſing we be
careful about our own part, <hi>viz.</hi> to uſe the means and
obey his Precepts. To diſpoſe of a departing Soul is
God's part and not ours! O how much evil is in this <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful
ſelf-providing Care!</hi> If I did but know what I
would know about my Soul and my Self; and if I
might but chooſe what condition it ſhould be in, and
be the final diſpoſer of it my Self, O what ſatisfaction
and joy would it afford me? And is not this to be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a God to my ſelf? Is he not <hi>fitter</hi> to <hi>know</hi> and
chooſe, and diſpoſe of me, than I am? I could <hi>Truſt</hi>
my ſelf eaſily, even my <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> in ſuch a Choice,
if I had but <hi>power.</hi> And cannot I <hi>truſt God</hi> and my
Redeemer, without all <hi>this care,</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi>
and all theſe particular enquiries? If you are convoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Child in a Boat, or Coach, by Water, or by
Land, and at every turn he be crying out [O Father, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we go? Or what ſhall I do? or I ſhall be drowned
or fall;] Is it not rather his <hi>Truſt</hi> in you, than the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59339:128"/>
ſatisfaction of his ignorant doubts, that muſt
quiet and ſilence him? Be not then fooliſhly diſtruſtful
and inquiſitive? Make not thy ſelf thy own diſquieter
or tormentor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by an inordinate care of thy own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Be not caſt down, O departing Soul, nor by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
diſquieted within me: Truſt in God, for thou
ſhalt quickly by experience be taught to give him
thanks and praiſe, who is the health of my countenance
and my God.</p>
               <p>§ 14. O what clear reaſon! What great experience
do command me to <hi>Truſt him? abſolutely</hi> and <hi>implicitly</hi>
to <hi>Truſt</hi> him, and to diſtruſt my ſelf.</p>
               <p>1. He is Eſſential Infinite Perfection, Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Love? There is in him all that ſhould invite
and encourage rational <hi>truſt,</hi> and nothing that ſhould
diſcourage it.</p>
               <p>2. There is nothing in any <hi>Creature</hi> to be truſted, but
God in that Creature, or God working in and by it.
Diſtruſt him and there is <hi>nothing</hi> to be truſted: Not the
Earth to bear me, nor the Air to breath in, much leſs
any mutable Friend.</p>
               <p>3. I am altogether his <hi>Own:</hi> His <hi>Own</hi> by right,
and his own by <hi>devotion</hi> and <hi>conſent:</hi> And ſhall I not
truſt him with his own.</p>
               <p>4. He is the great Benefactor of all the World,
that giveth all good to every Creature, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
nor by commutation, but as freely as the Sun giveth
forth its light: And ſhall we not truſt the Sun to ſhine?</p>
               <p>5. He is <hi>my</hi> Father and ſpecial Benefactor; and hath
taken me into his Family as his Child: And ſhall I not
truſt my heavenly Father?</p>
               <p>6. He hath given me his Son as the great Pledge of
his Love: And what then will he think too dear for me?
Will he not with him give me all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:59339:129"/>
7. His Son came purpoſely to reveal the Fathers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
Love, and purpoſe to ſave us: And ſhall I
not truſt him that hath proclaimed his Love and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
by ſuch a Meſſenger from Heaven.</p>
               <p>8. He hath given me the <hi>Spirit</hi> of his <hi>Son,</hi> even the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Adoption,</hi> which is the ſureſt Character of his
Child, the Witneſs, Pledge, and Earneſt of Heaven,
the Name, and Mark of God upon me, HOLINESS
TO THE LORD; and yet ſhall I not believe his
Love and Truſt him?</p>
               <p>9. He hath made me a Member of his Son, and ſo far
already united me to him: And will he not take care
of the Members of his Son? Will he loſe thoſe that are
given him? Is not Chriſt to be truſted with his Members.</p>
               <p>10. I am his <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>the intereſt</hi> of his Son:
Freely beloved; dearly bought! For whom ſo much
is ſuffered and done, that he is pleaſed to call us his
peculiar Treaſure. And may I not truſt him with his
dear bought Treaſure.</p>
               <p>11. He hath ſtated me in a relation to Angels, who
rejoiced at my Repentance, and to the heavenly Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which ſhall not miſs the ſmalleſt part: Angels ſhall
not loſe their joy, nor miniſtration.</p>
               <p>12. He is in Covenant with me; even the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghoſt: He hath given me many great
and precious Promiſes: And ſhall I fear leſt he will
break his Word or Covenant?</p>
               <p>13. My Saviour is the forerunner, entred into the
Holieſt, and there appearing and interceeding for me:
And this after he had conquered Death, and riſen again
to aſſure me of a future life, and aſcended into Heaven to
ſhew us whither we muſt aſcend; and that after theſe
comfortable words, SAY TO MY BRETHREN, I
ASCEND TO MY FATHER AND YOUR FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59339:129"/>
TO MY GOD AND YOUR GOD, <hi>Joh.</hi>
20. 17. And ſhall I not follow him through Death,
and truſt ſuch a Guide and Captain of my Salvation?</p>
               <p>14. He is there to prepare a place for me, and
will take me to himſelf? And may I not confidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it.</p>
               <p>15. He told a Malefactor on the Croſs, that he
ſhould that day be with him in Paradiſe, to tell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Sinners what they may expect.</p>
               <p>16. The Church by the Article of his <hi>Deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell,</hi> hath ſignified their common belief, that his
ſeparated Soul, had its ſubſiſtence and operation, and
did not ſleep or periſh, to tell us the Immortality of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
Souls.</p>
               <p>17. His Apoſtles and other Servants have on earth
ſerved him all with theſe expectations.</p>
               <p>18. The Spirits of the perfected Juſt are now in
poſſeſſion of what I hope for! And I am a follower of
them who by Faith and Patience have attained the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Felicity! And may I not truſt him to ſave me
who hath already ſaved Millions in this way? When I
could truſt a Ferriman to paſs me over a River, that
had ſafely paſſed over Thouſands before me: Or
I could truſt a Phyſician who cureth all that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh
of the ſame Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>19. I muſt be at his diſpoſal whether I will or not:
I ſhall live while he will, and die when he will, and
go whither he will: I may ſin and vex my Soul with
fears, and cares, and ſorrows, but I ſhall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt his will.</p>
               <p>20. Therefore there is no <hi>Reſt</hi> for Souls but in the
<hi>Will of God:</hi> That <hi>will created</hi> us, and that will did
govern us, and that will ſhall be fulfilled on us. It was
our <hi>Efficient</hi> and our <hi>Regent</hi> Cauſe, and it ſhall be our
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59339:130"/>
                  <hi>End.</hi> Where elſe is it that we ſhould reſt? In the will
of men, or Angels, or in our <hi>own wills?</hi> All Creatures are
but Creatures: And our <hi>own Wills</hi> have undone us:
They have miſgoverned us, and they are our greateſt
Enemies; our Diſeaſe, our Priſon, and our Death, till
they are brought over to the will of God: Till then
they are like a Foot out of joint; like a Child or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in Rebellion! There is no rectitude or health, no
order, no peace or true felicity, but in the Conformity
of our wills to the will of God. And ſhall I die in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful
ſtriving againſt his will, and deſiring to keep
up my own before it.</p>
               <p>21. What abundant experience have I had of God's
fidelity and love? and after all this ſhall I not <hi>truſt</hi>
him? His undeſerved Mercy gave me being, it choſe
my Parents; it gave them a tender love to me, and
deſire of my good; it taught them to inſtruct me early
in his Word, and to Educate me in his fear: It

gave me betimes a teachable ingeny: It choſe my
School-maſters: It brought to my Hands many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and ſuitable Books: It gave me ſome profitable
publick Teachers: It placed me in the beſt of Lands
on Earth; and I think in the beſt of Ages which that
Land had ſeen: It did early deſtroy all great expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and deſires of the World, teaching me to bear the
Yoak from my youth, and cauſing me rather to groan
under my infirmities, than to fight with ſtrong and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Luſts: It chaſtened me betimes, but did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
me. Great Mercy hath trained me up all my
daies, ſince I was Nineteen years of Age, in the School
of Affliction, to keep my ſluggiſh Soul awake in the
conſtant expectations of my change, and to kill my
Pride, and overvaluing of this World, and to lead all
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59339:130"/>
my ſtudies to the moſt neceſſary things, and as a Spur to
excite my Soul to ſeriouſneſs, and eſpecially to ſave me
from the ſupine neglect and loſs of <hi>time:</hi> O what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
Mercy hath a life of conſtant but gentle
Chaſtiſement proved to me? It urged me againſt all dull
delays, to make my Calling and Election ſure, and to
make ready my accounts as one that muſt quickly give
them up to God. The Face of Death, and nearneſs of
Eternity, did much convince me, what Books to read,
what ſtudies to perfer and proſecute, what Company
and Converſation to chooſe! It drove me early into the
Vineyard of the Lord; and taught me to preach as a
dying Man to dying men: It was Divine Love and
Mercy which made <hi>Sacred Truth,</hi> ſo pleaſant to me,
that my life hath been (under all my infirmities) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
a conſtant recreation and delight, in its diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
contemplation, and practical uſe: How happy a
Teacher have I had? What excellent help, and ſweet
illumination? How far beyond my expectation hath
Divine Mercy encouraged me in his Sacred work?
How congruouſly did he chooſe every place of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration,
and Habitation to this day, without my
own forecaſt or ſeeking? When and where ſince he firſt
ſent me forth, did I labour in vain? How many are
gone to Heaven, and how many are in the way, to
whom he hath bleſſed the Word which in weakneſs I
did by his Grace and Providence deliver? Many good
Chriſtians are glad of now and then an Hours time, to
meditate on God's Word, and recreate themſelves in
his holy worſhip; but God hath allowed and called
me, to make it the conſtant buſineſs of my life. My
Library hath afforded me both profitable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
company and help, at all times, when ever I
would uſe them. I have dwelt among the ſhining
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59339:131"/>
Lights, which the Learned, Wiſe, and Holy men of
all Ages have ſet up, and left to illuminate the World.
How many comfortable Hours have I had in the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of living Saints, and in the love of faithful Friends?
How many joyful Daies have I had in the ſolemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
where God hath been worſhipped with ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and alacrity, by concordant though imperfect
Saints. Where the Spirit of Chriſt hath manifeſted his
preſence, by helping my ſelf and my Brethren in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the People in ready delightful hearing, and
all of us in loving and gladly receiving his Doctrine,
Covenant and Laws? How unworthy was ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Worm as I (who never had any Academical helps,
nor much from the Mouth of any Teacher) that Books
ſhould become ſo great a Bleſſing to me, and that quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my own intentions, God ſhould induce or conſtrain
me to provide any ſuch like helps for others? How unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
was I to be kept from the multiplied ſnares of Sects
and Errours which reigned in this Age, and to be uſed as
a means for other mens preſervation and reduction: And
to be kept in a love of Unity and Peace: How unworthy
was I that God ſhould make known to me ſo much of his
reconciling truth, while extreams did round about prevail,
and were commended to the Churches by the advantages
of <hi>Piety</hi> on one ſide, and of worldly Proſperity and
Power on the other? And the God ſhould uſe me
above thirty Years in ſo comfortable a work as to plead
and write for Love, Peace and Concord, and to
vouchſafe me ſo much ſucceſs therein as he hath done,
notwithſtanding the general prevalency of the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
military Tribe. Mercy I have had in Peace, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in times of Violence: And Mercy I have had in
Wars, living two years in ſafety in a City of defence
in the very midſt of the Land, (<hi>Coventry,</hi>) and ſeeing
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59339:131"/>
no enemy while the Kingdom was in Wars and Flames;
and only hearing of the common Calamities round
about: And when I went abroad and ſaw the effects
of humane folly and fury, and of God's diſpleaſure,
he mercifully kept me from hurting any one, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hurt by any: How many a time hath he preſerved
me by Day and Night, in difficulties and dangers,
from the Malice of Satan, and from the Wrath of Man,
and from accidents which threatned ſudden Death:
While I beheld the ruines of Towns and Countreys, and
the Fields covered with the Carkaſſes of the ſlain, I was
preſerved and returned home in Peace. And O how great
was the mercy which he ſhewed me, in a teachable tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable,
peaceable, humble, unanimous People? So many
in number, and ſo exemplary in quality; who to this Day
keep their Integrity and Concord, when violence hath
ſeparated me from them <hi>Twenty two</hi> years: Yea, the like
Mercy of acceptance and ſucceſs beyond my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he hath ſhewed me every where I have had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of free miniſtration; even where there were many
Adverſaries I have had an open Door, in the midſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Wrath and Rage, he hath preſerved my Liberty
beyond expectation, and continued my acceptance and
ſucceſs. When I might not ſpeak by Voice to any
ſingle Congregation, he enabled me to ſpeak by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
to many; and for the ſucceſs of my plaineſt &amp; popular
writings, which coſt me leaſt, I can never be ſufficiently
thankful: Some of which he ſent to preach abroad in
other Languages in forreign Lands. When my Mouth
with Eighteen hundred or Two thouſands more had
been many years ſtopped, he hath ſince opened them
in ſome degree; and the ſufferings intended us by men
have been partly put by, and partly much alleviated
by his Providence, and the hardneſs of our Terms hath
not ſo much hind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59339:132"/>
feared, and as others hoped it would have done. I
have had the comfort of ſeeing ſome <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi>
and <hi>Proſperity</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> kept up, under the
utmoſt oppoſition of diabolical and humane <hi>Power, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,</hi>
and <hi>Wrath:</hi> When I have been ſent to the
common Jail for my ſervice and obedience to him, he
hath there kept me in peace, and ſoon delivered me.
He hath made the Mouths of my greateſt Enemies who
have ſtudied my defamation and my ruine, to become
my Witneſſes and Compurgators, and to croſs their own
deſigns: How wonderful is it that I ſhould ſo long dwell
in ſo much peace, in the midſt of thoſe that ſeemed to
want neither <hi>Power</hi> nor <hi>Skill,</hi> and much leſs <hi>Will,</hi> to
tread me down into contempt and miſery? And O
how many a danger, fear and pain hath he delivered
this frail and languiſhing Body from? How oft hath he
ſuccoured me, when Fleſh, and Heart, and Art have failed?
He hath cured my conſuming Coughs, and many a time
ſtayed my flowing Blood; he hath eaſed my pained
Limbs, and ſupport'd a weary macerat'd Skeleton: He hath
fetcht me up from the Jaws of Death, and reverſed the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
which men have paſſed on me: How many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
weary days have been ſweetned with his pleaſant
work? And how many Thouſand painful weary Nights
have had a comfortable Morning? How many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ſtrong and healthful Perſons have been taken away
by Death, whilſt I have been upheld under all this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
Many a time have I cryed to the Lord in my
trouble and he hath delivered me out of my diſtreſs?
I have had Forty years added to my Daies, ſince I
would have been full glad of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s promiſe of
Fifteen? Since the day that I firſt preached his Goſpel,
I expected not of long time to live above a Year; and
I have lived ſince then Forty years; when my own
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59339:132"/>
Prayers were cold and unbelieving how many Hundreds
have prayed for me: And what ſtrange deliverances,
encouraging Faſting and Prayer have I oft had, upon
their importunate requeſts? My Friends have been
faithful, and the few that proved unfaithful have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
taught me, to place no confidence in Man, and
and not to be inordinately affected to any thing on
Earth; for I was forſaken by none of them, but thoſe
few that I exceſſively valued and overloved: My Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
have been comfortable to me, contrary to my
deſerts, and much beyond my expectations: My Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
have been faithful: My Neighbours have been
kind: My Enemies have been impotent, harmleſs or
profitable: My Superiours have honoured me by their
reſpectful words, and while they have afflicted me, as
ſuppoſing me a <hi>remora</hi> to their deſigns, they have not
deſtroyed, but protected me! To my inferiours God
hath made me in my low capacity ſomwhat helpful?
I have been protected in ordinary health and ſafety,
when the raging Peſtilence came near my Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and conſumed an Hundred thouſand Citizens!
My dwelling hath been ſafe when <hi>I</hi> have ſeen the glory
of the Land in flames, and after beheld the diſmal
ruines! When violence ſeparated me from my too
much beloved Library, and drove me into a poor and
ſmoaky Houſe, <hi>I</hi> never had more help of God, nor
did more difficult work than there! What pleaſant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements
and quietneſs in the Countrey have been the
fruits of perſecuting Wrath? And <hi>I</hi> muſt not forget,
when <hi>I</hi> had more publick liberty, how he ſaved me
and all my Hearers, even by a wonder from being
buried in the ruines of the Fabrick where we were; and
others from the Calamitous, Scandal, and Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which would elſe have followed: And it is not a

by the backbiting of angry dividers of all ſorts,
and by the calumniating accuſations of ſome that were
too high to be gain-ſaid, and would not endure me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

and procure any common belief, nor to bring me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>Theſe, all theſe, and very many more than theſe,
are my <hi>Experiences</hi> of that wondrous MERCY which
hath meaſured my Pilgrimage, and filled up my daies.
Never did God break his Promiſe with me! Never did
he fail me nor forſake me: Had I not provoked him
by raſh and wilful ſinning, how little Interruption of
my peace and comforts, had I ever been likely to have
had. And ſhall I now <hi>diſtruſt</hi> him at the laſt? Shall I not
<hi>Truſt,</hi> and quietly <hi>Truſt,</hi> that Infinite <hi>Wiſdom, Love,</hi> and

But fly not from him that is Goodneſs, Love and Joy

And if he be for thee, and juſtifie and love thee, who

us that which he never meaneth to perform: He
hath laid the rudiments of our hope, in a <hi>nature</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of deſiring, ſeeking, and thinking of another life:
He hath called me by Grace, to actual deſires and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours:
And ſome foretaſts he hath vouchſafed: I
look for no Heaven, but the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Divine Life,
Light,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> in endleſs Glory with Chriſt and his
holy Ones: And this he hath begun in me already:
And ſhall I not boldly hope when I have the capacity,
the promiſe, and the earneſt and foretaſt? Is it not God
himſelf that hath cauſed me to hope; was not <hi>Nature,
Promiſe,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> from him? And can a Soul miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and be deceived, that departeth hence in a hope of
God's own cauſing and encouraging? Lord, I have
lived in hope? I have prayed in hope: I have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſuffered and waited in hope: And by thy Grace I
will die in hope? And is not this according to thy
Word and Will? And wilt thou caſt away a Soul that
hopeth in thee, by thine own <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Operation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Had Wealth and Honour, or continuance on Earth, or the
favour of Man, been my reward &amp; hope, my hope &amp; I had
died together: Were this our beſt, how vain were Man?
But the Lord liveth, and my Redeemer is glorified and
interceedeth for me! And the ſame Spirit is in Heaven,
who is in my Heart; (As the ſame Sun is in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is in my Houſe:) And the Promiſe is ſure
to all Chriſt's Seed: And Millions are now in Heaven,
that once did live and die in hope; they were Sinners
once as now I am: They had no other Saviour, no
other Sanctifier, no other Promiſe than I now have, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
that they were Strangers here, they looked for
a better Countrey, and for a City that had Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59339:137"/>
even a heavenly where now they are: And ſhall
I not follow them in hope that have ſped ſo well?
Hope then O my Soul unto the end, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13.
From henceforth and for ever hope in the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
131. 13. I will hope continually, and will yet praiſe thee
more and more; my Mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs

is at my right Hand; I ſhall not be moved: My

               <p>III. What then remaineth, O my Soul, but that in
TRUST and HOPE thou LOVE thy God, thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
thy Comforter, the Glorious Society, thy own
Perfection in Glorious, Endleſs, Heavenly Life, and Light,
and Love, and the Joyful Praiſes of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> better then
this burden of painful and corruptible Fleſh, and this
howling Wilderneſs, the Habitation of Serpents and
untamed Bruits, where unbelief and murmuring, Luſt
and Folly, Injuſtice and Uncharitableneſs, Tyranny
and Diviſions, Pride and Contention, have long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
God, and wearied thee? Where the Vintage
and Harveſt is Thorns and Thiſtles, Sin and Sorrows,
Cares and Croſſes, manured by manifold Temptations!
How odious is that <hi>darkneſs</hi> and unbelief, that unholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and <hi>diſaffection,</hi> that <hi>deadneſs</hi> and ſtupidity, which
maketh ſuch a work as this, ſo reaſonable, neceſſary,
and pleaſant a work, to ſeem unſuitable or hard! Is it
unſuitable or hard to the Eye to ſee the Sun and Light?
Or by it to ſee the beautified World? Or for a Man to
love his Life or Health; his Father or his Friend?
What ſhould be eaſier to a Nature that hath rational
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59339:137"/>
LOVE, than to Love him, that is Eſſential LOVE it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
He that loveth all, and giveth to all the Loving
faculty, ſhould be loved by all: And he that hath ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
loved me ſhould be ſpecially loved by me?</p>
               <p>Love is the Perfection of all thy Preparations: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
to <hi>Pleaſe God;</hi> and therefore to be in the moſt
<hi>pleaſing ſtate,</hi> and freed from all that is diſpleaſing to
him; which is not to be hoped for on Earth: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
all ſuitable nearneſs, acquaintance, union and
communion: It is weary of diſtance, eſtrangedneſs, and
alien ſociety, and affairs: It taketh advantage of every
notice, intimation, or mention of God, to renew
and exerciſe theſe deſires: Every Meſſage, and Mercy
from him is fewel for Love, and while we are ſhort of
Perfection ſtir up our deſires after more! When Love
taſteth of the Grapes it would have the Vine: When
it taſteth of the Fruits it would dwell where they
grow, and poſſeſs the Land! Its thoughts of Proximity
and fruition are ſweet. No other Perſon or Thing can
ſatisfie it. The Soul is where it loveth: If our Friend
dwell in our Hearts by Love; and if fleſhly Pleaſure,
Riches, and Honour, do dwell in the Heart of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous,
the Covetous, and the Proud, ſurely God
and our Redeemer, the heavenly Society, Holineſs,
and Glory, do dwell in the Heart which loveth them
with a fervent Love! And if Heaven dwell in my
Heart, ſhall I not deſire to dwell in Heaven? Light
and Light, Fire and Fire are not more inclined to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then Love and Love; Gracious Love, and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Love: Would Divine Original, Univerſal LOVE,
communicate and pour out itſelf more plentifully upon
my Heart, how eaſy would it be to leave this Fleſh and
World? And to hear the Sentence of my departure to
my God? Death and the Grave would be but a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59339:138"/>
for victorious Love: It would be eaſier to die in
Peace and Joy, than to reſt at Night, or to come
home from my Travel to my beloved Friends, or to
go when I am hungry to a Feaſt: A Little Love hath
made me ſtudy willingly, and preach willingly, and
write willingly, yea, and ſuffer ſomwhat willingly;
and would not more make me go more willingly to
God? Shall the imagination of Houſe, Gardens,
Walks, Libraries, Proſpects, Meadows, Orchards,
Hills, and Rivers, allure the deſires of deceived Minds?
And ſhall not the Thoughts of the heavenly Manſions,
Society and Delights, much more allure and draw up
my deſires? The reading of a known Fiction of a <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas
Solis,</hi> an <hi>Utopia,</hi> an <hi>Atlantis,</hi> &amp;c. hath pleaſed
many: But if I did believingly hear of ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
in the World, where men did never die, nor were
ſick, or weak or ſad, where the Prince were perfectly
juſt and pious, wiſe and peaceable, devoted to God and
the publick good; and the Teachers were all wiſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
men, of Univerſal certain knowledge, perfectly
acquainted with the Matter and Method of Natural
and Theological Truths, and all their duty, and all
of one Mind, and of one Heart, and Tongue and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
loving each other, and the People as themſelves,
and leading the Flocks heavenward through all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
with triumphant hopes and joy; where all the
People perfectly obeyed God, their <hi>Commanders</hi> and
their <hi>Teachers,</hi> and lived in perfect Love, Unity, and
Peace, and were daily employed in the joyful praiſes
of God and hopes of Glory, and in doing all poſſible
good to one another, contending with none through
ignorance, uncharitableneſs or pride, nor ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
injuring or hurting one another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay,
if I knew or heard of ſuch a Countrey, ſhould I not
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59339:138"/>
love it before I ever ſee it, and earneſtly deſire to be
there? Nay, do I not over-love this diſtracted World,
where Tyranny ſheddeth ſtreams of Blood, and layeth
deſolate Cities and Countries, and expoſeth the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Inhabitants to lamentable Diſtreſs and Famine;
where the ſame Tyranny ſets up the Wicked, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth
and oppreſſeth the Juſt and Innocent, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out the Goſpel, and keepeth up Idolatry, Infidelity,
and Wickedneſs in the far greateſt part of all the Earth;
where Satan chooſeth Paſtors too often for the Churches
of Chriſt, even ſuch as by Ignorance, Pride, Senſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Worldlineſs, and Malignity, become Thorns
and Thiſtles, yea, devouring Wolves, to thoſe whom
they ſhould feed and comfort; where no two Perſons
are in all things of a Mind; where Evil is commended,
and Truth, and Goodneſs accuſed and oppreſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
mens Minds are unacquainted with them or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable
to them: And thoſe that are the greateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to Truth, do moſt eagerly contend againſt it
and oppoſe it; and almoſt all the World are ſcolding
or ſcuffling in the Dark: And where there appeareth but
little hopes of a remedy: I ſay, can I love ſuch a World
as this? And ſhall I not think more delightfully of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the Saints in Light, and the uniting Love
and joyful praiſes of the Church triumphant and the
heavenly Chore?</p>
               <p>Should I not love a Lovely and a <hi>Loving World</hi> much
better than a World where there is comparatively <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

little <hi>Lovelineſs</hi> or <hi>Love?</hi> All that is of God is Good
and Lovely: But it is not here that his <hi>Glory</hi> ſhineth in
felicitating Splendor: I am taught to look upward
when I pray, and to ſay, <hi>Our Father which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
God's works are amiable even in Hell; and yet

And, alas, how much of the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> are

which they are worſe to one another than Wolves or
Tigers, depopulating Countries, and filling the
World with Bloodſhed, Famine, Miſery, and Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
proud Tyrants being worſe than raging
Plagues; (which made <hi>David</hi> chooſe the Peſtilence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Enemies purſuit:) Here is much of God's beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
order, and harmony: But here is alſo much of
Man's madneſs, deformity and confuſion. Here is
much hiſtorical Truth, and ſome Civil and Eccleſiaſtick
Juſtice; but, alas, with how much odious falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and injuſtice is it mixed? Here is much precious
Theological Verity: But how dark is much of it to
ſuch blind and negligent and corrupted minds, as every
where abound: Here are wiſe judicious Teachers and
Companions to be found; but, alas, how few in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of the moſt? And how hardly <hi>known</hi> by
thoſe that need them? Here are Sound and Orthodox
Miniſters of Chriſt: But how few that moſt need them
know which are they, and how to value them or uſe them?
And how many Thouſands of ſeduced or ſenſual Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are made believe that they are but Deceivers, or
as they called <hi>Paul,</hi> peſtilent fellows, and movers of
Sedition among the People: And in how many parts

Prophets, or the <hi>Baalites?</hi> Though ſuch as of
whom the <hi>World is</hi> not <hi>worthy.</hi> (And is that World
then more worthy of any love than Heaven?) There
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59339:139"/>
are Worthy and Religious Families which honour God,
and are honoured by him: But, alas, how few? And
uſually by the temptations of Wealth and Worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
how full even of the ſins of <hi>Sodom, Pride, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Bread, and abundance of Idleneſs,</hi> if not alſo <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs</hi>
to the Poor: And how are they tempted to
plead for their ſins and ſnares, and account it ruſtick
Ignorance which contradicteth them: And how few
Pious Families are there of the greater ſort that do not
quickly degenerate, and Poſterity by falſe Religion,
Errour or Senſuality, grow moſt contrary to the minds
of their Pious Progenitors? There are many that edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
their Children wiſely in the fear of God, and have
accordingly comfort in them: But how many are there
that having devoted them in Baptiſm to God, do train
them up in the ſervice of the Fleſh, the World, and
the Devil, which they renounced, and never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
or at leaſt intended, for themſelves, or Children,
what they did profeſs: How many Parents think, that
when they offer their Children to God in Baptiſm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſober and due conſideration of the nature and
meaning of that great Covenant with God, that God
muſt accept and certainly regenerate and ſave them?
Yea, too many Religious Parents forget, that they
themſelves are Sponſors in that Covenant, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to uſe the means on their part, to make their
Children ſit for the Grace of the son, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Spirit, as they grow up, and think God
ſhould abſolutely ſanctifie, keep and ſave them at Age,
becauſe they are <hi>theirs</hi> and were Baptized, though
they keep them not from great and unneceſſary temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
nor teach them plainly and ſeriouſly the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Covenant which was made for them with
God as to the nature, benefits or conditions of it: How
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59339:140"/>
many ſend them to others to be taught in Grammar,
Logick, Philoſophy, or Arts; yea, and Divinity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their own Parents ever taught them, what they
did with God in Baptiſm, what they <hi>received?</hi> And
what they promiſed and vowed to do? They ſend
them to Trades, or ſecular Callings, or to travel in
forreign Lands, among a Multitude of Snares, among
tempting Company, and tempting Baits, before ever
at home they were inſtructed, armed, and ſettled
againſt thoſe Temptations which they muſt needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
and which if they overcome them, they are
undone: How ordinarily when they have firſt negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
this great duty of their own for their fortification,
do they plead a neceſſity of thruſting them out on theſe
temptations, though utterly unarmed from ſome Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio
of <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> to avoid
the Contempt of worldly men, or to adorn their (yet
naked) Souls, with ſome of the Plumes or painted
Trifles, Ceremonies or Complements, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſerve inſtead of heavenly Wiſdom, Mortification,
and the Love of God and Man: As if they were like
to learn that fear of God in a croud of diverting and
tempting Company, Baits and Buſineſs, which they
never learnt under the teaching, nurture and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overſight of their religious Parents in a ſafer ſtation:
Or as if for ſome little reaſon they might ſend them as
to Sea without Pilot or Anchor, and think that God
muſt ſave them from the Waves: Or as if it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to enter them into Satans School or Army, and
venture them upon the notorious danger of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
than miſs of Preferment and Wealth, or of the
Faſhions and Favour of the Times? And then when
they hear that they have forſaken God, and true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and given up themſelves to Luſt and Senſuality,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59339:140"/>
and perhaps as Enemies to God and good men, deſtroy
what their Parents laboured to build up, theſe Parents
wonder at God's Judgments, and with broken Hearts
lament their infelicity, when it were better to lament
their own miſdoing, and it had been beſt of all to have
prevented it.</p>
               <p>Thus Families, Churches and Kingdoms run on to
blindneſs, ungodlineſs and confuſion: Self-undoing and
ſerving the malice of Satan, for fleſhly Luſt, is the too
common employment of Mankind: All is wiſe, and
good, and ſweet which is preſcribed us by God, in
true <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Supernatural revelation:</hi> But folly, ſin,
and miſery, miſtaking themſelves to be <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,</hi>
and <hi>Proſperity,</hi> and raging againſt that which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally
they pretend to and profeſs, are the ordinary
caſe and courſe of the moſt of men: And when we
would plead them out of their deceit and miſery, it's well
if we are not tempted to imitate them, or be not partly
infected with their Diſeaſe, or at leaſt reproached and
oppreſſed as their Enemies: Such a <hi>Bedlam</hi> is moſt of
the World become, where madneſs goeth for the only
Wiſdom, and he is the braveſt Man that can ſin and be
damned with reputation and renown, and ſucceſsfully
drive or draw the greateſt number with him unto
<hi>Hell:</hi> To which the World hath no ſmall likeneſs,
forſaking God, and being very much forſaken by him.</p>
               <p>This is the World which ſtandeth in competition
for my Love, with the Spiritual bleſſed World: Much
of God's Mercies and Comforts I have here had: But
their ſweetneſs was their taſte of Divine Love, and
their tendency to heavenly Perfection. What was the
end and uſe of all the Good that ever I ſaw, or that
ever God did for my Soul or Body, but to teach me to
<hi>Love</hi> him, and to long for more? How many weaning
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59339:141"/>
experiences? How many Thouſand bitter or contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Thoughts have I had of all the glory and pleaſures
of this World? How many Thouſand love tokens
from God have called me to believe and taſte his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
Where ever I go, and which way ſoever I look,
I ſee VANITY and VEXATION written upon all
things in this World, ſo far as they ſtand in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God, and would be the end and portion of a
fleſhly Mind: And I ſee HOLINESS TO THE
LORD written upon every thing, ſo far as it declareth
God and leadeth me to him as my ultimate end. God
hath not for nothing engaged me in a War againſt this
World, and commanded me to take and uſe it as mine
Enemy: The <hi>emptineſs, dangerouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>bitterneſs</hi>
of the World, and the <hi>All-ſufficiency, Truſtineſs,</hi> and
<hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God have been the Summ of all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
of my life? And ſhall a worldly backward
Heart overcome the teachings of Nature, Scripture, the
Spirit of Grace, and all Experience? Far be it from
me!</p>
               <p>But, O my God, LOVE is thy great and ſpecial
gift: All Good is from thee: But LOVE is the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<hi>Nature, Life,</hi> and <hi>Image:</hi> It is given us from the
Love of the Father, the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Son, and the
quickning, illuminating and ſanctifying Operation of the
Holy Spirit: What can the Earth return unto the Sun
but its own reflected Beams? (If thoſe.) As how far
ſoever Man is a <hi>Medium</hi> in Generation, <hi>Nature</hi> and
that <hi>Appetite</hi> which is the <hi>moving pondus</hi> in the Child
is thy work; ſo whatever is <hi>Man's</hi> part in the <hi>Mediate</hi>
work of <hi>Believing</hi> and <hi>Repenting,</hi> (which yet is not done
without thy Spirit and grace,) certainly it is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Regenerator which muſt make us New Creatures by
giving us this <hi>Divine Nature, holy LOVE,</hi> which is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59339:141"/>
the holy <hi>Appetite</hi> and <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Soul. Come
down, Lord, into this Heart, for it cannot come up
to thee. Can the Plants for Life, or the Eye for
Light, go up unto the Sun? Dwell in me by the Spirit
of Love, and I ſhall dwell by Love in Thee. Reaſon
is weak, and Thoughts are various, and Man will be
a ſlippery uncertain Wight, if LOVE be not his fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Principle, and do not incline his Soul to Thee!
Surely through thy Grace I eaſily feel, that I love thy
Word, I love thy Image, I love thy Work, and O
how heartily do I <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Love</hi> thee! And long to
<hi>Know</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> thee more! And if <hi>all things be of Thee,</hi>
and <hi>through Thee,</hi> and <hi>to Thee,</hi> ſurely <hi>this Love</hi> to the
Beams of thy Glory here on Earth, is eminently ſo!
It's Thee, Lord, that it meaneth! To Thee it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
It's Thee it ſerveth! For Thee it mourns, and
ſeeks, and groans! In Thee it Truſteth! And
the Hope, and Peace, and Comfort which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
me, are in Thee! When I was a returning Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
in rags, thou ſaweſt me afar off, and metteſt me
with thy embracing, feaſting Love: And ſhall I doubt

               <p>The ſuitableneſs of things below to my fleſhly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

And ſhall not the ſuitableneſs of things above to my

cloathed in ſuch meanneſs, and humbled to ſuch a Life
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59339:142"/>
and Death, as was to the <hi>Jews</hi> a ſtumbling Block, and
to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> matter of reproach: But he Shineth and
Reigneth now in Glory, above the malice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Sinners. And I ſhall there Live becauſe
he liveth; and in his Light I ſhall have Light. He
loved me here with a Redeeming, Regenerating
and preſerving Love: But there he will love me with a
perfecting, glorifying joyful Love. I had here ſome Raies
of heavenly Light: But interpoſitions cauſed Eclipſes and
Nights, yea, ſome long and winter Nights: But there
I ſhall dwell in the City of the Sun, the City of God,
the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where there is no Night,
Eclipſe or Darkneſs! There are the heavenly Hoſts
whoſe holy Love and Joyful Praiſes I would fain be a
partaker of? I have here had ſome of their Loving
aſſiſtance, but to me unſeen, being above our fleſhly
way of Converſe. But there I ſhall be with them, of
the like Nature, in the ſame Orb, and of the ſame Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
Church and Chore! There are perfected
Souls gathered home to Chriſt: Not, as here, ſtriving
like <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Womb, not yet as <hi>John</hi>
when he leaped in the Womb, becauſe of his Mothers
joy; nor as wrangling Children that are hardly kept
in the ſame Houſe in Peace: Not like the Servants of
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> like <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> like <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
and <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> like <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caroloſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
like <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper,</hi> or the many ſtriving
Parties now among us; nor like the Diſciples ſtriving

in an Idolatrous Land, nor like <hi>Elijah</hi> left alone, nor
like thoſe that wandred in Sheep Skins and Goat Skins,

Peucer</hi> and many other worthy men, whoſe matureſt
Age was ſpent in Priſons: Not as we poor bewildred
Sinners, feeling evil, and fearing more, confounded in
folly, and mad contention, ſome hating the only way of
Peace, and others groping for it in the dark, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
and loſt in the cleareſt Light, where the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
can but pitty the Blind, but cannot make them
willing to be delivered: What is Heaven to me, but
GOD? GOD who is LIFE, and LIGHT, and LOVE,
communicating himſelf to bleſſed Spirits, perfecting
them in the Reception, Poſſeſſion and Exerciſe of
LIFE and LIGHT, and LOVE, FOR EVER.
Theſe are not the Accidents, but the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of
that God who is Heaven and All to me; ſhould I fear
that Death which paſſeth me to <hi>Infinite Eſſential Life?</hi>
Should I fear a darkſom paſſage into a World of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
LIGHT? Should I fear to go to LOVE itſelf?
Think, O my Soul, what the Suns quickening Light
and Heat is to this lower corporeal World? Much
more is GOD, even Infinite, LIFE and LIGHT and
LOVE to the bleſſed World above: Doth it not draw
out thy deſires to think of going into a World of
LOVE? When LOVE will be our Region, our
Company, our Life: More to us than the Air is for
our Breath! than the Light is for our ſight; than our
Food is for our Life, than our Friends are for our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace:
And more to us than we are to our ſelves, and
we more for it as our ultimate end, than for our ſelves.
O excellent Grace of <hi>Faith</hi> which doth foreſee, and
bleſſed Word of Faith that doth foreſhew, this World
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59339:143"/>
of LOVE! Shall I fear to enter where there is no
WRATH, no fear, no ſtrangeneſs, nor ſuſpicion, nor ſelfiſh
ſeparation, but LOVE will make every holy Spirit as dear
and lovely to me as my ſelf, and me to them as lovely as
themſelves, and God to us all more amiable than our
ſelves and all: Where LOVE will have no defects or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
no damps or diſcouragements, no diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
or mixed diſaffection; but as LIFE will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Death, and LIGHT, without Darkneſs, (a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
everlaſting <hi>Day</hi> of Glory,) ſo will LOVE be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any hatred, unkindneſs, or allay. As many
Coals make one Fire, and many Candles conjoined
make one Light, ſo will many <hi>living Spirits</hi> make
<hi>one Life,</hi> and many <hi>illuminated Glorious Spirits, one
Light</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and many Spirits innaturalized into
LOVE, will make one Perfect LOVE of GOD, and
be LOVED as One by God for ever: For all the Body
of Chriſt is One; even here it is One in initial Union
of the Spirit, and Relation to One God, and Head,
and Life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. throughout. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 1. to 17.
and ſhall be preſented as beloved and ſpotleſs to God,
when the great Marriage Day of the Lamb ſhall come,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 24, 25, &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. &amp; 22.</p>
               <p>Had thou not given me, O Lord the LIFE of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I ſhould have had no conceptions of a Glorious
everlaſting Life: But if thou give me not the <hi>Life</hi> of
<hi>Grace,</hi> I ſhall have no ſufficient delightful inclination
and deſire after it. Hadſt thou not given me <hi>Sight</hi>
and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the Light of Nature, I ſhould not have
thought how deſirable it is to live in the <hi>Glorious Light</hi>
and <hi>Viſion;</hi> but if thou give me not the Spiritual Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of a <hi>ſeeing Faith,</hi> I ſhall not yet long for the
Glorious Light, and beatifical Viſion. Hadſt thou
not given me a <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> which is part of my very
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59339:143"/>
                  <hi>Nature</hi> itſelf, I could not have taſted how deſirable it
is, to live in a World of Univerſal, perfect, endleſs
LOVE: But unleſs thou alſo ſhed abroad thy LOVE
upon my Heart, by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Jeſus the Great <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
of LOVE, and turn my very <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
into Divine and Holy LOVE, I ſhall not long for
the World of LOVE. Appetite followeth Nature:
O give me not only the Image and the Art of Godlineſs;
the approaches towards it, nor only ſome forced or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
acts; but give me the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which
is Holy Love, and then my Soul will haſten towards
thee, and cry, How long, O Lord, How long! O
come, come quickly, make no delay. Surely the fear
of dying intimateth ſome contrary Love that inclineth
the Soul another way; and ſome ſhameful unbelief and
great unapprehenſiveneſs of the Attractive Glory of the
World of LOVE: Otherwiſe no frozen Perſon ſo long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for the Fire, none in a Dungeon ſo deſireth Light,
as we ſhould long for the heavenly Light and Love.</p>
               <p>God's Infinite Eſſential SELF-LOVE, in which he is
Eternally delighted in himſelf, is the moſt Amiable
Object, and Heaven itſelf to Saints and Angels: And
next to that His Love to all his Works, to the World,
and to the Church in Heaven ſpeaketh much more of
his Lovelineſs than his Love to me. But yet due <hi>Self-love</hi>
in me, is his work, and part of his natural Image;
and when this by ſin is grown up to exceſs, (through
the withdrawing of a contracted narrow Soul, from
the Union and due Love to my fellow Creatures, and to
God) I muſt alſo, I cannot but, enquire after God's Love
<hi>to me,</hi> and by this my deſires muſt much be moved: For
I am not ſo capable of aſcending above Self-intereſt, and
Self-love, as in the ſtate of Glorious Union I ſhall be.
I am glad to perceive that others do love God; and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59339:144"/>
I love thoſe moſt that I find moſt love him: But it is
not other mens love to God that will be accepted by
him inſtead of mine: Nor is it God's Love to others
(which yet rejoiceth me) that will ſatisfie me without
his love to me. But when all theſe are ſtill before me,
<hi>God's Eſſential Self-love</hi> and <hi>Delight,</hi> his <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>his</hi>
Creatures, eſpecially the Glorified, and his Love to
<hi>me</hi> alſo, even to <hi>me</hi> a vile unworthy Sinner; what then
ſhould ſtay my aſcending <hi>Love,</hi> or diſcourage my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to be with God?</p>
               <p>And doſt thou doubt, canſt thou doubt, O my Soul,
whether thou art going to a God that loveth thee? If
the <hi>Jews</hi> diſcerned the great love of Chriſt to <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
by his Tears, canſt not thou diſcern his Love to
thee in his Blood? It is never the leſs but the more
obliging and amiable, that it was not ſhed for thee
alone, but for many. May I not ſay as <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2,
20. <hi>I live by the Faith of the Son of God, that hath
loved Me, and given himſelf for me!</hi> Yea, it is not ſo
much I that live, as Chriſt <hi>Liveth in me?</hi> And will he
forſake the Habitation which his love hath choſen?
And which he hath ſo dearly bought! O read often
that triumphing Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and conclude, <hi>What
ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of God?</hi> If <hi>Life</hi> have not
done it, <hi>Death</hi> ſhall not do it. If leaning on his
Breaſt at Meat, was a token of Chriſt's ſpecial love
to <hi>John,</hi> is not his dwelling in me by my Faith, and his
living in me by his Spirit, a ſure token of his love to
me: And if a dark ſaying, [<hi>If he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee?</hi>] raiſed a report that the beloved
Diſciple ſhould not die, why ſhould not plain <hi>Promiſes</hi>
aſſure me that I ſhall live with him that loveth me for
ever? Be not ſo unthankful, O my Soul, as to queſtion
doubtingly whether thy heavenly Father, and thy Lord
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59339:144"/>
doth love thee? Canſt thou forget the ſealed Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of it? Did I not even now repeat ſo many as
ſhould ſhame thy doubts? A multitude of thy Friends
have loved thee ſo entirely, that thou canſt not doubt
of it? And did any of them ſignifie their love with the
convincing evidence that God hath done? Have they
done for thee what he hath done: Are they <hi>Love itſelf;</hi>
Is their love ſo full, ſo firm and ſo unchangeable as his?
I think the ſweetlier of Heaven becauſe abundance of my
ancient Lovely and Loving Holy Friends are there,
and am the willinger by Death to follow them. And
ſhould I not think of it more pleaſedly becauſe my God
and Father, my Saviour, and my Comforter is there?
And not alone, but with all the Society of Love. Was
not <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the Boſom of God himſelf? yet it is
ſaid, that he was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom; as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
runs, that we ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,</hi>
and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of God. And what
maketh the Society of Saints ſo ſweet as holy Love?
It is comfortable to read that, <hi>To love the Lord our God
with all our Heart, and Soul, and might, is the Firſt and
great Commandment; and the Second is like to it, To Love
our Neighbours as our ſelves.</hi> For God's Commands pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from that Will which is his Nature or Eſſence, and
they tend to the ſame as their Objective end. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that hath made Love the Great Command, doth
tell us that LOVE is the Great conception of his own
Eſſence, the ſpring of that Command; and that this
commanded imperfect Love, doth tend to perfect hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Love, even to our communion with Eſſential
Infinite Love. It were ſtrange that the Love and
Goodneſs which is equal to the Power that made the
World, and the Wiſdom that ordereth it, ſhould be
ſcant and backward to do good, and to be ſuſpected
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59339:145"/>
more than the Love of Friends! The remembrance of
the holineſs, humility, love and faithfulneſs of my
deareſt Friends of every Rank with whom I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
on Earth, in every place where I have lived, is
ſo ſweet to me, that I am oft ready to recreate my ſelf
with the naming of ſuch as are now with Chriſt: But
in Heaven they will love me better than they did on
Earth; and my love to them will be more pleaſant:
But all theſe Sparks are little to the Sun.</p>
               <p>Every place that I have lived in was a place of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love, which there ſet up its obliging Monuments.
Every Year and Hour of my life hath been a time of
Love: Every Friend, and every Neigbour, yea, every
Enemy have been the Meſſengers and Inſtruments of
Love. Every ſtate and change of my life, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
my ſin, hath opened to me Treaſures and
Myſteries of Love. And after ſuch a life of Love, ſhall
I doubt whether the ſame God do love me? Is he the
God of the Mountains and not of the Valleys? Did he
love me in my youth and health? And doth he not
love me in my Age, and Pain, and Sickneſs; Did he
love all the Faithful better in their life than at their
Death? If our hope be not chiefly in this life, neither
is our ſtate of Love, which is principally the heavenly
endleſs Grace. My groans grieve my Friends, but
abate not their love. Did he love me for my ſtrength,
my weakneſs might be my fear: as they that love for
Beauty, loath them that are deformed, and they that
love for Riches, deſpiſe the Poor: But God loved me
when I was his Enemy to make me a Friend, and
when I was bad to make me better: What ever he
taketh pleaſure in, is his own gift. Who made me to
differ? And what have I that I have not received? And
God will finiſh the Work, the Building, the Warfare
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59339:145"/>
that is his own. O the multitude of Mercies to my
Soul and Body, in Peace and War, in Youth and Age,
to my ſelf and friends, the many great and gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
which have teſtified to me the Love of God!
Have I lived in the experience of it, and ſhall I die in the
doubts of it? Had it been Love only to my Body, it
would have died with me, and not have accompanied
my departing Soul: I am not much in doubt of the
truth of my Love to him: Though I have not ſeen
him ſave as in a Glaſs, as in a Glaſs ſeen I love him: I
love my Brethren whom I have ſeen, and thoſe moſt
that are moſt in Love with him: I love his Word, and
Works, and Ways, and fain I would be nearer him,
and love him more; and I loath my ſelf for loving
him no better. And ſhall <hi>Peter</hi> ſay more confidently,
[Thou knoweſt that I <hi>love</hi> thee] than [<hi>I know that
thou loveſt me?</hi>] Yes, he may; becauſe though God's
Love is greater and ſtedfaſter than ours, yet our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his great love, is leſs than his knowledge of
our <hi>little love;</hi> and as we are defective in our own
Love, ſo are we in our certainty of its ſincerity. And
without the knowledge of our Love to God, we can
never be ſure of his ſpecial love to us. But yet I am
not utterly a ſtranger to my ſelf: I know for what I
have lived and laboured in the World! And who it is
that I have deſired to pleaſe. The God <hi>whoſe I am, and
whom I ſerve</hi> hath loved me in my youth, and he will
love me in my aged weakneſs. My Fleſh and my Heart fail:
my pains ſeem grievous to the Fleſh: But it is LOVE that
chooſeth them, that uſeth them for my good, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateth
them, and will ſhortly end them. Why then
ſhould I doubt of my Fathers Love? Shall pain or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
make me doubt? Did God love none from the
beginning of the World, but <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias?</hi> And
what am I better than my fore-Fathers? What is in me
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59339:146"/>
that I ſhould expect exemption from the common lot
of all Mankind? Is not a competent time of great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on Earth, in order to the unſeen felicity all that the
beſt of men can hope for? O for a clearer, ſtronger
Faith, to ſhew me the World that more excelleth this,
than this excelleth the Womb where I was conceived!
Then ſhould I not fear my third Birth day, what pangs
ſoever go before it; nor be unwilling of my change!
The <hi>Grave</hi> indeed is a Bed that Nature doth abhor:
Yet there the weary be at reſt: But Souls new born
have a double Nature that is Immortal, and go to the
place that is agreeable to their Nature; even to the
Region of Spirits, and the Region of Holy Love.
Even <hi>paſſive Matter</hi> that hath no other Natural motion,
hath a Natural Inclination to uniting, aggregative mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And God maketh all Natures ſuitable to their
proper ends and uſe: How can it be that a Spirit ſhould
not incline to be with Spirits? And Souls that have the
Divine Nature in holy Love, deſire to be with the God
of Love? Arts, and Sciences, and Tongues become not
a Nature to us; Elſe they would not ceaſe at Death:
But holy LOVE is our <hi>New Nature,</hi> and therefore
ceaſeth not with this bodily life. And ſhall acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
love make me deſire the company of a frail and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Friend? And ſhall not this ingrafted inſeparable
love, make me long to be with Chriſt? Though the
love of God to all his Creatures will not prove that
they are all Immortal, nor oblige them to expect another
life, that never had Capacity or Faculties to expect it;
yet his love to ſuch as in <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> are made
capable of it, doth warrant and oblige them to
believe and hope for the full Perfection of the work
of love. Some comfort themſelves in the love of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
as having the Keys of Heaven: And how many
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59339:146"/>
could I name that are now with Chriſt, who loved me
ſo faithfully on Earth, that were I ſure they had the
Keys and Power of Heaven (and were not changed in
their Love) I could put my departing Soul into their
Hands, and die with joy. And is it not better in the
Hand of my Redeemer, and of the God of Love, and
Father of Spirits? Is any love comparable to his? Or
any Friend ſo boldly to be truſted? I ſhould take it
for ungrateful unkindneſs in my Friend, to doubt of my
love and truſtineſs, if I had given him all that he hath,
and maintained him conſtantly by my kindneſs! But O
how odious a thing is ſin! Which by deſtroying our
love to God, doth make us unmeer to believe and ſweetly
perceive his Love? And by making us doubt of the
Love of God, and loſe the pleaſant reliſh of it, doth
more increaſe our difficulty of loving him! The Title
that the Angel gave to <hi>Daniel [A Man greatly beloved
of God,]</hi> methinks ſhould be enough to make one joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
love and truſt God, both in life and death.
Will Almighty LOVE ever hurt me or forſake me?
And have not all Saints that Title in their degrees?
What elſe ſignifieth their <hi>Mark</hi> and Name, HOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS
TO THE LORD? What is it but our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God as his peculiar beloved People? And how
are they ſeparated but by mutual love, and our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
all that alienateth or is contrary? Let Scorners
deride us as ſelf flatterers that believe they are God's
Darlings (and wo to the Hypocrites that believe it on
their falſe Preſumption;) without ſuch belief or ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hopes I ſee not how any Man can die in true
Peace. He that is no otherwiſe beloved than Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
and Unbelievers, muſt have his portion with
them: And he that is no otherwiſe beloved than as
the ungodly, unholy and unregenerate, ſhall not ſtand
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59339:147"/>
in judgment, nor ſee God, nor enter into his Kingdom.
Moſt upright Souls are to blame for groundleſs doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God's Love; but not for acknowledging it,
rejoicing in it, and in their doubts being moſt ſolicitous
to make it ſure: Love brought me into the World,
and furniſhed me with a Thouſand Mercies! Love hath
provided for me, delivered me, and preſerved me till
now! And will it not entertain my ſeparated Soul?
Is God like falſe or inſufficient Friends, that forſake us
in adverſity!</p>
               <p>I confeſs that I have wronged LOVE by ſin; by
many and great unexcuſable ſins! But all ſave Chriſt
himſelf were ſinners, which love did purifie and receive
to Glory! God who is rich in Mercy for the great love
wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in
ſins hath quickned us together with Chriſt (by Grace
we are ſaved) and hath raiſed us up together in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
places in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6. O that
I could love much that have ſo much forgiven! The
glorified praiſed him who loved us, and waſhed us from
our ſins, in his own Blood, and made us Kings and
Prieſts to <hi>God, Rev.</hi> 1. 5, 6. Our Father that hath
loved us, giveth us conſolation and good hope through
Grace, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 16. I know no ſin which I repent
not of with ſelf-loathing! And I earneſtly beg and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
that none of my ſins may be to me unknown. I
dare not juſtifie even what is any way uncertain; though
I dare not call all that my ſin which ſiding men of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
judgments on each ſide paſſionately call ſo:
While both ſides do it on contrary accounts, and not
to go contrary ways is a Crime. O that God would
bleſs my accuſations to my illumination, that I may
not be unknown to my ſelf! Though ſome think me
much better than I am, and others much worſe, it
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59339:147"/>
moſt concerneth me to know the Truth my ſelf, flattery
would be more dangerous to me, than falſe accuſations,
I may ſafelier be ignorant of other mens ſins than of my
own. Who can underſtand his errours: Cleanſe me
Lord from ſecret ſins (and let not ignorance or errour
keep me in impenitence;) and keep thou me back from
preſumptuous ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12, 13. I have an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with the Father, and thy Promiſe, that he that
confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins ſhall have Mercy.
Thoſe are by ſome men taken for my greateſt ſins,
which my moſt ſerious Thoughts did judge to be the
greateſt of my outward duties, and which I performed
through the greateſt difficulties, and which coſt me
deareſt to the Fleſh, and the greateſt ſelf-denial and
patience in my reluctant Mind: Where-ever I have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
Lord, make it known to me, that my confeſſion
may prevent the ſin of others; and where I have not
erred, confirm and accept me in the right.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing an unworthy Worm hath had ſo many
Teſtimonies of thy tender love, let me not be like
them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 1, 2. that when thou ſaidſt, <hi>I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
you,</hi> unthankfully asked, <hi>Wherein haſt thou loved
us,</hi> Heaven is not more ſpangled with Stars, than thy
Word and Works with the refulgent Signatures of
Love. Thy well beloved Son, the Son of thy Love,
undertaking the Office, Meſſage and Work of the
greateſt Love, was full of that Spirit which is Love,
which he ſheds abroad in the Hearts of thine Elect,
that the Love of the Father, the Grace of the Son, and
the communion of the Spirit may be their hope and life.
His Works, his Sufferings, his Gifts, as well as his
comfortable Word, did ſay to his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.
9. <hi>As the Father loved me, ſo have I loved you: conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
ye in my love.</hi> And how, Lord, ſhall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

its tender expreſſions upon Earth. As Love is no where
perfectly revealed but in Heaven, ſo I can no where ſo
fully diſcern it, as by looking up by Faith to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Saviour which is in Heaven, and converſing
more believingly with the heavenly Society. Had I done
this more and better, and as I have perſuaded
others to do it, I had lived in more convincing delights
of God's Love, which would have turned the fears
of Death into joyfuller hopes, and more earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to be with Chriſt, in the Arms, in the World, in

in a dark, a doubting, fearing World.</p>
               <p>But, O my Father, Infinite LOVE, though my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
be many and ſtrong, my Heart is bad, and
my ſtrength is weakneſs, and I am inſufficient to
plead the cauſe of thy Love and Lovelineſs to my
ſelf or others: O plead thy own cauſe, and what
Heart can reſiſt? Let it not be my <hi>word</hi> only, but
Thine that thou loveſt <hi>me,</hi> even me a Sinner;
ſpeak it as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Lazarus</hi> Ariſe: If not, as
thou telleſt me that the Sun is warm, yet as thou
haſt told me, that my Parents and my deareſt Friends
did love me, and much more powerfully than ſo.
Tell it me, as thou telleſt me that thou haſt given
me life, by the conſciouſneſs and works of life:
That while I can ſay, <hi>Thou that knoweſt all
things, Knoweſt that I love Thee;</hi> it may include,
[<hi>therefore, I know that I am beloved of thee;</hi>]
and therefore come to thee in the confidence of thy
Love, and long to be nearer in the clearer ſight, the
fuller ſenſe, and joyfuller exerciſe of Love for ever.
Father, into thy Hand I commend my Spirit: Lord
Jeſus receive my Spirit! <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 TIM. 3. 16.</bibl>
               <q>Without Controverſie, great is the Myſtery of
Godlineſs, God was manifeſted in the Fleſh,
juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Gentiles, believed on in the World,
received up into Glory.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THeſe are the Creed, or Six Articles of the Goſpel,
which the Apoſtles preached.</p>
            <p>§ 1. I. God manifeſted in the Fleſh of Jeſus, is the
firſt and great Article. Believe this and believe all:
No wonder that believing that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59339:149"/>
of God is ſo often made in Scripture, the deſcription
of ſaving Faith, the Title to Baptiſm, and Pardon, and
Salvation, the Evidence of the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that
truly and practically believeth that God came in Fleſh
to Man, and that Chriſt is the Fathers Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from Heaven, muſt needs believe that God
hath a great value for the Souls of men and for
his Church, that he deſpiſeth not even our Fleſh,
that his Word is true and fully to be truſted, that
he who ſo wonderfully came to Man, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take up Man to him: Who can doubt of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of Souls, or that Chriſt will receive the
departing Souls of the Faithful to himſelf, who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that he took Man's Nature, and hath glorified it
now in Heaven, in union with the Divine? Who
can ever have low Thoughts of God's love and Mercy
who believeth this? And who can proſtitute his Soul and
Fleſh to wickedneſs, who firmly believeth that he took
the Soul and Fleſh of Man, to ſanctifie and glorifie it.</p>
            <p>§ 2. II. The holy Spirit is the Juſtification of the
Truth of Jeſus Chriſt. He is Chriſt's Advocate and
Witneſs to the World. He proveth the Goſpel by
theſe five ways of Evidence. I. By all the Propheſies,
Types and Promiſes of Chriſt in the Old Teſtament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſts coming. II. By the Inherent impreſs of God's
Image on the Perſon and Doctrine of Chriſt: VVhich
<hi>Propria luce</hi> ſheweth itſelf to be Divine. III. By the
concomitant Miracles of Chriſt: Read the Hiſtory of
the Goſpel for this uſe, and obſerve each Hiſtory.
IV. By the ſubſequent gift of the Spirit to the Apoſtles
and other Chriſtians, by Languages, wonders and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of Miracles to convince the VVorld. V. By the
undeniable and excellent work of Sanctification on all
true Believers through all the VVorld, in all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59339:150"/>
to this day. Theſe five are the Spirits VVitneſs
which fully juſtifieth the certain Truth, that Jeſus
Chriſt is the Son of God.</p>
            <p>§ 3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how are we ſure who our ſelves never
ſaw the Perſon, Miracles, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion of
Chriſt, that the Hiſtory of them is true?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We may be ſure that the Spectators were
not deceived. II. And that they did not deceive them
to whom they reported it. III. And that we are not
deceived by any miſcarriage in the hiſtorical Tradition
to us.</p>
            <p>§ 4. I. It was not poſſible that men that were not
mad, that had Eyes and Ears, could for three Years
and a half believe that they ſaw the Lame, the Blind,
the Deaf, and all Diſeaſes healed, the Dead raiſed,
Thouſands miraculouſly fed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this among
crouds of People that ſtill followed Chriſt, if the things
had not been true: One Man's Senſes may be deceived
at ſome one inſtance, by ſome deceitful accident: But
that the Eyes and Ears of Multitudes ſhould be ſo oft
deceived many years in the open Light, is as much as
to ſay, No Man knoweth any thing that he ſeeth and
heareth.</p>
            <p>§ 5. II. That the Diſciples who received the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Evangeliſts report of Chriſt were not deceived
by the Reporters, is moſt evident.</p>
            <p>For, 1. They received it not by hearſay, at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
hand, but from the Eye and Ear Witneſſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who muſt needs know what they ſaid.</p>
            <p>2. They heard this report from Men of the ſame
Time, and Age, and Countrey, where it was eaſy
to examine the caſe, and confute it, had it been
falſe.</p>
            <p>3. The Apoſtles appealed to crouds and Thouſands
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59339:150"/>
of Witneſſes, as to many of Chriſt's Miracles, who
would have made it odious, had it not been true.</p>
            <p>4. They ſharply reproved the Rulers for perſecuting
Chriſt, which would provoke them to do their beſt to
confute the Apoſtles for their own juſtification.</p>
            <p>5. Chriſt choſe men of no great human Learning
and Subtility, but common, plain, unlearned men, that
it might not be thought a deceit of Art.</p>
            <p>6. Yea, he did not make much more known to them
before his Death, than the bare Matters of Fact
which they da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly ſaw, and that he was the Chriſt, and
Moral Doctrine; his Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Kingdom of Heaven they knew little of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
But experience and the ſudden coming down
of the Spirit ſuddenly taught them all the reſt.</p>
            <p>7. They taught not one another, but were every
one perſonally taught of God.</p>
            <p>8. And yet they all agreed in the ſame Doctrine,
when they were diſperſed over the World; and never
differed in any one Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>9 They were men that had no worldly Intereſt,
Wealth or Dominion to ſeek.</p>
            <p>10. Yea, they renounced and denied all worldly
Intereſt, and ſealed their Teſtimony by their Sufferings
and Blood; and all in hope of a heavenly reward
which they knew that Lying was no means to obtain.</p>
            <p>11. Had they plotted to cheat the World (for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
the ſin is ſo heinous that ſome one of them
would have repented and confeſt it, at leaſt, at death;
which none of them did, but died joyfully as for the
Truth.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Paul</hi> was converted by a Voice and Light from
Heaven, in the preſence of thoſe that travelled with
him in his perſecuting deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:59339:151"/>
13. But yet it is a fuller evidence that the Doctrine
which they delivered as from God, beareth a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Impreſs, that as the Light, it is its own Evidence.</p>
            <p>14. And for the more infallible conviction, they
that teſtified of Chriſts Miracles did the like themſelves
to confirm their Teſtimony, they ſpake with Tongues
which they never learnt: They healed all Diſeaſes;
even the ſhadow of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Clothes that came
from <hi>Paul,</hi> did heal men. They raiſed the Dead: And they
that in all Countries converted the Nations by their own
Miracles, atteſting the Miracles and Reſurrection of
Chriſt, muſt needs compel the Spectators to believe them.</p>
            <p>15. Yet, more than all this, thoſe that believed
them were preſently enabled to do the like in one kind
and degree or other. The ſame extraordinary gift of
the Spirit fell upon the common multitude of Believers
by the laying on of the Apoſtles hands. So that <hi>Simon
Magus</hi> would fain have bought that Power with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
And when men witneſſed Chriſt's Miracles, and
wrought the like themſelves, and thoſe that believed
them had and did the like, (either Healing, Tongues,
Propheſie or ſome wonders,) it was ſure an infallible
way of teſtifying.</p>
            <p>16. When wrangling Hereticks quarrelled with the
Apoſtles, and would draw away Diſciples to themſelves
by diſparaging them they ſtill appealed to the Miracles
wrought by theſe Diſciples themſelves, or in their
ſight; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 5. And as Chriſt, when the
<hi>Jews</hi> ſaid he did all by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> when he caſt out
devils, askt them [<hi>By whom do your Children caſt them
out?</hi>] Which had it been falſe, would have turned all
the People from them.</p>
            <p>17. Their adverſaries were ſo far from writing any
Confutation of their Teſtimony, that they confeſt the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59339:151"/>
Miracles, and had no ſhift but either to blaſpheme the
Holy Ghoſt, and ſay that they were done by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
or elſe by perſecution and violence to oppreſs them.
As if the Devil were Maſter of the World, and could reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſly
deceive it againſt God's will, or God himſelf would
ſend or ſuffer a full courſe of Miracles remedileſly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the World, which is to make God like the Devil: Or
as if the Devil were ſo good as by Miracles to promote
ſo holy and amiable and juſt a Doctrine as that of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
to make men wiſe, and good, and juſt, and kill
their ſin. So that this blaſphemy of the Holy Ghoſt,
makes Satan to be God, or God to be Satan.</p>
            <p>18. All the cruelty, powers, Learning and Policy
of their Adverſaries was not able to ſtop the progreſs
of this Teſtimony, much leſs to prevail againſt it.</p>
            <p>III. It is then moſt certain that the firſt Witneſſes were
not deceived by Chriſt, nor Believers after deceived by
them: The next Queſtion is, whether we be not deceived
by a falſe hiſtorical Tradition of theſe things. Had we
ſeen them all our ſelves, we muſt needs have believed;
but at this diſtance we know not what miſreports may
interven: what Eye-ſight and hearing was to them,
that Tradition is to us. Now the Queſtion is, Is it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the very ſame Fact and Doctrine which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and which we receive?</p>
            <p>And here let it be premiſed that there is no other
way of aſſurance than that which God hath afforded
us, that the reaſon of Man could have deſired.</p>
            <p>1. If we would ſee God, and Heaven, and Hell, this
is not a way ſuitable to the ſtate of Probationers that
live in Fleſh on Earth. Angels live by viſion and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Glory: And Bruits by ſenſe on ſenſible things:
But reaſonable Travellers muſt live by reaſon, and by
believing certain Revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:59339:152"/>
2. If God will ſend his Son from Heaven to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
us, and we will believe no more than we ſee our
ſelves, then Chriſt muſt dwell on Earth to the end of
the World, &amp; he muſt be in all places of the Earth at once
that all may ſee, and he muſt die and riſe again before
all men in all Ages: And how mad an expectation is this?</p>
            <p>3. Or if all that deliver us the Hiſtory muſt work
Miracles before our Eyes, or elſe we will not believe
them, it is ſtill moſt abſurd. Will you not believe that
the Laws of the Land are genuine, or that ever there
were ſuch Kings as made them unleſs he that tells it you
work Miracles? Shall not Children believe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
or Schollars their Tutors, unleſs they work Miracles.</p>
            <p>3. I muſt premiſe that there is three ſorts of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I. Such as depends on the common Wit and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
of Mankind: And this is very much to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
wickedneſs, folly and lying being grown ſo
common in the World.</p>
            <p>II. Such as depends on the extraordinary skill and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
of ſome proved men: And this deſerveth much
belief; but it is but an uncertain humane Faith.</p>
            <p>III. Such as depends on <hi>Natural Neceſſity,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly be falſe; we have both theſe laſt to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
us of the Goſpel Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>This reſteth on a diſtinction of the <hi>Acts of Mans
Will:</hi> Some of them are <hi>mutably free;</hi> and theſe give
no certainty: Some of them are <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
neceſſary,</hi> and Man can do no otherwiſe, and theſe
give even <hi>natural Infallible certainty:</hi> Such are, <hi>To love
ones ſelf, to love fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>city; to hate torment and miſery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c.
And to know that which is fully manifeſt to our ſound
Senſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When men of <hi>contrary Intereſts</hi> and temper, <hi>all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs</hi>
the Truth of <hi>known things,</hi> about which their
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59339:152"/>
Intereſts ſtand croſs, it is a Phyſical evidence of Truth:</p>
            <p>On this account mens agreement about Natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
is infallible.</p>
            <p>It ſeems ſtrange that all the World from <hi>Adam</hi>'s
time are agreed which is the firſt, ſecond, and third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
day of the Week, and not a day loſt till now. It
could not be otherwiſe, Becauſe being a thing of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
intereſt and notice, if any Kingdom had loſt a
day by over ſleeping, or had agreed to falſifie it, all
the reſt of the World would have ſhamed them.</p>
            <p>Thus all <hi>Grecians, Latines, Engliſhmen,</hi> &amp;c. agree
about the ſenſe of Words; for if ſome would pervert
them, the reſt would detect it.</p>
            <p>Thus we are certain that the Statutes of the Land, are
not counterfeit: For men of croſs intereſts hold their
Lands, and lives by them; and if ſome did counterfeit
them, the reſt would by intereſt be bound to detect it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. There can be no effect without an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
cauſe. But in Nature there is no cauſe that can
make all men agree to aſſert a known falſhood, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a known Truth, againſt all their known intereſt:
therefore there can be no ſuch effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. A neceſſary cauſe will neceſſarily effect:
But where mens known Intereſt obligeth them to agree
of a known Truth, this is a neceſſary cauſe of certain
credibility: therefore it hath a neceſſary effect.</p>
            <p>You know who were your Parents, and when and
where you were Born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by ſuch Tradition in a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Degree. This dependeth not on pretended Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
nor on meer honeſty; but on natural neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed this, I come to prove that we have
ſuch Tradition of Phyſical infallible evidence, that the
Faith of the preſent Church in the Eſſentials is the
ſame which the firſt Churches received infallibly from
the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:59339:153"/>
1. The World knoweth that ever ſince Chriſt's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion
all that believed in him, were Baptized (as
all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenanting ſeed were Circumciſed:)
And what is Baptiſm, but a Profeſſion of Belief in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt as dead, riſen and glorified; and a devoting
our ſelves in Covenant to God the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghoſt? All that ever were Chriſtians by ſolemn
Vow profeſt this ſame Faith: And this is ſuch a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſtianity as humane Generation down from
<hi>Adam</hi> is of the ſame humanity in the World.</p>
            <p>2. They that were Baptized were Catechized firſt;
in which the three Articles of Baptiſm were opened to
them, of which Chriſt's Death, Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion
were part: And this hath been an undeniable
Tradition of the ſame Faith.</p>
            <p>3. The Summ of the Chriſtian Faith was from the
beginning drawn up in certain Articles called the
Creed, which expounded the three Baptiſmal Articles;
and all Churches on Earth had the ſame in ſenſe, and
moſt in Words; and all at Age that were Baptized,
profeſſed this Creed: Which is as full a Tradition of the
ſame Belief in Chriſt's Birth, Death, and Reſurrection,
Aſcenſion and Glory, as <hi>Speaking</hi> is a Tradition of the
<hi>ſame</hi> humane Nature.</p>
            <p>4. Before Chriſt's Aſcenſion, he inſtituted the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Sacred Miniſtry, which Friends and Foes
confeſs hath continued ever ſince: And what is this
Miniſtry, but an Office of publiſhing the Goſpel of
Chriſt, his Life, Death, Miracles, Reſurrection,
Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What elſe have they done in all Ages in
the World? So that the Office is an undeniable Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>5. Chriſt and his Apoſtles inſtituted the Weekly
Celebration of the Remembrance of his Reſurrection on
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59339:153"/>
the Lord's days: Friends and Foes confeſs the Hiſtory,
that the firſt Day of the Week hath been kept for ſuch
Memorial ever ſince, through all the Chriſtian part of
the World: Which proveth the uninterrupted belief
of Chriſt's Reſurrection, as a Notorious Practical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>6. Chriſt and his Apoſtles ever ſince his Reſurrection
inſtituted Solemn Aſſemblies of Chriſtians to be held on
thoſe Days, and at other Times: Once a Week was
the leaſt through the Chriſtian World: And what did
they meet for but to Preach, hear and profeſs the ſame
Chriſtian Faith?</p>
            <p>7. It was the conſtant cuſtom of Chriſtians in
their Aſſemblies, and their Houſes, to ſing Hymns
of Praiſe to Jeſus Chriſt, in remembrance of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
<hi>&amp;c. Pliny</hi> tells <hi>Trajan</hi> that this was the
practice by which Chriſtians were known by their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors:
Which is a Practical Tradition.</p>
            <p>8. Jeſus Chriſt inſtituted, and all Chriſtians to this
Day have conſtantly uſed, the Sacrament of Chriſt's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
called the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> to keep in remembrance
his Death till he come, and profeſs their Belief that he
is our Life. And as the conſtant Celebration of the
Paſſover with all its Ceremonies, was a moſt certain
Tradition of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Plagues, and <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
more than a bare written Hiſtory would be;
ſo hath the Lord's Supper been of the uninterrupted
belief of the Hiſtory of our Redemption by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>9. The Church hath from the beginning had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Diſcipline, by which it hath kept it ſelf ſeparate
from Hereticks, who have denied any Eſſential Article of
this Faith: Which is a ſure Tradition of the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>10. None queſtion but Chriſtians have from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59339:154"/>
been perſecuted for this ſame Faith; and in
Perſecution made Confeſſion of it: Perſecutors, and
Confeſſors then are both the Witneſſes of the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>11. When ever Hereticks or Enemies have written
againſt Chriſtians, their Apologies and Defences ſhew
that it was this ſame Faith that they owned.</p>
            <p>12. Moſt of the adverſe Hereticks owned the ſame
Matters of Fact.</p>
            <p>13. The <hi>Jews</hi> were long before in Poſſeſſion of
the Books of the Old Teſtament, which bear their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>14. The Books of the New Teſtament have by
certain Tradition been delivered down to this preſent
Day, which contain the Matters of Fact, and Doctrin,
the Eſſentials, Integrals and Accidents of the Faith.</p>
            <p>15. No Enemies have written any thing againſt the
Matter of Fact, of any Moment.</p>
            <p>16. Yea, the <hi>Jews</hi> and other bittereſt Enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
much of the Miracles of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>17. Martyrs have cheerfully forſaken Life, and all
in confeſſing it.</p>
            <p>18. God by his wonderful Providence hath main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it.</p>
            <p>19. The Devil and all the Wicked of the World
are the greateſt Enemies to it.</p>
            <p>20. The Holy Ghoſt hath ſtill bleſt it, to work
the ſame holy and heavenly Nature, and Life in all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and ſerious Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> This proveth infallibly the Tradition of the ſame
Faith in the Eſſentials: But how prove you that the
ſame Holy Scripture is delivered as uncorrupted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All the Bible is not brought down ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
as are the Eſſentials of our Religion: When
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59339:154"/>
there were no Bibles but what Scriveners wrote, no
wonder if overſight left few Copies without ſome of
their ſlips. There are hundred of various Readings
in the New Teſtament; and of many no Man can be
certain which is true: But none of them are ſuch as
make any difference in the Articles of our Faith, or
Practice, nor on which any point of Doctrine or Fact
dependeth.</p>
            <p>And the words are neceſſary but for the Matter,
which they do record.</p>
            <p>And, 1. All Miniſters, and all Churches conſtantly
uſed this ſame Scripture publickly, and privately, as the
Word of God; ſo that it could not be eaſily altered.</p>
            <p>2. They all knew that a Curſe is pronounced againſt
every one that addeth or diminiſheth: Which muſt
needs poſſeſs them with fear of corrupting it.</p>
            <p>3. They took it to be the Charter of their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>4. The work of the Miniſters was to expound it,
and preſerve it againſt Corrupters.</p>
            <p>5. Theſe Miniſters and Churches were over much of
the World, and could not agree together to corrupt
it: And if ſome did it, all the reſt would ſoon detect it.</p>
            <p>6. Hereſies and Quarrels were quickly too rife
among them: So that croſs Intereſts and Animoſities
would ſoon have fallen upon the Corrupters.</p>
            <p>7. Some Hereticks made ſome adding and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
attempts, which the Church preſently condemned
and turned it to their ſhame.</p>
            <p>8. In all the Diſputations then managed, the ſame
Scriptures were appealed to.</p>
            <p>9. The Tranſlations into various Languages ſhew
that the Books were the ſame, without any Momentous
difference.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:59339:155"/>
10. To this Day when Sin and Tyranny have torn
the Church into many Factions, they all receive the
ſame Canonical Scriptures, except that ſome receive
more Apocryphal Writings, which yet make no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
at all of our Goſpel Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But doth not this laying ſo much on Tradition
favour Popery?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: The difference is here; 1. <hi>Papiſts</hi> are
for Tradition as a ſupplement to the Scripture, as if this
were but part of the VVord of God; and 2. They plead
for a peculiar power of being the Keepers and Judges
of that ſupplemental Tradition; which other Churches
know nothing of.</p>
            <p>But we, 1. Plead for the Infallible, Practical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity by itſelf, and in
the Creed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is leſs than the Scripture. 2. And
next for the certain Tradition of the Scripture itſelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted
in all that Faith depends on: which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the compleat Record of God's VVill and Law,
containing more than Eſſentials and Integrals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So much of God,</hi> 1. Manifeſted in the Fleſh, 2. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>III. He was <hi>ſeen</hi> of <hi>Angels;</hi> that is, <hi>Angels were the
Beholding, Witneſſing,</hi> and <hi>admiring Servants of this
great Myſtery, God manifeſted</hi> in the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>1. Angels preached Chriſt at his Incarnation.</p>
            <p>2. Angels miniſtred to Chriſt in his Temptations,
Agonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Angels were Preachers and VVitneſſes of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
            <p>4. Angels rowled away the Stone, and terrified the
Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:59339:155"/>
5. Angels preached his return to them that gazed
up at his Aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>6. Angels opened the Priſon Doors and ſet the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
Apoſtles free once, and <hi>Peter</hi> alone afterwards.</p>
            <p>7. Angels rejoice in Heaven at the Converſion of all
that Chriſt brings home.</p>
            <p>8. Angels diſdain not to be the Guardians of the
leaſt of Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
            <p>9. Angels are protecting Officers over Churches and
Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>10. Angels have preached to Apoſtles, and been
the Meſſengers of their Revelations.</p>
            <p>11. Angels have been the Inſtruments of Miracles,
and of deſtroying the Churches Enemies.</p>
            <p>12. Angels will miniſterially convoy departed Souls
to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>13. Angels will gloriouſly attend Chriſt at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and ſever the Wicked from the Juſt.</p>
            <p>14. Angels will be our Companions in the heavenly
Chore for ever.</p>
            <p>Therefore, 1. We ſhould love Angels. 2. And be
thankful to God for them. 3. And think the more
comfortably of Heaven for their Society: 4. And Pray
for the benefit of their Miniſtry on Earth, eſpecially in
all our dangers.</p>
            <p>IV. The Fourth Article is [<hi>Preached to the Gentiles.</hi>] The
<hi>Jews</hi> having the Covenant of Peculiarity, were proud
of their Priviledge, even while they unworthily abuſed
it: And deſpiſed the reſt of the World, and would
not ſo much as eat with them, as if they had been God's
only People. And indeed the reſt of the World was ſo
corrupted, that we find no one Nation that as ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59339:156"/>
Idolatry, and was devoted in Covenant to the
true God alone, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were. Now that God
ſhould be manifeſted in Fleſh, to reconcile the Heathen
World to himſelf, and extend greater Priviledges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely
to all Nations than ever the <hi>Jews</hi> had in
their ſtate of Peculiarity, this was a Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
which the <hi>Jews</hi> did hardly yield belief to.</p>
            <p>And that which aggravateth this wonder is, 1. That
the <hi>Gentile</hi> World was drowned in all Idolatry and
Unnatural Wickedneſs, ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribeth, <hi>Rom.</hi>
1. &amp;. 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. And that God ſhould
ſuddenly and freely ſend them the Meſſage of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
and be found of them that ſought him not, is
that wonder, which obligeth us <hi>Gentiles</hi> who once
lived as without God in the World to be thankful to
him.</p>
            <p>V. The Fifth Article is [<hi>Believed on in the World.</hi>]
The effect of the Goſpel on the Souls of men in their
<hi>Effectual Faith,</hi> is one of the Evidences of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Truth.</p>
            <p>I told you before that the Fifth Witneſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
on the Souls of all Believers, I reſerved to be here
mentioned. Here, 1. It is a part of the wonder that
Chriſt ſhould be believed on in the World, even with
a common Faith. For, 1. To believe a mean Man to be
the Mediator between God and Man, and the Saviour
of the World, yea, one that was Crucified as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor:
this muſt needs be a difficult thing.</p>
            <p>2. The very <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation was as contemptible to
the <hi>Romans,</hi> being one of their pooreſt ſubdued Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to the <hi>Jews:</hi> And Chriſt
was by Birth a <hi>Jew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:59339:156"/>
3. The Greatneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire then, ruling
over much of the World, was ſuch, that by Preaching,
and not by VVar, to bring them to be Subjects to a
Crucified <hi>Jew,</hi> was a marvellous work; and ſo to
bring the Conquered Nations to become Chriſt's Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Subjects.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Learning was then at the
height of its Perfection: And the Chriſtians were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
by them as unlearned <hi>Barbarians:</hi> And that
Learning, Arts and Empire, ſhould all ſubmit to ſuch
a King and Saviour, was certainly a work of Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Power. Chriſt did not levy Armies to overcome
the Nations, nor did Victory move them; but the
Victors and Lords of the VVorld, and theſe no Fools,
but the Maſters of the greateſt humane VViſdom, were
Conquered by the Goſpel, preached by a ſort of inferior
men.</p>
            <p>5. And this Goſpel which Conquered them was ſtill
oppoſed by them, and the Chriſtians perſecuted as a ſort
of hated men, till it overcame the Perſecutors.</p>
            <p>It's true that Heatheniſm hath the greateſt part of the
VVorld, and Mahometans have as much as Chriſtians:
But one ſort got it by the Sword, and the other by the
Doctrine, and Holy lives of a few unarmed inferiour
men.</p>
            <p>II. But I uſe this of the <hi>Extent</hi> of Faith, but as a
probable, and not a cogent Argument: But the main
Argument is from the <hi>Sanctifying</hi> effect of Faith.</p>
            <p>I know it will be ſaid, that many or moſt Chriſtians
are as bad as other men.</p>
            <p>But it's one thing to be of a profeſt Religion, becauſe
it is the Religion of the King and Countrey, and therefore
maketh for men's worldly advantage, and they hear
little ſaid againft it: This is the caſe of moſt in the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59339:157"/>
World, Chriſtians, Mahometans and Heathens: And
it's another to be a ſerious Believer, who upon trial
and conſideration chooſeth Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>And it is notorious that ſuch <hi>ſerious Chriſtians</hi> are all
<hi>Holy, Sober,</hi> and <hi>Juſt,</hi> and ſo greatly differing from the
corrupted World, as fully proveth that God owneth that
Goſpel which he maketh ſo effectual to ſo great a change.</p>
            <p>Here conſider, 1. What that change is; 2. How hard
and great a work it is: 3. That it is certainly a work of
God. 4. That the Goſpel is the means by which God doth it.</p>
            <p>1. The nature of this Holy work on all ſerious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Chriſtians, is, It ſets all their Hopes and Hearts on
the promiſed Glory of the Life to come, and turns the
very nature of their Wills, into the predominant Love
of God and Man, and of Heaven and Holineſs: It
mortifieth all fleſhly Luſts, and Subjects Senſe to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and Faith, the Body to the Soul, and all to God:
It ſets a Mans Heart on the ſincere ſtudy of doing all the
good he can in the World, to Friends, Neighbours and
Enemies; eſpecially and moſt publick good; to live
ſoberly, righteouſly and godly is his delight: Sin is
his chief hatred; and nothing more grievous to him
than that he cannot reach to greater Perfection, in
Faith, Hope, Obedience, Patience, and in heavenly
Love and Joy: It cauſeth a Man to contemn Wealth,
Honour, and fleſhly Pleaſure, and Life, in compariſon
of God's Love and Life everlaſting; this change God's
Spirit worketh on all true Believers.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are ungodly, have but the <hi>Name</hi> of
Chriſtians; they never well underſtood what Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is; nor ever received it by a true belief. But all
that underſtandingly and ſeriouſly believe in Jeſus
Chriſt are ſanctified by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>II. And this is a greater work than Miracles; in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:59339:157"/>
1. It is the very Health of the Souls: It is Salvation
itſelf: it maketh Man in his meaſure like to God, and is
his Image: It is a heavenly nature, and is the earneſt
and preparation for Heaven: It delivereth Man from
the greateſt evil on Earth, and giveth him the firmeſt
peace and joy, in his peace with God, the pardon of
his Sins, and the hope of everlaſting Glory.</p>
            <p>2. It's eaſy to diſcern how great a work this is, by
the deep roots of all the contrary Vices, in the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Nature of Man: Experience aſſureth us that Man
by vitiated Nature is proud, and ignorant, and ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
little but the things of the Fleſh, and worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and is a Slave to his Appetite and Luſt: His bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Proſperity is all that really hath his Heart: Yea
if God reſtrain them not, all wicked men are bitter
Enemies to all that are truly wiſe and holy, even among
Heathens and Inſidels, if any be but better than the
reſt, the wicked are their deadly Enemies. There is
ſo viſible an Enmity between Godlineſs and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the Seed of Chriſt, and of the Serpent in the
World as is a great confirmation of the Scripture
which deſcribeth it. And it is not the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
that altereth mens Nature. We here that have
Peace from all the World, are under ſuch implacable
hatred of wicked men, that call themſelves Chriſtians,
that ſo many Bears or Wolves would be leſs hurtful
to us.</p>
            <p>3. And the univerſal ſpreading of this wickedneſs over
all the Earth, in all Ages and Nations, doth tell us how
great a work it is to cure it.</p>
            <p>4. And ſo doth the fruſtration of all other means, till
the Spirit of God do it by ſetting home the Goſpel upon
the Heart. Children will grow up in VVickedneſs,
againſt all the Counſel, Love, Correction of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59339:158"/>
no VVords, no Reaſon will prevail with them,
more than with drunken men or beaſts.</p>
            <p>5. VVe find it a very hard thing to cure a Man of
ſome one rooted ſin: much more of all.</p>
            <p>6. The common miſery of the VVorld proclaimeth
Man's Vice, and the difficulty of the cure: How elſe
comes the VVorld to live in ſelf-ſeeking, falſhood,
fraud, malice, and in bloody VVars, worſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> than
VVolves and Serpents againſt each other.</p>
            <p>7. Laſtly, VVhere God cureth this by true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
it's done with the pangs of ſharp repentance, and
a great conflict before God's Spirit overcometh.</p>
            <p>III. It is evident then that this Sanctification of Souls
is an eminent work of God himſelf: 1. In that it is yet
done on ſo many of his choſen ones in all Ages and Places.</p>
            <p>2. In that as hard as it is, he uſually turneth the
Hearts of Sinners to himſelf, in a very little time:
Somtimes by one Sermon.</p>
            <p>3. It is a work that none can do but God, who hath
the power of Souls.</p>
            <p>4. It is a work ſo good that it beareth God's own
Image: It is but the writing of his Law and Goſpel on
mens Hearts: None is ſo much for it as God. Satan ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
fighteth againſt it with all the power he can
raiſe in the VVorld. Mark it and you will find that
moſt of the ſtir that there is in the VVorld, by falſe
Teachers, and Tyrants, and private Malice, is but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
VVars againſt Faith and Holineſs, and Love:
Certainly it is not he that promoteth them.</p>
            <p>IV. And it is evident in Experience, that it is the
Goſpel of Chriſt which God uſeth and bleſſeth, to do
this great ſanctifying work on Souls. Among Chriſtians
none are converted by any other means And God would
not bleſs a word of falſhood and deceit to ſuch great
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59339:158"/>
and excellent effects: All that are made holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and truly conſcionable among us, are made ſo by
Chriſt's Goſpel: And all the wicked are Enemies to the
ſerious practice of it, or Rebels that deſpiſe it. The effects
daily prove that God himſelf owneth it as his Word.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, There are as good men among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
and Mahometans, as holy heavenly, and juſt:</p>
            <p>I anſwer, It is none of my buſineſs to depretiate
other men: But I can ſay, 1. That I have lived above
Sixty ſeven years, and I never knew one ſerious holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in <hi>England</hi> that was made ſuch by the Writings of
Heathens or Mahometans. 2. Many excellent things are in
the Writings of ſome Heathens, <hi>Plato, Cicero, Hierocles, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,
Antonine, Epictetus,</hi> and many others. But I miſs
in them the expreſſions of that holy and heavenly
frame of mind and life, and that Victory over the
Fleſh and World, which Chriſtianity containeth.</p>
            <p>3. Chriſt is like the Sun, whoſe Beams give ſome
light, before it is ſeen its ſelf at its riſing, and after it
is ſet. The Light of Jews and Heathens, was as the
dawning of the Day before Sun riſing: And the light
among the Mahometans is like the Light of the Sun
which it leaveth when it is ſet.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs the ſame God who hath uſed Mahometans
to be his dreadful Scourge to wicked Chriſtians, who
abuſed the Goſpel by a falſe Profeſſion, hath alſo uſed
them to do abundance of good againſt Idolatry in the
Heathen World: Where-ever they come, Idolatry is
deſtroyed. Yea the corrupt Chriſtians, Greeks, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Papiſts, that worſhip Images, Angels, and
Bread, are rebuked and condemned juſtly by Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.
But, O that they who have Conquered ſo far by the
Sword, were Conquered by the Sacred Word of Truth,
and truly underſtood the Myſtery of Redemption, and
the Doctrin of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:59339:159"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But they think us Idolaters for ſaying that Chriſt
is God, and believing the Trinity.</p>
            <p>I. As to the Trinity; it is no contradiction that
<hi>one Fire</hi> or <hi>Sun</hi> ſhould have Eſſentially a Virtue or
Power to <hi>Move, Light,</hi> and <hi>Heat:</hi> Nor that <hi>one Soul</hi>
ſhould have a power of <hi>Vegetation, Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi>
Nor as <hi>Rational,</hi> to have a peculiar power of <hi>Vitality,
Intellection</hi> and <hi>Free-will.</hi> Why then ſhould the Trinity
ſeem incredidible?</p>
            <p>II. We do not believe that the <hi>Godhead</hi> hath any
change, or is made Fleſh, or the Manhood made God;
but that the Godhead is incomprehenſibly united to the
humane Nature by aſſumption, ſo as he is united to no
other Creature, by and for thoſe peculiar Operations on
the humanity of Chriſt, which make him our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
            <p>They that well think that <hi>God is All in All things,
more than a Soul to all the World,</hi> and as near to us as our
Souls to our Bodies, in whom we live, and move, and
have our being, will find that it is more difficult to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
how <hi>God is further</hi> from <hi>any Soul,</hi> than that
he is ſo much <hi>One</hi> with <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Save that different Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of God on his Creatures are apparent to us.</p>
            <p>By all this we ſee that every ſanctified Chriſtian hath
the certain Witneſs in himſelf that Chriſt is true: He
is truly a Phyſician that healeth, and a Saviour that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
all that ſeriouſly believe and obey him, The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God in a New, and Holy, and Heavenly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Spiritual Life, and Light, and Love, is the
Witneſs.</p>
            <p>VI. The Sixth Article in my Text is [<hi>Received
up into Glory.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:59339:159"/>
That Chriſt after Forty Days continuance on Earth,
was taken up into Heaven in the ſight of his Diſciples,
is a Matter of Fact of which we have all the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
infallible proof, which I muſt not here again
repeat.</p>
            <p>And, 1. If Chriſt were not glorified now in Heaven
he could not ſend down his Spirit with his Word on
Earth, nor have enabled the firſt Witneſſes to ſpeak
with all Tongues, and <hi>heal</hi> the Sick, and raiſe the Dead,
and do all the Miracles which they did. A dead Man
cannot ſend down the Holy Spirit in likeneſs of Firy
cloven Tongues, nor enable Thouſands to do ſuch
VVorks; nor could he do what is done on the
Souls of ſerious Believers in all Ages and Nations to this
Day. He is ſure alive that makes men live, and in
Heaven that draws up Hearts to Heaven.</p>
            <p>2. And this is our Hope and Joy: Heaven and
Earth are in his Power. The Suffering and VVork
which he performed for us on Earth was ſhort, but his
heavenly Interceſſion and Reign is Everlaſting. Guilty
Souls can have no immediate acceſs to God: All is by
a Mediator: All our receivings from God are by him:
And all our ſervices are returned by him, and accepted
for his ſake. And as he is the Mediator between his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and us, his Spirit interceedeth between him and us:
By his Spirit he giveth us Holy deſires and every Grace:
and by his Spirit we exerciſe them in returns to him.</p>
            <p>And our glorified Saviour hath Satan, and all our
Enemies in his Power: Life and Death are at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
All Judgment is committed to him: He that
hath redeemed us is preparing us for Heaven, and it
for us; and receiveth our departing Souls to his own Joy
and Glory. He hath promiſed us that we ſhall be with
him where he is, and ſhall ſee his Glory. He that is our
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59339:160"/>
Saviour will be our Judge. He will come with Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of his Angels to the confuſion of wicked Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and to be glorified in his Saints. He will
make a New Heaven, and a New Earth in which
Righteouſneſs ſhall dwell. Angels and Glorified Saints
ſhall with Chriſt our Head, make one City of God, or
holy Society and Chore, in perfect Love and Joy to
praiſe the bleſſed God for ever.</p>

               <p>Above are the vaſt capacious Regions, ſufficient

               <p>XXXI. This VVorld is as <hi>Newgate,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> as <hi>Tyburn:</hi>
ſome are hence ſaved, and ſome condemned.</p>
               <p>The other VVorld is the Glorious Kingdom of

               <p>All Myſteries of Nature and Grace, are there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled

               <p>XXXVIII. Many of God's Promiſes are here unful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,

               <p>There Truth ſhineth in the full performance of
them all.</p>
               <p>XXXIX. Our Grace is here ſo weak, and Hearts ſo
dark, that our ſincerity is oft doubted of.</p>
               <p>There the flames of Love and Joy leave no place
for ſuch a doubt.</p>
               <p>XL. By our unconſtancy here one Day is joyful and
another ſad.</p>
               <p>But there our Joys have no interruption.</p>
               <p>XLI. We dwell here with ſinful Companions like
our ſelves in Fleſh.</p>
               <p>There holy Angels and Souls with Chriſt are all
our Company.</p>
               <p>XLII. Our beſt friends and helpers are here in parst
our hinderers by ſin.</p>
               <p>There all concur in the harmony of active
Love.</p>
               <p>XLIII. Our Errours and Corruptions make us alſo
hurtful and troubleſome to our Friends.</p>
               <p>But there both Chriſt and they forgive us, and
we ſhall trouble them no more.</p>
               <p>XLIV. Selfiſhneſs and croſs intereſts here jar, and
mar our converſation.</p>
               <p>There perfect Love will make the Joy of every

               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:59339:162"/>
XLV. A militant Church imperfectly ſanctified
here liveth in ſcandal and ſad diviſions.</p>
               <p>The glorious Church united in God in perfect
Love, hath no contention.</p>
               <p>XLVI. Sin and Errour here turn our very publick
Worſhip into jars.</p>
               <p>The Celeſtial harmony of joyful Love and Praiſe
is to Mortals unconceivable.</p>
               <p>XLVII. VVeak, blind and wicked Teachers here
keep moſt in deluſion and diviſion.</p>
               <p>There glorious Light hath baniſhed all Lies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and darkneſs.</p>
               <p>XLVIII. The wills of blind Tyrants is the Law of
moſt on Earth.</p>
               <p>The Wiſdom and Will of the moſt holy God, is
the Law of the heavenly Society.</p>
               <p>XLIX. Lies here cloud the Innocency of the Juſt,
and render Truth and Goodneſs odious.</p>
               <p>All falſe Judgments are there reverſed, and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is ſilenced, and the Righteous juſtified.</p>
               <p>L. Government is here exerciſed by terrour and
violence.</p>
               <p>But there God ruleth by Light, Love, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Delight.</p>
               <p>LI. Enemies, Reproach, and Perſecution here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
and tempt us.</p>
               <p>All ſtorms are there paſt, and the Conquerors
crowned in joyful Reſt.</p>
               <p>LII. The Glory of Divine Love and Holineſs is
clouded here by the abounding of Sin, and
the greatneſs of Satan's Kingdom upon
Earth.</p>
               <p>But the vaſt glorious heavenly Kingdom,
to which this Earth is but a Point and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59339:163"/>
Priſon will baniſh all ſuch erring Thoughts
and Glorifie God's Love and Goodneſs for
ever.</p>
               <p>LIII. This is the World which as corrupted is called
an Enemy to God and us, and which as
ſuch we renounced in Baptiſm, and muſt be
ſaved from.</p>
               <p>That is the World which we ſeek, pray and
wait for all our lives, and for which all the
tempting Vanities of this muſt be forſaken.</p>
               <p>LIV. This Body an World is like our riding
Clothes, our Horſe, our Way, and Inn,
and travelling Company: All but for our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
homeward.</p>
               <p>The other is our City of Bleſſedneſs and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Reſt, to which all Grace inclineth Souls,
and all preſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Means and Mercies tend.</p>
               <p>LV. The very ignorance of Nature and Senſible
things, makes this life a very Labyrinth, and
our Studies, Sciences and Learned Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
to be much like a Dream, or Popet
Play, and a Childiſh ſtir about meer Words.</p>
               <p>But in Heaven an Univerſal knowledge of God's
wonderful Works will not be the leaſt of the
Glory in which he will ſhine to Saints.</p>
               <p>LVI. Diſtance and Darkneſs of Souls here in Fleſh,
who would Fain know more of God and the
heavenly World, and cannot, doth make our
lives a burden by theſe unſatisfied deſires.</p>
               <p>There Glorious Preſence and Intuition giveth
full ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>LVII. Our ſin and imperfection here render us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of being the Objects of God's full
complacential Love, though we have his
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59339:163"/>
benevolence which will bring us to it.</p>
               <p>But there we ſhall in our ſeveral meaſures per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
pleaſe God, and be perfectly pleaſed in
God for ever.</p>
               <p>LVIII. All things here are ſhort and tranſitory, from
their beginning, poſting towards their end,
which is near and ſure, and ſtill in our Eye: ſo
ſhort is time, that Beings here are next to
nothing; the Bubble of worldly Proſperity,
Pomp and fleſhly Pleaſure, doth <hi>ſwell up,</hi> and
<hi>break</hi> in ſo ſhort a Moment, as that it Is, and
and <hi>Is not</hi> almoſt at once.</p>
               <p>But the heavenly ſubſtances and their work, and
Joys, are crowned by Duration, being aſſuredly
EVERLASTING.</p>
               <p>Such, O my Soul, is the bleſſed Change which God
will make.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Reaſons and Helps of my Belief and Hope
of this Perfection.</head>
               <p>1. NAtural Reaſon aſſureth me that God made all
Creatures fitted to their intended uſe: Even
Bruits are more fit for their ſeveral Offices, than Man is.
He giveth no Creature its faculties in vain: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a wiſe Man maketh, he fits it to the uſe which he
made it for. But Man's Faculties are Enabled to
think of a God, of our relation and our duty to him,
of our hopes from him, and our fears of him: Of the
ſtate of our Souls related to his judgment; of what
will befall us after Death, reward or puniſhment, and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59339:164"/>
how to prepare for it: This Nature, and its faculties,
and powers, are not made in vain.</p>
               <p>II. Reaſon aſſureth me that all men are bound by
Nature to prefer the leaſt probability of a Life of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Joy, before all the Proſperity of this World;
and to ſuffer the loſs of all this ſhort Vanity, to eſcape
the leaſt poſſibility of endleſs miſery: And Nature hath
ſuch notices of Rewards and Puniſhments after Death,
that no Man can ſay that he is <hi>ſure</hi> there is no ſuch
thing. From whence it followeth that all men are
bound by the very Law of Nature to be Religious, and
to ſeek firſt and moſt their Salvation in the Life to come.
And if ſo, It's certain that there is ſuch a thing to be
obtained: Elſe God had made the very <hi>Nature</hi> of Man
to be deceived by itſelf, and to ſpend the chief part,
yea all his life, through labour and ſuffering for that
which is not; and ſo made his greateſt duty to be his
greateſt deceit and miſery: And the worſt men ſhould
be leaſt deceived. But all this is not to be imputed to
our wiſe and good Creator.</p>
               <p>III. The univerſal ſenſe of Moral Good and Evil in
all Mankind, is a great evidence of another life. The
vileſt Atheiſt cannot abide to be accounted a Knave, a
Lyer, a bad Man; nor will equal a vicious Servant
with another. All would be thought good who will
not be good. And doth not God make a greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
than Man? And will he not ſhew it?</p>
               <p>IV. The World is actually ruled much by the hopes
and fears of another life, and cannot well be ruled
without it, according to the Nature of Man: But the
Almighty, moſt Wiſe and moſt Holy God, needs not,
and will not rule the World by meer deceit.</p>
               <p>V. The Goſpel of Chriſt hath brought Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
into a clearer Light than that of Nature.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59339:164"/>
And it muſt be by believing in Chriſt that we muſt
have our full ſatisfaction. O what hath God done in
the Wonders of Redemption to make us ſure? And
againſt the doubts that are apt to riſe from ſome hard
particular Text of Scripture, it muſt be conſidered,
I. That Chriſt and his Apoſtles did put the aſcertaining
Seal of the many uncontrolled Miracles to the Goſpel
Doctrin, primarily; which Doctrin, 1. Was delivered
and ſealed Eight years before any of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was written, and almoſt Seventy before the laſt.
2. And Chriſt did not ſpeak in the Language that the
Goſpel is written to us; ſo that being but a Tranſlation
as to his own Words, the Matter is the thing firſt
ſealed.</p>
               <p>II. And that it was the two <hi>Legiſlator-Mediators,
Moſes</hi> and Chriſt, who came with the great ſtream of
uncontrolled Miracles; It being neceſſary that men
ſhould have full proof that a Law or Doctrin is of God,
before they believe it: But the Prieſts and Prophets af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Preachers and Paſtors of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church, who were not Commiſſioned to bring
men any New Laws or Goſpel, but to proclaim and
teach that which they received, needed no ſuch New
Teſtimony of Miracles.</p>
               <p>III. The Belief of every particular Prieſt or Prophet
after <hi>Moſes,</hi> or every Paſtor after Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
was not of the ſame degree of neceſſity to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the belief of the Law and Goſpel itſelf. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though all the Holy Scripture be true, the Law
and the Goſpel muſt be much differenced from the
reſt.</p>
               <p>IV. The <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Law and Goſpel have full
aſcertaining hiſtorical Evidence; or elſe there is none
ſuch in the World. Therefore the Doctrin muſt be
true.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:59339:165"/>
V. The Propheſies fulfilled prove the Goſpel
true.</p>
               <p>VI. And the Divine Impreſs on the whole.</p>
               <p>VII. And the ſanctifying work of the Spirit wrought
by it, in all Nations and Ages, on ſerious Believers, is
a conſtant Divine atteſtation.</p>
               <p>VIII. And as my Faith hath ſo ſure a Foundation, it
confirmeth my Faith and Hope that it hath been ſo
long and great a work of God by his Word and Spirit
on my Soul, to raiſe it to believe, and love, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that Holy ſtate of Perfection and Fruition which I
hope for: That which hath made me ſo much better
than I elſe had been, and turned my Heart and Life,
(though imperfectly) to things above the Pleaſures of the
Fleſh, muſt needs be of God: And God would never
ſend his Grace to work my Heart to Deceit and Lies,
and give me ſuch Graces as ſhall all be fruſtrate:
His Spirit is the Earneſt and firſt Fruits of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>IX. And all the courſe of Religious and Moral duty
which he hath commanded me, and in which he hath
employed my life, were never impoſed to deceive me;
I am ſure by Nature and Scripture that it is my <hi>Duty</hi>
to love God and my Neighbour, to deſire Perfection,
and to ſerve God, and do good with all my
time and power, and to truſt God for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
believing that all this ſhall not be in vain;
nor that which is beſt be made my loſs. O bleſſed be
God for Commands and Holy Duty: For they are
equal to Promiſes: Who can fear that he ſhall loſe by
ſeeking God?</p>
               <p>X. As God hath ſealed the Truth of his Word as
aforeſaid, ſo he hath by an inſtituted Office and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
ſealed and delivered to my ſelf, his Covenant

with the gift of Chriſt and Life, in Baptiſm, and the
Lord's Supper.</p>
               <p>XI. He hath given me ſuch a love to Holy Things and
Perſons, that I greatly long to ſee his Church in perfect
Light, and Love, and Concord: Oh how ſweet would
it be to ſee all men Wiſe, and Holy, and Joyfully
praiſing God: Every Chriſtian longs for this: And
therefore ſuch a ſtate will be.</p>
               <p>XII. I have found here the great benefit of the Love
and Miniſtry of Angels, ſuch as is deſcribed in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.
They have kept me Night and Day; which confirmeth
my hope, that I ſhall dwell with them; for I love them
better than men, becauſe they love and ſerve God
better.</p>
               <p>XIII. That low communion which I have here with
God by Chriſt and the Spirit, in his anſwer to my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Supports, Comforts, Experiences, tends to more.</p>
               <p>XIV. The pleaſure which I have by Love in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the happineſs of my many, many, many holy
departed Friends, and of the Glory of Chriſt, and the
heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is ſure ſome hopeful approach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their ſtate.</p>
               <p>XV. When I ſee the Fire mount upward, and think
that Spirits are of a more ſublime and excellent Nature
than Fire. And when I ſee that all that is done in this
World, is done by Spiritual unſeen powers, which
move this groſs and droſſie Matter, it puts me paſt
doubt that my Soul being a Spirit, hath a vaſt and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
World of Spirits to aſcend to. God hath by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
put into all things an aggregative uniting inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Earth hath no other natural motion. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of Fire tells us its Element is above: And Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

naturally incline to Spirits, and holy Spirits peculiarly
are inclined to the Holy.</p>

XVI. I am ſure, 1. By underſtanding that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
and by willing that I will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. I am ſure
by theſe Acts that I have the power or faculties to do
them. For none doth that which it cannot do. 3. And
I know that it is a ſubſtance that hath theſe powers:
For nothing can do nothing.</p>
               <p>My Soul then being certainly an intellective, Voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
Vital ſubſtance; 1. I have no reaſon to think
that God who annihilateth not the leaſt Sand, will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate
ſo noble a ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>2. Nor that he will deſtroy thoſe Powers which are
its Eſſential form, and turn it into ſome other thing.</p>
               <p>3. Nor that ſuch Eſſential powers ſhall lie as dead
unactive, and ſo be continued in vain.</p>
               <p>4. There remaining therefore nothing uncertain to
natural Reaſon, but the continuance of Individuation
to ſeparate Souls. 1. Apparitions, and Wirches caſes
have put that out of doubt, notwithſtanding many
Fables and Deluſions. 2. Chriſt hath put it more out
of doubt. 3. While ſubſtance, faculties and acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
it is the errour of our ſelfiſh ſtate in Fleſh, which
maketh any fear too near a Union which ſhall end our
individuation. The greateſt Union will be the greateſt
Perfection, and no loſs to Souls.</p>
               <p>XVII. God's wonderful Providences for the Church
and ſingle Saints on Earth, are ſuch as tell us of that
love and care, which will bring them afterwards to
him.</p>
               <p>XVIII. The Nature of God taketh off the terrour of
my departure much: I am ſure I ſhall die at the will, and
into the Hand of Infinite Eſſential Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
whoſe love ſhould draw up my longing Soul.</p>
               <p>XIX. I am going to a God whoſe Mercies have

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59339:166"/>
Friend doth, and better than I love my ſelf, and is a
far better chooſer of my lot.</p>
               <p>XX. As he hath abſolute right to diſpoſe of his
own, ſo indeed the <hi>fulfilling of his Will,</hi> is the ultimate
end of all things, and therefore moſt deſirable in itſelf
And <hi>his will</hi> ſhall be <hi>fulfilled</hi> on me.</p>
               <p>XXI. I go to a glorified Saviour who came down to
fetch me up, and hath conquered and ſanctified Death,
and made it my Birth-day for Glory, and taketh me
for his dear bought own and intereſt, and is in Glory
ready to receive his own.</p>
               <p>XXII. I go to that Saviour who on the Croſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
his Spirit into his Fathers Hand, and taught
me with dying <hi>Stephen</hi> to ſay, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my
Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIII. I go no ſolitary untrodden way, but follow all
the Faithful ſince the death of <hi>Abel</hi> to this day, (ſave
<hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>) who all went by Death into that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
World where I ſhall find them.</p>
               <p>XXIV. I have ſo long groaned under a languid Body,
and in a blind, diſtracted, and by Man uncurable
World, where Satan by Lies, Malice, and Murder
reigneth in—alas how many, and ſpecially am ſo
weary of my own darkneſs and ſinful imperfection,
that I have great reaſon to be willing of deliverance.</p>
               <p>XXV. I have had ſo large a ſhare of Mercies in this
World already, in time, and manifold comforts from
God, that reaſon commandeth me to reſt in God's time
for my removal.</p>
               <p>XXVI. I ſhall leave ſome fruits not uſeleſs to ſerve
the Church when I am gone: and if good be done, I
have my end.</p>
               <p>XXVII. When <hi>I</hi> am gone, God will raiſe up and uſe
others to do his appointed work on Earth: And a
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59339:167"/>
Church ſhall be continued to his praiſe: And the Spirits
in Heaven will rejoice therein.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. When <hi>I</hi> am gone, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not wiſh to be
again on Earth.</p>
               <p>XXIX. Satan by his temptations and all his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
would never have done ſo much as he doth in the
World to keep us from Heaven, if there were not a
Heaven which Conquerors obtain.</p>
               <p>XXX. When darkneſs and uncertainty of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the action and fruition of ſeparated Souls would
daunt me, it is enough to know explicitely ſo much as
is explicitely revealed, and implicitely to truſt Chriſt
with all the reſt: Our Eyes are in our Head; who
knoweth for us? Knowledg of Glory is part of fruition:
And therefore we muſt expect here no more than is
ſuited to a life of Faith.</p>
               <p>XXXI. All my part is to do my own duty and then
truſt God; obeying his commanding will, and fully
and joyfully reſting in his diſpoſing and rewarding
will. There is no reſt for Souls but in the Will of
God, and there with full Truſt to repoſe our Souls in
Life and at Death, is the only way of a ſafe and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
departure.</p>
               <p>XXXII. The glorious Marriage day of the Lamb
cannot now be far off, when the number of the Elect
ſhall be compleat, and Chriſt will come with his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Angels, and will be glorified in his Saints, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
in all Believers, and there ſhall be a New Heaven,
and a New Earth wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs, and
that Kingdom ſhall come, where that which God hath
prepared for them that love him, Eye hath not ſeen,
Ear hath not heard, nor hath it entred into the Heart
of Man to have a formal, full conception of it.</p>
               <p>Come Lord Jeſus; come quickly, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:59339:167"/>
Fear not then, O my Soul, to lay down this Fleſh:
Mercy hath kept it up for my preparing work; but, O
what a burdenſom and chargeable a Companion hath it
been! Is it better than the dwelling place of perfect
Spirits? O what are my groans and all my cold and
faint Petitions, and my dull Thanksgiving, to their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
joyful Praiſe? If a Day in God's Courts be
better than a Thouſand, what is a Day, yea, what is <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs</hi>
in the heavenly Society and Work; O how
hateful a thing is <hi>darkneſs</hi> and <hi>unbelief,</hi> when the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of them thus ſtop poor Souls in their aſcent: And
make us half unwilling to go home? What! unwilling
to be with my glorified Lord? Unwilling to be with
Saints and Angels, who are all Life, &amp; Light, and Love?
Unwilling to ſee the Glory of <hi>Jehovah?</hi> O fooliſh ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Soul! Hath Chriſt done ſo much to purchaſe the
heavenly Glory for thee, and now art thou unwilling
to go into the poſſeſſion of it? Haſt thou been ſeeking,
and praying, and labouring, and ſuffering ſo many
Years, for that which now thou ſeemeſt ſcarce willing
to obtain? Doſt thou not judge thy ſelf unworthy of
Eternal Life, when thou no more deſireſt to enjoy it?
All this is long of thy too much adherence unto SELF
and SENSE: Thou art ſtill deſiring ſenſitive ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not content to know thy part, wouldſt know
that for <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> which Chriſt knoweth for thee: As if
thou couldſt better truſt thy ſelf than him? Fear not,
weak Soul, it is our Fathers good pleaſure to give thee
the Kingdom: Truſt infinite <hi>Power, Wiſdom,</hi> and
<hi>Love:</hi> Truſt that faithful gracious Saviour who hath
ſo wonderfully merited to be truſted: Truſt that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
which never deceived any one? and which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59339:168"/>
by ſo many Miracles, and by the Oath, and by
the Spirit of God. Whenever thou departeſt from this
houſe of Fleſh, the Arms of Mercy are open to embrace
thee, yea, Eſſential tranſcendent Love is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thee: The Spirit of Love hath ſealed thee to
that bleſſed ſtate? Chriſt will preſent thee juſtified and
accepted. Moſt of my old holy familiar Friends are
gone before me, and all the reſt that died ſince the
World began. And the few imperfect ones left behind,
are haſting after them apace, and if I go before will
quickly overtake me: Though they weep as if it were
for a long ſeparation, it is their great miſtake: The
gate of Death ſtands all Day open, and my ſorrowful
Friends are quickly following me, as I am now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
thoſe for whom I ſorrowed. O pitty them
who are left a while under the temptations, dangers
and fears which have ſo long been thy own affliction?
But be not afraid of the Day of thy deliverance, and
the boſom of everlaſting Love, and the Society of the
wiſe, and juſt, and holy, and of the end of all thy
troubles, and the entrance into the Joy of thy Lord,
and the place and ſtate of all thy hope. O ſay, not
notionally only as from argumentative conviction, but
confidently and with glad deſire and hope TO DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PART
AND BE WITH CHRIST, IS FAR BET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER
than to be here.</p>
               <p>But, O my God, I have much more hope in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thee, than to my ſelf. Long may I plead with
this dark and dull, yet fearful Soul, before I can plead
it into joyful hope and heavenly deſires, unleſs thou
ſhine on it with the light of thy Countenance, and
Thou whom my Soul muſt <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> wilt give
me Faith and Love themſelves. I thank Thee for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Arguments: But had this been all the ſtrength
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59339:168"/>
of my Faith and Hope, the tempter might have proved
too ſubtile for me in diſpute. I thank thee that ſome
experience tells me, that a holy Appetite to heavenly
Work, and a love to the heavenly Company and State,
doth more to make me willing to die, and think with
Pleaſure of my change, than ever bare Arguments
would have done. O ſend down the ſtreams of thy
love into my Soul, and that will powerfully draw it up
by longings for the near and full fruition. O give me
more of the divine and heavenly Nature, and it will be
natural and eaſie to me to deſire to be with Thee!
Send more of the heavenly Joys into this Soul, and it
will long for Heaven, the place of Joy. I muſt not
hope on Earth for any ſuch acquaintance with the
World above, as is proper to the enjoying ſtate. But
if the Sun can ſend its illuminating, warming Rays, to
ſuch a World as this, according to the various diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Recipients; doubtleſs Thou haſt thy effectual,
though unſearchable, waies, of illuminating, ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and attractive influence on Souls. And one ſuch
Beam of thy pleaſed Face, one Taſte of thy complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Love, will kindle my love and draw up my deſires,
and make my pains and ſickneſs tolerable; I ſhall then
put off this cloathing with the leſs reluctancy, and
willingly leave my Fleſh to the Duſt, and ſing my
<hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> when I have thus ſeen and taſted thy
Salvation. O my God, Let not thy ſtrengthning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
grace now forſake me, leſt it ſhould overwhelm
me with the fears of being finally forſaken. Dwell in
me as the God of Love and Joy, that I may long to
dwell in Love and Joy with Thee for ever. As Grace
abounded where ſin abounded, let thy ſtrengthning
and comforting Mercy abound, when weakneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth,

               <head>What ſenſible manifeſtation of his Kingdom,

               <p>§ 1. Our Lord who brought Life and Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

ſo great things unſeen: And therefore it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him to give men ſome ſenſible helps by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.
In <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. &amp; 17. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c. Mark</hi> 9. 1.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 28. he promiſed ſome of his Diſciples a ſight of
his Kingdom as coming in power; or ſuch a glimpſe
as <hi>Moſes</hi> had of the Backparts of God's Glory: This he
performed firſt in his Transfiguration, as afterward in
his Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and ſending the holy Ghoſt
to enable them with power, to preach and work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and convert the Nations.</p>
               <p>§ 2. By the Kingdom of God, is meant God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his Holy ones by a heavenly communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59339:169"/>
of Life, Light and Love initially on Earth, by
Grace, and perfectly in Heaven by Glory. A ſpecial
Theocracy.</p>
               <p>§ 3. For the underſtanding of this we muſt know,
that when God had made Man good, in his Image, he
converſed with him in a heavenly manner, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
or by an Angel ſpeaking to him, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him his will. But Man being made a free ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
Agent, he was left to chooſe whom he
would follow: And hearkening unto Satan, and turning
from God, he became a Slave of Satan, and gave him
advantage to be his deceiving Ruler: Not that Man's
rebellion nullified God's Power, or diſpoſing Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or took Man from under Obligation to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
but that forſaking God he was much, though
not wholly forſaken by his ſpecial fatherly approving
Government, and left to Satan and his own will: But
the eternal Word interpoſing for Man's Reprival and
Redemption, undertook to break the Serpents Head,
and to conquer and caſt out him that had deceived
and captivated Man: And chooſing out a ſpecial Seed
he made them a peculiar People, and ſet up a heavenly
Prophetical Government over them, himſelf by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Revelation making their Laws, and chooſing
their chief Governours under him, from time to time,
and would not leave it to blind and ſinful Man to make
Laws or chooſe Princes for themſelves, but would keep
them in a ſpecial dependance upon Heaven. But the
carnal <hi>Iſraelites</hi> having provoked God by odious Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
to deny them much of the benefit of Government
(ſave when they repented and cryed to him for help)
they thought to amend this by chooſing a King like
other Nations, and ending their dependance on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Revelation and choice for Government: And ſo
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59339:170"/>
Theocracy was turned into a more humane Regiment,
and God more caſt off: Though yet he would not
quite forſake them. And the reſt of the World was
yet more left under the power of Satan and their own
corrupted mind and will. So that Satan hath both an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Kingdom in wicked Souls, and a viſible Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Government of the wicked Kingdoms of the
World, ruling them by men that are ruled by him.
And as Chriſt came to caſt him out of mens Hearts by
his ſanctifying conquering Spirit, ſo alſo to caſt him
out of the Political Government of the Kingdoms of
the World, and to bring them under the Laws, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and Spirit of Chriſt, and rule them by heavenly
Power and Love as his own Kingdoms, that he may
bring them to Perfection in one Celeſtial Kingdom
at laſt. And in this ſenſe we pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom
come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. To make men believe that he is the heavenly
King ſent from God to caſt down Satans Kingdom, was
the great buſineſs of the preaching of the Goſpel: This
he would demonſtrate, as by all his Miracles which
ſhewed him to have the Victory of Devils, and to be
the Lord of Life, ſo alſo by <hi>viſible Apparition</hi> in <hi>Glory.</hi>
And as it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7, 8. that there are three
Witneſſes in Heaven, and three on Earth, ſo here
Chriſt would have three heavenly, and three earthly
Witneſſes of his Transfiguration. From Heaven he had
the Witneſs, 1. Of a Voice proclaiming, <hi>This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear him.</hi> 2. Of
<hi>Moſes</hi> the chief Lawgiver. 3. And of <hi>Elias</hi> the chief
Prophet; to tell us that the Law and the Prophets,
are his prognoſticating Witneſſes: But [<hi>Hear him</hi>] no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth
to us, that Chriſt and his Goſpel are to be heard
above the Law and the Prophets, and to teach
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59339:170"/>
us more than they could teach us: The Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Grace and Truth (the ſubſtance ſo typified) are by
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Light and Glory are often of the ſame ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Chriſt was transfigured into a lucid glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Body: He tells us by this, that he would have
us have ſome ſort of Idea of his Kingdom, fetcht from
ſenſe, many Apparitions of Angels have been in lights.
Chriſt appeared to <hi>Saul</hi> in a viſible light, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. So did
he to <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God and the Lamb are the
Light of the New <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It is an inheritance of
the Saints in Light.</p>
               <p>Some ſeem to me to think too baſely of Senſe, and
too far to ſeparate it from Intellectual Spirits both as to
Power, Act, and Object: And all becauſe they find it
in lower Creatures. They might accordingly deny
ſubſtantiality to Spirits, becauſe Bruits are ſubſtances:
The higher have all the Perfections of the lower, either
formally or eminently. It is not a Spirits Perfection to
be inſenſible, or to have nothing to do with ſenſible
things, but to be eminently ſenſible, and to be Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Agents on lower ſenſibles. GOD IS LOVE:
And LOVE is Complacency: And a high degree of
Complacency is Delight or Joy. So that God is Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Infinite Joy: But without that droſſie quality
which is proper to Souls in Fleſh, and all that Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which belongs to Creatures. Can we tell what
it is to enter into our Maſters Joy, or Joyfully to love
and praiſe him, without any ſenſe: I rather think that
as vigorous Youth maketh men capable of more delight
than decrippt, languid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and joyful hopes, becauſe thou canſt not know what
it is: Haſt thou no conception of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs?</hi> If thou hadſt been but one
Year kept in abſolute darkneſs, wouldſt thou have no
deſiring thoughts of light? The Blind think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
half dead, while they are alive. Indeed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
and Object muſt be ſuitable: Light may be too
great for our weak Eyes, as heat may be torment in an
unſuitable degree: but when our Souls are perfected, they
will be ſuitable Recipients of a more glorious Light than
we can here endure: <hi>Moſes</hi> is not there covered in a
cleft of the Rock, becauſe he could ſee but as the back
parts of God's Glory. We muſt ſee here but as in a
Glaſs: but there as Face to Face. Though theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical
Eyes as Spectacles ſhall be laid by, we ſhall
have <hi>Media</hi> more perfect ſuitable to our perfect
ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:59339:172"/>
And as I can think of Heaven as a Region of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Light, ſo can I think of it as a place and ſtate of
<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Love:</hi> I know ſomwhat of the difference of
<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> and that a living Dog is better than
a dead Lyon. And I have felt what it is to love my
Friends, and thence to deſire their near communion as
my delight. And can I then have no Idea of that
World, where Life, Light and Joyful Love are the
very Element of Souls, as Water is to the Fiſhes.</p>
               <p>And as I can have ſome Idea of that ſtate in general,
ſo may I of the ſtate of the perfected Spirits of the Juſt
which are there. They are con-natural to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Element. They are Eſſential created Life, Light,
and Love. And they want not ſubſtance to be the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
of thoſe formal Powers, nor Objects on which to
exerciſe them. Think not then that Heaven is ſo far
unconceivable as not by any Idea to be thought of: If
we have no Conception of it, we can have no deſires
of it, and no delightful hope. What can we conceive
of more certainly, than of Life, and Light, and Love;
of a Region, and of Perſons eſſentiated of theſe? Do
we not know what Knowledge is? and ſee what Light
is? and feel what Life and Love are?</p>
               <p>But it's true that our Conceptions hereof are lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably
imperfect; and ſo they muſt be till Poſſeſſion,
Fruition, and Exerciſe perfect them. Who knoweth
what Light or Sight is, but by Seeing; or what
Knowledge is but by knowing? Or what Love, and
Joy are but by loving and rejoicing? And who knows
what <hi>Perfect</hi> Sight, Knowledg, Love, and Joy are,
but by perfect Seeing, Knowing, Loving, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing?
No Man by an intuitive or immediate percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But ſome abſtractive Conceptions of it we may
have by reaſoning deduction, from that poor Degree
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59339:173"/>
which we here in the Kingdom of Grace poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs.</p>
               <p>Can I perceive ſubſtantiality in the dark terrene ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
which are but mutable lifeleſs matter agitated
and uſed by inviſible Powers and ſhall I think of thoſe
unſeen powerful ſubſtances as if they were leſs ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
for being Spiritual, or were not Objects for a
knowing Thought. Are the Stars which I ſee leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
than a Carkaſs in a darkſom Grave? The
Lord that appeared in ſhining Glory, hath Members in
their meaſure like himſelf; and hath promiſed that we
ſhall ſhine as Stars in the Kingdom of his Father: If
ſome degree of this be here performed in them who are
called the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and the <hi>Lights of the
World,</hi> how much more will they ſhine in the World
of Light. They that call Light a quality or an Act,
muſt confeſs it hath a ſubſtance whoſe quality or act it
is. Alas, what a deceived thing is a ſenſual Unbeliever;
who ſpendeth his Life in the purſuit of fugitive ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
and walketh in a vain ſhew, and thinks of
Spiritual glorious ſubſtances, as if they were the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
or deluſions of a Dream?</p>
               <p>§ 6. Chriſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> here viſibly appeared
as three diſtinct individual Perſons: This tells us that
it is a falſe conceit that Death ceaſeth Individuation, and
turneth all Souls into one: (of which before:) Perfect
indiviſible infinite Unity is proper to God: From this
<hi>One</hi> is <hi>multiplicity.</hi> Reaſon forbids us when we ſee the
numberleſs individuals in this World, and ſee alſo the
numerous Stars above, to imagine that all the Worlds
above us have ſo much of Divine Perfection, as to be
but one undivided ſubſtance, and to have no multiplicity
of Inhabitants. Yea, ſome of thoſe <hi>Sadduces</hi> hold that
the Stars are Worlds inhabited as the Earth is. And
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59339:173"/>
why then ſhould they think whither ſoever Souls go,
that they ceaſe their individuation) When they go
among individuals? But Chriſt hath confuted them
even to Senſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> is <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtill, and <hi>Elias</hi> is <hi>Elias</hi>
ſtill: And all our Friends that are gone to Chriſt, are
the ſame ſtill that they were, and may be called by the
ſame Names. <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are the ſame
in Heaven; and <hi>Lazarus</hi> was <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
boſom. When we lay by Fleſh, and are uncloathed,
we put not off our perſonality: Every one ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his own reward, according to what he hath
done in the Body, when every one muſt give account
of his own works and talents.</p>
               <p>Why then may I not with diſtinct conceptions and
joyful deſires look after the Souls of my departed
Friends, that are now in the Celeſtial Kingdom?
Though malignity hath ſcorned me for naming ſome
few in my <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> being ſuch as the Despiſers hated;
yet I forbear not on ſuch accounts to Solace my ſelf by
naming more, but becauſe they are more than it's fit to
number. In all places where I have lived, how many
excellent Souls (though here they were not perfect) are
gone to Chriſt? How ſweet is the remembrance
of the communion which I had with many of them
in <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and other parts of <hi>Shropſhire?</hi> Of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
at <hi>Dudley</hi> and the adjoining parts: Of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
at <hi>Kiderminſter, Bewdley,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire:</hi>
Of abundance at <hi>Coventry,</hi> and other parts
of <hi>Warwickſhire:</hi> And of many where I have ſojourned
in other parts of the Land: And above all in <hi>London,</hi>
and the adjoining parts? As Mr. <hi>How</hi> hath elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
it in his excellent Character of my excellent and
dear Friend Mr. <hi>Richard Fairclough: What a Multitude</hi>
of <hi>Bleſſed</hi> Saints will ariſe at the laſt Day out of <hi>London?</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:59339:174"/>

and this Earth is as it were hallowed with the Duſt and
Relicts of ſo many bleſſed Souls. But it's Heaven that
is ſpangled with theſe Spiritual Stars: The place ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with them, and they with it, and all by Chriſt.
We are like Infants, or Lambs, or other young ones,
that cry for their Dams if they be but out of ſight;
though they are never ſo near, if they ſee them not,
they cry as if they were not, or had forſaken them. As
Chriſt told his Diſciples, that it was needful for them
that he departed from them, and yet their Hearts for
this were ſorrowful, till the Holy Ghoſt came upon
them, as better than Chriſt's fleſhly preſence, to prepare
them joyfully to follow him; ſo we think of our
Friends as almoſt loſt to us by ſeparation, till the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Spirit tell us where they are, and prepare us to
deſire to be with them.</p>
               <p>§ 6. <hi>Elias</hi> hath a Body now in Heaven; and ſo
hath <hi>Henoch:</hi> But can we think that only two or
three that are there with Chriſt do ſo much differ from
all the reſt, as to have Bodies when the reſt have none?
Is there ſuch a diſſimilitude of Saints in Heaven?
What are two or three in ſuch a Society? Doubtleſs
their Bodies are not corruptible Fleſh and Blood,
but ſuch Spiritual Bodies as all Saints ſhall have at the
Reſurrection. But are they in Heaven ſuch viſible and
ſhaped Bodies as they appeared on the Mount? The
ſame difficulty poſeth us about the riſen Body of Chriſt:
He would not have <hi>Mary</hi> touch him becauſe he had not
yet aſcended to his Father? He could appear and vaniſh
from their ſight at his pleaſure: And yet <hi>Thomas</hi>
handled him, and felt that he had Fleſh and Bones:
That Body of Fleſh aſcended viſibly up toward Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
And yet it is not Fleſh and Blood in Heaven, but
a Spiritual Body: For it is not worſe than he will make
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59339:175"/>
his Members. What ſhall we ſay to theſe things?
We muſt ſay, That we are not capable of knowing
them, but have Reaſon to be thankful that we may
know ſo much, more neceſſary for us: But yet it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
probable that the Bodies of Chriſt, and <hi>Henoch,</hi>
and <hi>Elias</hi> were changeable according to the Region in
which they were to be: Chriſt could take up a Body
of Fleſh and Blood, and immediately change that ſtate
of it into a pure incorruptible Spiritual Body, as it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into the incorruptible Spiritual Region: And ſo
God did by <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that we
ſhall not all die (thoſe that live till Chriſt's appearing)
but we ſhall all be changed. And yet if <hi>Elias</hi> have buſineſs
on the Mount, he can put on the cloathing of a groſſer
Body to be ſo ſeen of men, and can lay it by or return to
his more inviſible Spiritual ſtate when he returneth to
the place from whence he came. And no wonder, when
Angels (and the Ancients ſay, Chriſt before his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
aſſumed Bodies ſuitable to their ſeveral buſineſſes
on Earth; yea, ſuch as could eat and drink with men;
when yet they dwelt not in Heaven ſo courſly cloathed.</p>
               <p>§ 7. But how came <hi>Moſes</hi> to have a Body on the
Mount, who is ſaid to have been buried, and therefore
took none with him into Heaven? We muſt ſtill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that we enquire of things above our certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
But in humble conjecture we may ſay, That
it's no more impoſſible for <hi>Moſes</hi> to aſſume ſuch a Body as
he appeared in on the Mount, for that occaſion, than for
Angels to appear in humane ſhapes; and departed Souls
too, as many Apparitions have told men. And if bad Souls
can do it, why not good ones when God will have it? The
Tradition ſeemeth but a Jewiſh Dream, that God kept
the Body of <hi>Moſes</hi> uncorrupted in the Grave; and that
this was it that the Devil is ſaid to ſtrive for againſt <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:59339:176"/>
that the Body might be corrupted. (And ſay
others, that at this Transfiguration it roſe again.)
There need no ſuch conceits to our ſatisfaction. The
Soul of <hi>Moſes</hi> could aſſume a Body.</p>
               <p>§ 8. But ſtill the diſſimilitude of <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>
from all the Saints in Heaven, is an unreſolved diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
If we knew that God would have it ſo, it might
ſatisfie us. But there is a ſymmetry in the Body of
Chriſt. And it's like that the ſame Region hath Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the ſame Nature. What ſhall we think then?
That <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> at their entrance into thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
laid by their Bodies, and became ſuch as <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and other holy Souls? Why are they taken up to be ſo
laid by? (The corruptibility no doubt they did lay by.)
God knoweth: but its much unknown to us. Or ſhall we
think as all thoſe Fathers cited by <hi>Fauſtus Regienſis,</hi> and as
Dr. <hi>More,</hi> and ſome of late, that all Spirits are <hi>Souls.</hi>
and animate ſome Bodies; and ſo that all in Heaven
have ſome Bodies: If ſo, what Bodies are they? And
how differ they from the Reſurrection ſtate? As the
Soul here operateth in and by the <hi>Igneous</hi> Spirits in our
Bodies, it may be ſo lodged in theſe as to take ſome of
them with it at Death, as the life of a dying Plant, yet
dieth not in the Seed. And a Man may be ſaid to go
unclothed to Bed, though he put not off his ſhift or
neareſt Garment, and to be clothed again when he puts
on the reſt: And at the Reſurrection, as there will be
a New Heaven and Earth, ſo Spirits now in Heaven may
have much more delightful buſineſs on the New and
Righteous Earth, than now they have, and therefore may
have uſe for an additional Body, as much differing from
what they have now in Heaven, as the New Earth,
and their employment there require; and as the Seed
doth differ from the Plant. And Spirits being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59339:176"/>
will be more happy by more communication.
As God delighteth to do good to all his works, ſo the
Souls now confined to Heaven, will delight to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in doing good to the New Earth, and to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the Bodies ſuited to ſuch work. Though now
they have uſe for no other than ſuch Spiritual lucid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles
as are fit for the Regions where they dwell.
And it will be no debaſement or dejection for a Spirit
now in Heaven to animate a Body at the Reſurrection fit
for the New Earth; no more than it was to Angels
to ſpeak to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Jacob,
Manoah,</hi> and others; or then it is to the Sun to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
and enliven things on Earth.</p>
               <p>It is a fooliſh thing to think as ſome do, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Souls will be as dormant, and unactive, as
in Apopletick or Sleeping Perſons, for want of Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
Bodies to act in. Spirits are Eſſentially Active,
Intellective, and Volitive: And will God continue ſuch
Eſſential Powers in vain? <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> wanted not Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
And thoſe in Heaven can praiſe <hi>Jehovah</hi> and the Lamb
with holy concordant Love and Joy; whether in any ſort
of ethereal Bodies or without, we ſhall ſhortly know.</p>
               <p>§ 8. It is ſaid that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talked with
Chriſt: This ſheweth that Chriſt hath familiar commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Bleſſed. He that would come into Fleſh
on Earth; and live with Man in an humbled ſtate, and
refuſed not familiar converſe with poor men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and would eat and drink with Publicans and
Sinners, will not refuſe everlaſting near familiarity with
the glorified: If the Church be his dearly beloved Spouſe,
and as it were one with him, as his Body, ſurely he will
be no ſtranger to the leaſt and loweſt Member of it.</p>
               <p>§ 9. But what was it that they talkt about? <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.
31. ſaith, They appeared in Glory, and ſpake of his
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59339:177"/>
deceaſe which he ſhould accompliſh at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This
was not to make it known to Chriſt, who came into
the World to die for ſin: What then was it for? Did
Chriſt tell them of it, as not knowing it before? That
is not likely neither. Did he need their comfort, as
Angels in his trials miniſtred to him and ſtrengthned
him? The particular uſes of this ſpeech we know not?
But in general we know it was ſomwhat preparatory
to his great Sufferings and Death.</p>
               <p>And muſt Chriſt's Sufferings and Death have ſuch
preparation, and muſt not mine have much premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and do I not need the conſolatory meſſages of
God? Carnal men would rather have choſen pleaſanter
diſcourſe, than the talk of Sufferings and Death. But
that which muſt be undergone, and requireth greateſt
ſtrength, muſt be forethought of, and requireth the
moſt preparing Thoughts. It's worſe than madneſs to
be ſurprized with Sufferings and Death, before it's
ſeriouſly forethought of? So ſharp a trial and ſo great a
change, require the greateſt preparation. He that can
refuſe to ſuffer and die, may refuſe to talk or think of
it. If Chriſt muſt have men from Heaven to talk
with him of his Croſs, what cauſe have we to ſtudy
the Croſs? Even all our lives to foreſee it, and by
obedient conſent to ſubmit unto it, and take it up to
follow Chriſt, and even to determine with <hi>Paul</hi> to know
nothing in the World but Chriſt and him Crucified,
that is, to take this for the only needful and excellent
Learning: But, alas, how ſenſleſly is Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
talkt of till it comes! We are to learn how to
ſuffer when ſuffering is upon us; and to learn how to
die till Nature or the Phyſician paſs the ſentence of
Death on us at hand. And it is God's Mercy to ſome
of us to make our ſufferings long, that we may have
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59339:177"/>
a competent time of learning. As we learn to write by
writing, and to diſcourſe by diſcourſing, and every Art
and Trade by practice; even ſo by ſuffering we learn to
ſuffer. And the Leſſon is very hard: Malefactors
ſuffer without Learning, whether they will or not, but
to ſuffer Obediently with Child-like affections is the
Leſſon to be learnt. O little, too little do many honeſt
Chriſtians think how much of their moſt excellent Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
conſiſteth in Child-like holy Suffering. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they little expect it, and provide for it: And
then they are overwhelmed with the unexpected ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal
when it comes. Even in the ſufferings which
men bring on the Faithful for Righteouſneſs ſake,
how many ſhrink and ſhift off their duty, or venture
on forbidden things for ſafety, becauſe they were not
prepared for it: The loſs of goods or impriſonment
and want, ſeem to many almoſt unſufferable trials: But
I can tell ſuch by ſome experience, that bodily pain
and torment is a far greater trial, which none of them
is ſecured from; and requireth greater ſtrength of
Faith, obediently to accept it at the Hand of God.
And others can tell them, that the violence of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and the terrours of God on a wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and troubled Soul, are yet far harder than all
theſe. And theſe are the ſaddeſt becauſe they make the
mind unfit at preſent to improve them, and to refer
them to Holy Ends and Uſes. Chriſt in all his Agony,
and even when he cryed out on the Croſs, <hi>My God, my
God, why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> had his Intellectuals
free and perfect, to know the Nature, the Reaſon, the
uſes and end of all his Sufferings: But ſo have not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
poor diſtreſſed, troubled, diſtracted Souls. O how
great a part of Chriſtianity is it, to underſtand and
rightly bear the Croſs? Moſt of our care is how to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59339:178"/>
eſcape it, or to be delivered from it, rather than how
obediently to bear it.</p>
               <p>§ 10. Experience of a ſuffering painful ſtate, is a
great help to our underſtanding of the Goſpel: It ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
off from me the ſcandal of Chriſt's Croſs, and
helpeth me to perceive the great uſe and reaſons of it,
when I am under ſufferings. O what need have I of
ſuch an example as Chriſts. All the parts of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are as uſeful to teach me how to ſuffer as the Ten
Commandments to teach me what to do. That he
was put to fly from proud domineering <hi>Phariſees,</hi> falſe
Teachers and worldly Rulers, and to converſe moſt
with the Poor in Wilderneſſes or obſcure various
places? That he was hated and perſecuted for doing
good, and accounted a Sinner for neglecting mens <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi>
and Traditions: That he was hardly believed
even by them that ſaw his Miracles: And his own
Diſciples were ſo ſlow in learning; and that in
his ſuffering they all forſook him and fled, and one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him with Oaths and Curſes. All theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
Inſtances; That Chriſt's natural (though ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs)
averſation to Death and Suffering, and his fear,
ſhould be ſo powerful, and the ſenſe of God's puniſhing
Juſtice ſo terrible, as to make his Soul ſorrowful even
to the Death, and caſt him into an Agony, where he
ſwate Water and Blood, and to pray thrice that the
bitter Cup if poſſible might paſs from him, which he
came into the World to drink; all theſe alſo are teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parts of the Sufferings of Chriſt; That Rulers,
and Prieſts, and Souldiers, and the Rabble ſhould agree
to Scorn him; Cloth him in deriſion, Spit on him,
Buffet him, Scourge him, make him their Jeaſt that
came to ſave them; that they ſhould make a Sinner of
him that never ſinned, but came to deſtroy it and ſave
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59339:178"/>
men from it; yea, to make him no leſs than a Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
a Blaſphemer, and an uſurping Rebel againſt <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
and write this laſt as his Accuſation on his Croſs,
thinking to leave his Innocency no Vindication or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
for the Lord and Saviour of the World to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
all this, is very inſtructing to a ſuffering Believer:
That he ſhould as ſuch a Malefactor be reviled on a
Croſs, and numbred with Tranſgreſſours, and his ſide
be pierced, and he there cry out to his Father as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
by him: That thus dying he was buried, and his
Soul went to the place of ſeparated Souls, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Paradiſe; they are excellent Leſſons which may be
learnt from all this.</p>
               <p>I am not to ſuffer for others, nor to make God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
a ſatisfying Sacrifice for ſin, as Chriſt did: But I
muſt ſuffer God's Fatherly Corrections, and the caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of paternal healing Juſtice: I muſt be ſaved as
by Fire, and paſs through this Purgatory that I may
be refined: I muſt ſuffer from Chriſt and for Chriſt;
for my ſin, and alſo for Righteouſneſs ſake: And I
muſt with a filial Juſtification of God's Holineſs and
chaſtening Juſtice, bear his indignation becauſe I have
ſinned againſt him: I am predeſtinated to be conformed
to Chriſt's Image, in ſuffering and in ſanctity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, I muſt count all things loſs for the
excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord,

things, and count them Dung that I may win him,
and be found in him—and not only know the power

ſuch that their conſolations may abound, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>But, alas, I ſuffer much more for my own ſin, than
for Chriſt and Righteouſneſs. But even this alſo by the
Croſs of Chriſt is ſanctified, and made a great remedy
againſt my Sin. As Chriſt ſuffered for our ſins, and
yet merited by his Suffering; ſo if we accept the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigatory
puniſhment, and Exerciſe Repentance, and
Mortification in our ſuffering, and an obedient ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the Rod, God will take this as acceptable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and bleſs it to our further good.</p>
               <p>§ 11. But how is it that Chriſt is ſaid, to <hi>learn obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
by the things that he ſuffered, and ſo to be made
perfect?</hi> Heb. 5. 8, 9. was he unlearned and imperfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
He had no culpable imperfection. But his ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mediation was imperfect till it was all performed: It
was not perfectly done; and when it was done he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
was conſtitutively made a perfect Mediator: as he ſaid
upon the Croſs, <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> And as his humane Nature
received additional acts of knowledge, as he grew up
and converſed with more Objects, and ſo is ſaid to
<hi>increaſe in Wiſdom</hi> (as <hi>Adam</hi> knew the Creatures when
he ſaw them;) ſo he had a new acquaintance with <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
ſuffering,</hi> when he was under the experience
of it; and is ſaid to <hi>learn</hi> it, in that he now <hi>exerciſed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:59339:179"/>
And ſhould not my ſuffering be God's School;
ſhould I not learn obedience by it? Surely, as it ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tells me of the evil of former diſobedience, ſo it calls
me to remember in whoſe hands I am, and with whom I
have to do, and what is my duty in ſuch a ſtate? God
can do no wrong to his own: He will do nothing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
hurtful to his Children. In all our afflictions he is
ſaid to be afflicted, to ſignifie that he afflicts not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
or without our provocation. Juſtice is good,
and holineſs is good; and it's good for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and be weaned from the Fleſh and World:
And all good muſt be loved, and the means as ſuch:
Sharp Heart-breaking Sermons are unpleaſing to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and yet to be loved for their uſe. And afflictions
are God's powerful Sermons: The proud and hardened
are forced to hear them, who ſcorn and proſecute
Preachers for ſpeaking the ſame things: And ſhall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
under ſufferings be untaught. Words are but
Words, but ſtripes go by forcible ſenſe unto the Heart:
Obedient ſubmiſſion to the greateſt pains, is a ſerious
acknowledgement of God's Dominion, and of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Love, and the certain hopes of a better life.
Impatience hath in it ſomwhat of Atheiſm, or Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
God is not duely acknowledged and honoured.
<hi>Job</hi>'s Wife would have had him thus purpoſly provoke
God, to end his miſery by Death: As if ſhe had
ſaid, <hi>Speak no more well of him, by whom thou ſuffereſt
ſo much, nor honour a God that will not help thee:</hi> But
Patience ſaith, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>I will look unto the Lord; I
will wait for the God of my Salvation: my God will hear
me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Impatience ſheweth a miſunderſtanding of God's
dealing with the afflicted; but patience yieldeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it underſtandeth whence all comes, and what
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59339:180"/>
will be the fruit and end. A Man that is let Blood
for his life, is not impatient with the Chyrurgion;
but a Beaſt will ſtrive, and a Swine or Child will cry.</p>
               <p>Our burdens are heavy enough of themſelves: Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
maketh them heavier, and is more painful than the
thing which we ſuffer: Some have gone mad with croſſes
which oft to another would have been light. Patience is
our cordial and nepenthes: yea, the Health of the Soul by
which it is able to bear its infirmities. In our patience
we poſſeſs our Souls, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 19. whatever elſe we loſe,
we loſe not our ſelves. He that keepeth his Faith, and
Hope, and Love by patience keepeth his Soul. But
the impatient loſe themſelves; as if their other loſſes
were not enough. A poor Man ſingeth that gets his
living only by his Day-labour: When a Lord or
Knight would be tormented with ſorrow, if he were
reduced to his degree. Striving under our yoak and
burden maketh it Gall the more: And we cannot ſo
hopefully or comfortably pray for deliverance from the
pain which we make our ſelves, as from that which
God layeth on us: Though alſo there, we muſt pray
for the Grace that muſt ſave us from our own impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
               <p>Patience preventeth many ſins; which impatience
cauſeth: Hard thoughts of God, if not hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly
Words; <hi>Job</hi> ſinned not nor charged God
fooliſhly: Impatience tempteth men to think that Piety
and Prayer are in vain, and to condemn the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Juſt, and to leave off Duty, and ſay, Why
ſhould I wait on God any longer; yea, and to venture
on falſe and ſinful means, in hopes of deliverance and
eaſe.</p>
               <p>Were it to men, we have much to allay our impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:
But againſt God impatience hath no juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59339:180"/>
Infinite Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs can do
nothing that deſerveth blame: We have God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
that <hi>All things</hi> ſhall work together for our good:
And is he not to be truſted? Or is the means of our
good to be accuſed?</p>
               <p>Impatience, is unſeemly for them that believe that
heavenly Reſt and Glory are at hand; where all their
pains and ſorrows will end. Were a Man on the Rack,
and were ſure to have all that he deſired after it,
he would the more eaſily endure it. Why elſe did
the Martyrs ſo patiently ſuffer? It's incongruous to
complain of any thing that brings a Man to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was himſelf Innocent, and yet accuſed not
God for his ſufferings. But we ſuffer juſtly for our
faults; and it's ſo much leſs than they deſerve, that the
ſins which we ſuffer moſt for are ſaid to be forgiven us,
in that the everlaſting puniſhment is forgiven: Should
we ſo often ſinfully pleaſe the Fleſh, and yet muſt it
not ſmart? Shall we ſo often grieve the Spirit of God,
and not be grieved? Shall we loſe our time, neglect
our duty forget our home, fall in love with the World,
and yield to temptations, and defile our Souls with filth
and vanity, and muſt not correction tell us of our ſinful
folly? If we ſuffer for our faults and bear it patiently,
it is not thanks worthy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>Our merciful Father doth uſe to ſhame us for our
impatience, by the bleſſed end of our Afflictions. The
End that God made with <hi>Job</hi> ſhewed the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Patience: When our afflictions are over, do
not all Believers ſee cauſe of thankfulneſs for them, and
ſay, <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted?</hi> The pain is
paſt, and the benefit remaineth. And if all that's paſt
was Mercy to us, why ſhould we much fear that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59339:181"/>
which is to come. Heaven will end all, and ſhame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
for ever.</p>
               <p>Our patience is much of our perſeverance: What
a deal of labour do thoſe impatient men loſe, that learn
and pray, and are ſomwhat Religious, and have not
patience at the laſt aſſault to bear the trial, but fail
when they ſeemed to be near the Crown?</p>
               <p>Hold out then poor deſponding Soul: Lift up the
Hands which hang down, and the feeble Knees, and
run with patience the Race which is ſet before thee,
looking to Jeſus who for the joy that was ſet before
him, endured the Croſs. God will not deceive thy
hopes! Sin hath brought pain and death on Man; but
Chriſt hath ſanctified it, and is the Lord of Life. Yet
a little while, and the heavenly Poſſeſſion ſhall turn
thy ſorrows into everlaſting Joy, and thy moans and
groans into thanks and praiſe, and there ſhall be no
more ſickneſs, pains or death. O fooliſh unbelieving
Hearts that cry out of ſuffering, and fear deliverance;
that would fain be free from all affliction, and yet fly
from the only ſtate of freedom: That are impatient
under their calamity, and yet afraid of paſſing to the
only reſt.</p>
               <p>§ 12. But it is neither Pain alone, nor Death alone
that will ſufficiently try our ſtrength and exerciſe our
Faith and Patience. It muſt be <hi>Great Pain</hi> (and often
<hi>Long</hi>) in order to a certain or expected Death. Theſe
two conjunct were the Caſe of Chriſt. The torment
of his Agony, Scourging, Crucifying, Piercing and
Deſertion, and the certainty of Death that followed.
<hi>Great pain</hi> with hopes of recovery and eaſe, may be
born even by a worldly Man: Becauſe there is ſtill
the worldly hope of better; and ſo there is no denial
of All, while Life it ſelf is not denied: We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59339:181"/>
the Sentence of Death in our ſelves, if we will find
that we truſt in God alone, and truſt him as one that
raiſeth the Dead, that is, for another and better life.</p>
               <p>As long as a Man hath any hope of life and eaſe, a
Man's Faith is not tried to the uttermoſt, by actual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
all. And yet an eaſy Death alone, doth not
fully try a Man: For they that know that all muſt
die, may ſubmit to this, who cannot bear long pains
before it. But great and long pains, and the Sentence
of Death together are the trial.</p>
               <p>And if God will ſo try me, why ſhould I repine?
Fleſh will groan, but the Mind may obediently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
It is but Fleſh: that Fleſh that hath tempted and
impriſoned my Soul. I have too much loved it, and
am too loth to leave it? And is it not Mercy from God to
make me weary of it? God is engaged againſt Idols;
that is, all that is loved and pleaſed before him: and if
any thing, that's likeſt to be this Fleſh. It's corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
tells us that both its pleaſure and its pain will be
but ſhort. Long pain is uſually tolerable: And into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
pain will conquer Nature and not be long. The
Grace of Chriſt is ſufficient for us, and his ſtrength is
manifeſted in our weakneſs, when he will not take the
Thorn out of our Fleſh, though as Chriſt and <hi>Paul</hi>
did, we pray thrice or oftner.</p>
               <p>And to be impatient with Death is to repine that we
are born Mortal men; and to fly from Heaven and all
true Hopes, and all the Felicity purchaſed by Chriſt?
And is this renouncing the World, and truſting Chriſt
for Life everlaſting? And why fear we that which endeth
all our pains and fears? A true Believer never ſuffereth
ſo much, but his Mercies are far more and greater than
his ſufferings. His Soul is united to Chriſt: His hopes of
Heaven have a ſure Foundation: He is ſealed up to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59339:182"/>
Glory: Reſt and Joy are near at hand. And former
Mercies ſhould not be forgotten: And ſhould not ſuch
men patiently endure? O what a ſhameful contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is it, to chooſe Heaven as our only Portion, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Chriſt for it, and to ſeek it as the buſineſs of
all our lives, and yet to be loth to die, that we may
obtain it, and to fly with fear from that which we ſo
ſeek and hope for? What a contradiction is it to call God
our God and Father, the God of Love, and to call Chriſt our
Gracious glorified Redeemer, and yet to Fly from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
with diſtruſtful fear? <hi>Almighty love</hi> may correct us,
may kill us, but it cannot finally hurt true Believers.</p>
               <p>So much of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> diſcourſe of the Sufferings
and Death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§ 13. Sure it is not true that the Souls of the Fathers
before Chriſt's coming did not enter into Heaven, but
lay in ſome inferiour <hi>Limbus?</hi> For <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>
came from Heaven; their ſhining glory ſhewed that,
and their diſcourſe with Chriſt, and the Voice and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that went with them. And it is not to be thought
that they were ſeparated from the reſt of the Souls of
the Faithful, and with <hi>Henoch</hi> were in Heaven by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
alone, and the reſt elſewhere. Though it's ſaid
that God's Houſe hath many Manſions, and there are
various degrees of Glory, yet the bleſſed are all Fellow-Citizens,
of one Society, and Children in one Family
of God. And they that came from Eaſt and Weſt,
ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the
Kingdom of God; and <hi>Lazarus</hi> is in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom,
and the believing Thief with Chriſt in Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>§ 14. It ſeems that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared thus,
to fore ſhew the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and of the
Faithful, and to make it eaſier to the three Diſciples
to believe it. Why ſhould they doubt whether Chriſt
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59339:182"/>
ſhould riſe, when they ſaw <hi>Moſes</hi> that was riſen before
him: And why ſhould they doubt of the Reſurrection of
the Faithful and the Glory following, when they ſaw theſe
glorified Saints? Some think that this Apparition was for
the ſtrengthening of Chriſt himſelf, whoſe humane Nature
had uſe for ſuch Miniſtry alſo of Angels: But it's more
certain that it was for the ſtrengthening of the Diſciples
Faith, and of ours by their Teſtimony. As it's ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi>
12. 30. <hi>This Voice came not becauſe of me, but for your ſakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 15. It is much worth our noting, in what a
<hi>Communion</hi> this <hi>Specimen</hi> of the Kingdom of Heaven
was repreſented in the holy Mount. Here was a Voice
of God and a glimpſe of his Glory: Here was our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
in a glimpſe of his Glory: Here was a <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and <hi>Elias</hi> in a glimpſe of their Glory: And here were
three beloved Diſciples, yet in the Fleſh, and in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Faith which needed ſuch confirmation, God our
Father, and our Saviour, the Saints of Heaven, and
thoſe on Earth, are all of one Society or Kingdom,
there is a near relation, and a near communion among
them all. When the Eternal Word diſdained not ſo
wonderful condeſcenſion, as to come to us in the form
of a Servant, even of a poor deſpiſed Crucified Man, it's
leſs wonder that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ſhould come down as
his Witneſſes and Servants <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and City of the Living God, of
which we are Enrolled Burgeſſes or Heirs, hath many
parts: There is the Aſſembly of the firſt Born, and
innumerable Angels, and the Spirits of the Juſt made
perfect, and Jeſus the Mediator of the New Cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nant,
and God the Judge of all. O what holy, glorious, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Company ſhall we have above? Chriſt and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
will not deſpiſe the leaſt of Saints.</p>
               <p>§ 16. But what was the Introduction to this Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59339:183"/>
and Transfiguration? It was Chriſt's praying;
<hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 28, 29. <hi>He went up into a Mountain to pray:
and as he prayed he</hi> was transfigured: Surely, this is
written to invite and encourage us to pray. We are in
greater need than Chriſt. It's folly in Unbelievers to
think Prayer vain, becauſe God is unchangeable. We
are not unchangeable: And the exerciſe of Faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on God and true deſires, being the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
required in a due Receiver, maketh thoſe Bleſſings
become our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, which elſe we had been uncapable of
God who commandeth fervent Prayer, hath promiſed
to anſwer it. Though we muſt not think to be the
Rulers of the World, nor have whatever our Fleſh or
ſolly doth deſire, becauſe we ask it earneſtly; yet true
Prayer is the appointed way for obtaining what we need,
and is beſt for us, and we are fitted to receive. And
as Chriſt had this wonderful return to his Prayers, his
Servants have experience that their choiceſt Mercies for
Soul and Body, have come this way.</p>
               <p>§ 17. Though the three Diſciples were admitted to
this glorious Society, how different was their caſe from
that of Chriſt, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias?</hi> In the beginning
of the heavenly concourſe, <hi>they were aſleep with</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs:
Even while this glorious Company ſtood near
them: Alas, ſuch is our infirmity in Fleſh, and ſuch a
Clog are theſe earthly Bodies to us, that when God is
preſent, and Heaven is before us, and we have the
greateſt cauſe to watch and pray, a heavy, weary, ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh
Body, even fettereth an active Spirit, and we ſleep
or turn away in wandering Thoughts, when we ſhould
ſeriouſly converſe with Chriſt and Heaven: Alas, what
unworthy Servants hath our Lord! Are ſuch as theſe
meet for his work, his Love, his Acceptance, or his
Kingdom? But, O how merciful a Saviour have we,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59339:183"/>
who taketh not his poor Servants at the worſt, but
when they after ſerved him thus in his Agony, he
gently rebuketh them; <hi>Could you not watch with me
one Hour:</hi> and that with an excuſe, <hi>The Spirit is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but the Fleſh is weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 18. It is a matter of great Moment to underſtand
in what caſes this excuſe will hold, and our weakneſs
will not make the willingneſs of the Spirit unacceptable
to God. If a Drunkard, <hi>Fornicator,</hi> or other Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
ſhould ſay, My Spirit is willing to leave my ſin,
but my Fleſh is weak, and in temptation doth prevail,
<hi>Video meliora probo<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>, &amp;c.</hi> This excuſe would not prove
God's forgiveneſs. If a Man live in known ſin, which
he could forbear were he truly willing, and ſay, <hi>To will
is preſent with me, but to do I am unable; it is not I but ſin
that dwelleth in me;</hi> this would be but a frivolous excuſe:
And yet to the ſleepy Diſciples it was a good excuſe;
and I think to <hi>Paul, Rom</hi> 7. where then is the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence?
There are ſome acts of Man, which the will
hath not power to rule, and ſome that it can rule: The
will hath not power always to keep a ſleepy Man
awake: This ſleep might be of the Fleſh without any
will at all: And this excuſeth from all guilt: There
are ſome acts of Man which the will cannot rule, but
by a <hi>great degree</hi> of power and endeavour: As per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
with much ado by preventing and reſiſting dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
the Diſciples might have kept awake: In this
caſe their ſleep is a fault, but a pardoned fault of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Some Perſons are liable to inordinate <hi>Fear</hi> and
<hi>Grief,</hi> which ſo ſurprizeth them by the Conſtitution of
their Bodies, that the greateſt <hi>unwillingneſs would</hi> not
hinder them. And ſome could do more to reſiſt theſe
paſſions than they do, but very hardly with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
diligence. Theſe are accordingly excuſable in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59339:184"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>perfectly</hi> obeyed God's Law,
and never have ſinned: But there is no Perfection in
this Life: Meer Imperfection of true Grace which is
predominant in the will, doth not damn men. But
there are acts which are ſo ſubject to the will that a
<hi>ſincere will,</hi> though <hi>imperfect,</hi> can command them: He
that doth <hi>theſe</hi> (or doth the contrary) it is not becauſe
he <hi>ſincerely would and cannot,</hi> but becauſe he hath but
uneffectual wiſhes, and is not <hi>ſincerely willing,</hi> if he
know them to be what they are. Eſpecially if they be
materially <hi>great ſins</hi> which he yieldeth to, which true
Grace more ſtrongly reſiſteth than it doth an idle word,
or thought, or action. In ſhort, all omiſſions or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
in which the will is poſitively or privatively
guilty, are ſinful in ſome degree: but only theſe do damn
the Sinner, which are inconſiſtent with the predominant
Love of God, and Heaven, and Holineſs, in the Soul.</p>
               <p>§ 19. When the Diſciples awaked they ſaw theſe
glorious ones in converſe! Did they hear what
they ſaid, or did Chriſt after tell them? The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is moſt probable: Doubtleſs as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us how
God made the World, which none could tell him but
by God's telling them firſt; ſo the Apoſtles have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
many things of Chriſt, which they neither ſaw nor
heard, but from Chriſt that told it them by Word or
Inſpiration. How elſe knew they what Satan ſaid and
did to him in his Temptations in the Wilderneſs, and
on the Pinacle of the Temple? How knew they what
his Prayer was in his Agony? And ſo in this inſtance
alſo. But Chriſt's own teſtimony was enough to put
them out of Doubt, to them that daily ſaw his confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Miracles.</p>
               <p>§ 20. How great a difference was there between
Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> and this Mount? When, God delivered
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59339:184"/>
the Law to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that Mount was terrible in Flame,
and Smoak, and Thunder, ſo that the People trembled
and fled: But now here is nothing but Life, and Light,
and Love from Heaven. A merciful Redeemer whoſe
Face ſhined as the Sun, with heavenly Company, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
nearly to the Diſciples, pittying and bearing
with their heavineſs and infirmity, ſtrengthning their
Faith and Hope, and proving to them a Reſurrection
and a heavenly Kingdom, by a viſible Apparition of
ſome of its Poſſeſſors. This was not a frightful, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
delectable ſight: The Law in terrour was by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
but Grace and Truth, Peace and Pleaſure are by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This was an inviting and delighting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting
Apparition: Was it not a ſhameful infirmity
and a ſin, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould deny Chriſt after ſuch a
ſight as this; and the reſt of the Diſciples forſake him
and fly? What! after they had ſeen the Kingdom of
God come in Power, and Chriſt's Face ſhine as the Sun
in its brightneſs? Could they forget all this? Or could
they doubt whether he or his Perſecutors were the
ſtronger, and liker to prevail at laſt? O how frail, how
uncertain, how bad a thing is depraved Man?</p>
               <p>But though Chriſt found them aſleep, and though he
foreknew that they would forſake him, he forſook
not them, nor uſed them as they deſerved, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
them with a glimpſe of Heaven. For he died
for his Enemies.</p>
               <p>§ 21. But this was but <hi>once</hi> in all the time of his
abode among them. It was an extraordinary Feaſt,
and not their daily Bread: They had Chriſt ſtill with
them, but not tranſfigured in Glory, nor <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
in their ſight: We are too apt to think that if God
give us a joyful extraordinary glimpſe of Heaven, we
muſt have it always; or that he forſaketh us, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59339:185"/>
off when he denieth it us! O that we were as deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of Holineſs and Duty, as we are of the Joy which
is the reward! But our Father, and not we, muſt be the
chooſer both of our Food and Feaſt. <hi>Moſes</hi> did not
dwell on Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> that he might ſtill ſee the Land
of Promiſe: It was enough to have one ſight of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death. As Fleſh and Blood cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven, ſo it's little of Heaven that entereth into it.</p>
               <p>§ 22. When the Diſciples <hi>awake they ſee his Glory,
and the two men that ſtood with him:</hi> It muſt not be a
ſleeeping but an awakened Chriſtian, that will have a
ſight of heavenly Glory! As we muſt love God with
all the Heart, and Soul, and Might, all muſt be awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
in ſeeking him, and in attending him, before
we can have a joyful foretaſt of his Love. Carnal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
ſupine neglect, and dull contempt, are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
which render us uncapable of ſuch delights.
Heavenly joys ſuppoſe a heavenly diſpoſition and deſires.
Angels ſleep not, nor are clogged with Bodies of Clay:
Earth hath no Wings; It muſt be holy vivacity that muſt
carry up a Soul to God, notwithſtanding the fetters of
Fleſh. It is with each others Souls in the Body that we
converſe together on Earth. And it is not ſluggiſh, but
lively Faith, and fervent deſire that muſt converſe in
Heaven, with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and our living Head.</p>
               <p>§ 23. <hi>But how did</hi> Peter <hi>know</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias,
whom he had never ſeen before? Perhaps glorified
Saints do bear each one his notifying Signature, and
need not names and ſound of words to make them
known: Perhaps Chriſt told the Diſciples who they
were that talked with him: Perhaps he made them
know it by Inſpiration, as Prophets have their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Any of theſe ways God could notifie them: It
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not needful that we know which of them it was. But
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59339:185"/>
that they were known is certain. We ſhall be no
Strangers to any Saints in Heaven; and therefore not to
our old acquaintance. Whether we ſhall have any
greater love to them, or delight in them, for old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
ſake, or becauſe they were inſtruments of
our good on Earth, I know not: But I know that our
love to them with whom we had Holy comfort on
Earth, may well render Heaven more familiar to us
now, and more ſuitable to our deſires: O how great a
number of my godly Friends are there? They are ſo
many that I cannot make a Catalogue of their Names;
but the Memory of abundance of them doth delight me.
And when we meet there we ſhall be far better known
to each other, then we were to the moſt intimate on Earth.</p>
               <p>O let Chriſtians now ſo converſe together, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that they muſt meet in Heaven, where all
that was ſecret will be brought to light. If we now
put on any Vizor, and ſeem better than we are, if
we hide any ſin or baſe corruption; if we by fraud or
falſhood deceive our Friends, all this will be opened
when we meet in Heaven. It is a daily grief and
ſhame to my Soul, to think of the ſins that I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt ſome that are now in Heaven, which I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
excuſed, extenuated or hid: And to think how much
evil they will know of me there, which on Earth they
knew not by me. But God who pardoneth them,
will cauſe his Servants there to forgive each other; but
the detected ſin for all that will be an odious ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing. Lying and Hypocriſie are there no cloak,
but an aggravation of the ſhame. If we cannot confeſs
and take ſhame to our ſelves by repentance upon Earth,
how ſhall we appear in the open light, and ſee the
Faces of thoſe whom we wronged: What diminution
it will make of our joy, I know not; but it muſt needs
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59339:186"/>
be a diſhonour to have been falſe to God or Man. And
eſpecially when we meet where ſin is perfectly hated, to
think how we either ſinned together, or that we temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and enſnared one another in any ſin; how it will
affect us then I do not fully know, but it is now to
me a far greater grief to think of any in Heaven whom
I tempted or wronged, than it was while they lived
with me on Earth. And I think there is ſomwhat of
this Nature common to good and bad: Even the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of wicked men do haunt them for notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
to others, eſpecially concealed ones, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for perſecuting the Servants of God, when they are
dead, more than while they lived. In ſo much that
(though I doubt not of real Apparitions) I am ready to
think, that ſome that ſay they are haunted by the
ſight and the voice of ſuch as ſeem to them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
Perſons, are rather haunted by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
which ſtrongly repreſent thoſe Perſons to
their imaginations.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, it is a great delight to me, to
think of the good which I received from many that are
now in Heaven: Of the profitable Sermons which I
heard from ſome, and the profitable converſation
which I had with others: How oft we ſweetly conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together of the things which concern everlaſting
life? How many days in publick and private we ſpent
in preparation and in ſome proſpect of the Bleſſedneſs
which now they enjoy? And it is not a ſmall Mercy to
me, that I can think of Multitudes now in Heaven of
whoſe Converſion and Salvation God hath made my
weak endeavours a proſperous means. O what a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is it to think on, that while I am yet compaſſed with
temptations, and languiſhing in weakneſs, and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in pain, and worſt of all burdened with a dark and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59339:186"/>
ſinful Soul, ſo many are paſt all this with Chriſt, by
means of any help which he ſent them by my labours?
It hath oft humbled me greatly to read in the lives of
ſuch men as <hi>John Janeway,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Allen,</hi> how
much of their proficiency they aſcribed to my Writings,
and how far they over-went me, and left me quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them in Holy delights and praiſes of God! But
how much more am I below a Multitude now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
who called me Father here on Earth.</p>
               <p>And if here I muſt rejoice with them that rejoice, as
well as mourn with them that mourn, why ſhould I
not much more rejoice with all the bleſſed Society
above? And more familiarly with my old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Pupils, and dear Friends? My Love ſhould be
moſt to the beſt; and therefore more to them than to any
other of my Friends: And therefore my Union with
them being cloſer, and their Felicity far greater, I
ſhould think with more Joy of them, than of any left
behind. They are ſafe in the Harbour, paſt all our
dangerous ſtorms and waves. And though they know
or will know more of my ſins than they did on Earth,
and hate them more, yet they that feel the comfort of
the Pardon of their own, will imitate God in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, and rejoice in God's forgiveneſs of me. Though
their vile Bodies lie like common duſt, how much
better do they now know the love of God, the Myſteries
of Grace, the heavenly Glory, the ſtate of Spirits in the
City of God, than I do who was wont to preach it to
them. God that ſent down <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> to ſhew that
Saints in Heaven, and on Earth have communnion, will
bring me and my Friends now in Heaven together again
into a far ſweeter Communion than ever we had here.</p>
               <p>§ 24. It is no great wonder that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be
tranſported with this glorious ſight; and greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59339:187"/>
with this heavenly Communion, and ſay, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
it is good for us to be here.</hi> Would not a ſight, a
glimpſe of Heaven, have tranſported any Holy Soul?
Yea, even thoſe that now lie in tears and fears, and
are overwhelmed with doubts and troubles? When
they are groping after God, and groaning on their
Knees becauſe they feel more of his frowns than of his
love, if then they had ſuch a ſight as this, what
a change would it make upon them? Perhaps you'll
ſay, that the doubt of their own ſincerity might ſtill
deprive them of the Joy. No: This ſight would ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
doubts and troubles: It is a communication of Love,
and ſuch as will fully convince the Communicants.</p>
               <p>Without ſuch a miraculous glimpſe of Glory, God
ſometime giveth ſome of his Servants ſuch a Mental illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
and inward glimpſe and taſte of Heaven, as
greatly overcometh all the fears of Pain and Death;
ſuch many old and later Martyrs have had: It was a
ſtrange word of the godly Biſhop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Farrar,</hi> to his Neighbours, [<hi>If I ſtir in the Fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not my Doctrin:</hi>] and accordingly he ſtirred not.
If he had not had ſome Prophetical Inſpiration, this
could not have been juſtified, from being a preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
tempting God: And Mr. <hi>Baynam</hi>'s caſe was a
meer wonder, who in the Flames called to the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
to ſee a Miracle, profeſſing to them that in the Fire he
felt no more pain, than if he had been laid in a Bed of
Down or Roſes.</p>
               <p>I am juſt now reading in <hi>Melch. Adam</hi>'s Lives of the
<hi>German</hi> Philoſophers, the Life of <hi>Olympia Fulvia Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata,</hi>
which ended with ſome ſuch experience. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages there hath been ſome one rare Woman who
hath excelled men in the Languages, Philoſophy and
other humane Learning: Such a one was this <hi>Olympia
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59339:187"/>
Fulvia Morata</hi> of <hi>Ferrarrie:</hi> She married <hi>Andr. Gund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
a Phyſician: She removed with him into <hi>Germany;</hi>
being by the way convinced of the Guard of Angels by
her young Brothers falling out of a high Window on
cragged Stones without any more hurt than if it had
been on the ſoft ground: In <hi>Germany</hi> ſhe thus wrote
to <hi>Anna Eſtenſis</hi> a <hi>Guiſian</hi> Princeſs <q>[<hi>As ſoon as by the
ſingular goodneſs of God, I was departed from the</hi> Italian
<hi>Idolatry, and came with my Husband into</hi> Germany, <hi>it
is incredible how God changed my Soul</hi> (or mind)
<hi>which being formerly moſt averſe</hi> (or abhorring) <hi>to the
Divine Scriptures, am now delighted in them alone,
and place in them all my Study, Labour, Care, and
Mind: And as much as poſſible contemn all the Riches,
Honours, and Pleaſures, which formerly I was wont to
admire.</hi>]</q> But the Croſs preſently following (in God's
uſual Method,) her Husband and She were by Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſtript naked ſave the ſhift next the Body, and
narrowly ſcaping with life, were put ſo to wander from
place to place, none daring to entertain them, even
when ſhe was ſick of a Feaver: till at laſt they found
liberal entertainment; in which ſhe ſhortly fell into a
mortal Diſeaſe, of which ſhe died: And in her laſt Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and after much torment of Body, near Death ſhe
pleaſantly ſmiled: Her Husband asked her the Cauſe;
who ſaid, <hi>I ſaw a certain place which was full of a moſt
clear and beauteous Light:</hi> Intimating that <hi>ſhe ſhould
be quickly there,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>I am wholly full of Joy:</hi>
And ſpake no more till her Eye-ſight failing; ſhe ſaid,
<hi>I ſcarce know any of you any more: But all things elſe
about ſeem to be full of moſt beauteous Flowers;</hi> which
were her laſt words, (having a long time profeſſed
that nothing ſeemed more deſirable to her than to be
diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, in all her ſickneſs magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his Mercies to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:59339:188"/>
Many have thus joyfully laid down the Fleſh to go
to Chriſt: What wonder then if <hi>Peter</hi> was loth to
loſe the pleaſure of what he ſaw.</p>
               <p>Two things are neceſſary to great and ſolid joy:
Firſt, That the <hi>Object</hi> be truly and greatly amiable and
delectable; and Secondly, That the apprehenſions of
it be clear and ſtrong: As to the firſt, we have ſo
great and glorious things to delight us, as would feaſt
our Souls with conſtant Joy, were not the Second,
alas, much wanting. What Man could chooſe but be
even in <hi>Peter</hi>'s rapture continually, if he had but aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
heavenly Glory, apprehended by him in as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
a manner as theſe ſenſible things are? If I lay
in Priſon, yea, or in torment of Colick, Stone, or
any ſuch Diſeaſe, and had but withal ſuch apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or ſight of aſſured Glory, ſurely the pain would not
be able to ſuppreſs my joy. What a mixture, what a
diſcord would there be in my expreſſions? Torment
would conſtrain my Fleſh to groan; and the ſight of
Heaven would make me triumph. I cannot but think
how this great diſcord would ſhew the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh:</hi> What a ſtrange thing it
would be to hear the ſame Man at the ſame time crying
out in pain with groans, and magnifying the love of
God with tranſporting joy! But we are not yet fit for
ſuch joyful apprehenſions; our weak Eyes muſt not
ſee the Sun, but through the allaying <hi>Medium</hi> of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
Air, at a vaſt diſtance, and by the Chryſtalline hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and organical parts of the Eye. Fain we would
get nearer, and have ſight or clearer apprehenſions of
the Spiritual Society and glorious World; We ſtudy,
we pray, we look up, we groan under our diſtance,
darkneſs, and unſatisfying conceptions: But yet it
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59339:188"/>
muſt not be: We muſt be ripened before the Shell
will break, or the dark Womb will deliver us up to
the Glorious Light. But Chriſt vouchſafed that to his
three Apoſtles, which we are unworthy of, and yet
unfit for. O happy ſight! O happy men! It is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
to ſay, <hi>What would I not give for ſuch a ſight?</hi>
Leſt it ſhould ſavour of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> folly: And I
have nothing to give. But it is not incongruous to
ſay, <hi>What would I not do? And what would I not ſuffer
for ſuch a fight?</hi> Yea, Chriſt puts ſuch kind of Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to us; O that I had better anſwered them! in the
Hour of <hi>Duty,</hi> and in the <hi>Hour</hi> of <hi>Temptation!</hi> When he
asked, <hi>Can ye drink of the Cup that I drink of, and be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
with the Baptiſm, that I am Baptized with?</hi> I have
been ready with <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to ſay, <hi>I can;</hi> but when
the trial comes (as they after in his ſuffering <hi>forſook him
and fled,</hi>) how inſufficient is my own ſtrength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
my promiſe? When he impoſeth on me, the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
of my ſelf, forſaking all, and taking up the Croſs
and following him,</hi> I yielded and covenanted by Vow
to do it: but it was, <hi>By the help of the Holy Spirit</hi>
which he promiſed to give me. I ſtand, Lord, to my
Covenant: Help me to perform it; and give me,
though not his preſent ſight, yet ſome of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
apprehenſions, and a glimpſe, a taſte of that which
tranſported him with delight. Let who will (or who
Thou wilt) take the Riches, and Grandeur of the
World: O give me ſome delightful taſte of that
which I am made for, redeemed for, and which thy
Spirit hath long taught me, to ſeek and hope for, as
my All.</p>
               <p>§ 25. <hi>Peter</hi> was not weary with the ſight of this
heavenly Apparition: Why ſhould I be weary of the
believing contemplation of greater things? Though
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59339:189"/>
ſight affect us more ſenſibly than meer believing and
thinking, yet theſe have their happy Office, which
may be effectual: And Chriſt who thus appeared in
Glory to <hi>Peter,</hi> hath ſaid, Bleſſed are they that have
not ſeen, and yet have believed: And <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf
ſaith of them that ſee not Chriſt, that <hi>They rejoice with
joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, in believing.</hi> Oh how
unexcuſable am I for every weary Prayer or Meditation
of ſuch a Glory? and for yielding to Satan and a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Heart, which have oft made me ſhorten theſe
ſweet employments, when I had time, and leave, and
need to lengthen them: What! aweary of communion
with Chriſt! Aweary of ſpeaking to my heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for endleſs Bleſſedneſs, upon ſuch joyful terms of
Hope as he hath given me? Aweary of the Thoughts of
the City of God, the heavenly Society and Work? Aweary
of exciting Divine Love, and exerciſing it in Divine
Praiſe, which are the works of Angels, and all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Hoſt? O how juſtly might God be as it were
aweary of me, and of my weary Services; yea, of
the beſt that I can offer him, which hath in it ſo much
to give him cauſe?</p>
               <p>§ 26. <hi>Peter</hi> did not fly from this glorious Proſpect;
but would fain have had more of it, and have dwelt
upon the Holy Mount. And when God will call me
to a more glorious Viſion, and Fruition in Heaven,
ſhall I draw back and be unwilling to go? Was that
Mount a better place than Heaven? Is not Chriſt now to
be there ſeen in greater Glory? Is the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
above, the Glorious Company of Saints and Angels,
no better and more deſirable a ſight, than <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Elias</hi> were on the Mount? Alas, when we have read,
and heard, and thought, and talkt ſo much of Heaven,
and done, and ſuffered ſo much for it, that yet we
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59339:189"/>
ſhould draw back with fear and unwillingneſs to go to
it? O what lamentable weakneſs of <hi>Faith,</hi> and power
of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> doth this diſcover: when I read <hi>Peter</hi>'s words
[<hi>It's good to be here:</hi>] I am grieved that I who dwell in
a World ſo near like Hell, among the implacable haters
of Holineſs and Holy Peace, and in a painful tired
Body, and who have thought, ſaid, and written ſo
much of Heaven, do yet ſay with no ſtronger deſire
and joy: <hi>It is good to be there:</hi> When I ſee all natural
Appetites deſire earneſtly their proper food, and even
the Bruits deſire their beloved company, ſhall my holy
Appetite be ſo dull and indifferent: Lord quicken it
by the fuller communications of thy Spirit, and ſave
me from this hated dangerous diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>§ 27. But <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake he knew not what, when he
talkt of building Tabernacles on Earth, for the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that which is proper to Heaven. Alas, this is our
common malady and folly: We would have Chriſt in
the Splendour of his Glory: but we would have him
here: We would ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> if they will
come down to us: We would have that in the Fleſh,
which Fleſh and Blood cannot poſſeſs. O if we knew
in what Land, what City, what Countrey, what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Houſe, we might live in the leaſt glimpſe of the
heavenly Glory, how joyfully ſhould we run to ſuch
an Habitation? Merchants make towards the moſt
gainful place for trade: Poor men enquire after the
moſt fertile and delectable Countries for Plantation!
Gentlemen delight themſelves with a ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
ſeated Manſion: But if Saints on Earth could
find a place where they could ſee what <hi>Stephen,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi>
or theſe Apoſtles ſaw, and have a little of Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
dying and putting off this Body, what a deſirable
dwelling would that ſeem to them. And yet, alas,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59339:190"/>
how cold are our deſires to the time and place where
we ſhall have much more? We have Chriſt on Earth, in
the manner and meaſure that we are capable. We have
here ſome communion with Heaven, as verily (though
not ſo ſenſibly) as our Eye hath with the Sun: God
will not deny Believers their Title, their Earneſt, and
ſome firſt Fruits: But when we would have our All or
our Beſt on Earth, or that on Earth which is proper to
Heaven, we know not what we deſire or ſay.</p>
               <p>Are we vile dirty Sinners in Fleſh now fit for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
ſights or joys? Or is this World a place for
building Tabernacles, where we may ſee the Lord,
and take up our reſt? What! in a world of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of wickedneſs, of ſufferings, where we are daily <hi>wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtling</hi>
for our lives, and <hi>fighting</hi> not meerly) againſt <hi>Fleſh</hi>
and <hi>Blood,</hi> but againſt Principalities and Powers, and the
<hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> of <hi>this World,</hi> even <hi>Spiritual
Wickedneſs</hi> (or wicked Spirits) <hi>in high Places</hi> (above
the greateſt men that are their Servants,) <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12.
But that which is of the Earth is earthly: Our earthly
part would have an earthly Felicity: But when we
know that it is corruptible and a dying thing, and that
we have here no continuing City, both Faith and Reaſon
bid us ſeek for one to come. The unfaithful Steward
had ſo much Wit as to make ſure of another Habitation,
when he knew that he muſt be no longer Steward.</p>
               <p>God hath ſo conſtantly confuted and befooled me,
by his marvellous Providence, when ever I have ſaid,
<hi>Soul take thy eaſe,</hi> and have thought of building Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles
on Earth, as hath convinced me, that ſuch
folly is not the leaſt part of the danger of a Soul, from
which his Mercy did ſo watchfully ſave me: If a little
Health and Eaſe, or a pleaſant Habitation, or beloved
Company and Friends, have but flattered me into
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59339:190"/>
earthly delight and hopes, and made me ſay, <hi>It's good
to be here;</hi> I never was long without ſome pains, and
dangerous ſickneſs, or ſome loſs or croſs in Friends, or
ſome removal by perſonal or publick changes, to tell
me, that I knew not what I ſaid; and that reſt and
happineſs are not here: As the laborious Ants and
Bees are long gathering a heap of Treaſure, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
a Hive with Winter Proviſion, and a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
foot ſoon ſpurneth about the one, and the chief
owner of the Hive deſtroyeth the other; ſo (while I
neglected Wealth and Honour) when I have but trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
up the choiceſt Books, and taken pleaſure in my
Work and Friends, God ſaw that ſuch pleaſure needed
an allay, and hath taken away Books and Friends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or driven me oft from them and my Habitation,
to tell me ſenſibly that I have higher to look, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to go; and that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared not to
turn Earth into Heaven, and make me think that now I
am well, but to invite my Soul to their Celeſtial Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
When Chriſt hath comforted me by hearing
Prayers, by great deliverances, by wonderful ſucceſs of
my defective labours, by comfortable Friends, by
publick Mercies, it was not by making my condition
pleaſant, to keep down my deſires from Heaven, but
to draw them thither by ſuch foretaſts. Contentment
with our Condition, as without more of the World, is
a great duty: But to be content with the World, or
any thing on Earth, without more holineſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, and without a part in the heavenly
Perfection, is a heynous and pernicious ſin.</p>
               <p>But, alas, it is a far worſe miſtake than <hi>Peter</hi>'s
which deceiveth the greateſt part of men. They ſay
indeed as he, <hi>It's good to be here,</hi> (till melancholy or
miſery make them intollerable to themſelves.) But it is
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59339:191"/>
not becauſe they have ſeen a glimpſe of Heaven on
Earth, or taſted the ſweetneſs of Holy ſociety and
work, but becauſe their Bodies are in Health, their
Purſes full, their Appetites pleaſed, and their inferiours
do their wills and honour them. This is all the Heaven
that they love, and to leave all this is the Death which
they abhor and fear. And they will not hear God,
and the experience of all Mankind befooling them, till
near the <hi>Night that their Souls ſhall be required,</hi> and
then, <hi>Whoſe will all their Treaſure be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 28. But yet it was a greater part of <hi>Peter</hi>'s dotage,
to think of Tabernacles for <hi>Chriſt, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi>
and of detaining of heavenly Inhabitants upon Earth:
If you ſhould offer the loweſt Saint in Heaven an
earthly Kingdom in exchange for his Condition, with
what diſdain would he deſpiſe the offer? Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was not of this World, nor would <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Elias</hi> change their lot with <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Poor
trifles allure us, and ſeem ſomwhat to us (as toys to
Children) while we are dreaming in the Fleſh; but if
once we be delivered and ſee what the Celeſtial Glory is,
what a change will it make upon our judgments. We fear
now in the dark to go unto that World of Light, and
are loth to put off the rags of Fleſh, and to depart from
a known though a dirty falling habitation: But if we get
to Heaven we ſhall be loth to return to Earth again, and
to be ſo courſly cloathed: When once we are there, a
World would not hire us to come back into this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
Body, till God will make it Spiritual and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.
Our Friends whoſe Death we paſſionately
lamented, would be loth now to change their company
for ſuch as we are, or their abode for ſuch a wicked
World as this, or their work for the beſt of ours on Earth:
No wonder that departed bleſſed Souls appear not to
their friends on Earth: Moſt Apparitions are of Devils, or
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59339:191"/>
miſerable Souls, to whom it is no loſs, or condeſcenſion
Were I once in Heaven, could I poſſibly be willing to be
turned again into a Bedlam World, and laid under the
Feet of blinded pride and raging madneſs, and live among
<hi>Sodomites</hi> (called Chriſtians) whoſe God is their Belly, and
who glory in their filthineſs and ſhame, and mind nothing
with love but earthly things, and are bitter Enemies not
only to the Croſs, but to the Government of Chriſt! Would
I be again among Dogs and Swine? Yea, Devils in Fleſh,
who hate and perſecute the Regenerate Seed, and all that
will not receive their mark, and be as mad &amp; bad as they?
would I again be groaning here in pain, or tired with a
weary Body, and more with a feeble ſinful Soul, weak
in Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, Cold in Love, of doubtful Hope, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Duty. Would I be here again in the proſpect
of a Grave, with fear of dying; as ſtrange as now to
the heavenly Felicity? <hi>Lazarus</hi> will not come from
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom, for the rich Man's Wealth and
Belly-pleaſure, no not to warn his ſenſual Brethren.
Had <hi>Peter</hi> ſeen Heaven as he ſaw the Glory on the
Mount, he would never have made ſo blind a motion,
for Chriſt, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> to continue there, who
have ſo much better a habitation.</p>
               <p>§ 29. But this glorious Apparition was but <hi>ſhort:</hi> As
the Glory of God's back parts to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which did but
paſs by. Preſently a cloud cometh, and ſeparateth
the company, and ends the pleaſant ſight. When
Chriſtians receive ſome extraordinary ſenſe of the Love
of God, ſome ſweet foretaſts of promiſed happineſs,
they muſt not look that this ſhould be ordinary, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſo! When ſome fervent Prayer is extraordinarily
anſwered, and a Sacrament ſweetned with unuſual
drops of heavenly ſweetneſs, or a holy Diſcourſe or
Meditation hath raiſed us higher than ever before, we
muſt not expect that this ſhould be our conſtant diet,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59339:192"/>
and God ſhould thus feaſt us all the Year. The times
of faſting alſo have their turn. <hi>Moſes</hi> did not dwell
on Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> nor Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> or <hi>Piſgah,</hi> from
whence he ſaw the Land of Promiſe: God's Children
do not always laugh and ſing: while they have their
ſinning times, they will have their ſuffering and crying
times. How ſuddenly doth the Lark come down to
the Earth, who before was ſoaring out of ſight, and
ſinging pleaſantly in the higher Air, as if it had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring
towards the Sun. A luſcious diet is not beſt for
ſuch as we, that have ſo many corruptions to be cured
by cleanſing means: Cordials muſt not be all our Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick;
unwarrantable expectations of greater or more
continued Joys then we are meet for, is injurious both
to God and to our ſelves. Deſires of more we may and
muſt have: But thoſe deſires muſt look up to Heaven
where indeed they may be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>30. The joy of theſe Spectators was turned into
<hi>Fear</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>when they entered into the Cloud.</hi>
No wonder: The change was ſudden and great; from
a ſight of the <hi>Kingdom of God in Power,</hi> unto a dark
<hi>Cloud!</hi> Juſt now they ſeemed almoſt in Heaven, and
preſently they knew not where they were: From glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Light, to a kind of Priſon of obſcurity.</p>
               <p>Such changes here we are liable to. The ſame Soul
that lately taſted of tranſporting joy, may lie in terrour,
hardly reſiſting temptations to deſpair: The ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that was confident of the Love of God, may be
quickly not only doubting of it, but ſinfully denying
it: The ſame that had aſſuring evidence of ſincerity,
may ſhortly conclude that all was but Hypocriſie. The
ſame that was triumphing in the ſenſe of Love, may cry
out, O miſerable Man that I am: And the ſame that
magnified the Grace of Chriſt, may ſay, The day of
Grace is paſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Eſpecially if either the Tempter get the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59339:192"/>
advantage of a Melancholy Body, or of caſting the Soul in
to renewed guilt of ſome wounding ſin, or into impatient
diſcontents with the things that befal it in the World.</p>
               <p>There is a ſtability in the Eſſentials of Holineſs: It's
Life eternal that is here begun: But, alas, the degrees
of Grace, the exerciſe of it, the evenneſs and integrity
of our obedience, and accordingly our Comforts, are
lamentably liable to change. Even as all worldly things
are mutable to the ungodly, though their harden'd Hearts
are too little changeable. Expecting nothing but joy
from God, or expecting more than we are meet for,
maketh our dejections the greater and more grievous.
None are caſt lower with terrour, trouble, and almoſt
deſpair, than ſome that have been moſt tranſported
with joy: When ſome other Chriſtians of an even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
have an evenneſs and conſtancy of Holy
Peace, though no ſuch joys.</p>
               <p>§ 31. The Cloud ſeparated the Company, <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and <hi>Elias</hi> are ſeen no more; no nor the Glory of
Chriſt: But yet Chriſt is not ſeparated from them:
His ordinary preſence ſtill abideth with them. Chriſt
doth not leave the Soul, when extraordinary joys do
leave it: It loſeth not his ſaving Grace, nor the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of his Spirit, as oft as it loſeth heavenly delight.
<hi>Deſire</hi> ſheweth <hi>Love</hi> to him, and to his Holineſs: And
he never forſaketh thoſe that love him: As long as the
Soul breatheth after Chriſt, and after more communion
with God, and conſcious of its imperfection would fain
be perfect, and reſolveth to continue waiting for increaſe
of Faith and Holineſs in the uſe of the means which
Chriſt hath appointed, it is not forſaken. Chriſt by
his Spirit dwelleth, and worketh in that Soul. It may
enter into a Cloud, and Chriſt may be unſeen, and
ſeem quite loſt, but the Cloud will vaniſh, and he will
appear; and he will firſt find us, that we may ſeek
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59339:193"/>
and find him. If he appear to us, but as in his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and as crucified, and thereby humble us, and
crucifie to us the World and the Fleſh, with the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Luſts thereof, and cauſe us but to ſeek
firſt his Kingdom and Righteouſneſs, he will raiſe us
higher, and ſhew us his Glory, when Grace, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
and Perſeverance have prepared us: We are in
a cloudy World and Body; and our ſins are yet a thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
Cloud, between God's glorious Face and us: But
as God is God, and Heaven is Heaven, ſo Chriſt is Chriſt,
and Grace is Grace, when we ſee it not, but fear that we
are undone, and entring into outer darkneſs: And at Sun
riſing all our darkneſs, &amp; all our doubts &amp; fears will vaniſh.</p>
               <p>§ 32. Luke 9. 15. <hi>There came a Voice out of the
Cloud, This is my beloved Son; hear him:</hi> Had I heard
ſuch a Teſtimony from Heaven, would it not have ſet
my Faith above all doubts and unbelief? For the
Voice that thus owned Chriſt and his Word, might
embolden me fully to truſt all his Promiſes, as it bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me to obey his Precepts.</p>
               <p>God's Love is effective and communicative; and as
his Life and Light cauſe Life and Light, ſo his Love
cauſeth Love; and Chriſt that is called his <hi>Beloved Son,</hi>
is likeſt him in <hi>Love:</hi> None loveth us ſo much as God
our Father, and his Beloved <hi>Son,</hi> who is alſo as God
Eſſential Love. And ſhall I think with cold or little
Love, of ſuch a God, and ſuch a Saviour? It is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
to fly from God or Chriſt, as fearing that he
wanteth Love, to a capable Soul, as to fly from the
Sun, as wanting <hi>heat</hi> or <hi>light.</hi> O what an unruly fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thing is the corrupted Soul of Man? When we
think of God's judgment, and how we are in his hands
as to all our hopes, for Soul &amp; Body, we fear and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable,
leſt he have not ſo much Love and Mercy, as
ſhould cauſe us confidently to truſt him: We could truſt
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59339:193"/>
ſome Friends with Life and Soul were we in their power:
but infinite love itſelf, and a loving Saviour we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
truſt; ſo far as to quiet us in Pain or Death: And
yet when Chriſt to cure this diſtruſt, hath manifeſted
his Love by the greateſt Miracles that ever God ſhewed
to mortal men, even by Chriſt's Incarnation, his Life,
his Works, his Death, Reſurrection, Interceſſion, and
the advancement of humane Nature in him above An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
the greatneſs of this Incomprehenſible Love, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioneth
the difficulty of our believing it; as if it were too
great and wonderful to be credible: Thus dark and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Sinners hardly believe our Fathers Love, whether it be
expreſt by ordinary, or by the moſt wonderful effects.</p>
               <p>§ 33. As Chriſt is called the <hi>Son of God,</hi> ſo alſo are
all his Members: We have ſo far the ſame title, that
we might partake of the ſame comforts: He is God's only
Son by Eternal Generation, and the hypoſtatical union
upon his miraculous conception: But through him we
are Sons by Regeneration and Adoption. And ſhall not
the love of ſuch a Father be truſted, and the preſence
and pleaſing of ſuch a Father be deſired? If <hi>Manoah</hi>'s
Wife could ſay, <hi>If he would have killed us Re would not
have accepted a Sacrifice of us;</hi> I may ſay, If he would have
damned me, or forſaken my departing Soul, he would not
have Adopted me, nor made and called me his Son Chriſt
was made his Incarnate Son, that we might be made his
Adopted Sons: And we are made his Adopted Sons, for
the ſake and by the Grace of Chriſt his Natural Son.</p>
               <p>§ 34. The Command [<hi>Hear him</hi>] is Relative as to
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> 1. Hear him whom the Law and
the Prophets typified and foretold, and were his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Preparatory Inſtructors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to lead us to him.
2. Hear him before <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, where his
Coming and Covenant abrogateth the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and as a greater Light he obſcureth the leſs: He hath
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59339:194"/>
revealed more than they revealed; and the ſame more
clearly: Life and Immortality is more fully brought to
light by him: His Goſpel is as the Heart of the Holy
Bible: We uſe the Old Teſtament Books eſpecially as
the Witneſſes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§ 35. And <hi>whom ſhould we hear</hi> ſo willingly, ſo
<hi>obediently</hi> as Chriſt? <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent not <hi>Dives</hi>'s Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to the King or to the High-prieſt to know what
Religion he ſhould chooſe, or what he ſhould do to
eſcape Hell torments: But it was <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets
that they muſt hear. But God from Heaven hath ſent
us yet a better Teacher, and commanded us to <hi>hear
Him: Moſes</hi> was faithful in God's Houſe as a Servant,
but Chriſt as a Son: His Authority is above Kings and
High-prieſts; and they have no Power now but from
him; and therefore none againſt him, or his Laws: All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
are null to Conſcience which contradict him: The
examples in <hi>Da.</hi> 3. &amp; 6. and of the Apoſtles tell us whether
God or Man ſhould be firſt obeyed. Therefore it is that
the Bible is more nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſary to be ſearcht and learned than
the Statute Book or Canons: Were Man to be heard
before Chriſt, or againſt him, or as neceſſarily as he,
why have we not Law <hi>Preachers</hi> every Lord's day to
expound the Statutes, and Canons to all the People?
And why are they not Catechized out of the Book of
Canons, or Law, as well as out of the Bible.</p>
               <p>And ſure if we muſt hear Chriſt and his Goſpel before
Prieſts or Princes, or before our deareſt friends, much
more before our fleſhly Luſts and Appetites, and before a
profane and fooliſh Scorner, and before the temptations
of the Devil. O had we heard Chriſt warning us, when we
hearkned to the Tempter, and to the Fleſh, how ſafely
had we lived, and how comfortably might we have died!</p>
               <p>§ 36. But this word [<hi>Hear him</hi>] is as <hi>comfortable
as obligatory.</hi> Hear him Sinner, when he calls thee to
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59339:194"/>
repent and turn to God, Hear him when he calleth
thee to himſelf, to take him for thy Lord and Saviour,
to believe and truſt him for Pardon and Salvation. Hear
him he when calleth, <hi>Come to me all ye that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and heavy laden: Ho, every, every one that thirſteth
come! whoever will, let him drink of the Water of Life
freely.</hi> Hear him when he commandeth, and hear
him when he promiſeth; and hear him before the
worldly wiſe when he teacheth us the way to God.
Hear him, for he knows what he ſaith: Hear him, for
he is true, and faithful, and infallible: Hear him, for he
is the Son of God, the greateſt Meſſenger that ever
God ſent! Hear him, for he purpoſly came down
into Fleſh, that he might familiarly teach us: Hear
him, for none elſe in the Word hath made known the
things of God like him, and none can do it. Hear
him, for he meaneth us no hurt: He is our deareſt
Friend, and Love itſelf, and ſaith nothing but for our
Salvation, and promiſeth nothing but what he will
perform. Yea, <hi>Hear him,</hi> for every Soul that will
not hear him ſhall be cut off.</p>
               <p>Hear him therefore, if he contradict thy fleſhly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite;
Hear him, if great or ſmall, if any or all ſhall
be againſt it. Hear him if he ſet thee on the hardeſt
work, or call thee to the greateſt ſuffering: Hear
him, if he bid thee take up the Croſs and forſake all and
follow him in hope of a reward in Heaven: Hear him
if he call thee to lay down thy Life; for none can be a
loſer by him.</p>
               <p>Hear him now in the Day of Grace, and he will hear
thee in the day of thy Extremity, in the day of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
Sickneſs, Death, and Judgment, when the World
forſaketh thee, and no ones hearing elſe can help thee.</p>
               <p>§ 37. But, <hi>I was not one that ſaw this Viſion: Had
I ſeen it my ſelf it would have ſatisfied me and confuted
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59339:195"/>
all my doubts. Anſw.</hi> But it is the will of God that the
Miniſtry and Teſtimony of Man, ſhall be a means of
our believing: It's <hi>Faith</hi> and not <hi>Sight</hi> that muſt be
the ordinary way of our Salvation. Elſe Chriſt muſt
have ſhewed himſelf and his Miracles, Reſurrection,
and Aſcenſion to every one in the World that muſt
believe in him: And then he muſt have been viſible at
once in every Kingdom, Pariſh, and Place on Earth,
and continued ſo to the end of the World; and muſt
have died, riſen and aſcended many Millions of times,
and in every place. They that will put ſuch Laws on
their Lawgiver before they will believe in him, muſt
be ſaved without him, and againſt him if they can.
This is more unreaſonable than to tell God that you
will not believe that there is a Heaven or Hell, unleſs
you ſee them. But God will have us live and be ſaved
by believing, and not by ſight. And he will uſe Man
for the Inſtruction and Salvation of Man, and not ſend
Angels with every Meſſage.</p>
               <p>§ 38. But, <hi>Why did Chriſt ſhew this Viſion but it
Three of his Diſciples? Anſw.</hi> He is not bound to tell us
why: But we may know that a ſight of heavenly
Glory is not to be ordinarily expected on Earth? Why
did God ſhew the back parts of his Glory to none but
<hi>Moſes,</hi> no not to his Brother <hi>Aaron?</hi> Why did he
ſpeak to him only in the Buſh and in the Mount?
Why did he tranſlate none to Heaven without dying
but <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias?</hi> Why did he ſave but <hi>Noah</hi> and
Seven with him in the Ark? Theſe are not things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
nor to be common to many.</p>
               <p>§ 39. But by this it appeareth that even among his
Twelve Apoſtles, Chriſt made a difference, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
ſome before the reſt: Though he ſet no one
over the reſt in any Governing Authority, yet ſome
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59339:195"/>
of them were qualified above the reſt, and eſteemed,
and uſed by him accordingly. <hi>Peter</hi> is called the firſt, and
it ſeems was qualified above the reſt, by his more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
ſpeaking and familiarity with Chriſt, and his
Speeches and Miracles after the Reſurrection. Though
yet the Faction that ſaid, I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> or I am of
<hi>Paul</hi> was rebuked as Carnal; ſo far was Chriſt from
directing the Churches to end all difference by obeying
<hi>Peter</hi> as their Supream Ruler. <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are
called the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Thunder:</hi> They had ſome more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
qualification than the reſt: So that <hi>James</hi> was the
firſt Martyred Apoſtle, and <hi>John</hi> the Diſciple whom
<hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpecially loved. Miniſters of the ſame Office,
and Order may much differ in Gifts and Grace, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and ſucceſs, and in God's acceptance and reward,
and in the Churches juſt eſteem and love. All Paſtors
were not ſuch as <hi>Cyprian, Baſil, Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene,
Chryſoſtome,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> And the reſt muſt
not envy at the preference of <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John.
Andrew</hi> ſeems to be <hi>Peters</hi> Elder Brother, and knew
Chriſt before him, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was Elder Brother to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi>
and yet muſt give God leave to chooſe to give
pre-eminence to whom he will.</p>
               <p>§ 40. But, <hi>Why did not theſe Three Apoſtles tell any
of this Viſion till after Chriſt's Reſurrection? Anſ.</hi> Chriſt
did forbid it them. And it was according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of his Revelation. He would make himſelf known to
the World by degrees; and more by his <hi>Works</hi> than by
bare <hi>Words:</hi> And theſe works were to be finiſhed, and all
ſet together to be his convincing Witneſs to the World.
And the chief of theſe were his <hi>Reſurrection, Aſcenſion,</hi>
and ſending down the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> The Apoſtles could
not ſay till then, [<hi>Jeſus is riſen, aſcended and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us the Seal of the Spirit: therefore he is the Son of God.</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:59339:196"/>
Chriſt firſt preached Repentance like <hi>John Baptiſt:</hi> And
next he told them that the Kingdom of God (by the
<hi>Meſſiah</hi>) was come and was among them. And then he
taught them to believe his Word to be ſent from God,
and to be true: And he taught them the Doctrines of
Holineſs, Love and Righteouſneſs towards men: And
he wrought thoſe Miracles which might convince them
that what he ſaid or ſhould ſay, deſerved their belief:
But yet before his Reſurrection his Apoſtles themſelves
underſtood not many of the Articles of our Creed; they
knew not that Chriſt was to die for ſin, and ſo to redeem
the World by his Sacrifice; nor that he was to Riſe, Aſcend,
and Reign, and Intercede in Glory. And yet they were
then in a ſtate of Grace and Life, ſuch as Believers were
in before Chriſt's Incarnation. (And ſure no more is
required of the Nations that cannot hear the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.)</p>
               <p>But the Reſurrection was the beginning of the proper
Goſpel State and Kingdom, to which all before was but
preparatory: &amp; then by the Spirit Chriſtianity was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to its ſetled Conſiſtence, and is a known unalterable
thing.</p>
               <p>And it is a great confirmation to our Faith, that
Chriſt's Kingdom was not ſettled by any advantage of
his perſonal Preſence, Preaching and Perſuaſion, ſo
much as by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in his Apoſtles and Diſciples,
when he was gone from them into Heaven.</p>
               <p>§ 41. <hi>But how are we ſure that theſe three men tell
us nothing but the Truth? Anſ.</hi> This is oft anſwered
elſewhere. The Spirit which they ſpake and work'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
by, was Chriſt's Witneſs and theirs. They healed the
Sick, raiſed the Dead, ſpake various Languages which
they never learnt; and Preached, and Recorded that
Holy Doctrin committed to them by Chriſt, which it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59339:196"/>
contained the evidence of its Divinity and of their
Truth: And Chriſt then and to this Day hath owned
it by the ſanctifying Efficacy of the ſame Spirit, upon
Millions of Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How Holy a Doctrin doth</hi> Peter <hi>himſelf deliver as
confirmed by this Apparition?</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 16, 17, 18.
We have not followed cunningly deviſed Fables, when
we made known to you the Power and Coming of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but were Eye Witneſſes of his Majeſty:
For he received from God the Father, Honour and Glory,
when there came ſuch a Voice to him from the excellent
Glory, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
And this Voice which came from Heaven we heard
when we were with him in the Holy Mount. <hi>The
words</hi> [In whom I am well pleaſed] <hi>are only here and
in</hi> Matthew: Mark <hi>and</hi> Luke <hi>omitting them, tell us
that the Evangeliſts undertook not to recite all that
was ſaid and done, but each one ſo much as ſeemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for him to ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 42. And now what remaineth, O my Soul, but
that thou take in the due Impreſſion of this Apparition,
of the Glory of Jeſus and his Saints; and that thou
joyfully obey this heavenly Voice, and <hi>Hear</hi> the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Son of God in whom the Father is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. As we that are Born in another Age and Land,
muſt know what Chriſt ſaid by the tranſmiſſion and
certain teſtimony of them that heard him, infallible Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
by Act, Word, and Record, being our way of
notice, as immediate ſenſation was theirs, ſo even the
glorious Apparition itſelf may be the mediation of their
infallible Record, be partly tranſmitted to our Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
An Incorporate Soul is ſo uſed to a mixed
way of knowing by imagined Idea's received by ſenſe,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:59339:197"/>
that it would fain have ſuch a ſort of knowledge of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
Souls and other Spirits, and of their glorious
ſtate and place and work, and is hardly fully ſatisfied
without it: Seeing Chriſt hath partly condeſcended to
this our culpable weakneſs, loſe not the help of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion.
Let this clear deſcription of the heavenly
ſight, make it to thee partly as if thou had been one of
the three Spectators: till thou canſt ſay, <hi>Methinks I
almoſt ſee the Face of Chriſt ſhine as the Sun, and his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whiter than the Snow; and</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias (<hi>no
doubt in ſome degree of glory) ſtanding with him: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I almoſt hear them diſcourſing of Chriſt's Death,
and Man's Redemption: And by this ſight I partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of the unſeen heavenly Company and State: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I ſee the Cloud receive them, when</hi> Peter <hi>had been
tranſported with the ſight: and I almoſt feel his pleaſant
raptures, and am ready to ſay as if I had been with him,
It is good for us to be hear: Methinks I almoſt hear the
heavenly Voice, This is my beloved Son, Hear him. And
ſhall I yet doubt of the Celeſtial Society and Glory? Had
I once ſeen that, what a ſenſe would it have left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Heart, of the difference between Earth, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Man and God, Fleſh and Spirit, Sin and Duty?
how thankfully ſhould I have thought of the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi>
and <hi>Sanctification?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And why may I not accordingly put my ſelf as into the
caſe of them, who ſaw all Chriſt's Miracles and ſaw him
<hi>riſen and aſcend towards Heaven?</hi> Or at leaſt of all
thoſe ordinary Chriſtians who ſaw all the wonders
done by the Reporters of theſe things? I can
eaſily receive a pleaſing Idea of ſome forreign happy
Countrey, which a Traveller deſcribeth to me, though
I never ſaw it; and my Reaſon can partly gather
what great things are, if I ſee but leſſer of the ſame
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59339:197"/>
kind, or ſomewhat like them. A Candle ſheweth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
by which we may conceive of the greateſt flame.
Even Grace and Gracious actions do ſomewhat notifie to
us the ſtate of Glory: But the ſight on the Mount did
more ſenſibly notifie it.</p>
               <p>Think not then that heavenly contemplation is an
impoſſible thing, or a meer dream, as if it had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
ſubject matter to work upon; the viſible things
of Earth are the Shaddows, the Cobwebs, the Bubbles, the
Shews, Mummerries, and Maſques: and it is loving them
and rejoicing and truſting in them, that is the dream
and dotage. Our heavenly Thoughts, and Hopes; and
Buſineſs are more in compariſon of theſe, than the Sun
is to a glow-Worm, or the World to a Mole-hill, or
Governing an Empire to the motions of a Fly. And
can I make ſomwhat, yea, too much of theſe almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things;
and yet ſhall I make almoſt nothing of the
active, glorious unſeen World; and doubt, and grope
in my Meditations of it, as if I had no ſubſtance to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend?
If inviſibility to Mortals were a cauſe of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or of unaffecting, unſatisfying Thoughts, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
who is All to Men and Angels, would be as no God to
us, and Heaven as no Heaven; and Chriſt as no Chriſt, and
our Souls which are our ſelves would ſeem as nothing to
themſelves; and all men would be as no men to us, and
we ſhould converſe only with Carkaſſes and Cloaths.</p>
               <p>Lord ſhine into this Soul with ſuch an heavenly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
quickening Light, as may give me more lively
and powerful conceptions of that which is all my hope
and life. Leave me not to the exerciſe of Art alone,
in barren notions; but make it as Natural to me to
love Thee and breath after Thee: Thou teacheſt the
young ones both of men and bruits, to ſeek to the Dam
for food and ſhelter: And though Grace be not a

that holy Senſe and Appetite, which the Divine and
Heavenly <hi>Nature</hi> doth contain. Let me not lay more
ſtreſs and truſt upon my own Sight and Senſe, than on
the Sight and Fidelity of my God and my Redeemer. I am
not ſo fooliſh as to live as if this Earth were no bigger
than the little of it which I ſee: Let me not be ſo much
more fooliſh as to think of the vaſt and glorious
Regions, and the Bleſſed Inhabitants thereof, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles
of juſtified Souls, as if they wanted either
ſubſtantiality or certainty, to exerciſe a heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
here, and to feaſt believing Souls with joy,
and draw forth well grounded and earneſt deſire, to
depart and be with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§ 43. II. <hi>Hear</hi> then, and <hi>Hear</hi> with <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi>
the tydings and promiſes of him, whom the Voice from
Heaven commanded Man to hear. He is the glorified
Lord of Heaven and Earth! All is in his power. He
hath told us nothing but what he knew, and promiſed
nothing but what he is <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to give. Two
ſorts of things he hath required us to Truſt him for:
Things notified by expreſs particular Promiſes
and things only generally promiſed and known to us.</p>
               <p>1. We may know particularly that he will receive
our departing Souls, and juſtifie them in judgment, and
raiſe the Dead, and all the reſt particularly promiſed. And
we know in general that we have a heavenly City and
Inheritance, and ſhall ſee God and be with Chriſt in
everlaſting Happineſs, Loving and Praiſing God with
Joy in the perfected glorious Church of Chriſt. All
this therefore we muſt explicitely believe. But it's lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
that we know diſtinctly of the <hi>conſiſtence</hi> and <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:59339:199"/>
of Spirits and ſeparated Souls as to a <hi>formal</hi> or
<hi>modal</hi> conception; a great deal about the place, ſtate
and mode, their acting and fruition is dark to us; but
none of it is dark to Chriſt: Here therefore an implicite
Truſt ſhould not only bound and ſtop our ſelfiſh and
over bold enquiries, but alſo quiet and comfort the
Soul, as well as if our ſelves knew all.</p>
               <p>O my Soul, abhor and mortifie thy ſelfiſh Truſt, and
unbelieving thirſt to have that <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and
<hi>Evil</hi> thy ſelf, which is the Prerogative of thy Lord and
Saviour. This was the ſin that firſt defiled humane
Nature, and brought calamity on the World. God hath
ſet thee enough to learn: know that and thou knoweſt
enough. If more were poſſible, it would be a perplexity
and a ſnare, and he that encreaſeth ſuch knowledge,
would encreaſe ſorrow: But when it is both unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and impoſſible, what a ſin and folly is it, to waſt
our time, and tire and deceive our Minds, in long and
troubleſom ſearches after it; and then diſquietly to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
at God, and the Holy Scripture, and die with ſad
diſtruſtful fears, becauſe we attain it not: When all this
while we ſhould have underſtood, that this part of
knowledg belongs to Chriſt and the heavenly Society,
and not to ſinful Mortals here; and that we have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it as much as may cauſe us to live and die in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Safety, Peace and Joy, if we can but Truſt him
who knoweth for us. Chriſt perfectly knoweth what
Spirits are, and how they act, and whether they have
any corporeal Organ, or Vehicle, or none: and what's
the difference between <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and thoſe that
left their Bodies here; and what a Reſurrection will
add to Souls, and how it will be wrought, and when;
and what is meant by the Thouſand year previous
Reign; and who they be that ſhall dwell in the New
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59339:200"/>
Earth, and how it will be renewed! All the dark paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of Scripture and Providence he can perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve:
He knoweth why God leaveth the far greateſt
part of the World in Satan's ſlavery, darkneſs and
wickedneſs, and chooſeth ſo few to real Holineſs: And
why he maketh not men ſuch as he commandeth them
to be; and why he leaveth ſerious Chriſtians to ſo
much weakneſs, error, ſcandal and diviſion. Theſe
and all other difficulties are fully known to Chriſt.
And it is not the Child, but the Father, that muſt know
what food and cloathing he ſhould have, and the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
that muſt know what are the ingredients of his
Medicines, and why.</p>
               <p>Lord open my Eyes then, to ſee what thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed;
and help me willingly to ſhut them to the reſt;
and to believe and truſt in Thee for both: Not to
ſtagger at thy ſealed Promiſes, nor ſelfiſhly to deſire
particular knowledge, which belongs not to me, as if
I could truſt my ſelf, and my own knowledge, and not
Thine. Lord teach me to follow Thee, even in the
dark as quietly, and confidently, as in the Light, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the general Light of thy Promiſe of Felicity.) I
knew not the Myſtery of thy Conception, Incarnation,
or the way of the workings of thy Spirit on Souls. No
wonder if much of the Reſurrection and unſeen World
be above my reach; much more that thy Infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is Incomprehenſible to me: How little do the
Bruits that ſee me know of my thoughts or me. I have
no adequate knowledge of any one thing in the World,
but ſomewhat of it is unknown. O bleſſed be that Love
and Grace that hath given me a glorified Head in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to know all for me which I know not: Hear and
Truſt Him living and departing. O my Soul! who
hath told thee that <hi>we ſhall be with him where he is,</hi> and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59339:200"/>
ſhall behold his Glory, and that a Crown of Salvation
is laid up for us, and we ſhall Reign with him, when
we have conquered and ſuffered with him, and hath
bid us live in joyful Hope of our exceeding eternal hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Reward, and at our Death to commend our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
into his hand: Receive us Lord according to thy
Promiſes, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>EXperience of the want of this Effuſion of God's
Love, and ſome ſmall taſt of its Sweetneſs, make
me think the thoughts of this very ſuitable to
one expecting Death.</p>
            <p>The words contain a golden Chain of higheſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
on all true Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>I. They are ſuppoſed to <hi>have Faith;</hi> that is both a
general Truſt to God's Revelations and Grace, and a
ſpecial Truſt in Jeſus Chriſt, as given by the Father's
Love to be the Redeemer, to Juſtifie, Sanctifie and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
his People: I have oft proved this juſtifying Faith
to be no leſs then our unfeigned taking Chriſt for our
Saviour, and becoming true Chriſtians, according to
the Tenor of the Baptiſmal Covenant: As to the Acts,
it is formally Truſt: One in three: The Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59339:201"/>
Aſſenting Truſt; the Wills conſenting Truſt;
and the executive Powers Practical, Venturing, Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Truſt.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>All true Believers are juſtified:</hi> Even all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the Baptiſmal Covenant, and chooſe God to be
their God, and Chriſt to be their Saviour, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt to be their Sanctifier, and give up themſelves
to him by true reſolution, as their only Ruler, Hope
and Happineſs; though this be done with ſo great
weakneſs, as endeth not all doubts, nor quieteth the Mind.</p>
            <p>To be juſtified is not to be accounted ſuch as <hi>have
no ſin,</hi> but, 1. To be <hi>made ſuch by</hi> Pardon through
Chriſt's Merits, and by true Faith, as <hi>God will take by
ſpecial love and favour unto life.</hi> 2. To be <hi>accounted
ſuch by God.</hi> 3. To be <hi>virtually Sentenced</hi> ſuch by
the Law of Grace and Faith, and to be juſt in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

4. At laſt we ſhall be <hi>judged ſuch</hi> by publick
Sentence. 5. And be <hi>uſed as ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not juſtified by the Law of <hi>Innocency</hi> or of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
but by <hi>Chriſt's Law of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not juſtified <hi>perfectly</hi> till the time of Perfection:
Much puniſhment on Soul and Body, is yet to be taken
off: And more ſins daily to be pardoned; and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the World to be ſentenced as juſt to life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>The juſtified have Peace with God.</hi> They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
and in a ſtate of love and friendſhip. It ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
<hi>mutual Peace;</hi> but with great <hi>inequality: God's
Love</hi> and favour to us is the <hi>ſtable, conſtant part: Our
conſent</hi> alſo and <hi>acceptance</hi> of his terms of Peace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in its <hi>truth:</hi> But our <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>God's Love,</hi> which is the
Peace poſſeſſed by the Soul, is weak and unconſtant, and
too oft quite loſt or obſcured by ignorance, miſtake, and

               </gap>r: But it muſt be known that this is a diſcaſed ſtate,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59339:202"/>
unnatural to the Believer as ſuch; as it's unnatural for a
Woman married to a faithful Husband to lie in terrour,
thinking that he will kill her, or doth not love her,
or for a Child to think the ſame of a loving Father.
Faith of its own nature tendeth to the Souls Peace and
Joy, in the ſenſe of God's love. And how is Chriſt
offered to us but as a Saviour to bring us by Grace to
Glory? And he that <hi>accepteth him</hi> as ſuch (whereby he is
juſtified) doth ſure believe that he is offered as ſuch: For
none can <hi>accept</hi> what he thinks not to be offered: And this
implieth ſome <hi>hope</hi> at leaſt, that Chriſt will be ſuch to
us: And did Faith work ſtrongly and kindly, its effect
would be a conſtant joyful ſtate of Soul, as pleaſant
Health and Mirth is to our Natures. All our diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
fears, and griefs, and diſquietments of Soul, are for
want of more Faith, as Sickneſs, and Pain is for want
of the Vital cauſes of Health.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>This Peace with God is only</hi> [<hi>through our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>] Though it be a vain dream to think by
<hi>juſtifying Faith,</hi> is meant <hi>Chriſt only,</hi> and not <hi>Faith:</hi> Yet it
is <hi>no other Faith,</hi> but the foreſaid Believing Truſt on
Chriſt: Therefore as <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>our part,</hi> ſo it ſuppoſeth
Chriſt and all the works of his Office (and Righteouſneſs)
on his part as its Object. Chriſt is the purchaſing cauſe:
But our Truſt and Acceptance is that which is pleaſing
to God, and choſen by him to be <hi>our part,</hi> without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
or keeping the Jewiſh Law.</p>
            <p>Since Man once ſinned, God's Juſtice and Man's
Conſcience tell us that we are unfit for God's acceptance
or communion immediately, but muſt have a ſuitable
Mediator. O bleſſed be God <hi>for this</hi> ſuitable Mediator.
Without him I dare not pray, I cannot hope, I dare not
die; God would elſe frown me away to miſery. All
the hope of Pardon and Salva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion that I have; all the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:59339:202"/>
acceſs to God, and the Mercies and Deliverances that I
have received, have been by this Author and Finiſher
of our Faith: Into his conducting hands I give my Soul,
and into his preſerving hands both Soul and Body, and
into his receiving hands I commend my departing Soul.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>v.</hi> 2. [<hi>By whom we have acceſs by Faith unto
this Grace wherein we ſtand;</hi>] That is, into this ſtate
of bleſſed Chriſtianity, Peace with God, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Bleſſings. As it is by Marriage that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
hath right to her Husbands Eſtate and Honours;
and by Inheritance that a Child comes to his Father's
maintenance and Land: This is no diminution to God's
Love. To ſay, It is all <hi>by Chriſt</hi> is not to take it as ever the
leſs from God the Father; it is more to give us Chriſt and
Life in him, than to have given us life without a Chriſt.

1. The beatifical Object: <hi>The Glory of God.</hi> 2. The
beatifical Act, [<hi>Rejoice,</hi>] 3. The mediate cauſing Act,
[<hi>Hope:</hi>] all preſuppoſing <hi>Faith</hi> and Juſtification.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Glory of God,</hi> is that <hi>glorious</hi> appearance of
God to Man (and <hi>Angels</hi>) which maketh happy.
1. The mind by beholding it. 2. The will by loving
it, and receiving the communications of Love. 3. The
executive powers by <hi>joyful</hi> praiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Though ſome foretaſts are here, it is yet ſaid to be
<hi>hoped</hi> for; and we <hi>hope</hi> for that which is <hi>not ſeen.</hi>
When <hi>Faith</hi> is ſaid to be that which we are juſtified or
ſaved by, it includeth <hi>hope,</hi> though more preciſely taken
they are diſtinct. <hi>We are ſaved by hope.</hi> The ſame
word is oft tranſlated [<hi>Truſt</hi>] and [<hi>Hope.</hi>] And Faith
is [<hi>Truſt:</hi>] to Truſt Chriſt for Salvation, includeth
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59339:203"/>
               <hi>hoping</hi> that he will ſave us. But <hi>Hope</hi> is denominated
from the <hi>Good hoped</hi> for, and <hi>Faith</hi> from the <hi>Cauſe</hi>
by which we hope to obtain it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hope</hi> doth not neceſſarily imply either <hi>certainty</hi> or
<hi>uncertainty:</hi> It may ſtand with both in various degrees.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Rejoicing</hi> is made by God the very naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
ſtate of the Soul: It is when natural the pleaſant
efflorence of the Spirits, or their ſtate of Health.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>Pleaſure</hi> that is the <hi>Spring</hi> or <hi>Poiſe</hi> of all motion
ſenſitive in the World: <hi>Trahit ſua quem<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> volisptas.
Appetite or Will</hi> is the <hi>Active Principle,</hi> and <hi>congrucus
Good,</hi> or <hi>delectable,</hi> is the <hi>Object.</hi> The World is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
by the ſeduction of falſe deceitful Pleaſure, and
men are bleſſed only in true and durable pleaſure. And
though we that made not our ſelves, are not ſo made
for our ſelves, as that our <hi>Pleaſure</hi> or Felicity in God,
ſhould be ſo high in our deſire, as God himſelf, who is
the ultimate Object of our Love; yet ſeeing ſuch an
Object he is, and the Love of him (and received
from him) is our Felicity, theſe are never to be ſeparated.</p>
            <p>What have I to rejoice in, if this <hi>hoped Glory,</hi> be
not my joy? All things elſe are dying to me. And
God himſelf is not my Felicity, as he afflicts me, nor
as he giveth me the tranſitory gifts of Nature, but as
he is to be ſeen in Glory. If this be not my joy, it's
all but vanity. What then ſhould all my thoughts
and labour aim at more (as to my ſelf) than to <hi>hope for,</hi>
and <hi>foretast</hi> this Glory. No ſin lieth heavier on
me, than that my hopes of Glory raiſe me to no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
joy, and that the great weakneſs of my Faith, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by ſuch dull thoughts of Glory, or by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
fears. Sure there is enough in the Glory of
God, ſoundly believed and hoped for, to make a Man
rejoice in pain and weakneſs, and to make him long to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59339:203"/>
be with Chriſt. I live not according to the Nature of
Chriſtianity, if I live not as in peace with God, and
in the joyful hopes of promiſed Glory.</p>
            <p>VII. [<hi>Not only ſo, but we glory in Tribulation.</hi>]
Glory is ſo Tranſcendent, and Tribulation ſo ſmall and
ſhort, that an expectant of Glory may well rejoice in
bodily ſufferings. It is Tribulation for Chriſt and
Righteouſneſs ſake, that we are ſaid to Glory in: The
reſt for our ſins, it's well if we can improve and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bear. Yet <hi>in them</hi> we may rejoice, in hope of
Glory, though we glory not of them. O if all the
painful languid Daies, and Nights, and Years that I
have had, as the fruit of my ſin, had been ſufferings
for that which I am now hated and hunted for, even for
preaching Chriſt when men forbid me, how joyfully
might I undergo it: But yet even here, approaching Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſhould be my joy. Alas, my groans and moans are too
great, and my joy too little.</p>
            <p>VIII. [<hi>Knowing that Tribulation worketh Patience.</hi>]
That which worketh <hi>Patience</hi> is matter of Joy: For
<hi>Patience</hi> doth us more good than Tribulation can do
hurt; Why then do I groan ſo much under ſuffering,
and ſo little ſtudy and exerciſe Patience, and no more
rejoice in the exerciſe thereof?</p>
            <p>IX. [<hi>And Patience, Experience.</hi>] It is manifold and
profitable Experience, which patient ſuffering brings.
It giveth us experience, as of Natures weakneſs, and
the great need of Faith: So of the Truth of God's
Promiſes, the love and tenderneſs of Chriſt, the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of our Prayers; and the power of the Spirits aid
and grace. O what abundance of experiences of God and
our ſelves, and the vanity of Creatures had we
wanted, if we had not waited in a ſuffering ſtate: Alas,
how many Experiences have I forgotten!</p>
            <p>X. [<hi>And Experience, Hope.</hi>] A bare Promiſe ſhould
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59339:204"/>
give us Hope: But we are ſtill diſtruſtful of our ſelves
and of all the cleareſt Evidences, till experience help us,
and ſet all Home. O what an advantage hath a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
of great and long experience for his <hi>hope</hi> and joy!
And yet when notable experiences of God's Providence
are paſt and gone, an unbelieving Heart is ready to
queſtion whether the things came not by meer natural
courſe; and like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs,
dangers and fears bear down even long and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences:
This is my ſin.</p>
            <p>XI. [<hi>And Hope maketh not aſhamed.</hi>] That is,
true Hope of what God hath promiſed ſhall never be
diſappointed. They that truſt on deceitful Creatures
are deceived, and aſhamed of their Hope: For all men
are Lyars, that is, untruſty; but God is true, and
ever faithful: O what a comfort is it that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
me to truſt him? Sure ſuch a command is a
virtual Promiſe, from him that cannot fail that truſt,
which he commandeth. Lord help me to truſt thee in
greateſt dangers, and there to reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XII.</hi> [Becauſe the Love of God is ſhed abroad upon our
Hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt which is given to us.]</p>
            <p>It is the Love of God ſhed abroad on our Hearts by
the Holy Ghoſt, which muſt make us rejoice in hope of
the Glory of God, even in Tribulation.</p>
            <p>Here I muſt conſider, I. What is meant by the Love
of God. II. Why, and how it is ſhed abroad on the
Heart by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>I. By the <hi>Love of God</hi> is meant the <hi>Effects of his
Love;</hi> 1. His ſpecial Grace: 2. The pleaſant guſt or
ſenſe of it.</p>
            <p>II. God's Love thus ſhed on the Heart, pre-ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it expreſt in the Goſpel, and Providence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
all theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:59339:204"/>
1. The ſanctifying of the Soul by renewing Grace.
This is the giving of the Spirit, as he is given all true
Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>2. Herein the Holy Ghoſt makes us perceive the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
deſirableneſs of the Love of God, and maketh
us moſt deſire it.</p>
            <p>3. He giveth the Soul ſome eaſing Hope of the Love
of God.</p>
            <p>4. He quieteth the doubts, and fears, and troubles
of the Soul.</p>
            <p>5. He raiſeth our Hopes by degrees to confident aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</p>
            <p>6. Then the thoughts of God's love are pleaſant to
the Soul, and give it ſuch delight as we feel in the love
and fruition of our moſt valued and beloved friends.</p>
            <p>7. The Soul in this ſtate is as <hi>unapt</hi> to be jealous of
God or to queſtion his Love, as a good Child or Wife
to queſtion the Love of a Parent or Husband, or to
hear any that ſpeak evil of them.</p>
            <p>8. This then becomes the habitual ſtate of the Soul,
in all changes to live in the delightful ſenſe of the love
of God, as we do live in pleaſure with our deareſt
Friends.</p>
            <p>O bleſſed ſtate, and firſt fruits of Heaven! and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are they that do attain it! And though lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
have their degree of happineſs, yet how far ſhort
are ſuch, in goodneſs, amiableneſs and comfort, of
thoſe that are thus rich in grace.</p>
            <p>This preſuppoſeth; 1. Knowledge of God and the
Goſpel. 2. True belief and hope. 3. A ſincere and
fruitful life. 4. Mortification as to Idol, worldly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
5. A conviction of our ſincerity in all this. 6. A
concluſion that God doth love us.</p>
            <p>But yet it is ſomewhat above all this. A Man may
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:59339:205"/>
have all this in his Mind and Mouth, and yet want this
guſt of effuſed Love upon his Heart. Theſe are the
way to it, but not itſelf.</p>
            <p>This is the greateſt good on this ſide Heaven: to
which all Wealth and Honour, all fleſhly Pleaſure and
long Life, all Learning and Knowledge, are unworthy
to be once compared: Briefly,</p>
            <p>1. It is the flower and higheſt part of God's Image
on Man.</p>
            <p>2. It is the Souls true communion with God, and
fruition of him, which carnal men deride. Even as our
Eye hath communion with the Sun, and the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Earth enjoys its reviving heats.</p>
            <p>3. It is that which all lower grace doth tend to, as
Childhood doth to Manhood: And what is a world of
Infants comparatively good for?</p>
            <p>4. It is that which moſt properly anſwereth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Redemption and the wonders of God's love
therein: And all the tenor of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>5. It is that which is moſt fully called, <hi>The Spirit of
God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> in us: He hath lower works, but this
is his great work by which he poſſeſſeth us as God's
moſt pleaſant Habitation: For we have not received
the Spirit of Bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of
Power and Love, and a ſound mind, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p>6. It is only that which all men in general deſire I
mean, the only ſatisfying content and pleaſure that Man
is capable of on Earth! All men would have quieting
and conſtant Pleaſure; and it is to be found in nothing
elſe, but the effuſed love of God.</p>
            <p>7. It is that which will make every burden light;
and all affliction eaſy: When the ſenſe of God's love is
ſtill upon the Soul, all pain and croſſes will be but as
Blood-letting by the kindeſt Phyſician, to ſave the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59339:205"/>
life. God will not be ſuſpected or grudged at in
ſuffering; his love will ſweeten all.</p>
            <p>8. It will overcome abundance of Temptations,
which no mens Wit, or Learning, or knowledge of
the words of Scripture, will overcome. No Arguments
will draw a loving Child or Wife, from the Parents or
Husband that they know doth love them. Love is the
moſt powerful Diſputant.</p>
            <p>9. It puts a mellow pleaſant ſweetneſs into all our
duties: When we hear the Word, or receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
it is to ſuch a Soul as pleaſant Food to the moſt
healthful Man: When we pray or praiſe God, it comes
from a comforted Heart and excites and increaſeth the
comfort it comes from. O who can be backward to draw
near to God in Prayer or Meditation, who taſteth the
ſweetneſs of his Love. This is Religion indeed, and
tells us what its life, and uſe, and glory is: This is
the true walking with God in the beſt degree: When
the Soul liveth in the taſte of his Love, the Heart will
be ſtill with him, and that will be its Pleaſure: And God
moſt delights in ſuch a Soul.</p>
            <p>10. This is it that putteth the ſweeteſt reliſh on all
our Mercies: Deny God's love, and you deny them
all. If you taſt not his love in them, you taſte little
more than a Beaſt may taſte: Poor Food and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is ſweet with the ſenſe of the Love of God. Had
I more of this, I ſhould lie down, and riſe, and walk in
Pleaſure and content: I could bear the loſs of other
things: And though Nature will feel pains, I ſhould
have Pleaſure and Peace in the midſt of all my pains,
and groans. This is the white Stone, the New Name:
No Man well knoweth it who never felt it in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>1. There is no dying comfortably without this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59339:206"/>
taſte of the Love of God. This will draw
up the deſires of the Soul: Love taſted, caſteth out
fear; though God be Holy and Juſt, and Judgment
terrible, and Hell intollerable, and the Soul hath no
diſtinct Idea of its future ſtate out of the Body, and
though we ſee not whither it is that we muſt go, the
taſte of God's love will make it go joyfully, as truſting
him; as a Child will go any whither in his Father's
power and hand.</p>
            <p>But all the knowledge in the World without this,
quiets not a departing Soul. A Man may write as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Books, and Preach as many Sermons of Heaven as I
have done, and ſpeak of it, and think of almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, and yet till the Soul be ſweetned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
with the Love of God ſhed abroad on it by the
Holy Ghoſt, death and the next life will be rather a Man's
fear, than his deſire. And the common fear of death which
we ſee in the far greateſt part even of godly Perſons, doth
tell us, that though they may have ſaving deſires, and
hopes, yet this ſenſe of God's love on the Heart is rare.</p>
            <p>What wonder then if our Language, our Converſe,
our Prayers, have too little ſavour of it, and in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of joyful Believers duties, be but like green Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to the mellow ones.</p>
            <p>My God, I feel what it is that I want, and I perceive
what it is that is moſt deſirable: O let not guilt be ſo
far unpardoned, as to deprive my Soul of this greateſt
good, which thou haſt commended to me and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and which in my languiſhing and pains I ſo much
need. Did I beg for Wealth or Honour, I might have it to
the loſs of others: But thy Love will make me more uſeful
to all, and none will have the leſs for my enjoyment: For
thou Lord art enough for all; Even as none hath the leſs
of the Sun-light for my enjoying it. The leaſt well
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:59339:206"/>
grounded hope of thy Love is better than all the
pleaſures of the Fleſh: But without ſome pleaſant ſenſe
of it, alas, what a withered languiſhing thing is a Soul;
thy loving kindneſs is better than life; but if I taſte it
not, how ſhall I here rejoice in God, or bear my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
burdens?</p>
            <p>O let me not be a diſhonour to thy Family, where all
have ſo great cauſe to honour thy bounty by their joy,
and hopes: Nor by a ſad and fearful Heart, tempt men
to think that thy love is not real and ſatisfactory; I can
eaſily believe and admire thy <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> and thy <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi>
Let it not be ſo hard to me to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>taſte</hi>
thy <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and thy <hi>Love:</hi> Which is as neceſſary to
me.</p>
            <p>If there be any thing (as ſurely there is) in which
the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Adoption</hi> conſiſteth, as
above all the <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Notions</hi> of Religion, which are
but like to other acquired Knowledge, ſure it muſt be
this holy Appetite and Habitual Inclination of the Soul
to God by way of Love, which is bred by an internal
ſenſe of his Lovelineſs, and Loving inclination to Man:
which differenceth a Chriſtian from other men, as a
Child differs towards his Father, from Strangers or
from common Neigbours. Till the love of God be the
very ſtate or nature of the Soul, (working here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Honour, Intereſts, Word, and Servants) no
Man can ſay that he is God's habitation by the Spirit:
And how the Heart will ever be thus habited, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
believing God's Love to us, it's hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p>Experience tells the World how ſtrongly it conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Perſons to love one another, if they do but think
that they are ſtrongly beloved by one another. In the
love that tends to marriage, if one that is inferior do
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59339:207"/>
but know that a Perſon of far greater worth doth
fervently love them, it almoſt puts a neceſſity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
on them for returns of Love: Nature can ſcarce
chooſe but love in ſuch a caſe. Love is the Loadſtone of
Love. A real taſte of the Love of God in ſaving Souls
by Chriſt and grace, is it that conſtraineth them to be
holy; that is, to be devoted to that God in Love.</p>
            <p>III. But this muſt as neceſſarily be the work of the
Holy Ghoſt, and can be no more done without him,
than the Earth can be illuminated, and the Vegetables
live without the Sun. But all the approaches of the
Holy Spirit ſuffice not to produce this great effect, and
give us the Divine holy Nature.</p>
            <p>The ſame Sun ſhine hath three different effects on
its Objects.</p>
            <p>1. On moſt things (as Houſes, Stones, Earth,) it
cauſeth nothing but the Accidents of Heat, Colour, and
Motion.</p>
            <p>2. On ſome things it cauſeth a <hi>ſeminal Diſpoſition</hi> to
Vegetable life, but not Life itſelf.</p>
            <p>3. In this <hi>diſpoſed</hi> matter it cauſeth Vegetable life
itſelf.</p>
            <p>So doth the Spirit of God, 1. Operate on Millions
but lifeleſs <hi>Accidents,</hi> as <hi>the</hi> Sun on a ſtone Wall. 2. On
others <hi>Diſpoſe</hi> and prepare them to <hi>Divine Life.</hi> 3. On
others (<hi>ſo diſpoſed</hi>) it effecteth the Divine life itſelf:
When holy Love is turned into a habit like to Nature.</p>
            <p>That none but the Holy Ghoſt doth make this holy
change, is evident: For, the effect cannot tranſcend
the cauſes; 1. Nature alone is dark, and knoweth not
the attractive amiableneſs of God, till illuminated;
nor can give us a ſatiſfactory notice of God's ſpecial
Love to us.</p>
            <p>2. Nature is Guilty; and Guilt breedeth fears of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:59339:207"/>
Juſtice; and fear makes us wild and fly from God, leſt
he will hurt us.</p>
            <p>3. Nature is under penal ſufferings already; and
feeleth pain, fear, and many hurts, and foreſeeth
Death: And under this is undiſpoſed of itſelf, to feel
the pleaſure of God's Love.</p>
            <p>4. Nature is corrupted and diverted to Creature va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and its Appetite goeth another way, and cannot
cure itſelf, and make itſelf ſuitable to the amiableneſs of
God.</p>
            <p>5. God hateth wickedneſs and wicked men; and
meer Nature cannot ſecure us that we are ſaved from
that enmity.</p>
            <p>Diligence may do much to get religious Knowledge,
and Words, and all that which I call the <hi>Art</hi> of
Religion: And God may bleſs this as a preparation to
holy Life and Love: But till the Souls Appetite incline
with deſire to God and Holineſs, Divine things will
not ſweetly reliſh.</p>
            <p>And this is a great comfort to the Thoughts of the
Sanctified, that certainly their holy <hi>Appetite, Deſire,</hi> and
<hi>Complacency</hi> is the work of the Holy Ghoſt. For,
1. This ſecureth them of the Love of God, of which
it is the proper token.</p>
            <p>2. And it aſſureth them of their Union with Chriſt,
when they live becauſe he liveth, even by the Spirit,
which is his Seal and Pledge. 3. And it proveth both
a future life, and their title to it: For God maketh not
all this preparation for it by his Spirit, in vain.</p>
            <p>But, alas, if it were not a work that hath great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
it would not be ſo rare in the World: What
is it in us that keepeth the Sun of Love from ſo ſhining
on us, as to revive our Souls into Holy contentments
and delight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:59339:208"/>
It muſt be ſuppoſed, 1. That all God's gifts are
free, and that he giveth not to all alike: The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
variety of Creatures proveth this. 2. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of his differencing works are his own will, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
reaſons are moſtly unknown to us, of which he
is not bound to give us an account.</p>
            <p>3. But yet we ſee that God doth his works in a
cauſal order, and one work prepareth for another; and
he maketh variety of capacities, which occaſion variety
of receptions and of gifts; and he uſeth to give every
thing that, to which he hath brought it into the next
capacity and diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>And therefore in general we may conclude that we
feel not God's Love ſhed abroad upon the Heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Heart is undiſpoſed, and is not in the next
diſpoſition thereto: And abuſed free will hath been the
cauſe of that. That we <hi>have Grace</hi> is to be aſcribed
to God: That we are without it is to be aſcribed to
our ſelves.</p>
            <p>1. Heinous guilt of former ſin may keep a Soul
much without the delights of Divine love: And the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs
is not only in the greatneſs of the evil done
materially, but oft in our long and willful committing
of ſmaller ſins againſt Knowledge and Conſcience, and
conſideration. The Spirit thus grieved by hardened
Hearts, and willful repulſes, is not quickly and eaſily
a comforter to ſuch a Soul; and when the ſinner doth
repent, it leaveth him more in uncertainty of his ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when he thinks, <hi>I do but repent, purpoſe and promiſe
now; and ſo I oft did, and yet returned the next temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to my ſin: And how can I tell that my Heart is not
the fame, and I ſhould ſin again if I had the ſame temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
O what doubts and perplexities doth oft will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſinning prepare for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:59339:208"/>
2. And ſins of omiſſion have here a great part: The
ſweetneſs of God's Love is a reward which ſloathful
Servants are unmeet for. It follows a [<hi>Well done good and
faithful Servant:</hi>] There is needful a cloſe attendance
upon God, and devotedneſs to him, and improvement of
Goſpel Grace and Revelation, to make a Soul fit for
amicable ſweet communion with God: All that will
ſave a Soul from Hell will not do this.</p>
            <p>He that will taſte theſe Divine Love-tokens muſt,
1. Be no ſtranger to holy Meditation and Prayer, nor
unconſtant, cold and curſory in them; but muſt dwell
and walk above with God. 2. And he muſt be wholly
addicted to improve his Maſters Talents in the World,
and make it his deſign and trade on Earth to do all the
good in the World he can. And to keep his Soul clean
from the fleſh and worldly vanity: And to ſuch a Soul
God will make known his Love.</p>
            <p>3. And, alas, how ordinarily doth ſome carnal a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
corrupt the appetite of the Soul? When we
grow too much in love with mens eſteem, or with
earthly Riches, or when our Throats or Phantaſies can
maſter us into obedience or vain deſires of Meat,
Drink, Recreation, Dwelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Soul loſeth
its Appetite to things Divine; and nothing reliſheth
where Appetite is gone or ſick: We cannot ſerve
God and Mammon, and we cannot at once taſte
much pleaſure both in God and Mammon. The old
auſtere Chriſtians found the mortification of the fleſhly
Luſts, a great advantage to the Souls delight in
God.</p>
            <p>4. And many errours about God's nature and
works much hinder us from feaſting on his Love.</p>
            <p>5. And eſpecially the ſlight, and ignorant thoughts
of Chriſt, and the wondrous workings of God's
Love in him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:59339:209"/>
6. And ſpecially if our belief itſelf once ſhake, or be
not well and firmly founded.</p>
            <p>7. And our ſlight thoughts of the Office and Work
of the Holy Ghoſt on Souls, and our neceſſity of it, and
our not begging and waiting for the Spirits ſpecial help.</p>
            <p>8. And laſtly, our unfaithful forgetfulneſs of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
experiences and teſtimonies of his Love, which
ſhould ſtill be as freſh before us.</p>
            <p>Alas, my Soul, thou feeleſt thy defect, and knoweſt
the hinderance, but what hope is there of remedy?
Will God ever raiſe ſo low, ſo dull, ſo guilty a Heart,
to ſuch a foretaſt of Glory, as is this effuſion of his
Love by the Holy Ghoſt? The lightſom Daies in
Spring and Summer when the Sun reviveth the late
naked Earth, and clothes it with delectable beauties
differs not more from Night and Winter, than a Soul
thus revived with the Love of God, doth differ from
an unbelieving formal Soul.</p>
            <p>Though this great change be above my power, the
Spirit of God is not impotent, backward, barren or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>able.
He hath appointed us means for ſo high a ſtate;
and he appointeth no means in vain. Were my own
Heart obedient to my commands, all theſe following I
would lay upon it: Yea I'll do it and beg the help of
God.</p>
            <p>I. I charge thee think not of God's Goodneſs and
Love as unproportionable to his Greatneſs and his
Knowledge: Nor overlook in the whole frame of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, the manifeſtation of one any more than
of the other.</p>
            <p>II. Therefore let not the the wickedneſs and miſery
of the World tempt thee to think baſely of all God's
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59339:209"/>
Mercies to the World; nor the peculiar priviledges of
the Churches, draw thee to deny or contemn God's
common Mercies unto all.</p>
            <p>III. I charge thee to make the ſtudy of Chriſt,
and the great work of Man's Redemption by him,
thy chiefeſt Learning, and moſt ſerious and conſtant
work; and in that wonderful Glaſs to ſee the Face of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love; and to hear what is ſaid of it by the Son
from Heaven; and to come boldly as reconciled to God
by him.</p>
            <p>IV. O ſee that thy repentance for former ſins
againſt knowledge, and Conſcience, and the Motions
of God's Spirit, be ſound and throughly lamented and
abhorred, how ſmall ſoever the matter was in itſelf
That ſo the doubt of thy ſincerity keep not up doubts
of God's acceptance.</p>
            <p>V. Let thy dependance on the Holy Ghoſt as given
from Chriſt, be henceforth as ſerious and conſtant to thee,
as is the dependance of the Eye on the light of the
Sun, and of natural Life upon its heat and motion. Beg
hard for the Holy Spirit, and gladly entertain it.</p>
            <p>VI. O never forget the many and great experiences
thou haſt had, (theſe almoſt Sixty years obſerved) of
marvellous favour and providence of God, for Soul
and Body; in every time, place, condition, relation,
company or change thou haſt been in: Loſe not all
theſe Love-tokens of thy Father, while thou art beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
more.</p>
            <p>VII. Hearken not too much to pained Fleſh, and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59339:210"/>
look not too much into the Grave; but look out
at thy Priſon Windows to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, and
the heavenly Society that triumph in Glory.</p>
            <p>VIII. Let all thy ſure notices of a future life, and
of the communion we have here with thoſe above,
draw thee to think that the great number of Holy
Souls that are gone before thee, muſt needs be better
than they were here; and that they had the ſame
Mind, and Heart, and Way, the ſame Saviour, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyer
and Promiſe that thou haſt; and therefore they
are as Pledges of Felicity to thee. Thou haſt joyfully lived
with many of them here; and is it not better be with
them there? It is only the ſtate of Glory foreſeen by Faith,
which moſt fully ſheweth us the greatneſs of God's Love.</p>
            <p>IX. Exerciſe thy ſelf in Pſalms of Praiſe, and daily
magnifying the Love of God, that the due mention
of it may warm and raiſe thy love to him.</p>
            <p>X. Receive all temptations againſt Divine Love,
with hatred and repulſe: Eſpecially temptations to
unbelief: And as thou wouldſt abhor a temptation
to murder, or perjury, or any other heinous ſin, as much
abhor all temptations which would hide God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or repreſent him to thee as an enemy or unlovely.</p>
            <p>Thus God hath ſet the Glaſs before us, in which
we may ſee his amiable Face. But, alas, Souls in fleſh
are in great obſcurity, and conſcious of their own
weakneſs, are ſtill diſtruſtful of themſelves, and doubt
of all their apprehenſions, till over-powering Objects
and Influences ſatisfie, and fix them. For this my
Soul with daily longings doth ſeek to thee my God
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59339:210"/>
and Father: O pardon the ſin that forſeits Grace: I
am ready to ſay, <hi>Draw nearer to me,</hi> but its mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to ſay, Open thou my Eyes and Heart, and
remove all impediments, and undiſpoſedneſs, that I
may believe and feel how near thou art and haſt been to
me, while I perceived it not.</p>
            <p>XIII. It is God's Love ſhed abroad on the Heart by
the Holy Ghoſt, which muſt make us <hi>Rejoice in hope
of the Glory of God:</hi> This will do it, and without this
it will not be done.</p>
            <p>This would turn the fears of Death, into joyful hopes
of future life. If my God will thus warm my Heart with
his Love, it will have theſe following effects in this matter.</p>
            <p>I. Love longeth for union, or nearneſs, and fruition:
And it would make my Soul long after God, in glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
preſence.</p>
            <p>II. This would make it much eaſier to me to believe
that there is certainly a future bleſſed life for Souls;
while I even taſted how God loveth them? It's no
hard thing to believe that the Sun will give light and
heat, and revive the frozen Earth: Nor that a Father
will ſhew kindneſs to his Son, or give him an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Why ſhould it be hard to believe that God
will glorifie the Souls whom he loveth? And that he
will take them near himſelf: And that thus it ſhall be
done to thoſe whom he delights to honour.</p>
            <p>III. This effuſion of Divine Love would anſwer my
doubts of the pardon of ſin: I ſhould not find it hard
to believe that love itſelf, which hath given us a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59339:211"/>
will forgive a Soul that truly repenteth, and hates
his ſin, and giveth up himſelf to Chriſt for Juſtification.
It's hard to believe that a Tyrant will forgive, but
not that a Father will pardon a returning prodigal
Son.</p>
            <p>IV. This effuſion of Divine Love, will anſwer my
fears which ariſe from meer weakneſs of Grace and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Indeed it will give no other comfort to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
Soul, but that he may be accepted if he
come to God by Chriſt, with true Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and that this is poſſible. But it ſhould be eaſie
to believe that a tender Father will not kill or caſt out
a Child for weakneſs, crying or uncleanneſs: Divine
Love will accept and cheriſh, even weak Faith, weak
Prayer, and weak obedience and patience which are
ſincere.</p>
            <p>V. This effuſed Love would confute temptations
that are drawn from thy afflictions; and make thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that they are not ſo bad as fleſh repeſenteth
them: It would underſtand that every Son that God
loveth, he chaſteneth, that he may not be condemned with
the World, and that he may be partaker of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the end may be the quiet fruit of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
it would teach us to believe that God in very
faithfulneſs doth afflict us; and that it is a good ſign
that the God of Love intendeth a better life for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
when he trieth them with ſo many tribulations
here: And though <hi>Lazarus</hi> be not ſaved for his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it ſignified that God who loved him, had a life of
comfort for him, when he had his evil things on Earth.
When pangs are greateſt, the Birth is neareſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:59339:211"/>
VI. Were Love thus ſhed on the Heart by the Holy
Ghoſt, it would give me a livelier apprehenſion of the
ſtate of Bleſſedneſs which all the faithful now enjoy: I
ſhould delightfully think of them as living in the joyful
Love of God, and ever fully repleniſhed therewith. It
pleaſeth us to ſee the Earth flouriſh in the Spring; and
to ſee how pleaſantly the Lambs and other young things
will skip and play: Much more to ſee Societies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Chriſtians loving each other, and provoking one
another to delight in God: O then what a pleaſant
thought ſhould it be, to think how all our deceaſed god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Friends, and all that have ſo died ſince the Creation,
are now together in a World of Divine perfect Love!
How they are all continually wrap't up in the Love of
God, and live in the delight of perfect Love to one
another.</p>
            <p>O my Soul, when thou art with them, thou wilt
dwell in Love, and feaſt on Love, and reſt in Love; for
thou wilt more fully dwell in God, and God in thee:
And thou wilt dwell with none but perfect Lovers:
They would not ſilence thee from praiſing God in their
Aſſembly: Tyrants, Malignants, and Perſecutors are
more ſtrange there (or far from thence) than Toads,
and Snakes, and Crocodiles are from the Bed or Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber
of the King. Love is the Air, the Region,
the World they live in: Love is their Nature, their
Pulſe, their Breath, their Conſtitution, their Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and their work: It is their life, and even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and all. Full loth would one of thoſe Spirits be,
to dwell again among blind <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and mad ſelf-damning
Malignants upon Earth.</p>
            <p>VII. Yea, this effuſed Love will teach us to gather
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59339:212"/>
the Glory of the Bleſſed from the common Mercies
of this life: Doth God give his diſtracted malignant
Enemies, Health, Wealth, Plenty, Pleaſure, yea,
Lordſhips, Dominions, Crowns, and Kingdoms, and
hath he not much better for beloved holy Souls.</p>
            <p>Yea, doth he give the Bruits, Life, Senſe, Delight
and Beauty, and hath he not better things for
men? for Saints?</p>
            <p>There are ſome ſo blind as to think that Man ſhall
have no better hereafter, becauſe Bruits have not, but
periſh. But they know not how erroneouſly they think.
The ſenſible ſouls of Bruits are ſubſtance: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are not annihilated at death: But God put them
under us, and made them for us, and us more nearly for
himſelf. Bruits have not Faculties to know and love
God, to meditate on him, or praiſe him, or by moral
agency to obey his Precepts: They deſire not any higher
felicity than they have: God will have us uſe their
ſervice, yea, their lives and Fleſh to tell us they were
made for us. He tells us not what he doth with them
after death: But whatever it is, it is not annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and it's like they are in a ſtate ſtill of ſervice unto
Man: Whether united or how individuate we know
not: Nor yet whether thoſe Philoſophers are in the
right, that think that this Earth is but a ſmall Image
of the vaſt ſuperiour Regions, where there are Kingdoms
anſwerable to theſe here, where the Spirits of Bruits
are in the like ſubjection in aerial Bodies, to thoſe low
rational Spirits that inhabite the Aerial Regions as in
Fleſh they were to Man in Fleſh. But it's enough for us
that God hath given us Faculties to know, love, praiſe,
and obey him, and truſt him for Glory, which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gave to them, becauſe they were not made for
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59339:212"/>
things ſo high. Every Creatures Faculties are ſuited to
their uſe and ends:</p>
            <p>And Love tells me that the bleſſed God, who giveth
to Bruits that life, health, and pleaſure which they are
made and fitted for, will give his Servants that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
delight in the fulneſs of his Love and Praiſe, and
and mutual joyful Love to one another, which Nature
fundamentally, and Grace more immediately hath
made them fit for.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed <hi>Jehovah,</hi> for what taſts of this effuſed Love
thou haſt given me, my Soul doth bleſs thee, with
ſome degree of gratitude and joy: And for thoſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meaſures which I want, and long for, and which
my pained languid ſtate much needs, and would raiſe
my joyful hopes of Glory, I wait, I beg, from day to
day. O give me now at the Door of Heaven, ſome
fuller taſte of the heavenly Felicity: Shed more abroad
upon my Heart, by the Holy Ghoſt, that Love of
thine, which will draw up my longing Soul to thee,
rejoicing in hope of the Glory of God.</p>
