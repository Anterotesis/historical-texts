            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and some other, perhaps better knowne vnto him-selfe, indifferent readers may gather, that it is expedient for him to staie, vntill he see the wholl charge of the aduersarie, and then more orderly and seasonablie he may publish his answere altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     </gap> hereunto an impudent heretike, and a malitious traytor. And if any man be so simple, that he cannot yet perfectlie be holde all these pointes in his owne treatise, yet in the answeres, and confutations thereof, he that will not acknowledge them to be verified in him, is like to proue a nowne of the same declension with him. Thus the Owlie <hi>Corrector</hi> hauing shotte his bolte out of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12222:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bulwarke, which by euil happe of a contrarie winde is caried backe against him selfe, and his owne freinds, retireth into a corner, and doth no more appeare, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that some notes of his negligence, here and there bewraying him, do declare that this was not the first time that he was ouerseene in his life, &amp; that he should haue done his Master better seruise, if he had imploied the time he spent in deuising this grammatication, in being occupied more diligentlie about his office of <hi>Correction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>setter forth of this booke</hi> hath the next place, who writing an epistle to <hi>Master Charke, minister,</hi> as he termeth him, and as he is indeede, of the Church of god in England, vnder colour of expostulation of some particuler matters, concerning the person of <hi>M. Charke</hi> taketh occasion to be a setter forth, not onelie of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious &amp; slaunderous booke against the Church, but also of moste spitefull accusations against the prince, and Magistrates of the realme: a sin the particuler vew of this epistle shall moste manifestlie appeare.</p>
                  <p>First therefore he excuseth the long delaie of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth this defense of the <hi>Censure,</hi> which hath beene deferred more moneths, then the <hi>Censure</hi> was daies in writing, <hi>vpon such cause as is easie to iudge, and speciallie to Master Charke, which for the moste parte is priuie to the same.</hi> The meaning is, that the author is so quicke a dispatcher of his matters, partely by meanes of the weakenes of our cause, partelie by singuler dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie of his owne wit and learning, that <hi>hauing fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his Censure in eight or nine daies space at the moste,</hi> he coulde also in like proportionable time haue accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished his defense, if he had not by the cause preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, beene stayed or interrupted. And here the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is much beholding to the <hi>setter forth,</hi> that doth so cunninglie commende his facultie in expedition of such writings: which in a Papist must needes be an argument of great and wonderfull promptnes, both
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12222:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of wit &amp; learning, though in a protestant it be gyrded at by the author him-selfe, with a scorneful reproche of rashnes and ignorance. But what is the cause, trowe ye, that hath stopped the force of these flowing streames of the authors eloquent style, that in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny monethes he hath not fullfilled that course, which without impediment he had beene able to haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched almost in as fewe daies. <hi>Euerie one</hi> (sayth he) <hi>may imagine how difficult a thing it is in England, for a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike man, to write any booke: where neyther libertie, nor rest, nor librarie, nor conference, nor being is permitted.</hi> But I praie you sir (if I may be so bolde to aske you) what greater libertie, rest, lybrarie, conference, or being, had your Catholike author in contriuing his <hi>Censure,</hi> which he wanted in writing his defense? Or rather what cause had he to complaine of the difficultie of the tymes, which with such facultie, in so shorte a tyme, could performe so greate and waightie a peece of worke, as by his owne iudgement (who you know is nothing partial in his owne cause) deserued to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the honorable name of a <hi>Censure?</hi> vnles perhaps you thinke, that either the Prince, her Councell, or the Cleargie of the realme, should haue inuited him to write against the religion of God, and the state of the realme, with promis of libertie, rest, librarie, and all other thinges, the lacke whereof you pretend to haue hindred him.</p>
                  <p>And yet whatsoeuer you say in generall, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse in particuler, that all difficulties notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the author had, soone after <hi>M. Charkes</hi> replie to his <hi>Censure,</hi> in greate parte dispatched his defense readie for the printe, but that by misaduenture your seditious printe was discouered, and taken <hi>with many things printed, or in printing, concerning your defense of trueth and equitie, against his falshoode, and violent oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi> That you speake against <hi>M. Charkes</hi> falshoode, it is lawful for you to renew, if you can discouer any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12222:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
committed by him. As for his <hi>violent oppressions,</hi> being a man of noe power or authority out of the Church, al may know how vainly you charge him, or rather how lewdlie in speaking to him, you speake of the lawful proceedings of the Prince, and all her magistrates, against Popish traytors, terming them no bettet then <hi>violent oppressions,</hi> when God knoweth, you haue but in a few yet tasted of most iust condemnations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions. Oflike stomach and style it is, that you say, <hi>the same print was so long sought, and much feared by him.</hi> By like he thought that your printe being taken, you had noe meane to publish your authors defense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: as though you haue not printers enow in places beyonde the sea. How daungerous an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne printe within the lande may be to the state, if it be abused by seditious persons, no man of meane vnderstanding can be ignorant: and therefore mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell not if the magistrates haue beene carefull, to search for it, and diligentlie to suppresse it being founde.</p>
                  <p>But of this disturbance (as you tell vs) had like to haue come a greate losse: for the author had almost giuen ouer his enterprise of defense, not onely vpon these difficulties alleadged, but also <hi>because Master Charkes replie did seeme sufficientlie to answere it selfe.</hi> A pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull case, but how did the replie answere it selfe so sufficientlie? He telleth vs, <hi>it was so obscure in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as moste men without the Censure might not vnderstande it.</hi> Admit it were so: is the obscuritie of a replie, a sufficient answere to it selfe? but why might not he that could not vnderstande it, haue recourse to the <hi>Censure,</hi> whereunto his replie had relation? Then he answereth for a second reason: <hi>It was so weake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as it needed litle confutation of others.</hi> This will best appeare by the authors doughtie defense, when both are compared, and examined together. A third reason. <hi>Campian the subiect of the Censure, being fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12222:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Master Charkes handes, it was looked for, that according to reason, and all his promisses, he should be disputed withall openlie, publikelie, and freelie: and so the matter without writing dispatched.</hi> No man is so simple, but he may well perceiue, that while the wordes are directed to <hi>Master Charke,</hi> they are ment against the Prince and state. For who can trulie say, that <hi>Master Charke</hi> had <hi>Campian</hi> in his handes? or that he had made promis, of open, publike, and free disputation, whoe knew full well that he was not able to performe such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis if <hi>Campian</hi> had beene taken? or that any man of our profession, made any one such promis? what meaneth then our <hi>setter forth,</hi> by these his wordes, <hi>and all your owne promises,</hi> but thorough fayning of many promises, to slaunder vs of many breaches of faith and much falshoode. This is, in Poperie and Knauerie, a common practize, to charge men with a promisse where none was, that they maie ouercome modestie with impudencie; or at left to make her blush, beeing vniustlie accused of vnfaithfulnes.</p>
                  <p>But you will saie, it was according to reason, that <hi>Campian</hi> should haue beene so disputed withall, if there had beene no promise at all. Great reason forsooth, that a well knowne, vaine, light, runnagate person, challengeing all the graue, wise, and learned of the land to disputation, should so greatlie be regarded, that his chalenge should be taken. Nay that an arrant traytor, furnished with faculties from the Pope, the Queenes open enemie, whose banner of defiance at the same time was spread within her Maiesties domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, should be admitted vnder colour of an open di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation, to stir vp the vnconstant people to tumult and sedition: as though the religion so long by lawe established, were now brought into doubte, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation. Finallie, it was small reason in wise mens iudgement, that such a lustie Champion as did first cast his gloue of defiance out of a secret corner, after
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12222:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he hath beene long sought for, &amp; is at length drawne out of the bench holl, shoulde be set on the open stage to answere his challenge against al commers, with no smal glory of his foole hardy attempt, though he loose the daie, and be vanquished in the cause. Neuer the lesse it pleased them that had authoritie, partelie to represse the insolencie of the proud peeuish challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and his foolish fautors, that made no small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counte of such a glorious <hi>Thraso,</hi> pattelie to satisfie the weake mindes of such, as might surmize of his bragges, otherwise then they deserued, there was a conference or disputation graunted, wherin although <hi>Campians</hi> learning was well knowne before, to all them that knew his bringing vp and studies, yet was it then throughlie discouered to many others, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued better of him before, then at that time shewed manefestlie to be in him. For besides his shamefull ignoraunce in the learned tongues, which he sought most rediculoussie to couer and hide, there appeared in him to all indifferent mens iudgements, no more then is writen of <hi>Catiline</hi> the Romane, whome he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as well in practize, as he resembled him in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <hi>Loquentiae multum, sapientiae parum,</hi> many words, little wisdome, impudent loquacity, smale learning, &amp; lesse iudgement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But when it came to the hearing of the worlde</hi> (sayth the setter forth) <hi>how courteouslie you had vsed this learned man with torments.</hi> The world here signifieth, the secretra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of trayterous papists, which giue themselues to no thing more then either to heare or inuent, most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent lies against religion, &amp; al mainteyners &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the same. For to omitte the common phrase of this epistle, wherewith all thinges that are done against the papists, are imputed to <hi>M. Charke,</hi> whom al reasonable men knowe to be one of the moste, that may doe lest in these cases: who is so farre from all sense or vnderstanding (if he know what racking
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12222:6"/>
meaneth) to beleeue that <hi>Campian</hi> endured such tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of racking: whereof no signe could appeare in any part of his body, either before the conference, or after, whereby he should be lesse hable to dispute, as may be prooued by many hundred witnesses: yet the glorious foole, partly to boast of his sufferings, partly to excuse his impatience, and pusillanimity, which for feare rather then feeling of the racke, had discouered many of his friendes &amp; complices, with his owne hand writting, immediately after his racking, was not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on the day of the first conference, to complayne of his grieuous torments, vntil by testimony of Master Lieuetenant of the Tower, and others that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, his impudencie was so restrained for that time, that he thought it not best to bragge any more of his intollerable racking. <hi>But in the conference</hi> (say you) <hi>he was handled without all indifferencie or law of reasoning.</hi> How so, I praie you? The questiones were taken out of his owne booke, in which he could not bevnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: he had as great warning of them, as any of his aduersaries: he required no booke to furnish his memorie, but it was prouided for him: the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents for the moste part, dealt with him in lawfull syllogismes, except when his owne lauish tongue, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing against the lawe of reasoning, enforced other manner of communication: he was neither threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor reuiled, though he gaue great occasion by his insolent speach &amp; gesture. He was pressed with no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but the booke was shewed him: &amp; what other indifferencie or lawe of reasoning would you require?</p>
                  <p>But it is no maruell though you dare be bolde to quarrell at his handling in the conference, when you are not ashamed to speake so impudently of his open trial and condemnation, saying: <hi>Finally you made him away by cruel death, without any shew or shadow of particu lar crime committed by him, against Prince or countrey.</hi> This were more then barbarous immanitie, if it were true:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12222:6"/>
but being false, what is it, but a most heynous, and sedi tious slaunder, whether you consider the matter, or the persons against whome it is vttered? Let vs begin with the persons. Who made <hi>Campian</hi> away? not <hi>M. Charke,</hi> I am sure: for all men would laugh at you, if you so should say: for immediatlie after, you distinguish him from that action, saying, <hi>and that your selfe Master Charke followed him in person:</hi> Then whoe can be vnderstoode to haue made him away by cruell death, but they by whose authoritie, in whose highe Courte, by whose order, he was brought to triall: by whome euidence, verdite and sentence was giuen, and execution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded? Now let vs waigh the matter: was he not in dighted, &amp; arraigned, found guiltie, atteinted, &amp; iudg ed, according to the ordinarie &amp; accustomable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alwaies vsed in the case of hie rreason, according to the lawes of the realme? had he not leaue to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere for him selfe, to challenge the Iurie, or to vse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other plea, that is permitted and allowed in such cases? was there noe shewe or shadowe of particuler crime conteined in the inditement, or in the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? The worlde knoweth it must needes be, &amp; the recordes are yet to be seene. But there was nothing prooued, perhaps you will say, though much was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged against him: he was slaundered by them that gaue euidence against him, he neuer did beare a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous or vndutifull minde against the Prince, or the state. Well, admit for <hi>Campians</hi> sake, that the credit of sworne witnesses, and the wholl processe of so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a state, as is of this lande, must stand in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense, and not prooue so much as any shew or shadow of treason committed by him: yet what shall his owne confession subscribed with his hande testifie, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his treasonable affection against her Maiestie? shall it not confirme the testimonie of such as gaue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence against him, &amp; prooue him moste manifestly to be guiltie of high treason? his owne confession ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

you shall receiue an answere. In the meane time you may not thinke that with any reasonable man it is sufficient for you to accuse him of pride in wordes, and crueltie in behauiour, when you bring no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple nor proofe thereof. And sure I am, what wordes of his soeuer then vsed, you may wrest to make a shewe of pride, you are hable to alledge no action, wherein you may declare his vnmercifulnes, feirce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or violence. As for his <hi>pompous gate and speach,</hi> which you note in the last place, I doubt not but all they which know him, do laugh to heare you obiect it to him, as also that you note him afterwarde, to <hi>weare gorgeous apparrell,</hi> and therein to haue excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Campian.</hi> His <hi>valew in reasoning, learning and weight of arguments in writing,</hi> what they are, and how to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, albeit his friendes know already, yet I hope his aduersaries also shall in their conscience acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, especiallie after the smoke of your authors ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils be driuen away, by the cleare light of trueth.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>the disturbance thorough searchers and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters,</hi> that you complaine of, which caused your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to breake of in the middest, is but a shift of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scant. For as your author, whatsoeuer he be, is still hidden, so in his hiding place, he may goe through, if it please him, or if he be weary of his enterprise, he may take his ease without controlement. For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of the time is not such, though you whine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much, but if he can abstaine from vndermy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the state, he may enioy more rest, then an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike deserueth to haue, or then Papists in time and places of their gouernement wil afforde vnto true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes.</p>

you haue no cause to repine against our seuerity, much lesse to condemne vs of violence, if you seeke not your owne bane, by practising of treason and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But how do you openlie and without shame, saie, that <hi>we flie openly and without shame all kinde of quiet triall?</hi> What lawfull kinde of quiet triall hath not bene offered to you? Would you haue confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? was there not a moste solemne conference agreed vpon, in the beginning of her Maiesties reigne, where principall men of both parts haue beene chosen to confer, and all the states of the realme assembled in parliament readie to heare? And who did there openly and without all shame flie the triall? did not the pillers of popery, vpon a friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus cauill, misliked by their owne <hi>Fecknam,</hi> giue ouer the combate? As for <hi>priuate confirence,</hi> it hath bene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times offered, and often practised with such of your heresie, as be in holde, but of them for the moste part misliked or reiected. Triall by writing of bookes, hath alwaies bene, and yet is open &amp; free, in so much as many of your popish treatises being confuted by vs, are allowed to be inserted into our bookes, that the indifferent reader may iudge of both more freely and easily: a triall which you papists neuer yet durst enter into, and a manifest argument, that you flie the most indifferent kinde of triall. You haue bene open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenged by <hi>Doctor Fulke</hi> to conclude the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies <note place="margin">In his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before his reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue against Bristowes motiues.</note> of religion that are betweene vs in the strict forme of syllogismes, both for your owne ease and for the clearnes and certainty of iudgement: and this rea sonable request, if you refuse to yealde vnto, he hath protested before God and the world, that you shew your selues thereby to be enemies of trueth, that you flie the light, and dare not abide the triall. And yet these foure yeares day, none of you all hath aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that most easie, certaine and necessary trial, which you cannot refuse, if you wil haue trueth to be thought
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12222:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to stand on your side. Let wise men iudge therefore, <hi>whether we refuse all kinde of quiet triall,</hi> and whether it be not a seditious kinde of triall, that you would haue, as appeared by <hi>Campians</hi> challenge: who although he were a person too contemptible for yeares, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, learning, or honestie, to make so proude a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, to all the learned and wise of the Church and common welth of England: yet when he was brought to light, he was conferred withall, by diuerse graue, and learned men, and tried in the defense of his owne treatise, in which God wot, he was quickly found to be none other, then his familiars alwaies knew him to be, that is more bold to challenge, then able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him-selfe: more ready to cauill like a childish so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister, then to answere like a sober deuine.</p>
                  <p>And as <hi>for his constancie &amp; patience</hi> (which you magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie with so many wordes) in his iust execution for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which you falsly terme <hi>martyrdome,</hi> for your false religion, there is smale cause you should boast of it: but that it is necessarie, where you cannot be borne out with trueth, to breake through with open lyes. For manie hundrethes of eie witnesses can testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, that of his patience (which yet had bene perforce) there was no sufficient trial by torment, or sense of bodelie paine, at his death, other then is vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to al that be strangled with an halter. But <hi>as for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie or cherefull passage vnto his death,</hi> it appeared lesse in him, then in any of his fellowes, but rather great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of deiection and consternation of his minde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraied in his colour, countenance, voice, and gesture, plainly noted by such as knew his stomach, courage, &amp; lusty behauiour when he was in prosperity. <hi>That he &amp; his complices, would acknowledge no guilt of treason,</hi> whereof they were so cleerely conuicted, it maketh their death more detestable, &amp; sheweth their hipocrisie more dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: who seeing it was necessary for them to die as traitors, desired of their fautors to be honored as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12222:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
declaring thereby intollerable rancor, and malice against the prince and the state, and no lesse pride &amp; ambition in them-selues. Of such <hi>Martyrs</hi> boast as long as you will, you shall neither get credit by them, when their cause is knowne, nor terrifie vs with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of their blood, when their punishment was iust. HEtherto belike you haue spoken to al that abhorre Popery in general: for now you <hi>will speake aword or two to Master Charke, as to his owne person in particuler.</hi> And two things you tell him of, that in this matter do prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concerne him. The first is his writing, <hi>which, as shall appeare by this authors defense, doth conuince him of grosse ignorance, and that in verie common matters, both of diuinitie, and of Philosophie, wherein it is well knowne that Campian was moste excellent.</hi> But seeing the proofe of this conuiction resteth onely in the authors defense, the discreete reader will suspend his iudgement, vntill he see <hi>Master Charkes</hi> answere also. In the meane time it will appeare, by that which other men write in his defence likewise, that all is not grosse ignorance, which cauilling and malitious Papists, seeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face him with a false accusation, are disposed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vnto him. As for <hi>Campians</hi> learning in these two sciences, I may be as bold to saie, it is well knowne, that it was but vulgar, and inferior to manie of his yeares and tyme of studie, which you commend to be in the superlatiue degree of moste excellencye. Some peece of his diuinity he shewed in the conference with in the tower of London. <hi>His knowledge in Philosophie,</hi> as it is not to be waighed in the controuersie of Religion, which we haue in hand, so it is not to be thought, that he so far excelled therein, but Oxford and Cambridge can aforde an hundreth Masters of Arte his iuniors in time, at the lest way his equalls, if not his betters therein</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Master Charke outfaced him in the towre of London, by reason of his high place, gaie apparell, great wordes, assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12222:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of friendes, countenance of authoritie, and applause of Protestantes standing by,</hi> it is a poore excuse of <hi>Master Campians</hi> insufficiencie, which though it was manifest to the wise and learned, in euery of the former daies of conference, yet in that last daie of <hi>Master Charkes encounter with him,</hi> was apparant euen to the simple &amp; ignorant: so that <hi>Campians</hi> impudencie, wherein he chieflie excelied, was so repressed at that time, as euen in the opinion of euerie man (albeit he was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished before) yet now at last he seemed to be cleane ouerthrowne. And this shamefull foile, you would faine haue to be thought to haue happened vnto him, as <hi>one ouermatched with M. Charkes highe place, gaie appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, great wordes, &amp;c.</hi> It is pittie your <hi>Champion</hi> was noe better armed aganst so weake arguments, but did suffer him self to be outfaced with such friuolous reasons, of place, garmentes, wordes, countenance, &amp; multitude. verely they that knew his audacitie from a childe, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled to see him so greatlie daunted, but that it pleased God that day, to make him, and all the papists, in their foolish deuise of his impudent challenge, ridiculous to al the world. But if we maie examine these reasons, by which he seemed to be so much outfaced, what <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of place,</hi> I praie you, was there betweene the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, and the respondent? were not there stooles of equall height? you would haue fooles imagine belike that <hi>Charke</hi> sat a loft in a throne, seauen stepps higher then <hi>Campian,</hi> or what meane you to prate of <hi>high place.</hi> As for <hi>gay apparell,</hi> men maie see <hi>Master Charke</hi> daielie how gorgeouslie he is araied, so that he turneth the eies of all men vppon him, which waie so euer he goeth: or els <hi>Campian</hi> had smale cause to feare him, for his gaie apparell. In trueth his apparell was of colour blacke, of matter wollen, of making such as the common sorte of Ministers in London commonly do vse to weare. But if <hi>Campian</hi> had bene stripped out of his rugge gowne, whereunder his ruffianlike garments
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:12222:12"/>
were hidde, he would haue appeared in much gayer apparell for matter, colour, and fashion, then <hi>Master Charke</hi> was euer seene to weare, since he came into the ministerie. Neuertheles his gowne could not hide his to spots hat, which, if not on that daie, yet at all other times of the conference, it is certaine was the same, that was seene with the rest of his <hi>Iesuiticali robes,</hi> when he ridde through Cheap-side towards the tower of London: And therefore mee thinkes you neede not to haue spoken of <hi>Master Charkes gaie apparell.</hi> But what <note place="margin">Sesquipeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia verba.</note> were those <hi>greate words</hi> of his, a foote and a halfe long at the lest, that <hi>Master Campian</hi> might be outfaced with them? They that were present could obserue no affectation os wordes, but weight of matter, that bare downe <hi>Campians</hi> courage, especially when he was pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to answere to syllogismes, which (as though no man but he could skill of) at the first he did scornefully call for. <hi>The assistance of friendes</hi> was a smale prerogatiue, when they were onelie hearers, and not helpers of his disputation. <hi>The countenance of authoritie</hi> litle auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in conference, where each partie, by leaue of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, may saie what he can for his cause. Last of all <hi>the applause of the Protestantes standing by,</hi> was no cause of <hi>Campians</hi> outfacing, but a consequent of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient answering. That vaine scoffe, of <hi>Campians comming within the reach of Charkes ministeriall power and authoritie,</hi> sauoreth of nothing, but of proude follie, and foolish malice. For all men maie easilie know, that when <hi>Campian</hi> was apprehended for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Queenes subiects to sedition, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the tower, for imagining and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of high treason, he was not within the reach of anie Ecclesiasticall persons power, or authoritie, much lesse of poore <hi>M. Charkes</hi> iurisdiction, which is none at all, further then by commission might be graunted to anie of the state ciuill or Ecclesiasticall to examine him, or to conferre with him.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:12222:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>The second matter you haue to speake to <hi>Master Charks</hi> owne person, <hi>is of his false dealing, to deceaue: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you graunt him principalitie, not onely aboue Campian, who had no talent at all therein, but euen aboue the chiefe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of his owne syde, most expert in that facultie.</hi> The terme of <hi>talent,</hi> being taken out of the gospell, and signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some grace or gyfte of god, how vngraciouslie it is abused, not onely in this place, for a facultie of false dealing, but also by the auctor him-selfe asterward, for a custome of rayling, I wish the sober reader to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, and to consider what religious affection these men beare to the doctrine of Christ, that can finde no termes to play with all in their spitefull inuectiues, but such as are shamefullie detorted and abused from the holy vse, and phrases of the blessed scriptures. As for the crime of <hi>false dealing,</hi> let it appeare in Gods name, by the tryall and examination of both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties writings, and rest where it shalbe found to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized. In the meane time, we must a litle consider of these examples here brought for a taste, to shew his false dealings by <hi>Master setter forth:</hi> First <hi>M. Charke</hi> inueigheth against the <hi>Censurer</hi> verie sharpely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he chargeth <hi>Luther</hi> with an opinion, which he confesseth that sometimes he held, and afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canteth, concerning the licensing of wiues to lie with their neighbour, when their husbands by naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, were not hable to do their partes. This say you, seemeth a very reasonable defense: where is then the false dealing? Mary (say you) <hi>the words that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow in Luther, declare that now he would doe worsse then before: for now he would compell the poore husbandes, to graunt their wiues that libertie, or els would he tugge them by the lockes of the heade. And can there be anie more shameles <note place="margin">See after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the answere to the defense more at large.</note> dealings, &amp;c.</hi> If <hi>Luther</hi> declare his opinion in the words following, to be as you say, I must needes confes that this was a great ouersight in <hi>Master Charke</hi> at lest, if it were not shameles dealing. But if <hi>Luthers</hi> meaning
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12222:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the whole scope of that place be plaine, not to giue the wife licence to lie with an other man (the band of wedlocke continuing) but to compell such an insufficient husband to be deuorced from his wife, because she cannot haue the lawfull remedie of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency by his companie, do you not plaie the papist in graine, thus to exclame against <hi>Master Charks</hi> false dealing? As for the phrase of <hi>tugging by the Locks,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Dutch prouerb, signifying no more but inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (to vse your owne words) hath that man anie conscience, trow you, that will vrge it to colour such vnhonest and false accusations? Verily you had bene better to haue held your peace: for now you are, and shalbe more hereafter discouered, while you slaunder him vntruely to vse deceit, and do vse false plaie your selfe, and that most impudentlie.</p>
                  <p>Another example of his <hi>false dealing</hi> you bring, in the controuersie, <hi>Whether concupiscense in the regenerate without consent be sinne.</hi> Where <hi>Master Chark</hi> being sore oppressed by many places of <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, brought by the <hi>Censurer, findeth no other reliefe of his credit with the reader, but to forge a place of Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine to the contrarie: in which to deceaue the reader, he foisteth in this word (sinne) reciting his words thus: Concupiscense is not so forgiuen in Baptisme, that it is not sinne. By which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the word (sinne) the matter seemeth to stand cleere on his side. And this cannot be excused by ignorance: but sheweth open and wilfull malice in the man.</hi> Hasty iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Peraduenture he may excuse the addition, by the Printers fault, and so it was neither ignorance, nor malice in him. But take it moste hardly, that <hi>Master Chark</hi> did purposely adde the word (<hi>sinne</hi>) vnto <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> text (which yet in a strict translation, where there is no neede, is not alowable) if it be manifest that it is <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> meaning, the addition of a word, for explication of the sense, is neither forging, nor foisting. But it is most impudentlying in you, sir
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12222:13"/>
                     <hi>setter forth,</hi> to say, <hi>he findeth none other reliefe of his credit with the reader,</hi> but to adde this word (<hi>sinne</hi>) to <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> text, when immediatly after this pretended forgerie, he bringeth a most cleere place of <hi>Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> in which he doth expressly affirme, that concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piseense, euen in them that haue the spirit of God, is sinne: which argueth, that he needed not at al to forge and foist, hauing <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> words so euident on his side, and that he findeth not onely another, but a farr better reliefe of his credit with trueth, then he could looke to gaine, if he had bene disposed to vse false dealing. <hi>Master Charkes</hi> wordes are these: <hi>Saint Augustines place making it no sinne in the regenerate without consent, is expounded by him-selfe afterward saying: Concupis cense is not so forgiuen in Baptisme, that it is not sinne, but that it is not imputed as sinne. For a cleere proofe hereof, in another booke he saieth plainly, it is sinne.</hi> and so shewing the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of his saying, citeth the place at large <hi>Cont. Iul. lib. 5. cap. 3.</hi> in which are these wordes. <hi>Concupiscense of the flesh, against which the good spirit lusteth, is sinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is in it a disobedience against the regiment of the minde.</hi> Where he saith, for a cleerer proofe, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the word (<hi>sinne</hi>) in the formet text, was not added by him, at lest wise not to deceaue: for with the addition, you will confesse, it is as cleare, as can be for his parte. But if he added that word, as being of the plaine meaning of <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi> yet subiect to cauilling, because it is not in him expressed, to take awaie al colour of wrangling, about the terme, he ioyneth a moste cleere proofe, of <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> iudgement plaine, that concupiscense in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is sinne in his owne nature, although because it is forgiuen, it is not imputed to them as sinne. So that the sense is manifest, that concupiscense in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate is sinne, but sinne forgiuen, or sinne not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And therefore although in some sense, a man may truely say, that sinne forgiuen, as adulterie, is no

Therefore except you wil say, that sinne forgiuen or not imputed ceaseth to be sinne in his owne nature, concupiscense in the regenerate is sin, although forgiuen &amp; not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them. But of this matter inough at this time, seing it is to be handled more at large hereafter, and to be plainly shewed, that <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi> although in some sense, he say that concupiscense is no sinne, yet in another sense he doth as plainly affirme, that it is sinne, and such as would condemne vnto death, if it were not satisfied by Christ, and remitted vnto the regenerate.</p>
                  <p>Your third example, of his purpose to deceaue, is, that <hi>not hauing at hand the Censure of Collen it selfe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth diuerse vntruthes against the Iesuites out of Gotuisus, concealing his name, quoting onely Censura Coloniensis, which he is sure cannot be seene, as not to be had in England, ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Canisius, whom his author Gotuisus doth likewise cite, which may be had, and red of euery man.</hi> This is but a bare surmise, without any sufficient reason to vphold it: of two he citeth one, <hi>Ergo</hi> he seeketh to deceaue. And as for the <hi>Censure of Collen,</hi> it is now as common to be had in England, as <hi>Canisius</hi> his Catechisme, although when <hi>Master Chark</hi> did set forth his first booke, it was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12222:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not to be sold in the shops, yet many had it in their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And it seemeth he did chuse to cite that which was like to be of greater authoritie among the Papists, as done by consent of a wholl Vniuersity. But it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him more neerely, that where <hi>Gotuisus did not bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the Iesuites sufficiently, Master Chark without blushing will falsifie his wordes, to make them more odious: as where Gotui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus his wordes are, that the Iesuites say, the scripture is, as it were a nose of wax, Master Chark saith their wordes are, the scripture is a nose of wax.</hi> This quarrell was obiected at the first by the <hi>Censurer,</hi> and answered by <hi>M. Charke</hi> in his reply, that protesting at the first, not to set downe the very words, but the meaning, he hath nothing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried therfro. For there can be no other sense of these words, <hi>the scripture is a nose of wax,</hi> and these, <hi>The scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is as a nose of wax,</hi> seing no man would dreame of a transsubstantiation, but al reasonable men vnderstand a semblans or likenes, although the note of similitude (<hi>as</hi>) be not expressed. Therefore there appeareth no purpose of deceauing by this citing out of <hi>Gotuisus,</hi> when <hi>Paiua Andradius</hi> also excusing the same crime against <hi>Kemnitius,</hi> confesseth that <hi>the fathers of Collen, in a most apte similitude, called it a nose of wax: &amp; Pighius the leaden rule of the Lesbian building,</hi> as <hi>Master Charke</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whose purpose is no more, but to prooue that this is an vnapt, and an vnworthie similitude, and therfore hath offered no wrong to the <hi>Iesuits</hi> or <hi>Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Collen,</hi> nor vsed any fraude to deceiue the reader.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning his other <hi>behauiour towards M.

First <hi>his inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uility in wordes vttered against Campian in his booke.</hi> These blasphemous heretiks, and arrant traitors, where they haue no authoritie, and most bloodie butchers of gods saints where they haue power, require to be reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:12222:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
euen of them, whome by all possible meanes they persecute, and abuse, so that there may not an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle word be spoken against them, though it be not halfe so much as they deserue to heare, but they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine forsooth, of greate inciuilitie vsed toward them. But what the <hi>Ceusure</hi> noted, the reply hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and therefore to a generall charge, I neede make none other, but a generall answere. <hi>But that was nothing to the contemptuous vsage of so learned a man in open audience.</hi> Surely learning goeth very low among the English Papists, when <hi>Campian</hi> is made so learned a man, and euen with lothsomnes so often commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for learning: in whome as we acknowledge there was more learning, then honesty, so they which either were priuy to his studies, or had trial of his knowledge, must needes confes, that there wasin him much more arrogancie, then learning. But what <hi>contemptuous vsage</hi> (I pray you) can you lay to <hi>Master Charks</hi> charge? <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous threatening of that further crueltie which then he had in minde, and now hath put in execution vppon him.</hi> Is any man so simple to belecue this slaunder? hath <hi>M. Chark</hi> put any crueltie or punishment of iustice, either vpon <hi>Campian</hi> in execution? or had he any more to do in <hi>Cam pians</hi> punishment, then you? or was any greater cause thereof then you? nay verily, I maie thinke probably, that you, or at lest wise I may saie boldly, that some of his greatest friendes the Papists, were a much greater cause of <hi>Campians</hi> death, then any minister in England. For they knowing his proude stomach, &amp; arrogant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position (which no man could be ignorant of, that was acquainted with <hi>Campian</hi>) chose him for a meete instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be sent into England, as a trumpet of sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with his traiterous faculties, which is in deede the right and true cause meritorious of such paine, as he suffered, &amp; not <hi>Master Charks</hi> crueltie or malice: which if he had borne any against <hi>Campian,</hi> he is neither of authoritic, nor credit, to procure execution thereof,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12222:15"/>
in such sorte as <hi>Campian</hi> was punished. Therefore this slaunder of <hi>Barbarous threatning, and contemptuous v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,</hi> is as the rest of your honest reportes, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue trueth, nor likely hoode of trueth in them.</p>
                  <p>But of all other things it seemeth to you <hi>most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and fit for a stage, which yet Master Charke thought was excellent, and became him well: and that was his often tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the people, and requesting them to reioyce, and thanke the Lord that had giuen him such an argument: which when it came forth, prooued not worth three eggs in Maie, for that Master Campian dispatched it often times in lesse then halfe three wordes.</hi> Ofthis turning and requesting they that were present do saie, you lie in your throate, that anie such was vsed by <hi>Master Charke,</hi> as also where you saie, that <hi>when he was brought to a non plus, and thereuppon the people beginning to departe, he caused the dores to be shut, and no man to be let out, vntill they had ioyned with him in praier to thanke the Lord for his victorie, &amp;c.</hi> But if it had bene true, that he had requested such thankesgiuing of the people, or caused the dore to be shut, that the wholl multitude of hearers might ioyne with him in prayer, is praier &amp; thankesgiuing ridiculous, &amp; meete for a stage? &amp; doth the vse of them prooue a comicall exercise to get applause of the people? if the one or the other be so in the accompt of papists, surely they are otherwise iudged of among true christians. But it was the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the arguments (you wilsay) which were so light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissolued, in lesse then halfe three words, which made that preparation ridiculous. A maruelous dexteritie of the Champion, orels a ridiculous maruell of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasite, to saie, that he could dispatch arguments often times, and shew the infirmitie of them in one worde onelie, so that all men might laugh at the opponents follie. Of like credit it is, that <hi>Master Charke in the end was brought to a non plus, and thereupon the people began to depart:</hi> when as manie as were present can testifie, that the daie being farr spent, <hi>Master Liuetenant</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12222:16"/>
that the time was past, whereupon <hi>Master Charke</hi> gaue ouer, and concluded with praier. In which if anie Papist, by reason the dore was shut by order of them which might commaunde it, were constrained like an hypocrite to vaile his bonet, or bow his knees against his minde, yet none was so hardie to protest that he would not ioyne in praier with him, but ouelie your grande Captaine <hi>Campian:</hi> which yet was so courtcous a gentleman, that he offered to ioyne hands with them in familiaritie, with whome he refused to ioyne his tongue in praier. A lack that treason and vaine glorie would not suffer him to liue: for otherwise manie thinke he would haue beene tractable enough in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But it was to get applause of the people that Master Norton the rackmaster was at Master Charkes elbow, to repeate and vrge his arguments for him to the purpose,</hi> What els? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we might be bold with your worship, and tell you that you gable. <hi>Master Norton</hi> was there as a diligent and faithfull writer, as well of the arguments, as of the answeres: and when he repeated anie argument that he had written, it was that the opponent might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he had taken it truely. As like wise he repeated <hi>Campians</hi> answere also, who often times when he misliked it him-selfe, either added, or detracted, or altered the same, so that he weried the writer not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, vntill it was set downe, as he would haue it stand, and as he would stand to it: otherwise it had bene smal matter of applause, that <hi>Master Charke</hi> should get, to haue an other man vrge his arguments for him to the purpose, as though he could not follow them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe sufficientlie: so greate likeliehoode of trueth your surmises haue, which yet you set downe as absolutelie, as they were oracles of Apollo. <hi>For which cause also you had Master Norton the rackemaster, &amp;c.</hi> But how well do you remember the rule of ciuilitie in wordes, whereof you are such a rigorous exactor in other men, that so
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12222:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reprochfully scoffe at <hi>M. Norton,</hi> who besyde his rare giftes of witte, learning, and wisedome, was of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall trust with other appointed by the Prince, and her moste honnorable councell, to examine such as were thought meete to be tried, or terrified with the racke, &amp; therefore in respect of the authoritie, by which he dealt in those cases, neither in ciuilitie, nor in christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie deserued the odious, and opprobious name of a <hi>rackemaster.</hi> Againe you pittie the case, <hi>that we durst not make those few disputations publike, where more men might haue laughed &amp; bene witnesses of our folly &amp;c. No no, if we had parted with Master Campian but at an euen hand, as we ioyned with him with all inequallitie, you shoulde haue had bookes of triumphset forth before now, &amp; this secret of ours al the people of England doth knowe.</hi> What secret of ours? be like that we durst not make these disputations publiker by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the report thereof. For otherwise there were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses enow, at the hearing of them. But now all the people of England know that you lie impudently. For the report of that conference hath bene imprinted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most this two yeares, and neuer a papist of you all, at home or abroad, hath aduentured to controll it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there haue bene printed brags, that you would shortly set'it out your selues to our shame. You will say it is set downe by our selues, or our owne friendes, and consequently partially in reporte of <hi>Campians</hi> answers. Admit it were so (as in deede it is otherwise) for <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> answers touching the substance of them, and in his owne wordes, are as trulie set doune, as the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents argumentes: yet because the matter is not the victorie against <hi>Campians</hi> person, but against his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, if you thinke <hi>Campian,</hi> or your cause haue iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by the report of his answers, whie do not you shew, either what his answers were. or what they should haue bene, to the auoiding of those argumentes that then were brought against him? Which arguments as they were then propounded to <hi>Camipans</hi> person. so
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12222:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now by publishing of them in print, they are offered as a smal taste to al his fautors &amp; abbertors, to answere them, if they can, better then <hi>Campian,</hi> but a young nouis in popish diuinity, was hable to doe. But I suppose it much more easie for you to laugh at them in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and smile in your sleeues in open presence, then keeping the lawes of disputation, to auoide the force of them. As for the vaine glory whereof you dreame, that we be so greedie, you see by differring the publication of that conference so long, that we could wel haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne it altogether, if vour insolent bragging, false surmising, impudent slaundering, and childish da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, had not in a manner extorted the setting forth thereof. The example you bring of our desire of praise, by <hi>Doctor Fulke,</hi> looking into Wisbige Castle, is by the same man sufficientlie answered, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarrells, that you picke against his writings, in a seuerall treatise annexed to his defense of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish translations against <hi>Gregorie Martine,</hi> and therfore there needeth not anie other confutation of those slaunders and cauills, then is alreadie set forth.</p>
                  <p>But with what inequalitie did we ioine with <hi>Campian,</hi> by meanes whereof, he might be lesse hable to make his partie good? <hi>We know</hi> (you saie) <hi>the inequalitie, whereby we dealt with that man, being but one, vnbooked, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided, wearyed with imprisonment, and almost dismembred with the rack, threatened and terrified with death to come, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed onely to answere, and neuer to oppose: yea all this wee know, and the world both knoweth and marueileth at it abroad.</hi> The world maie maruell at his arrogancie, in making such a proude challenge, and at your impudencie, in defending his insufficiencie with such manifest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueths. First you saie, <hi>he was but one,</hi> and the world knoweth there were but six, of more then six hundreth whome he challenged, hable to haue incountred with a greater giant, then he was, that at seuerall times had conference with him. He being but one, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12222:17"/>
note of intollerable pride, prouoked al the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of England: and do you complaine, that being but one, he was assaied by so few of so greate a number as he challenged? There was but one that challenged all, and therefore it was thought meete, that this one should be a litle discouered, partelie to represse the insolencie of him-selfe and of his friendes, partlie to satisfie the weakenes of some ignorant persons, that might imagine, there was some greate matter in his bold challenge, who shewed therein the greatest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that could be, if it had notserued for an other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till practize. <hi>Hewas vnbooked</hi> (you saie) but in deede he was licensed to haue what bookes soeuer he would call for. <hi>Canisius</hi> great Catechisme he required, and had, which he saide should be vnto him <hi>instar omnium. Vnprouided</hi> he could not be, being opposed in his owne booke, or at lest wise could not complaine of it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as long time to consider of the questions, as his aduersaries had. <hi>His imprisonment</hi> had not bene so long before the conference, nor his keeping so straite, that his witts could be dulled, or his memorie quai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in so short a time of fiue or six weekes. That he was either almost, or anie thing at all <hi>dismembred, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted in bodie with the racke,</hi> is a most false lie, and shamelesse slaunder, although he bragged as of his suffering by the rack, which he rather saw, then felt, as Master Lieuetenant told him. It is as false that he was <hi>threatened or terrified with death,</hi> by anie of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters. If he were terrified in minde with conscience of his treasons, to feare that death, which he knew he had deserued, there was none to blame but him-selfe. Otherwise his behauiour was not like one that feared death, as it was afterward when death in deede was present before his eies.</p>
                  <p>Finallie, that he was <hi>appointed onelie to answere, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to oppose,</hi> it was noe disaduantage to him, if he had maintained a true cause, and had beene that man of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12222:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
learning, which he would seeme to be. For all men which know what belongeth to disputation, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that it is easier for a learned man to answere with commendation in defense of trueth, then to oppugne a true cause, with hope to winne credit. Wherfore the inequalitie was in the cause, not in the disputers parte, which was appointed to <hi>Campian.</hi> For if his positions had not bene false, by answering he had the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage against the opponents. Againe, <hi>Campian</hi> did first take vpon him the opponents parte in publishing his booke of tenne arguments against vs, which by our side was answered, and therefore it was meete, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to order, he should be appointed to answere, and our side to oppose, and that by the verie law of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie and indifferencie, although (as it is euident by the reporte of the conference) he was permitted som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to oppose, and propounded such arguments as his weake cause could afforde him.</p>
                  <p>But you <hi>are sure and dare auowe to our faces, that we will neuer deale with you at euen hand, or vpon equall conditions, while we liue.</hi> You maie be sure that to maintaine your purpose of sedition, for which your challenge was made, that we will not deale with you at anie hand, or vpon anie conditions. But to shew your falsehoode, ignorance, and arrogancie manifest to the world, we are readie to ioyne with you in anie conditions, that our prince and magistrates will allow vs, and shall thinke maie stand with the quiet of the state: who, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our religion after lawfull and solemne conference by vs offered, and shamefullie refused by your good masters, is by law established, will not rashlie admitt euerie vaine and ridiculous challenge of disputation, that is offered by such, as <hi>Campian</hi> &amp; you are, who dare auow to our faces, and yet dare not shew your owne faces, before you be drawen out of your creeping cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and hiding holes, as <hi>Campian</hi> and his complices were.</p>

                     <hi>Yet you are in the name of all your fellow Catholikes tore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new your bublike challenge of equall disputation.</hi> Who are you, and what Commission haue you from your fellow Papists, that we may credit you? If we knew either the one, or the other, we might the rather consider of your pretended publike challenge. <hi>Edmond Campian</hi> did more like a Champion, who when he cast downe his gloue of defiance, spared not his name, though he hid his head. But you, comming with so lowd a challenge, so large of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, so magnifical promises, not of your owne countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but of straungers also, of matters not in priuate mens power, but of the graunt of Princes, &amp; that in any kingdome and countrie, which you call Catholike; and moreouer, rather then you would faile of disputation, are ready to beare the expenses, not onely of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie-men, which are manie, but of all the learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of Europe, whome you giue vs leaue to call for our defense, must needs haue great intelligence &amp; conference with all the popish states in Europe, and a wonderfull large commission from them all, which we would beglad you should shew, for our assurance, or els you shew your selfe the noblest foole in the world, to thinke that any man will credit you in so weightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, vpon your owne bare worde, not knowing so much as whome to enquire for, or where to finde you, if we were disposed to confer with you, about anie conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of equalitie to be vsed in the pretended disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or about the time, place, or persons to be emploied in the same.</p>
                  <p>Neuerthelesse to shew your confidence, and desire of triall in all the haste, you tell vs, that <hi>albeit we thinke your cause to be greatlie weakened by the taking awaie, and dispatching</hi> (so you cal the iust execution) <hi>of Campian, &amp; Sherwine, yet you are the same men you were before, yea much more disirous of this triall, then before.</hi> Indeede I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded you are no changelings, but euen as the deuill hardneth them whome he hath once in possession, so
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12222:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your obstinacie daylie encreaseth, both in herisie and treason. For the weakening of your cause, we neuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted any greate moment to be either in <hi>Campian,</hi> or <hi>Sherwine,</hi> more then to the strengthening thereof. They were of the ripest frie, that your seminarie could afforde, sparing the olde stores, and yet they were but frothe, for any sounde learning that was in either of them. You say, we <hi>were wante for more abasement of the other, to saie that M. Sherwine was farre better learned, then Campian him-selfe.</hi> It may be some haue saide soe, and they that haue had conference with both, doe affirme that is the learned tongues Greeke and Hebrewe, <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi> had some litle sinacke, so that he could talke of them, whereas <hi>Campian</hi> was as blind as a betle in them both. Againe, <hi>Sherwyn</hi> in reasoning had for the most parte, the common shiftes and ordinarie answers of Papists, to the places that were cited out of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: <hi>Campian</hi> had nothing but friuolous distinctions, framed of his owne heade vpon the seddaine, seldome, or neuer vnderstanding the argument of the booke, or place of the Doctors, that he was pressed withall. So that it might casilie appeare, that <hi>Sherwin</hi> was better studied, &amp; <hi>Campian</hi> quicker witted. In impudencie they were almost equall, sauing that <hi>Campian</hi> was impudent with arrogancie, <hi>Sherwine</hi> with more shew of humilitie. I wil note one example of <hi>Sherwins</hi> impudencie, and an other of his small knowledge in the Hebrewe tongue, wherein yet the Papists would beare vs in hand, that he was excellent. When after some priuate confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence had with him in <hi>M.

is no shift of heretikes, or new teachers, but the auncient practize of the best and most approoued Catholikes. To pretend these things in shew, and not to accomplish them in deed, is the guise of hypocrites, what religion soeuet they would seeme to mantaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The second cause</hi> (saith he) <hi>is by excluding Councells, fathers, and aunciters of the Church (whoe from time to time haue declared the true sexse of scripture vnto vs) to reserue vnto them selues libertie and authoritie to make what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of scripture they please, and thereby to giue colour to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fansie they list to teach.</hi> But <hi>Master Charke</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, giuing the soueraigne authoritie to the onely scriptures, do not at all exclude councells, fathers, and aunciters of the Church, except it be in case, where they teach contrarie to the manifest scriptures of god, which doe either in expresse and plaine wordes, or els by moste easie and necessarie conclusion deliuer vnto the Church all things needefull to be credited, and knowne vnto eternall life, as both the Apostle testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth. 2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3. and S.

But what doth it serue anie protestants turne, whether there be more, or fewer signes in number, that maie be called sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments? seeing all protestants agree about the things themselues, that are set forth in the scriptures to be visible signes of grace inuisible, and the name it selfe, <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in that sense we speake of, when we saie there are 2. 3. 4. or 7. sacraments, is not once vsed. This diuersitie therefore is but of a terme, and that not vsed in scripture: therefore it ariseth not of anie interpretation, or peruerse vnderstanding of the scripture, as our answerer would haue it seeme to be.</p>
                  <p>But let vs heare his example. <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> saith he, <hi>after he had denied all testimonie of man, besides himselfe, he beginneth thus about the number of sacraments. Principiò neganda mihisunt septem sacramenta, &amp; tantúm tria pro tempore ponenda. First of all I must denie seauen sacraments, and appoint three for the time. Marie this time lasted not long: for in the same place he saith, that if he would speake according to the vse of onely scripture, he hath but one sacrament for vs, that is baptisme.</hi> In this sentence how manie lies and slaunders be packed together? First he saith, <hi>Martin Luther denieth all testimonie of man,</hi> which is false: for he alloweth all testimonie of man, that agreeth with the testimonie of God, expressed in the scriptures, and often citeth the testimonies of the auncient fathers
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:12222:28"/>
for confirmation of the trueth, which he taught: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede he alloweth man no authoritie to institute sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or to make articles of faith, or lawes to binde the conscience of man: and he would haue all mans testimonies to be examined and iudged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of God: but this is not to denie all testimonie of man, but to distinguish true testimonies of man, from false. An other slaunder is, where he saith, that <hi>Luther in denying all mans testimonie, excepteth him selfe:</hi> which is altogether vntrue. For he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth none other credit to be giuen to his owne testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, then he alloweth to the testimonie of other. Neither doth he arrogate any authoritie to him selfe, which he derogateth from other men. And namelie in this booke <hi>of the captiuitie of Babilon,</hi> he taketh not vpon him absolutelie to teach euerie point, but so farr forth as he did for the present vnderstand of them: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising after greater study, &amp; more diligent inquirie, to intreat of diuers of them more certenly: &amp; euen in this verie place of the number of the sacraments, he saith, <hi>he will admit three onclie for the present time,</hi> intending to be further a duised whether there be fewer, or more, to be entituled with that name. Wherein our answerer offereth him the third iniurie, in translating, <hi>tria pro tempore ponenda, I must appoint three for the time,</hi> as though <hi>Luther</hi> had taken vpon him to appoint how manie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments the Church should haue, or would challenge power to appoint more or Jesse at his pleasure; where as his wordes (if the answerer did not wilfullie corrupt them by false translation) do import no such thing, but onelie as farr as he did presentlie see, there were no more but three of those, that were commonlie called sacraments of the new testament, which were rightlie to be called by that name. The fourth slaunder is, <hi>that Luther hath but one sacrament for vs, which is Baptisme, if he would speake according to the vse of onelie scripture:</hi> yea this is a double slaunder: for neither doth <hi>Luther</hi>

say, that he hath but one sacrament for vs, in that mea ning of the word sacrament, in which he is charged by the cauiller to alter his opinion so shortlie, but in an other meaning: neither doth he saie, that this one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is haptisme: in which I can but wonder at the impudency of this fellow, that forgeth this last lie in his owne braine, without all colour or shew of <hi>Luthers</hi> words: as though <hi>Luther</hi> would allow no sacrament of the Church but Baptisme. The wordes of <hi>Luther</hi> are these, of the number of sacraments. After he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the number of seauen, &amp; admitted for the present but three, namely Baptisme, penance, &amp; the supper, all which he affirmeth by the court of Rome to be brought <note place="margin">De cap. Bab.</note> into miserable captiuitie, and the Church spoiled of all her libertie, he addeth: <hi>Quanquam si vsu scripturae lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui velim, non nisi'vnum sacramentum habeam, &amp; tria signa sacrament alia, de quo latiùs suo tempore. Although if I would speake after the vse of scripture, I haue but one sacrament, and three sacramentall signes, whereof more at large in due time.</hi> This one sacrament, whereof he speaketh, is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie mysterie or secret of our redemption, or saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Iesus Christ; of which the other that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie called sacraments, are holie and mysticall signes: so that herein he changeth no opinion of the thing, but onelie speaketh of the diuerse taking of the worde.</p>
                  <p>Well, yet will our a duersarie replie, he alloweth three sacraments, <hi>so doth the confession of Auspurge, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon fowre, and Caluine two: and all this by onelie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> I haue shewed before sufficientlie, that this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of the number of those signes that maie be called sacraments properlie, or vnproperlie, generallie or speciallie, is not determinable by the holie scriptures, because this name of sacrament is not found in them. Those holie mysteries, which by externall elements do testifie the inuisible grace of God workeing in vs, vnto our saluation by regeneration and preseruation,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:12222:29"/>
are plainlie set forth in the scripture, Baptisme, and the Lords supper, without naming them sacraments, which comprehend that whol mysterie of our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which <hi>Luther</hi> calleth the onelie sacrament, by the vse of the scripture, according to which explication of the word sacrament there are but two, so rightlie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie, and speciallie to be termed, according to the auncient vsage of the Latine Church, and no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, by anie protestant of sound religion. For <hi>Luther,</hi> his enemies shall testifie, which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to gather out of his writings whatsoeuer they thought to be erroneous, to be obiected against him: &amp; this is their Censure. <hi>Negat septem esse sacramenta, sed tantùm tria pro tempore ponenda, baptismum, poenitentiam, panem. Immo non nisi vnum esse sacramentum, &amp; tria fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na sacramentalia. Duo tamen in Ecclesia Dei esse sacramenta, baptismum, &amp; panem. He denieth</hi> (say the collectors) <hi>that there are seauen sacraments, but that three onelie for the time are to be admitted, baptisme, penance, and the breade: nay rather, that there is but one sacrament, and three sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall signes: neuertheles there are two sacraments in the Church of God, baptisme, and the bread. Luthers</hi> iudgement thus appearing by the confestion of his owne aduersaries, that as baptisme and the supper are called sacraments, there are no more that rightlie and properlie can beare that name: The <hi>confession of Auspurge</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon,</hi> which as our answerer saith, pretend and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to follow <hi>Luther</hi> in all things, can haue none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning in this matter of the number of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the new testament. And <hi>Melancthon</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely discoursing of the term <hi>sacrament,</hi> sheweth how diuerslie it maie be taken, to comprehend <hi>two, three or fowre.</hi> And in the last edition of his common places, where he answereth the articles of the Bauaricall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, he holdeth but two properlie to be called sacraments, as <hi>Luther</hi> before him, in his Catechisme the greater, and the lesser. Wherefore this friuolous
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12222:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cauill is thus easilie discussed, to the shame of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiller, and to the attestation of our consent in the matter and substance of trueth,</p>
                  <p>The like brable of wordes he maketh of <hi>the title of heade of the Church, which Caluine and the Magdeburgeans doe mislike, and Caluine in King Henrie found to be Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, but Caluines folowers in England do finde by onelie scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure to be moste Christian.</hi> Where all the dissention is in the terme, which being rightlie vnderstood, as by law it hath bene confirmed vnto the Prince, conteineth no other authoritie, then <hi>Caluine,</hi> and all other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the Gospell, do acknowledge to pertaine vnto the Christian magistrate, and is prooued to be moste Christian, not onelie by scripture, but also by testimonie of the moste auncient and Catholike Fathers of the Church, as it were easie to shew, but that it is here no place to decide these controuersies. <hi>The title of supreme head of the Church, graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to King Henrie, Caluine saieth was blaspheomus,</hi> not as it was vnderstoode of the godlie at that time, but as it was applied by <hi>Stephen Gardiner:</hi> who in a conference at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> cared not much for the testimonies of the scripture, but said, <hi>it was in the Kings power to abrogate decrees, and to institute new ceremonies, as to appoint daies of fasting, abstinence from flesh, &amp;c.</hi> And not staying there, he proceeded further, to affirme, that <hi>it was lawfull for the King to forbid mariage vnto Priests, to forbid the laie people to drinke of the cup in the Lords supper; and generallie to commaund, or for bid in his kingdome what he would, because he had soueraigne authoritie.</hi> This authoritie, or the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in this sense, neither our princes do accept, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth anie godlie man allow vnto them.</p>
                  <p>A third example he bringeth of burning of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, wherein he saith: <hi>The Protestants a greate while by onelie scripture, defended against the Catholikes, that no he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes might be burned, or put to death, whereof large bookes are written on both partes: Now they haue found by euident scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12222:30"/>
that they maie be burned.</hi> As though there were not controuersies enow, betweene the Papists and the Protestants, this man will needes make more, as this of putting blasphemous heretikes to death, which was neuer denied, the scripture of stoning blasphemers, false Prophets, and Idolaters, being so manifest. A. nabaptists indeede, and such like sectaries, are lothe that heretikes should be punished with death. <hi>But there hath bone long bookes</hi> (saith he) <hi>written thereof on both partes.</hi> If you aske him by whome, he biddeth you in the margent looke <hi>Eckius in Encher.</hi> and <hi>Luther contra Latom. de incendiariis.</hi> Would you not thinke this follow had read these treatises, for burning of heretikes, <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> whereunto he sendeth vs, to iustifie his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of large bookes written on both partes? but in truth he either neuer saw the bookes, or els he is the moste impudent forger, that euer was heard of: for <hi>Fckius</hi> in his litle booke, called <hi>Encheridion, loco 27. de hereticis Comburendis,</hi> which is but a short section or Chap er, doth not charge <hi>Luther</hi> with this opinion, of heretikes not to be burned; but the <hi>Donatists,</hi> whose fansie is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed againe in the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Libertines.</hi> As for <hi>Luther Contra Latomum deincendiariis,</hi> handleth not this controuersie at all, but onelie expostulateth with the deuines of <hi>Louane,</hi> which burned his bookes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination, or Conuiction of them, out of the word of God. Manie men haue complained, and that moste iustlie, of the crueltie of the Papists in burning as heretikes, the true saints, martyrs, and members of the Church, whose faith and religion they were neuer hable to conuince of heresie, by the authoritie of gods word. But that no blasphemer or obstinate heretike, maintaining blasphemie against the expresse and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest trueth of God, is to be punished by death, I am persuaded he can bring no booke or author of any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, that so holdeth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthlie, he addeth, that <hi>Luther by onelie scripture,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12222:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
found the sacramentaries to be heretikes. D. Fulk by the same scripture findeth that both parties are good Catholikes.</hi> But as <hi>Luther</hi> erred in his opinion of the sacrament, so he was ouer rash in condemning those whome he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth sacramentaries: neuerthelesse seing he erred of ignorance, and inconsiderate zeale, he hath found mercie with God, and is not to be adiudged as a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous heretike. For neither the error he maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is blasphemie in it selfe, neither did he hold it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his knowledge, but as he was ignorantlie persuaded with zeale of trueth, though deceiued with error. How <hi>Doctor Fulke</hi> prooueth this not onelie by scripture, but also by example of auncient fathers, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in like cases, and yet not to be condemned for heretikes, you maie reade in the place by this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer quoted, and in his confutation of Popish quarrels.</p>
                  <p>His last example is <hi>of manie things which Master Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift doth defend against Thomas Cartwright, to be lawfull by scripture, as Bishops, Dcanes, Archdeacons, officialls, holy daies, and an hundreth more, which in Geneua are holden to be flat conirarie to the scripture.</hi> There are manie things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by scripture, which yet are not necessarie to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. The forme of external gouernment and discipline of the Church is not so expreslie set downe in holie scriptures, but that euetie particulare Church hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and must of necessitie appoint manie things for order, decencie, and gouernment, which are not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse termes conteined in the scriptures, euen as god shall giue them grace to see what is moste expedient, according to the difference of times, places, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for the building vp of the Church, in trueth and loue. Wherefore although the Church of Geneua in the forme of outward regiment, rites, and discipline, differing from the Church of England, do not vse the same things that we do, yet it followeth not that they holde them to be flat contrarie to the scripture, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12222:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is our answerer hable soundlie to prooue, that he doth so boldlie asseuere.</p>
                  <p>To proceede, he telleth vs what aduantage herctikes haue by onelie scripture: <hi>they make them-selues therebie iudges of Doctors, Councels, histories, presidentes, cusiomes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, yea of the bookes of scripture, &amp; sense it selfe, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing al interpretation to them-selues.</hi> But this is nothing so, for howsoeuerheretikes take vppon them to control al things, according to their fantasie, yet haue they noe aduantage by onelie scripture, but therebie maie be, &amp; are confounded, when they come to examination &amp; tri all. And as for the professors of the Gospell, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the scriprure to be sufficiente to teach all <note place="margin">Ioh 5.</note> thinges needful to be knownevnto saluation, although they are by god him selfe made Iudges of the spirits of al men, by exacting them vnto the trial of the word of <note place="margin">Iho. 17.</note> god, which is the onelie certaine rule of truth, yet doe they not by priuate authoritie iudge of Councells, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, fathers, customs, &amp;c. But by that charge, which is laide vpon them to iudge, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne, euen the <hi>Angels <note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note> from heauen, if they should bring anie other Gospell, then that which the Apostles haue preached;</hi> without al arrogancie or insolencie against the Angels, Councels, Doctors, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; whatsoeuer: but in giuing god the glorie, to be onely true, &amp; al men to be liers, &amp; no Angel to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, except they speake by the spirite of God; of whose speach we haue no certaine demonstration, but in the holie scriptures, &amp; whatsoeuer is agreeable vnto them. <hi>The discerning of the bookes of scripture, &amp; of the true sense of them,</hi> is also committed vnto the Church, &amp; the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful members thereof, that doutful bookes be iudged by those that without doubt are indited by the holy ghost, &amp; deliuered to the Church by faithfull witnesses &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of the holy ghost, to be of soueraigne and perpetual authority in the Church, and so are knowne and taken of the true Church from time to time, in such sorte, that although the same truth maie be found
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12222:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in other bookes, yet (as <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> saith) they are not of the same authoritie, because there is not such certentie of trueth. As for <hi>the sense and interpretation of the holie scriptures,</hi> it must be taken out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures them-selues, which are alwaies the best and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest interpretation of them-selues, in all points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to be knowne, with the aide of the gift of tongues, the gift of knowledge, the gift of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in them that haue labored in finding out the sense thereof, according to the analogie of faith, which is comprehended in the scriptures, and that in places so plaine and euident, as they neede no interpretation, and therefore cannot be wrested by damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes without great impudencie, and against their owne conscience: for which cause <hi>Saint Paul</hi> willeth <hi>an heretike after the first &amp; second admonition to be auoided,</hi> as one who though he will not acknowledge the truth, yet he is condemned in his owne conscience, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto eternall damnation. Wherefore <hi>Councells, Fathers, Doctors, customs, examples,</hi> are by vs admitted, but not hand ouer head, without distinction, but such, &amp; so farre forth, as they be true and faithful interpreters of the scripture, by matters and places plaine, &amp; certen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, opening matters &amp; places obscure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. Which is the office of an expounder, &amp; not to determine by his owne authority of anothers mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereof, as among men, euetie man is the best in terpreter of his owne, so is the holy ghost of him-selfe, in the scriptures by him inspired: of whose meaning, where they be hard to be vnderstood, no man can be certaine, but either by his own plaine wordes, or by plaine &amp; necessary conclusion out of his plaine words.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the <hi>Papists, whome</hi> our answerer saith <hi>to be restrained from chopping and changing, affirming and denying at their pleasures, because they binde them-selues to other things beside the scriptures (to which they giue souereigne authoritie) as to councells, auncient fathers, traditions of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12222:32"/>
Apostles, and primatiue Church, with the like,</hi> the matter is farre otherwise. For whatsoeuer they prate of the soueraigntie of the scriptures, of the authoritie of councels, auncient fathers, traditions of the Apostles, and primitiue Church; they binde them selues to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to the present Popes authoritie and determi nation in thinges, which he may choppe and chaunge at his pleasure, against which they admitte nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scripture, Councell, Fathers, nor Church. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample brieflie. The scripture moste plainlie <hi>forbiddeh the worshipping of Images.</hi> will they giue soueraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to the scriptures? All the primitiue Church for six hundred yeares after Christ, condemned the worshipping of Images, euen <hi>Pope Gregorie</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the vse of them: shall the authoritie of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue <note place="margin">Greg. ep. lib. 7. ep. 109.

No, I warrant you: they will set them al to schoole, and learne them a new lesson. <hi>Theodoretus</hi> Bishop of Cyrus, and <hi>Gelasius</hi> Bishop of Rome, doe in plaine wordes affirme, that <hi>the substance of bread and wine doth remaine in the Lordes supper after consecration:</hi> doth either the antiquitie of these fathers, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Bishop of Rome, which otherwise they affirme neuer to erre in doctrine, preuaile with them against their new here sie of <hi>transsubstantiation?</hi> The councells of Constantiople the first, and of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon decreed, <hi>that the Bishop of Constantinople should haue equall authoritie and dignitie with the Bishop of Rome.</hi> The councells of Constans and <hi>Basill</hi> determined, <hi>that the Councell is aboue the Pope.</hi> The councels of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople the sixt and Nice the second, <hi>condemned the Pope for an heretike:</hi> will the Papists of these daies, trow you, stand to the determination of these Councells? you maie be assured they will not. But <hi>the traditions of the Apostles</hi> they holde fast, and binde them-selues vnto: yea verilie, as long, and as much as they list. What beareth a greater shew of the Apostles traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                     <hi>filthines of the soules.</hi> These &amp; such like traditions of the Apostles, how are they regarded of our Traditioners? euen as much as they list; and that is neuer a whit at this time: and yet these men binde them selues to Councells, Fathers, traditions, primitiue Church, you see how farre. Yea you see, that while they raile vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, for appealing to onelie scriptures, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues relie vpon the present Popes authoritie onelie. Let all indifferent men therefore iudge, whether it be more safe for a Christian man, to bind him-selfe to the authoritie of scriptures onelie; or to the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie onelie? and whether claime a priuiledge of ease, they that will admitte no testimonie irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but onelie the scripture; or they which chattering of many other things, in the end conclude vpon the Church onelie, which when it commeth to triall, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but the Pope onelie: for if all the Church saie it, and the Pope denie it, it is nothing worth with them: and if the Pope affirme it, thoughe all the Church denie it, it must stand for paiment.</p>
                  <p>But seeing <hi>the sense and interpretation of scripture,</hi> is the cheefe matter we haue to speake of, let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether <hi>Master Charke</hi> be iustlie charged by our answerer, to haue abused that scripture by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which is the chiefe ground of his preface, and which he saith, is a full and plaine rule, whereby to discerne and trie the spirites: namelie the text of Saint Iohn. 1. Iohn. 4. <hi>Euerie spirite which confesseth Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ being come in the flesh, is of God: and euerie spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>

                     <hi>which confesseth not Iesus Christ being come in the flesh, is not of God, and this is that spirit of Antichrist, &amp;c.</hi> This text <hi>Master Charke</hi> doth so expound, as that it conteineth a confession, not onelie of the person of Christ, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of his office, for which office sake, that wonderfull person of God and man, Iesus Christ, was ordeined, and sent into the world, to be a Prophet alone to teach, a King alone to rule, a Priest alone to sanctifie vs, and to reconcile vs to his father, by the obedience of faith. And if any spiritte shall teach, that Christ is not our onelie teacher, by his Gospell, but that we must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte vnwritten beleefe, and traditions, from we know not whome, to be of like authoritie with the written worde: Secondlie, if any spirite make not Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone our King, and head to rule vs by his holie spirite, but teach, that a mortal and sinfull man must sit in our consciences, and for hatred or gaine (which is his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise) binde or loose at his pleasure: lastlie, if anie spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite impeach the all-sufficiencie and entire vertue of Christes sacrifice, offered vp once for euer, and teach that themselues must enforce it from day to day, by the continuance of their daylie sacrifice of the Masse, offered for the quick and the deade; it appeareth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestlie that such spirits are not of God, &amp;c. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of <hi>Master Charke</hi> (saith the answerer) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth manie absurdities. For first <hi>the auncient fathers did expound this place (as of it selfe it is moste euident) against the Iewes, which denied Christ to haue taken flesh, also against Ebion, Cerinthus, and other heretikes, that denied the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Christ.</hi> Note here by the aduersaries confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that some places of scripture <hi>are of them selues moste euident,</hi> whereof this is one against the Iewes &amp; other heretikes, that deny the godhead of Christ. And I hope you shall see it shortly as euident against the Papists, that denie his offices. To this interpretation of the auncient fathers we agree, that whosoeuer denieth the person of Christ, or any thing proper to his person, is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:12222:33"/>
of Antichrist. But none of the auncient fathers doe affirme, that this text is to be vnderstood against such enemies onelie, as denie the Godhead or manhoode of Christ. For <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> do interpret it <hi>against all heretikes and schismatikes, which, although they confesse this matter in wordes, yet denie it in deedes:</hi> and <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius against all wicked persons, which haue not the spirite of Christ, mortifying their vngodlie lustes, which carie not the mortification of Christ in their bodie, &amp;c.

                  <p>But now commeth our answerer, after he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a place of <hi>Luther,</hi> and hammered it out against <hi>Master Charke,</hi> to maruaile that these men can finde so many absurdities vpon one sentence of scripture: and first he would aske, <hi>whether Master Charke thinketh, that the Papistes doe exclude Christ, when they allowe Prophets, to teach vnder him, Kinges to raigne vnder him, Priests to sanctifie vnder him, or no.</hi> As though there were no waie for Papists to be guiltie of Antichristianisme, except they did exclude Christ altogether; whereas it hath bene prooued, that whosoeuer doth not acknowledge the wholl, and euerie part of his offices, is of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. As for Prophets, Kinges, and Priests, to teach, reigne, and sanctifie vnder Christ, is not the matter in question, but to teach, reigne, &amp; sanctify beside Christ, to claime like authotitie in teaching, gouerning, &amp; sanctifying with him: as to be fellow Prophets, fellow Kings, &amp; fellow priestes with him, to teach that Christ taught not, to make articles of faith, to dispense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods commaundements, to make lawes to binde the conscience of men, to sanctifie them by their worke, whome Christ by his onelie oblation hath made perfect for euer. They that holde these points, denie Christ to be a perfect Prophet, King, and Priest. <hi>But these be deepe mysteries of puritanisme,</hi> saith the answerer, <hi>Christ is a Prophet alone, a King alone, a Priest alone: the ouerthrow of all gouernment.</hi> No, sir, no:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12222:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to acknowledge Christe to be our onelie Prophet, king, and priest, ouerthroweth not, but establisheth all power, that is ordeined vnder him to teach, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, and sanctifie. The scripture in deede Eph. 4. &amp; Acts. 5. doth allowe <hi>Prophets and teachers</hi> in the Church, but not authors of new doctrine, no makers of new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, no traditions beside the Gospell of Christ, which is written, <hi>that we might beleeue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing haue eternall life in his name.</hi> The scripture allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>Kinges, and rulers,</hi> 1. Pet. 2.

                  <p>Againe he asketh, <hi>what doe the traditions of Christ and his Apostles</hi> (for of those onelie they talke, when they compare them with scripture) <hi>impeach the teaching of Christ and his Apostles?</hi> I answere, there are no traditions of Christ and his Apostles, pertaining to a Christian <note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 31.

Act. 26. 22.</note> mans dutie to obtaine erernall life, but those that be comprehended in the holie scriptures, as the spirite of God in the scripture, which cannot lie, doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. And therefore, they are the traditions of men, and not of Christ and his Apostles, that areso called, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which title all heresies &amp; fansies may be brought in, without testimonie of the written worde of God. Wherefore such traditions doe greatlie impeach the office of Christes teaching, reproouing his Apostles and Euangelists of imperfection, if they haue not comprehended the summe of all that Christ taught, and did for our saluation which Saint Luke in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Gospell, doth professe that he hath done and that verie exactlie. And further it is false, that our answerer saith, they talke of the traditions of Christ and his Apostles onelie, when they compare them with scripture.

                  <p>Secondlie he asketh: <hi>what doth the spiritual authorttie of the Pope vnder Christ, diminish the Kinglie power, and authoritie of Christ?</hi> I answere, the Pope hath no spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall authoritie vnder Christ, by anie graunt of Christ, but he vsurpeth authoritie aboue Christ, when he will controll the lawes and institutions of Christ, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the cuppe of blessing vnto the laie people, and in taking vpon him to make newe lawes, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne men to obserue them in paine of damnation, as be his lawes of abstinence from mariage and meates, for religions sake, which Christ hath left free for all

                  <p>Last of all he asketh, <hi>How doth the priesthood of men, as from Christ, or the sacrifice of the altar instituted by Christ, disgrace Christs priesthood, or his sufficient sacrifice once for all offered on the crosse?</hi> I answere, the priesthood of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling by sacrifice, doth not passe from Christ to anie man, because <hi>he hath by one sacrifice made perfect for euer, all that are sanctifyed,</hi> and <hi>liueth for euer to make intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for vs,</hi> therefore hath (as the Apostle saith) <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>But that the sacrifice of the Masse, is the same that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on the crosse, differing but in the vnbloodie manner of oblation, Saint Chrisostome</hi> (saith out answerer) <hi>doth prooue at large vpon the epistle to the Hebrewes.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12222:38"/>
Master Charke and his fellowes would not disdaine to reade, and beleeue, they would be ashamed to cauill and blaspheme gods mysteries, as they do.</hi> The place of Chrisostome hath bene often alledged on both partes: by the Papists, for a shew and a colour of the matter: by the other side, for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest demonstration, that <hi>Chrisostome</hi> (as he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret him-selfe) maketh nothing for the Popish sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse, but altogether against it. His wordes are these, after he hath shewed the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the legall sacrifices, by the often repeating of them, <hi>Then what do we euerie daie? do we not offer? yes we offer, but we make the remembrance of his death: and this is one sacrifice, and not manie. How is it one, and not manie? Seeing it was once offered, it was caried into the holie of holies. This thing is a figure or type of that sacrifice, &amp; this sacrifice of that. For we offer the same alwaies, not now an other, but alwaies the same. Therefore it is one sacrifice by this reason: otherwise because it is offered in manie places, are there manie Christes? Not so, but one Chrisi euery where, both here full and perfect, &amp; there full and perfect. one bodie. Therfore as being offered in manie places, it is one bodie, and not manie bodies, so is it one sacrifice. He is our high priest, which offered that sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which maketh vs cleane. the same do we offer now also, which then was offered, which can not be consumed. This is now done in the remembrance of that which was then done. For do ye this (saith he) in remembrance of me: we do not offer an other sacrifice, as the high Priest, but the same alwaies: but rather we worke the remembrance of a sacrifice.</hi> These words of Chrisostome declare, that the name of <hi>sacrifice,</hi> is vn properly giuen to the celebration of the Lords supper, which is rather <hi>a remembrance of a sacrifice,</hi> then a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice indeede. Secondlie, that reteining the name of a sacrifice, there is great difference betweene it, and the sacrifice of Christ: for the thing here offered, is a type of that which was offered there, and this sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is a figure of that sacrifice. Thirdlie Christ offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the onelie sacrifice propitiatorie, that purgeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12222:38"/>
sinnes: this oblation is but a remembrance of that, to stur vs vp to thankfullnes for that, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our faith in our spirituall nourishment, by that bodie and blood which was once offered for all, neuer to be repeated. <hi>So</hi> that <hi>Master Charke</hi> and his fellowes haue not <hi>Chrisostome</hi> their aduersarie in this place, but receaue great light by this exposition of the name sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which is not properlie so to be called, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a remembrance of a sacrifice. And it is not to be doubted, but that other auncient fathers vsed the name of sacrifice in the same sense that Chrisostome did.</p>
                  <p>The answerer referreth his reader further to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret,</hi> and Saint Augustine, who handleth this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>whie Christians do now vse to sacrifice, seeing the old law with all sacrifices were abolished, by the one sacrifice of Christ.</hi> You maie see by this that our answerer hath more care to point his margent with quotation of the Doctors, which the ignorant can not reade, then he hath iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to consider what the Doctors write. For this place of Theodoret is cleane contrarie to the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice propitiatorie of the Masse.

to passe, that other sacrifices should not be necessarie; why do the Priests of the new testament celebrate a mysticall liturgie or sacrifice? But it is cleare to them that are instructed in diuine matters, that we do not offer an other sacrifice, but do celebrate a remembrance of that one and helthfull sacrifice. For this our Lord him seife commaunded vs, Doyee this in remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of me, that by contemplation of the figures, we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the passions that were suffered for vs, and continew good will towards our benefactor, and waite for the fruition of good things to come.</hi> This saying of <hi>Theodoretus,</hi> is a full and large answere in deede to the obiection by him made, of the vnproper terme of sacrifice, whereby the celebration of the Lords supper was commonlie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his time, but it is nothing fauorable to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish sacrifice of the Masse, yea rather it sheweth the right vse and end of the sacrament, which is an holie memoriall of Christs sacrifice, not the same sacrifice it selfe, nor anie sacrifice propitiatorie, but onelie eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistical, of praise and thankesgiuing. The other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to whome our answerer referreth his reader, is <hi>Saint Augustine.</hi> Ep. 23. <hi>ad Bonifacium,</hi> who proposeth this doubt (saith he) <hi>how we sacrifice Christ euerie day vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the altar, seeing he is said to be sacrificed once for all vpon the crosse.</hi> But in deede the question he answereth, <hi>is, how the godfathers in baptisme answere, that the infants do beleeue, whereas they do neither beleeue in deede, and it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine whether they will beleeue:</hi> for resolution of which question, he bringeth in example of the Lords supper, called the bodie of Christ, and a sacrifice, whereas it is not properlie either of both, but a signe, sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and memoriall of those things: so is baptisme called faith, and infants said to beleeue, when they are baptised: his wordes are these, often alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Papists: <hi>Nempe saepe it a loquimur, &amp;c. Verie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie we do often times speake so, that when Easter is at hand, we saie, to morow, or the next daie after, is the passion of our Lord, whereas he hath sufferrd so manie yeares passed before, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12222:39"/>
that passion was suffered but once in all. For on the verie Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daie we saie: This daie our Lord arose againe, whereas there are so manie yeares passed since he arose againe. Whie is no man so foolish, that would charge vs to haue lied, when we speak after this manner, but because we name these daies, according to the similitude of those daies, in which these thinges were done. So that the daie is called the same, which is not the same, but in reuolution of time like vnto it, and the thing is saide to be done on that daie, for the celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is not done that daie, but was done long before? was not Christ once offered in him-selfe? and yes in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not onelie in euerie solemnitie of Easter, but euery daie he is offered for the people, neither doth he make a lye, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked the question, shall answere that he is offered? for if Sacraments had not a certaine similitude of those things, where of they are sacraments, they should be no sacraments at all: And of this similitude for the moste part, they take the names euen of the things them-selues. Therefore euen as after a certaine manner the sacrament of the bodie of Christ, is the bodie of Christ, the sacrament of the blood of Christ, is the blood of Christ; so the sacrament of faith is faith. And to beleeue is nothing els but to haue faith. And by this, when it is answered that the child beleeueth, which as yet hath not the effect of faith, it is answered that he hathfaith, because of the sacrament of faith, &amp; to conuert him-selfe to God, because of the sacrament ofcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, because the answere it selfe perteineth to the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sacrament. As the apostle, of baptisme it selfe saith, we are buried with Christ by baptisme vnto death. He saith not we signifie his buriall, but plainlie, we are buried with him. Wherefore he called the sacrament of so great a matter by none other name, then of the verie thing it selfe.</hi> This answer of Saint Augustine, how full and large it is, in that sense the Papists defend their sacrifice of the Masse, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how directlie contrarie to the same, I referre to the iudgement of anie indifferent reader, that with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie conscience will consider it. Neither hath <hi>Eusebius.

Likewise in the exposition of the prophecie of Malachy he saith, <hi>That God by the voice of the Prophet hauing refused the sacrifices after Moses, doth by oracle declare what should be done of vs, saying, For from the rising of the sunne vnto the going downe of the same my name is glorified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the gentiles, and in euerie place incense is offered to my name, and a pure sacrifice: wherefore we sacrifice to god that is aboue all, the sacrifice of praise. we sacrifice a diuine, reuerent, and holie sacrifice: we sacrifice after a new manner, according to the new testament, a pure sacrifice: and the sacrifice to God is said to be a broken spirit, for a contrite and humbled heart God will not dispise: and we doe burne also the propheticall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, offering to him the sweete smelling fruite of the moste ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent diuine contemplation, by those praiers that are sent vp vnto him.</hi> Thus much Eusebius of the sacrifice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. As for Theophylact, in the place by him quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wherein either his Printer, or his note booke hath deceiued him, hath nothing touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in question, but vpon the 10. Chapter, he hath the verie words of Chrisostome, which I haue sette downe at large before. <hi>Suboritur hîc quaestio, &amp;c. Here
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12222:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
riseth a question, whether we also do offer vnbloodie sacrifice: whereto I answere that we do certainlie: but we keepe a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Lords death, and it is one sacrifice, and not mante, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was offered vp once for all. For we offer vp the same alwaies, but rather we keepe the memorie of that oblation wherein he offered him felfe, as if it were done euen now.</hi> Thus none of the auncient writers, to whome he doth referre the reader, for defence of his Popish sacrifice, do speake anie thing for it, and some of them do write directlie against it.</p>
                  <p>And now the answerer thinketh he might haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his preface, <hi>but that he promised to shew, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer most reasonable meanes of triall, and that we in deede admit none at all.</hi> Of both these partes we haue spoken alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, sufficientlie to the conscience of all reasonable men, yet must we further answere to such matters, as he can obiect against vs. And first he saith, <hi>All the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie being not of the words, but of the sense of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we admit no Iudge but our selues.</hi> To this I answere first, that all the controuersie is not about the sense onelie, but some about the wordes also; where we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the interpretation of them out of the originall tongues, and they wil admit none, but the vulgar tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, which in manie places is false, in some places also corrupted from the integritie in which it was first written. Secondlie, that we admit no Iudge of it, but our selues, it is false of vs, and true of them. For they admit no interpretation of the scripture, but that which their Church alloweth, which alloweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that the present Pope alloweth, whome they make Iudge of all interpretation, and to whose Iudgement they will all stand: Conttariewise, we take vpon vs no iudgement, but that which is common to all men, by reason and learning to waigh all thinges that are brought vnto vs, the cheife Iudge or rule to Iudge by, being the holie scriptures, in places of them selues euident and confessed, or to be confessed by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12222:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
right reason, of all that acknowledge the authoritie of the scriptures, by them to finde out the obscurities of such places as are hard, and haue neede of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>But if they bring scripture (saith he) neuer so plaine, yet will we shift it of, with some impertinent interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whereof he bringeth two, or three examples, in which you shall plainlie see, how like a Papist he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth him-selfe, in all kinde offalshood and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The first example is this. <hi>The moste of the auncient fathers write bookes in praise of virginitie aboue wedlock, and vsed to prooue it by the saying of Christ: There be Eunuches which haue gelded them-selues for the kingdome of heauen: he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Math. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>that can take it, let him take it. Also by the words of Saint Paul, he that ioyneth his virgine in mariage doth wel: and he <note place="margin">I. Cor. 7.</note> that ioyneth her not, doth better. Which words being alledged against M. Luther, who preferred marriage (yea though it were of a vowed Nunne) before virginitie, he answered it thus, That Christ by his words terrified men from virginitie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie, <note place="margin">Lib. de vot. Monast. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> and Saint Paul by this speech did disswade them from the same. Now what could be replied</hi> (saith he) <hi>in this case trow you?</hi> He beginneth with a lie, and so he holdeth on. For the moste of the auncient fathers haue not written bookes in praise of virginity aboue wedlock, neither is he able to prooue, that the one halfe of them haue wri ten bookes of that argument, although manie of them haue in their writings mentioned that comparison. Secondlie, in the state of the controuersie, he offereth vs shamefull iniurie: for we all confesse, that in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects named by our Sauiour Christ, and his Apostles, virginitie is better then marriage, in such persons, as haue the gist of continencie: but not in all respects, and namelie not in such respectes, as the Papists do preferre it, of merite for them-selues and others, &amp;c. nor in persons that lack that rare gift of continencie. For neither Christ nor Saint Paul do saie, that virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie meriteth more then mariage, or the profession of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12222:41"/>
virginitie in all men, though they haue not the gift of continencie, is better then a chaste life in holie matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. Wherefore that which we affirme against the Papists, is against that which they affirme, more then Christ or S. Paull spake, and is more then by anie law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full demonstration can be prooued out of their words. Thirdlie, in rehearsing the text, against the plainnes whereof he bringeth <hi>Luthers</hi> interpretation, he frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulentlie leaueth out those wordes, whereupon the exposition of <hi>Luther</hi> is grounded, namely these words <hi>non omnes capiunt, &amp;c. All men are not capable of this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Math. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>but they to whome it is giuen.</hi> If you aske, of what say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? the text is plaine, his disciples said vnto him, <hi>If the cause of aman and his wife be so (that he may not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced but for adulterie) it is not expedient to marrie: but all men,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>doe not receiue, or cannot take this saying.</hi> For there be three kindes of Eunuches, or gelded men, the third onelie being voluntarie, and for an excellent end, is commendable, so it be giuen vnto him, that he maie take it. <hi>He that can take it, let him take it.</hi> Is it not euident by this text, that Christ ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth all such men from this high attempt, to whome it is not giuen, and exhorteth them onlie which haue the gift to vse it. Now to come to <hi>Luthers</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: First he saieth, <hi>that Luther preferreth Marriage before virginitie, yea though it were of a vowed Nunne.</hi> This as it is simplie set downe, is a lowd lie: for <hi>Luther</hi> acknowledgeth the preferment of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie before mariage, in persons hauing the gift, and for the end and respects by Christ and <hi>Saint Paull</hi> named, as by his owne wordes in diuerse places of his workes is manifest, and most plainlie, <hi>Exege. ad. Cap. 7. Ep. ad Cor. 1. Nam sicubi coniugium quis cum coeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batu conferat, praestantius certè donum est coelibatus. For if a man compare mariage with virginitie, virginitie verilie is a better gift.</hi> Concerning the mariage of a vowed Nunne, if she haue the gift of continencie, and will renounce
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12222:42"/>
the superstitious and blasphemous end, for which she vowed virginitie, and vse it to the glorie of God, you shall heare <hi>Luthers</hi> iudgement. <hi>Nec ideo caelibatum &amp; virginitatem reprobare mihi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> est, nec inde quenquam ad iugale vinculum inuitare: quisque pro dono suo diuinitus impartito vt potest feratur. For all this my minde is not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect sole life &amp; virginitie, nor to allure anie person from thence vnto wedlocke: let euerie man according to the gift giuen him of god, be carried as he maie.</hi> But if your vowed Nunne haue not the gift of continencie, <hi>Luther</hi> is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to preferre chaste marriage before vnchaste sole life, or the vow of virginitie that is not kept: and this he learned of <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> against <note place="margin">Ad Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem. Cout. Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. H. 61.</note> whome you maie take your action, if yon cannot away with <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion.</p>
                  <p>By this the indifferent reader maie gather, how these wordes of <hi>Luther</hi> are to be vnderstood, out of which our answerer bringeth example of absurd inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. <note place="margin">De vot. mon.</note> 
                     <hi>At virginitas &amp; caelibatus, &amp;c. But virginitie &amp; sole life is a Counsell, Christ him-selfe plainlie did not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell it, but rather feared men from it: he onely shewed it, and praised it, while he saide to the mentioned Eunuches, he that can take it, let him haue it: and againe, all men are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this saying: are not these the wordes of him that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calleth backe and fraieth from it? for he doth not inuite &amp; call any man, but onelie sheweth it. Yet Paul saith, I giue counsell: but neither doth he inuite anie man, but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terreth and calleth backe while he saith, but euerie one hath his proper gift of God, he doth neither perswade, nor disswade, but leaueth it indifferent and free. but our vncleane wiuelesse men vnderstand nothing else by counselling, but inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, exhorting, calling, and perswading vnto sole life, also to disswade, dehort, call awaie, fraie awaie from mariage, which thing they doe in all their sermons and writinges.</hi> Vnderstand <hi>Luther</hi> here according as he expoundeth him-selfe, that men void of the gift of continencie are disswaded from professing of virginitie, and other

which haueit, be at their liberty to vse it without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, and there is not anie absurditie in this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, but the verie pure and naturall meaning of our sauiour Christ and his Apostles sayings.</p>
                  <p>The second example he taketh, is touching S. Iohn Baptist, <hi>his being in the wildernes, his apparel of Camels heare, his meate, locusts &amp; wilde honie, of which the olde fathers do ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a singular &amp; great austeritie of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Iohns life, &amp; the patterne of Monkes. The former we al confesse, the second can not be prooued out of this place, because the calling of S. Iohn was singuler, neither do all, or moste of the olde fathers in exposition of this text affirme this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, &amp; they that do affirme it, speake of the solitarie men of their time, not of the false and counterfeit Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Monkes, and Friers of these times, whome proudlie &amp; schismaticallie he calleth religious people: who neither in austeritie of life, nor exercises of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, nor in the end of their profession, are anie thing like the other, but in name onelie: and yet we can not defend the other in all points. Now what saith our answerer vpon this example? <hi>For this cause</hi> (saith he) <hi>Saint Chrisostome doth often call S. Iohn Baptist, Monachum, &amp; principem vitae Monasticae, a Monke, &amp; Prince of Monasticall life, which Protestants being not able to abide, do rage marueilouslie against Saint Chrisostome, condemning him of rashnesse and falshoode for vsing those termes.</hi> I praie you note his liberall speeches: Saint Chrisostome doth often cal Iohn Baptist a Monke, and Prince of the Monasticall life, yet he noteth not so much as one <note place="margin">In Mar. ho. 1.</note> place where he so calleth him.

these words of Saint Iohn Baptist. But how doe the Protestants rage so marueilouslie against him? The words of the Centuriastes be these: <hi>Similia, immo fere, &amp;c, The like, yea more superstitious things doth Chrisostome reporte of Monkes, and first he maketh Iohn Baptist Prince of al Monkes, in deede somewhat rashlie, and against the trueth of the thing.

The exercises or studies of his childhood and youth are not put in writing: Onelie Luke doth rehearse, that being a childe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the wildernesse, vntill the time of his open shewing, which is not to be vnderstoode of some denne, altogether seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred from the conuersation of men: as though he had lurked there like a beare, and an hater of mankinde, estranged from all humanitie, as in latter times Eremites, and such like men fained vnto them-selues superstitious seruice, but he was <note place="margin">Luc. 1. 65.</note> brought vp vnder the discipline of his parents, which dwelled in a place, lying in an hillie region, which was commonlie called the wildernesse: as we also speake in our vulgare lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. To dwell by the forest Hercinia, am hartzowonen, that is, to dwell in townes neere to the mountaines. So afterward he baptizeth in the wildernesse, that is, in places neere Iordane, where the mountaines are not farre of: and yet euerie where there were townes and villages.</hi> Thus it is plaine, that the Centuriastes do vnderstand by the wildernesse, not onelie a priuate life in his fathers house, but also his dwelling in the wildernesse. Except our answerer (perhaps) doth thinke, that as soone as Iohn Baptist was circumcised, he was cast out into a desert place, and not nourished in his fathers house, nor by them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in godlinesse. The words of Lake are plaine, Immediately <hi>after his circumcision. The childe grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and was in the desert places, vntill the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12222:44"/>
daie of his open shewing vnto Israel.</hi> by which desert pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if he will vnderstand none other, but a vaste wildernesse, void of all conuersation of men, he must needes place him there in his infancie by the text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could go, speake, or helpe him-selfe anie more, then a childe of eight daies olde. Againe, he must tel vs where this wildernesse was, into which Iohn was so translated: for the land of Israel, as it had manie wilde and solitarie places, as euerie countrie hath, yet had it no such wildernesse, as is imagined, but that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited with townes and villages, and the groundes thereof occupied and frequented. Finallie, he is mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie reade in the scriptures, which knoweth not, that the word <hi>desert</hi> often signifieth the countrie, as it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the citie, and frequence of men, and not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie a barren forsaken land, as the desert of Arabia, through which the children of Israell passed from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt to Canaan.</p>
                  <p>Now touching his apparell, how is it expounded by Protestants? The answerers wordes are these. <hi>And for his apparell (saie they) of Camells heare, it was not strange apparel, but vsuall to Mountain men, that is vndulata, saieth another, water-chamlet, handsome and decent, albeit somewhat plentifull in that countrie.</hi> For this is quoted, <hi>Marlorate in cap. 3. Mat. &amp; Chytraeus in cap. 3. Math.</hi> The wordes of Marlorate are these: <hi>Hoc Euangelista non memorat, &amp;c. The Euangelist doth not rehearse this among his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall vertues, that being addicted to a rude and austere forme oflife, he auoided euen meane and vsuall neatnes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cawse he had said before, that he was a man of the mountaines or wildernesse, now he addeth, that his victuals and his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell was agreeable to his dwelling. And this he reciteth, not onelie that we maie know, that he being content with rusticall victuals and apparell, sought after no delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but that in this base and contemptible habit, he was of great estimation, euen among them that were delicate and gallant.</hi> It satisficeth not the Papists, that he vsed a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12222:44"/>
garment of small price, and great hardnesse, except it were of a strange and disguised fashion, such as no man vsed the like. And therefore in stead of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of Camells heare, they cloth him in their Imagerie, with a camells skinne halfe naked, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the taile hanging betweene his leggs, as Hercules in his Lyons skinne is pourtraicted of the gentiles: although the expresse restimonies of the auncient writers are to the contrarie. Therefore the Centuriasts write thus ofhis apparel, to whome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our answerer would be referred, because his quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is before, <hi>&amp;c. Fuit &amp; vestitus &amp; victus ratio pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaris: His apparell, and manner of liuing was peculiar: which as in Prophets sometimes hath betokened the greatest matters, so also in this Iohn his garment was wouen of camells heare. Neither is it agreeable to trueth, thatraw hydesweere so ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, as some thinke, but he wore an vsuall kinde of garment, such as they were clad in, which dwelled in those hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie places, namelie base and rusticall, lest anie man should suspect, that he desired the greatest honours or the life of noble men, &amp;.</hi> Againe, <hi>Horridior quidem paulò, &amp;c. His garment of Camells heare was somewhat rough, but yet strong and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> You see these men acknowledge his garment to haue beene base, rusticall, and rough, farre from the daintinesse, and brauerie, that is commonlie desired in apparell, although they thinke it was vsuall vnto poore bowers of the countrie, that dwelled in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert mountaines, where he had his abode. But what is he, that saith his garment was of water-chamlet, handsome and decent, albeit somewhat plentifull in that countrie? Chytreus is noted on the 3. of Mathew, whose wordes are these: <hi>vestis Iohannis er at contexta ex pilis Cameli, similis ei quam hodie vulgo à camelis vocamus Kamelet, vel Shamlodt, Latinè vndulatum.

It was no filthie garment, nor againe veric precious, but meane, and decent, and in those places easie to be gotten.</hi> Let vs examine this saying, which soundeth moste like to our answerers charge. First, he saith not simplie, that it was water chamlet, but like vnto that, which is commonlie called chamlet, because it is made of the same stuffe, that is camels heare, yet differing much in finenesse, and price, as hempen sackcloth differeth from silke sackcloth, and yet is wouen like vnto it: or as course cloth of towe, differeth from fine holland and camebrike, and yet is made of the same flax, and wouen after the same manner. For of the fine and soft heares, of some cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Non de la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na camelina Chrysost. in opere imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. in 3.

Such one meaneth Chytraeus, that the garment of Saint Iohn was. That he saith, <hi>it was not a filthie, or ill shapen garment, but decent,</hi> he speaketh it against the grosse deuise of the Papists, which in their pictures, do apparell the Baptist, in a rawe camells skinne, and that not shaped to couer his bodie, but that his armes, and his legs are bate. <hi>Saint Hicrome in Marc.</hi> saith, that <hi>by the camels heares, the riches of the gentiles are signified.</hi> Euthinius vpon Marke also saith, that <hi>he was cloathed in camells heares, non simpliciter incompositis, not simplie disordered, but wouen together,</hi> which seemeth to argue, that although there weere no costlienesse, or delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, yet there was decencie and comehenesse in the apparell of Iohn Baptist.</p>
                  <p>Now commeth our answerer to his diet with these wordes: <hi>And lastlie, touching his diet of locusts and wild ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, it was no hard fare (saie they) for the locusts were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, cast awaie by the fishers of Iordane, as vncleane by the law, but eaten of Iohn by the libertie of the Gospell.</hi> First we will speake of the locusts, and afterwarde of the wilde

All these thinges tende to this ende, that it might be manifest, that neither Iohn nor Christ did seeke the Empires of this world, and that this simplicitie and austerine of life might testifie, that Christ is not to be receiued for corporall commodities of this life, which giueth freclie spirituall and eternall good thinges.</hi> The Magdeburgians doe here acknowledge a simplicitie, and austeritie of life: they doe not saie, it was no hard fare. But if they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret those locusts to be creuises, which are a delicate fishe with vs, it could not be hard fare, whatsoeuer they saie, as our answerer thinketh. Let vs then heare their owne wordes: but where shall we finde them? <hi>Cap. 4.</hi> which he quoteth, conteineth 50 great leaues, or more, which he that hath leysure maie reade ouer, and tell what he findeth to the purposeithe sixt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath euen as much, sauing that in it they saie, that, <hi>Albeit Iohn Baptist lined in the wildernesse by Iordane, yet was he no Monke, neither did he institute anie Monkish or solitarie kinde of liuing. For he tooke his iournie freelie about those places whether he would, and did preach the doctrine of Messias to the people, that flocked to him dailie.</hi> That which perteineh to this purpose of locusts, is in the tenth Chapter, where their wordes are these. <hi>Cibus erat mel siluestre, &amp;c. His meat was wilde honie, which the woodes neare hand did bring forth aboundantlie, as Samuel. 14. and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:12222:46"/>
locusts. But what manner of liuing thing this was, it is doubted among learned men. Some thinke it was a kinde of Crabbe, somewhat like the locusts in shape, which the Iewish fishers at Iordan did cast on the bankes, as meat forbidden by God. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. II. Such also are certaine Crabbes that are bred in the Sea, of meane bignes, hauing a shell armed with manie sharpe prickes, wanting armes, and hauing somewhat longer legges. If that be so, Iohn also did exercise an example of the libertie of the Gospell in that meat, which vsed fishes that were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, that all men might know, that this Lawe of Moses was now abrogated. Other vnderstand it of the land locuste, the eating whereof is expresselie permitted. Leuit. II. Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides, lib. 2. cap. 44. writeth, that there is a certaine kind of locust, which is called Asiracos or Onos, which the people called Aphei dwelling about Leptis, doe eate plentifullie. Plinius li. II. cap. 29. saith, that locusts are a pleasant meat vnto the Parthians, and that they are found in some places three foote long.</hi> It is manifest the Centuriaters do not affime that these locusts were creuises, but onelie they report the iudgement of some men that so thought, them-selues, rather allowing the common opinion, that they were land locusts, and in the end concluding, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoeuer you take it, these matters declared a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie and austeritie of his life. For admit they were fishes, yet to eate nothing, but such fishes, and wilde honie, though it were neuer so sweete honie, would be compted but hard fare of my Lord fatte Abbot, and his couent of Popish Monkes. And it appeareth by the testimonie of <hi>Plinie,</hi> that the land locusts are as pleasant in tast, as the shrimps or creuises. <hi>Saint <note place="margin">in Mat. 3.</note> Ierome</hi> vpon his diet noteth no more but this. <hi>Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori solitudinis, &amp;c. For an inhabitant of the wildernes, it is meete not to followe the daintines of meates, but to satisfie the necessitie of the humane flesh.</hi> A small repast to sustaine nature, though it be of pleasant meate, and alwaies the same, will prooue no delicacie in any man. The elder writets were not all agreed what these locusts
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12222:46"/>
were. <hi>Euthimius</hi> reporteth that some affirmed, that they were the stalkes of hearbs, some that they were a certaine herbe called locusts, and other that they were the insect or flying vermine. Yet he him-selfe holdeth the first. It is, I weene, no wrong interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sometimes to declare the diuers opinions of learned men, vpon matters whereof question may be: wherefore neither the Magdeburgians, nor Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treus, who reporteth the like opinion of the creuises, are to be charged with absurd interpretations, when either they leaue the matter to the readers iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or els they declare their owne, without preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of other.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the honie, our answerers words are these. <hi>And the wilde honie was noe vnpleasant thing, as the fathers doe imagine, but it was (saie Cossius and Strige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius) that pleasant Manna, which Apothecaries vse to keepe in their shoppes: so that according to these men, all that austeritie of life which the scriptures so particulerlie doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and all antiquitie doth wonder at, in Saint Ihon Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, commeth but to this, that he was brought vp priuatelie in his fathers house, cladde in Chamlet, and fed with creuises and sweet Manna. what great hardnes was this?</hi> First, where he saith, the fathers do imagine that the wilde honie was an vnpleasant thing, he bringeth none for proofe, neither doe I think he can bring in any more then <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimius,</hi>

But it is against all experience, that honie (though of wilde Bees) should be bitter or vnpleasant. Of honie that is <note place="margin">Plin.</note> poisonous, we haue read in them, that haue obserued the diuersities thereof, but not of bitter hony. And the moste auncient fathers rooke this wilde honie to be sweet, and pleasant in tast, and thereof gather allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, analogies, &amp; anagogies.

And he trulie did eate wilde honie, preaching that the people should be filled with honie out of the rocke, as it is written: he filled them with honie out of the rocke.</hi> Adde hereunto Cyrillus Hierosolymitanus, whose wordes are these. <hi>Thou seeft how excellent a man he hath chosen to be guide of this graet, possessing nothing at all, a louer of the wildernesse, but not voide of humanitie, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Catech. illust. min. 3.</note> locusts and preparing winges for the soule, eating honie and speaking thinges more sweete and profitable then honie.</hi> This testimonie is the rather to be noted, because this man, being Bishop of Ierusalem manie yeares, might easilie know, whether there were any bitter ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie made in the wildernesse about Iordan, where Iohn liued. But he acknowledgeth none but sweete honie. Beda also is a witnesse of good antiquitie, for the sweetenesse of the honie, that Iohn the Baptist did <note place="margin">In Marc. 1. lib. 1.</note> eate. <hi>Locustas &amp; mel siluestre edebat, quia dulce quidem, &amp;c. He did eate locusts and wilde honie, because his preaching sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured sweetelie vnto the multitude, while the people iudged, and all men thought in their hartes of him, whether he were
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12222:47"/>
not Christ. But this opinion soone had an ende, when his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers vnderstood, that he was not Christ, but the forerunner and Prophet of Christ. For in the honie there is sweetenesse, in the locusts swift flying; but some falling doune.</hi> Last of all, as latest in time, I will ioyne to these Theophilacte: who vppon Matthew sheweth, that wild honie is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that, which is made of wilde Bees, and is found in trees and rockes, which no man will suspect to be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But in the first of Marke he maketh the wilde hony to signifie the spirituall foode of the people, which is the scriptures, &amp;c.<hi>Quodammodo igitur &amp; mel. After a sort also the people did eate honie, which being made by the Bees, the Prophets, not gotten with any husbandrie, nor domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, which was well vnderstood, sought out and comprehended. The Hebrews truelie had the scriptures, as a kind of honie, but they did not husband them, nor search them.</hi> This cloude of witnesses doth prooue most euidentlie, that the greatest parte of the auncient fathers did not imagine that the wilde honie was vnpleasant of tast, as our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer would haue it be thought; but that it was as honie, naturallie sweete of it selfe, although the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall eating there of did make it not delectable, as experience sheweth, that the most daintic meate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten eaten, is lothsome. Now whether it were honie made of Bees, or dewhony, called in the Apothecaries shoppes <hi>Manna,</hi> it skilleth not much, seeing the one is as sweete as the other. But where our answerer citeth <hi>Cossius,</hi> either his notebooke deceiued him, orels good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man corrector was studying of his declension, when he should haue looked to his office, wherein he hath failed in quotation, three or foure times together. There is one <hi>Lossius</hi> in deed, who vpon Mar. 1. thinketh the wilde hony was this dew hony which falleth vpon the leaues of trees, and at this daie is brought from the countrie neere vnto Iordan. Chytreus and others thinke the same, citing <hi>Gallen. lib. 3. de alim. facult, and Diodor, Sicul. pag. 691.</hi> to shew the plentie of it in those
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12222:48"/>
partes. But what of this? doth <hi>Lossius</hi> hereof gather that it was no hard fare? his wordes are cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie in the same place. <hi>Describit Euangelista singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem continentiam, &amp; duritiem vitae Iohannis. The Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list doth describe</hi> (saith he) <hi>the singuler continencie, and hardnesse of the life of Iohn.</hi> Last of all, are <hi>Lossius, Strige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and the Protestantes of this time (thinke you) the first authors of this opinion, that wild honie is the dew honie vpon the leaues of trees? No verilie. For Ambrose (as we haue heard before) maketh mention of honie spreadde on the leaues of the woods. And <note place="margin">In3. mat. lib. 1.</note> Beda vpon Matthew is verie plaine that it was so. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro mel syluestre, folia sunt arboris, mirae dulcedinis, quod doctri nae Iohannis nimiam suauitatem ostendit.

a mournefull song: wherefore though his honie was sweete, and his locusts pleasant in eating, whether they were fish, the infect, or the herb so called, or the buds of trees, his course garment comelie, &amp; his education from the time of his circumcision, in rusticall houses, rather then in the open ayre, or in the dens of wilde beastes, yet was his bringing vp veric hard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining alwaies in the wildernes, and not in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or ciuill places, considering the nobilitie of his birth, being descended from the stocke of the high priestes, and allied vnto the famlie of the Kings: his apparrell rough and hearie, after the example of the olde Prophets, his dyet thinne and vnpleasant, not in respect of the ill tast of the thing he did eate, but of the continuall vse of them, without seeking of <note place="margin">Luc. 1.</note> varietie, and especiallie his great and often fasting, his perpetuall abstinencie from wine and strong drink, his dailie excercise of praier, and contemplation, when he was alone, his diligent and zealous prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and baptifing, when the multitudes came to him, his free and earnest rebuking of all mens sinnes, euen those that were greatest in credit, the Pharises, the Saduces, the high Priests, and the King him-selfe. All these ioyned together, are such arguments of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie and seueritie of life, as not onelie all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but all ages past, present, and to come, may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelie wonder at: as for the place, the garment, the dyet, be not matters of so great admiration of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, neither so wondred at of all antiquitie, as he bableth, not yet followed of his Mocke-monkes, and false Eremites, that either the wildernes is their dwelling, or the Camels heare their weede, or the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs and bitter honie their diet, or anie thing answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to these in hardnes. Their Monkes dwell in palaces, their Eremites in fine houses, neere to cities and great townes; their apparell, though in fashion disguised, yet neither rough, nor hearie, nor of smalest

price; their dyet like Princes, and noble men: the life of the greatest parte of them idle, and lasciuious. Therefore to their owne shame, they may account Ihon Baptist the Prince or first author of their Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish order, whome they follow as neare in austeritie of life, as they much come behind him in course of time. I trust all reasonable men may now vnderstand, what these vnlearned quarrels come vnto, when they be discussed and examined, howsoeuer they seeme to be bolstred out with impudent asseuerations, multitud of quotations, false cauillations, and vnnecessarie collections. In the rest therefore, I wil be more briefe, because my purpose is not to handle common places of controuersies at large; but shortlie to discouer the vanitie and pride of this answerer, and leaue such matters to other treatises, where they be fullie answered.</p>
                  <p>A third example he taketh, <hi>of our impertinent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, about the controuersie of the reall presence in the sacrament:</hi> which is nothing els, but a beggerlie cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of a matter still in question, which can beare no shew of of anie lawfull example, except it were cleere against vs, that our exposition were beside the text, or contrarie to it. But peraduenture this fellow will bring some new matter, that hath not beene heard of in this cause, to conuince vs of absurd interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. First he saith, <hi>they haue these wordes of scripture repeated in foure seuerall places: This is my bodie.</hi> If we <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 1. Cor. 11. Mat 26. Marc. 14.</note> did vtrerlie denic the sacrament to be the bodie of Christ in anie sense, it were somewhat that he saith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs: But we graunt it to be the bodie of Christ, in such sorte as Christ did meane, by those wordes. Contrariewise we shew the one part of the sacrament to be six times called <hi>bread,</hi> after the consecration, in the scripture, the other part, twise or thrise to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the fruite of the vine,</hi> yet your gare interpreters the Papists, do vtterlie denie the one to be bread, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12222:49"/>
to be wine in anie sense, but monstrous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible, and that against the iudgement of all antiquitie, and the plaine wordes of diuerse auncient doctours. But all antiquitie (to our answerer, a great antiquarie, as you shall sec by and by) are so cleere for the Popish reall presence, <hi>as no man might without great offence doubt thereof, as the wordes of Saint Ambrose and Saint Cyrill are.</hi> These bookes that he quoteth of <hi>lib. 4. de sacram. C. 5.</hi> for Ambrose, and <hi>Catech.</hi> 4. for Cyrill, are not so without controuersie acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be so auncient, as those fathers, whose names they beare: and yet they saie nothing in this cause, of not doubting, but we are readie to saie the same: Namelia, that Christ hauing said, <hi>this is my bodie,</hi> no man ought to doubt, but that it is his bodie. They haue also other wordes to declare, that their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not of the popish manner of presence, but the spirituall manner of eating of Christs flesh, where of the externall sacrament is a figure, and similitude: as <hi>Ambrose, de sacr. lib. 4. cap. 4. &amp; 5. de iis qui my ster: init: cap.</hi> 9. The same Cyrill also, though much to be suspected for his antiquitie, as verie latelie come into light, yet saith in the same place, that the bodie of Christ is to be receiued by fatih, <hi>not as the Capernaites imagined, which thought they had been prouoked to the cating of a mans flesh. But that same Cyrill,</hi> saith our answerer in another place, <hi>prooueth at large, that to aske onelie, quomodo, how it may be, is the parte of an vnbelecuing Iewe, &amp;</hi> quoteth <hi>lib. 4. in 10. cap.</hi> 13. In deed Cyrillus Alexandrinus affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and we subscribe vnto him, that to aske, how God can doe, that he said he wil doe, commeth of Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish incredulitie. He saith not, that it is a part of an vnbeleeuing Iewe, to ask how Christs words are to be vnderstood, figuratiuely, or properlie, carnallic, or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallie. Neither doth he speake in the place alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, of Christes reall presence in the sacrament, but of the question of the Iewes, how Christ could giue his
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:12222:50"/>
flesh to be eaten, which we beleeue verilie he doth, not one lie in the sacrament, but euen to infants, which neuer receiued that sacrament, or els we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from eternall life, according to his words, <hi>except ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his blood, you shall haue no life in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now you shall plainlie see, how skilfull this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer is in all antiquitie, whereof he talketh so often and so confidentlie (as bayard is alwaies the boldest horsse) <hi>The same Cyrill</hi> saith he (speaking of him vnder whose name are caried those my stagogical catechesis) <hi>is he that wrote vpon Iohns gospell, &amp;c.</hi> whereas the one was Bishop of Ierusalem in Palestine, the other of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria in Egypt: the one not much nearer in time to the other, then the prouinces where they were Bishops are in place. For Cyrill of Ierusalem was a verie olde man, in the time of the second generall Constantinopolitane councell. Cyrillus of Alexandria was president of the third generall councell of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the first: betweene which two Councels there was aboue fortie yeares distance in tyme. By which note of grosse ignorance, it is manifest, that this scorneful proude answerer hath neuer seene the workes of the one Cyrill, nor of the other, but one lie the quotations and collections of other men, which he vseth as vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinglie, as they were all of his owne reading: yea, if they be not pregnant inough for his purpose, he will make no bones to falsefie their sayings, cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to their meaning, as he dealeth with Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, whome he affirmeth to saie, <hi>That albeit the hoste see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to vs of arounde forme, and insensible, yet whosoeuer beleeueth it not to be the true bodie of Christ, is fallen from grace and saluation:</hi> whereas Epiphanius saieth expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, it is of a round shape, and insensible, as concerning power, and yet it is the same that Christ said it to be, &amp; we beleeue the same. The whol discourse of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in that place, is contrarie to the error of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12222:50"/>
presence; where he sheweth, that the sacrament is the Image of Christ, as man is the Image of God, though he be not equall with God, as the sacrament is not equall with Christ, but an insensible thing: yet neuerthelesse by grace is called, and beleeued to be that which Christ said of it. This saying of Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius do we allow, and vse as an inumcible argument against transsubstantiation, and the carnal manner of presence, as was well tried, when in the conference at the tower, it was opposed vnto your client Campi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who had nothing but vaine wordes to anoide it, being a place, which he neither vnderstood in the authors tongue, nor after it was expounded in English, could tell the argument, or occasion of it.</p>
                  <p>To the places cited out of Chrysostome I answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that albeit they be sometimes hyperbolicall, yet as he vnderstood them, and doth manie times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde him selfe, we confesse them to be true, and yet no carnall presence prooued by them, as <hi>In Mat. H.</hi> 83. which our answerer citeth in these wordes: <hi>Sed quoniam ille dixit, hoc est corpus meum, credamus, etiamsi sensui absurdem esse videatur. Because Christ hath said, this is my bodie, we must beleeue it, although it seeme absurd to our sense.</hi> The saying is good and catholike, but yet it is not altogether Chrysostomes, neither in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, nor in the <hi>Hom</hi> 60. <hi>ad Pop.

Ho.</hi> 83. of the translation of Trapezuntius, be these: <hi>Quoniam ergo ille dixit, hoc est corpus meum, nulla teneamur ambiguitate, sed credamus, &amp; oculis intellectus id perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciamus. Because then he hath said, this is my bodie, let vs not be holden with anie doubtfulnesse, but let vs beleeue, and behold it with the eies of vnderslanding.</hi> And <hi>ad pop. Antioch. Ho.</hi> 60. <hi>of Germanus Brixius translation, these are his wordes: Quoniam igitur verbum dicit, hoc est corpus meum, &amp; pareamus, &amp; credamus, &amp; intellectualibus ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum occulis intueamur.

This is the verie same bodie, whose blood was shed, and which was wounded with the speare, and which he carried vp with him.</hi> We graunt as much, that we receiue in the sacrament, the verie same bodie of Christ, that was crucified, wounded, dead, and caried into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, yet not comming downe to vs, but we (as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome saith in the same homelie) <hi>by faith made E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, and ascending vp into heauen,</hi> where Christ is: yet the wordes be not altogether, as our answerer citeth them, for immediatelie after the word <hi>vulneratum,</hi> followeth, <hi>Fontes sanguinis &amp; aquae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>To proceede, after these quotations, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the auncient Doctors, he commeth to his aduersaries, to shew how contrarie they are, in vnderstanding of this text of scripture, <hi>This is my bodie: they haue found out</hi> (saith he) <hi>a new exposition, affirming that it must be construed: this is onelie the signe of my bodie, for which they haue neither scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor auncient father, for warrant, or example.</hi> But which of your aduersaries (good sir) giueth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction? This is the signe of my bodie, some do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it, and for that, you maie haue warrant of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctors more then euer you read, if you durst denie it. but this is onelie the signe, by which you meane a bare signe, to exclude all true feeding vpon Christ in his supper, none of the Protestantes your aduersaries, did euer affirme. What Libertines, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, and other fantasticall heades haue ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:12222:51"/>
we haue nothing to doe with it, no more then with the eight seuerall expositions numbred by <hi>Luther,</hi> or those 84. gathered by <hi>Claudius de Xanctes:</hi> from all which we disclaime, and from all other, sauing from one, which is the true interpretation. And yet it is certaine, that <hi>Luther,</hi> an enemie to this trueth, strei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth much, &amp; Claudius ten times more, the words of the Christian Protestants, to so great numbers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations. Among whome if eighty more do vtter the same sense in diuers wordes, you will make no lesse then 80. interpretations. But because <hi>M. Chark</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth <hi>Luther</hi> to be illuminated singularlie by the holie ghost, and he is compared to Elias, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon phrase of all Protestants, our answerer taketh paines, to repeat diuers bitter sayings of his, against our interpretation of those wordes of Christ, <hi>as which he had reuealed to him by his holie spirite.</hi> A wife matter: as though <hi>Luther</hi> being singularly illuminated by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ghost, is made a Pope, by M Charke, that he can not erre in anie thing, or being compared by some Protestants, and in some respects (for it is a lowd lie that he is compared by al Protestantes) to Elias, may not be deceiued in anie point, as Eliashim-selfe was.</p>
                  <p>But doth our answerer, trow you, cite more true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie out of <hi>Luther,</hi> then he did of late out of the olde wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that we might thinke, perhaps he hath read the latter more diligentlie, although he hath beene litle conuersant in the former? I will giue you a taste, by one or two places. and first, that which he citeth out of <hi>Luthers epistle ad Argentinenses:</hi> wherein he clippeth and geldeth out diuerse wholl sentences, at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or rather as his note booke did lead him. So that it is plaine, he hath read no more in <hi>Luther,</hi> then in the auncient Doctors. The wordes are these. <hi>Hoc dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteri nec possum, nec volo, &amp;c. This can I not. nor will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but if Carlostadius, or anie manels, could for fiue yeares past haue persuaded me, that there had bene nothing in the

sacrament, but bread and wine, he should haue bound me to him, by a great good turne. For I haue taken great care, and anxietie, in discussing this matter, and haue endeuoured with all my power, and synowes siretched out, to ridde my selfe of the same.

But by our answerer he is charged with his honestie, as labouring to peruert the sacrament, thereby to hurt the Pope. Yet neither anie desire of peruerting the sacrament, or end of hurting the Pope is confessed in those words. For <hi>Luther</hi> laboured not to peruert the sacrament, but to finde out the trueth, if he might: not to hurt the Popes person, but to oueithrowe the papacie, which is the Kingdome of Antichrist: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he acknowledgeth, that his affection is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried sometimes on the one side, sometimes on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, contrarie to his persuasion. Wherein he is an honester man, to confesse his owne infirmitie, then the answerer is, to quarell and cauill with him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12222:52"/>
For the saying which he citeth out of his epistle <hi>ad Ioh. Heruagium,</hi> Printer of Argentine, he sendeth vs to seeke it in Gesners Bibliotheca, where is onelie the title at the moste: but where it is to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Luthers</hi> printed workes, neither he nor we can tell: and therefore how honestlie he hath dealt with it, I can not saie. But to this he ioyneth certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sentences of <hi>Luthers,</hi> taken out of a treatise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a defense of the wordes of the supper against the phanaticail spirits of sacramentaries: in which trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, it cannot be denied, but <hi>Luther,</hi> as he erred in the matter, so was he caried farre beyond the bondes of charitie, and modestie, in declaiming against the contrarie parte: yet not also much, as the answerer would haue men think, by falsifying his wordes, and mangling his sentence, after his vsuall manner. As in the first clause, he maketh <hi>Luther</hi> to saie, <hi>accursed be their char. tie and concord,</hi> where his wordes be, <hi>Illa cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas &amp; concordia, that charitie and concord,</hi> vnder pretense of which (as he vntruely gathered) gods trueth should be defaced.</p>
                  <p>The second sentence, in which he derideth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers expositiones of Carolostadius, Zuinglius, and Oecolampadius, more by happe, then by cunning, he hath hit vpon <hi>Luthers</hi> wordes, who yet els where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, that the interpretation of Zuinglius, and Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius came both to one end: As for Carolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stadius fantasie, is as much reiected of vs, as of <hi>Luther</hi> and the papists.</p>
                  <p>Now come we to the third place, wherein it is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long to shew the fooletie of this answerer, which wil take vpon him, out of another mans notebooke to set downe Luthers wordes, as though he had read the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe, euen as he plaieth with al other writers say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings almoste, that come thorough his fingers, olde &amp; new. Yet, to discouer his vaine pride, and to shame his fellow papists, that boast of his great learning,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12222:53"/>
and much reading, I will set forth the matter some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more at large: this is the answerers saying. p. 22. <hi>And againe in the same worke, he hath these wordes. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the wordes of Christ, as the sacramentaries do (this is the signe of my bodie) is as absurd an exposition, as if a man should interpret the scripture thus: In the beginning God made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, that is, the Cuckow did eate vp the titling or hedgesparow, together with her bones. Againe, in S. Iohn. And the word was made flesh, that is, a crooked staffe was made a kite.</hi> This saith the answerer: but in deede <hi>Luthers</hi> wordes are farre otherwise, and to another end, then to shew the absurditie of our exposition, although he haue the wordes of a Cuckow, and a crooked staffe, a titling, and a kite, as you shall see plainlie: <hi>Age verò, audiamus quo pacto verbis Christi, &amp;c. Goe too, let vs heare how they take awaie our sense from the wordes of Christ, and thrust in their owne. They affirme, that the word (is) is all one with the word (signifieth) as Zuinglius writeth. And the word (my bodie) is the same that (the signe of my bodie) as Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius writeth. The words therefore, and minde of Christ, after the text of Zuinglius, do sound thus: take ye, eat ye, this doth signifie my bodie. &amp; after the text of Oecolampadius, take ye, &amp; eate ye, this is the signe of my body. Now they are as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that these sentences are true, &amp; they do as stedfast lie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in them, in their hartes, as a reede is wont to do, being sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hither and thither of the winde, as I said. Therefore by and by they glorie, that we haue no testimonie of scripture, that the bodie of Christ is in the Lordes supper, but a litle while after, they humble them selues againe, and desire to be taught, and promise that they will followe vs, if we shall prooue by scripture, that the bodie of Christ is present in his supper. And truelie they doe a great and earnest matter: but the same thing commeth to passe, as if, when I had a litle before denied, that God created heauen and earth, and had subscribed to the opinion of Aristotle, Plinie, &amp; other ethnikes, of the eternitie of the world, and some man setting him-selfe against me, should bring forth that saying of Moses: In the beginning

God created heauen and earth, and I now to confute mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, should expound the wordes of Mosesthus: God, that is the Cuckow, created, that is deuoured, heauen and earth, that is the titling all and wholl together with the bones and fethers, and so should fayne this sentence of the wordes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: In the beginning the Cuckow deuoured the titling all and wholl together with the bones and feathers, and should vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie cast awaie that, In the beginning God created heauen and earth: would not this seeme to be a peece of cunning? Yet truelie, not vnworthie, nor vnknowne of Iesters. Also it should be like, as if I would denie the sonne of God, to be made man, to him that should laie against me that saying of Saint Ihon. 1. The word was made flesh: I would answere, the word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a crooked stafe, and flesh a kite; and the sentence is, a crooked stafe is made a kite. But if my conscience did reprooue me, and crie against me, Master Martyne, you expound the text too peeuishlie and crookedlie, but, &amp;c. and I should keepe in that (but) vntill shame died my cheekes with redde, and yet would say, fie on the false traytor, take awaie thy (but) &amp; holde thy peace, that no man euer perceiue, or smell out, that I haue so euill a conscience. And afterward should set forth my selfe lustilie, and clapping my handes together with full mouth should sing: Hei, how, the Christians haue not anie place of scripture, which affirmeth and prooueth that the word is made flesh. And yet at the last, I should submitte my selfe againe, and desire to be instructed and taught, how they could prooue it out of the scripture, which I before had rent in peeces.

So that the controuersie is still, betweene the true Catholikes and the Papists, which part prouoketh to the scriptures, in their true meaning, as the onelie sufficient rule to decide all controuersies of religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But which part alleadgeih the true meaning</hi> (saith our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer) <hi>according to the councell of wise Sisinius to Theodosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us the Emperour, we desire to be tried by the iudgement of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:12222:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
auncient fathers, indifferent in this matter, for that they liued before our controuersies came in question.</hi> This he saith, but as I haue prooued before, and namelie in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled of transsubstantiation, they will not stand to the iudgement of the auncient fathers, further then their Pope shal alow them. As for vs, we refuse not the iudgement of the most auncient fathers, except it be in such matters, wherein it is manifest by the plaine texts, and necessarie collections out of the scripture, that they were deceiued as euen the Papists will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse in some poyntes that they were. This wise Sisini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, whose counsell he would haue followed, was a wise heretike, whoe first gaue the aduise to Nectarius the Catholike Bishop, by whome it was commended to the Emperour, and had good successe against all other heresies, saue the heresie of the Nouatians, who by meanes hereof came in credit with the Emperour, and had free libertie to vse their conuenticles openlie. By which it appeareth, that it is no perfect kinde of triall, which was first offered by an heretike, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie he could not be conuicted of his heresie. Againe it was not vsed against the sufficiencie of the scripture, and the triall that maie be had therebie, but onelie to cutte of quarelous disputation of heretikes, which are alwaies more readie to contend, then to learne the truth. Last of all, where he saith, <hi>the auncient fathers are indifferent, for that they liued before our controuersies came in question,</hi> it is no sufficient argument, seeing the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers erred them-selues in some points, and no man is an indifferent iudge in that case, wherein he is deeeiued him-selfe. Againe, the auncient fathers are not all of one antiquitie, but commonlie the most auncient, the purest and furthest from all smacke of Antichristian errors; the later more sauouring of the infection of the times; drawing toward the apostasie. Euen as water, the nearer the spring, is purer, but running further of, through vnpure soyle, receiueth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12222:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some taste thereof. So the Councell of Sisinius in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the most auncient fathers, that were before the heresies of those times, was better to be vsed in his time, then in these daies, when they that liued fiue hundred yeares after Sisinius, maie be counted aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers in respect of vs, yet their iudgement not so weightie, nor so meete to be imbraced, as those first fathers of the primitiue Church, to whose iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if all matters of controuersie were referred, the Papists should get but small aduantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But our aduersaries</hi> (saith the answerer) <hi>will allow no exposition but their owne, wherebie it is easie to defeat, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is brought against them, scripture, or Doctor.</hi> In deede this which he saith, is moste true of the Papists, as I haue prooued before, but vntrue of vs: for we allowe all interpretations, that are not contrarie to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of faith, and are agreeable to the plaine words, &amp; necessarie circumstances of the place of scripture, &amp; not repugnant to anie other euident text of scripture. According to which rules, we must examine all expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of all men, since the Apostles time: yea the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles them-selues were content that their doctrine should be examined by the scriptures of the olde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament: but so are not the Papists: for they holde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, <note place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note> altogether beside the scriptures. But our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer, to iustifie that, which he hath saide against vs, bringeth examples of shifting scriptures and Doctors: all which (except one) are gathered out of diuerse writings of <hi>Doctor Fulke,</hi> for answere of which, seeing he hath set forth a speciall treatise, I referre the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells.</note> thereunto. <hi>pag.</hi> 38. 39. 40. That one example which he could father vpon no man, I will examine here. <hi>The like euasion</hi> (saith he) <hi>they haue, when we alleadge the wordes of Saint Paull, Qui matrimonio, &amp;c: he that ioyneth his virgin in mariage, doth well, and he that ioyneth her not, doth better. Whereof we inferre, that virginitie is more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and meritorious before God, then mariage, although
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12222:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mariage be holie. No saie our adversaries, Saint Paull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth onelie, that he doth better before men, and in respect of worldlie commmodities, but not before God.</hi> If you aske him, which of his aduersaries doe saie so, he is not able to name one: for in truth we neuer saide so, not thinke so. But that which he saith, they doe infer vpon the text, <hi>that virginitie is more meritorious before God, the mariage,</hi> we doe vtterlie denie, and we saie furthet, that all the Papists in the world shal neuer be able, by lawfull and true arguments, to infer so much, vpon these wordes of the text, or to iustifie this kinde of inferring; virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is better before God, <hi>ergo</hi> it is more meritorious. for the antecedent, which we graunt, doth not prooue the conclusion, which we denie. Therefore when out of the circumstances of the text he prooueth, that virginitie is better in respect of God, as a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gift of God, he taketh more paines then he needeth. For we confesse as much, that he that ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not his virgin doth better, not onelie in respecte of worldlie commodities, or before men: but also that shee maie be holie before the Lord, in bodie and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c. then he that ioyneth her in mariage: <hi>but that he doth better in respect of merite, &amp; reward in the life to come</hi> (as the answerer saith) it doth not follow thereof. I meane for the merite. As for the reward, which God bestoweth of his meere mercie, doth not prooue anie merite or desert of the partie rewarded. For he which vseth the gift of God well, by the power and strength which he hath of God, shall of Gods goodnesse, not misse of his reward; but he cannot therebie claime reward of dutie, or of merit; neither doth the text al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by him prooue any such thing: Some Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs <note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> haue gelded them-selues for the kingdome of heauen, therefore they haue deserued the kingdome of heauen therebie. Such licentious kinde of infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, will not onelie make poperie to stand, if it were lawfull, but also might be able to iustifie all heresies,

But Caluine (he saith) is reiected about the head of the Church in England, which is a manifest vntrueth: for Caluin is euen of the same iudgement, concerning the Princes authoritie in causes, &amp; ouer persons Ecclesiasticall (as is euident in his Institutions) that we are in England; onelie he misliked the terme <hi>supreme heade,</hi> as offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, though not euill, as it was vnderstood of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: and that terme is forborne in England, for the

same cause, and another of <hi>supreme gouernour</hi> vsed, which signifyeth as much, as was ment by the other, when it was rightlie vnderstoode. As for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church in Geneua, Caluine did neuer binde all other Churches to vse the same: what other pointes are reiected in Beza, he hath no leisure to tell vs. But that all the Churches of the Protestants, as he calleth vs, in Europe, do agree in the chiefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall articles of Religion, the <hi>Harmonie of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,</hi> latelie set forth in print, doth giue ful &amp; moste sufficient testimonie.

And some men maie haue their priuat opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, sometime perhapes vntrue yet retaining the vnitie of faith, in the chiefe grounds and foundation of Religion, with them that dissent from them, either iustlie or vniustlie. Wherefore our answerers finall conclusion doth not followe, that Protestants will haue onelie that to be taken for trueth, which they last agree vpon, and their wordes must be the one ie proofe thereof. whereas the worlde can testifye, that the holie scripture is our ground, and from thence we challenge the best proofe: not refusing any other lawful proofes, that wil stand with the iudgement of holie scripture, where it is most plaine, and easie to be vnderstoode, euen without anie interpretations.</p>
                  <p>The bookes of the scripture we receiue, which the Church of God, among the Iewes before Christ, and the moste auncient Church of the Gentiles since Christ, hath receiued and allowed: the sense we take euen out of the same bookes, and bring no foreine sense vnto them: all writtings of men olde and new, we examine according to the same, praising God for such helpe, as we haue by his giftes in them, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his word: yet leauing to them, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, such things as proceeded from them selues,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12222:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without the warrant of that worde: and this haue all true Catholikes alwaies done, and no heretike is able to doe, albeit he woulde professe neuer so much to doe.</p>
                  <p>To the former slaunders, our answerer will haue vs <hi>adioyne this, that our aduersaries</hi> (saith he) <hi>notwithstanding all request, sute, offer, or humble petition that we can make, will come to no publike disputation, or other indifferent and lawfull iudgement: but doe persecute, imprisone, torment, and slaughter them which offer the same.</hi> Touching anie law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful request, sute, or humble petition made in due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to them that haue authoritie to graunt, I neuer hard of anie, onelie the seditious challenge of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> is all the request, sute, offer, and humble petition, that he is able to prooue, was euer made by them, for anie such matter, before the publishing of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of his. As for them that persecute, imprisone, torment, and slaughter them which offer disputation, which he calleth their aduetsaries, it is well knowne, that <hi>Master Charke,</hi> and the ministers of the Church, are none such, neither haue they anie such authoritie. It remaineth then, that he accounteth the Prince, her councell, magistrates, and ministers of Iustice his aduersaries; who indeede haue good cause so to be, not onelie in respect of their heresyes, but also in regard of their manifolde, and almoste infinite pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises of treason, against the Prince and realme; for which, some of them haue suffered moste iustlie, and not for offering of disputation, as this traiterous here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, euerie where, moste slaunderouslie, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowe.</p>
                  <p>But nowe for their partes, he saith, they offere the best, surest, and easiest meanes that can be deuised, or that haue bene vsed in Gods Churches, for triall, and they are manie in number. The first is, <hi>the bookes of Scripture,</hi> receiued vpon the credit of the auncient Church, of which <hi>we are content</hi> (saith he) <hi>to accept for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12222:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
canonicall, and allowe all those, and none other, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie in Christendome hath agreed vpon.</hi> But this is false: for to omit that they receiue for canonicall, such as the Church of God before Christ neuer receiued, they receiue also such, as the greatest, and best an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie in Christendome receiued not: as the Church in Origens time, witnesse Eusebius, more then the <note place="margin">Hist. lib. 6. e. 18.</note> Church of Rome, receiued in <hi>Saint Ieromes,</hi> witnesse <hi>Ierome</hi> himselfe, <hi>prologo Galeato.</hi> and Ruffinus <hi>in Expos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>symb.</hi> more then the Councell of Laodicea did receiue for canonicall, as is manifest by the 59. canon.</p>
                  <p>The second way of trial, is <hi>the expresse &amp; plaine words of Scripture,</hi> wherein they must needs be farre superior: <hi>for what one expresse plaine text haue they</hi> (saith he) <hi>in anie one point or article against vs, which we doe not acknowledge liberallie, as they doe, and as the wordes doe lie?</hi> yes we haue manie, but a fewe shal serue: for example, God saith, Exod. 20. <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy selse anie grauen image, &amp;c. thou shalt not fall down to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor worship them.</hi> Againe Matt. 4. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onelie shalt thou serue:</hi> Which are moste plaine, expresse, and manifest against worshipping of Images, and other creatures, in anie vse of Religion. Christ saith, <hi>drinke ye all of this,</hi> they be expresse and manifest wordes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the popish sacriledge of the cuppe. The 14. to the Corinthians the first Epistle, is expresse and plaine against publike praiers, homilies, lessons in a straunge &amp; vnknowne tongue. 1.

And Heb. 13. <hi>Mariage is honourable in all men.</hi> And 1. Tim. 3. Tit. 1. <hi>a Bishop, Elder, or Deacon must be the husband of one wife,</hi> beside a great number more. <hi>But the papists</hi> (saith our answerer) <hi>haue infinit texts against vs, which we cannot admit without glosses, and fond interpretations of our owne.</hi> A bolde speach, as alwaies he vseth: but it shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be founde, that if we doe in anie text departe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12222:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the grammaticall sense, there is necessarie cause why: as if it be a figuratiue spcach, which is tried either by circumstances of the same place, or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther texts of scriptures, &amp; for the most parte, hath the iudgement of the most auncient writers agreing with our interpretation. But the most of these examples he bringeth, haue nothing in shewe, that the expresle wordes of scripture are with them, or against vs, but by their fonde, false, vnreasonable collections, and such as they can neuer conclude in lawful &amp; true syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logismes: as for example. <hi>We haue it</hi> (saith he) <hi>(for the supremacie) expresselie saide to Peter, that signifieth arocke, vpon this rock will I builde my Church.</hi> We answere, that we might followe the interpretation of the most auncient and approoued fathers, that the rocke here spoken of, is Christ, whom Peter confessed but graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, that they could neuer euict, we confesse that the Church is builded vpon the foundation of Peter the Apostle, but not vpon him alone, or more principallie, then vpon all the Apostles, who are all rockes, or stones, vpon whose foundation, as also vpon the foundation of the Prophets, the Church of Christ <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 20.

Rom. 4. 3.</note> but to declare vnto men, by the fruites of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that Abraham was a iust man: euen so by faith, the harlot Rahab perished not, with the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, when the receiued the spies in peace, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing them peaceablie, she was declared to be iust, or iustified in the sight of men. Therefore there are two kindes of iustification: the one by faith before
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12222:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
god, the other by works before men: therefore a man is not iustified by faith only, but by works also: which say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of S. Iamesis not repugnant to that we holde, that a man is iustified before god, <hi>sola fide,</hi> by faith alone, or <hi>by faith without the workes of the lawe,</hi> as S. Paule saieth, which is alone: which comprehendeth al good works, <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 28.</note> as also the examples of Abraham and Dauid, in the 4. Chapter to the Romanes, doc plainelie declare, where the Apostle speaketh expreslely of circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was a worke of obedience, following the faith of <hi>Abraham. And Dauid pronounceth the blessednes of a man, to whome the Lord imputeth righteousnes without workes:</hi> which <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 6.</note> must needes be vnderstood, euen of workes following faith, because Dauid speaketh of himselfe, and of all men generallie, that shall obtaine blessednes by the grace of god, without merite of workes. For, <hi>to him that worketh, reward is not imputed according to grace, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to debt.</hi> Againe, the Apostle writing to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 4.</note> which were faithful, speaketh generally. <hi>It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that by the lawe no man is iustified before god: for the iust shal liue by faith.</hi> By which texts, &amp; many more, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 11.</note> is moste necessarie, that before God, workes following faith, doe not iuslifie, but faith alone without workes: yet not a dead, but a liuing faith, which worketh by loue. <hi>Further</hi> (he saith) <hi>they haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presselie for absolution: whose sinnes ye forgiue, are forgiuen, whose sinnes ye retaine, are retained.</hi> Iohn. 20. <hi>but we haue no where, that Priests cannot forgiue, or retaine sinnes in earth.</hi> But the controuersie is not, whether the Ministers of God haue power to forgiue, or retaine sinnes; for we beleeue that they haue such power; but whether absolute power, properlie to forgiue sinnes, and how the same is to be exercised, is the question. For we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that God onelie hath power, absolutelie &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie, <note place="margin">Marc. 2. 7. Luc. 5. 21. Iob. 14. 5. Esa. 43. 12.</note> to remit sinnes, according to the scripture, man by declaring Gods will &amp; pleasure. <hi>Yet againe, they haue expresselie, The doers of the lawe shall be iustified.</hi> Rom. 2.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12222:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And we saie euen as much: but because none is found a doer of the lawe, we saie with the same Apostle, that <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 11.</note> it is manifest, that no man is iustified before God by the lawe. But our answerer inferreth moreouer, <hi>that we haue no where, that the law required at Christians hands is impossible, or that the doing therof iustifieth not Christians.</hi> yes we haue it expressely, <hi>That which was impossible of the law,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>in as much as it was weake by the flesh, God sending his sonne in the similitude of sinfull flesh, &amp;c. If there had beene a lawe giuen, that had bene able to giue life, righteousnes in deede had bene of the lawe. but the scripture hath concluded all vnder</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ga. 3. 21. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>sinne, that the promis by the faith of Iesus Christ might be giuen to them that belecue.</hi> Againe, <hi>by the workes of the lawe no flesh shalbe iustified before him:</hi> therefore no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> by the workes of the lawe shalbe iustified before him. Moreouer, <hi>we are saued by grace through faith, not of workes. Ergo</hi> Christians (for none els are saued) are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified through faith without workes. Yet againe, <hi>they haue expresselie,</hi> Psal. 75. <hi>Vowe ye, and render your vowes: we haut no where, vowe ye not, or if you haue vowed, breake your vowes.</hi> we confesse, the Prophet willeth the people to vowe, yet he meaneth onelie thinges lawfull, and in their power to performe: we bid no man to breake his vowe, if it be lawful and possible: but if he haue vowed to goe a pilgrimage, which is Idolatrie, or to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried, which is not able to liue continentlie: we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him to repent of his wicked, or vnaduised vowe, &amp; <note place="margin">Num. 30,</note> to serue God, as he hath appointed, or to vse the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie that God hath prouided. <hi>They haue againe expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi>

This prooueth not that the Apostles left any traditions, which are no where written in the holie scripture, because they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12222:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were not all written in the epistle of Saint Paul to the Thessalonians. But we haue expresselie, that the holie scriptures are able to make vs wise to saluation, to make the man of God perfect, and prepared to all <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 15.</note> good works: which things seing we haue fufficientlie in the holie scriptures, we neither regard, nor receiue any other doctrine vnder name of tradition of the Apo stles, or of Angels from heauen. Still <hi>they haue expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the commaundements: and (when he said he did that already) if thou wilt be perfect, go &amp; sel all thou hast, &amp; giue to the poore, &amp; follow me. And we haue no where, that either the commaundements of God cannot be kept, or that we are not bound vnto them, or that there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of life one perfecter then another.</hi> We graunt, that who so by good deeds will seeke to enter into life, as that yong man did, must doe the deedes of the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, which if he can doe, he shal liue by them: but albeit he boasted, that he had kept the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet it followeth not, that he did keepe them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, and as god required, but was a blinde hipocrite, and sought to iustifie him-selfe, according to the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie of the Pharisies. That we are not bound to keepe the commaundements, as neere as God will giue vs grace, is no article of ours, but a slaunder of his. Finallie, we denie that anie mortall mans life is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet we graunt, that some mens liues come neerer to perfection then other some. Neither doth our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours words include perfection, in selling his goodes, nor in giuing them to the poore: for if a man bestowe all his goodes, to feede the poore, and haue not loue, he is nothing: but he addeth, that he must followe Christ, and take vp his crosse: and so by Christs grace <note place="margin">I. Cor. 13.</note> he shal attaine vnto perfection, which he falselie ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that he he had obtained by a pharizaical obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation <note place="margin">Marc. 10.</note> of the lawe: this fauoreth not Monkes and friers, more then hipocrites, and liers. Beside this: <hi>They haue expresselie, worke your owne saluation with feare
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12222:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and tremhling, Phil. 2. we haue no where, either that a man can worke nothing toward his owne saluation, being holpen with the grace of God: or that a man should make it of his beliefe, that he shall be saued without all doubt or feare.</hi> The saying of Saint Paull we acknowledge, that men should <hi>worke out their owne saluation with feare and trembling:</hi> together with the next verse following: <hi>for</hi>

                     <hi>it is God that worketh in you, both to wil, and to be hable to do, for his owne good pleasure.</hi> whereupon we conclude that though a man is willed to worke his owne saluation, by walking in that waie, which god hath appointed for them that shalbe saued, yet he can doe nothing by his owne strength, but all that he doth, is of the grace of god: for <hi>by grace you are saued, through faith, &amp; that not of</hi>

                     <hi>your selues, it is the gift of God.</hi> To be short, we make not the grace of God an helper onelie, but a wholl doer and bringer to passe in vs of our saluation, and of all thinges tending thereto. For we are not apt of our selues, as of our selues, to thinke anie thing belonging thereto, but our aptnes is of God. <hi>Nor I,</hi> saith Saint Paul, <hi>but the grace of God which is with me.</hi> Againe, we <note place="margin">2.

But that a faith which is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, or voide of the workes of repentance, should be sufficient to saluation or Iustification, we doe vtterlie deny, as a thing contrary to the scriptures.

they haue expresselie, <hi>that euerie man shalbe saued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his workes.

To that he saieth, they <hi>haue expresselie praier and sacrifice for the dead in the second of the Maccaebees,</hi> We answer, that booke of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabes to be no holie Scripture, out of which he might haue expresselie a man commended for killing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. <hi>Whether Angels present good workes and almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes before God,</hi> and <hi>whether Saintes departed do praie for them that are aliue,</hi> which he gathereth out of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphal bookes of Tobie, and the Maccabes, we make

no question, as of matters not reuealed in the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall scriptures.

No man verilie. You see therefore that while he boasteth of expresse words of scripture against vs, he is driuen either to glose vpon the text, or to faine some opinion vnto vs, which we holde not at all, and that all his bragges are but winde and wordes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out matter, as of one that-fcareth no shame, because his heade is hidden.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third waie of triall is, necessarie collections, made and inferred vpon the scriptures:</hi> which we are willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and admitte, to be of as great authoritie, as the expresse words of the scripture. But to discerne, what is necessarie collection, and what is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie collection, when there is no expresse wordes of scripture, there is no certaine waie, but the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Logicke: for that onelie is necessarie colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which out of expresse words of scripture, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, or other groundes confessed to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarilie gathered out of the holie scripture, may be rightly concluded in a true and lawfull syllogisme: &amp; whatsoeuer cannot be so concluded, is no necessarie collection. But our answerer saith, <hi>we must referre our selues to the auncient primitiue Church, for this meaning:</hi> and his reason is, <hi>For it is like, they knew it best: for that they liued nearer to the writers thereof, then we doe, who could well declare vnto them, what was the meaning of the same:</hi> we doe willinglie yeald, to consult with the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent primitiue Church, to be holpen with their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12222:62"/>
but to admit all their collections without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining them, were to admit many errors, that euen the Papists doe condemne for errors, and which are reprooued by the scriptures them-selues. Let one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample serue in stead of manie. S. Ierome collecteth out of this scripture, <hi>It is good not to touch a woman, that therefore it is euill to touch a woman.</hi> Euerie man doth see that this is an vnnecessary collection; and so are many other in the auncient fathers writings. Wherefore we must vse the gift of knowledge of right gathering and concluding, which God hath giuen, not to be vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto his Church, but to be both beneficiall, and necessarie. Againe, marke the feeble reason, vpon which our answerer groundeth his saying: <hi>It is like they knew it best:</hi> he cannot say, it is necessarie that they knew it best: then how prooueth he, that it is like? <hi>because they liued neerer to the writers, then we doe, who could well declare the meaning vnto them.</hi> In deede if we had the writings of them that liued so neere vnto the Apostles, that they might heare their meaning of their owne mouthes, it were some likeliehood, and yet no necessarie proofe of necessarie collection; For Logicke would stil iudge, whether such meaning could be necessarilie gathered out of such wordes. Seeing we are not bound to creditte any writings, since the diuine inspired scriptures, but so farre, as they agree with the scriptures, and receiue the light of trueth from them. But those auncient writers, to whome he would haue vs to referre our selues, liued so many hun dred yeares after the Apostles, and Euangelists, the writers of the new testament, as they could no more declare to them, then to vs, their meaning in their writings: and therefore those auncient fathers, which ground purgatorie, prayer to saintes, sacrifice of the altar, vse of the crosse, &amp;c. (beside tradition) vpon the scriptures (as the answerer saith) must shew the necessarie collection of them, by the iudgement of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12222:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
seeing they neuer sawe the writers, neuer heard them speake, nor possiblie could, liuing so long after them, or els they can carie no credit of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie collection, outof the expresse wordes of holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. As for tradition, without scripture, since God hath giuen the holie scripture, is as good as the credit of men may be, without a warrant from God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A fourth waie of triall of spirites</hi> with him <hi>is, Councells, by which olde heretikes haue beene tried, and they are content to referre themselues to all the Christian Councells, that euer haue beene since Christ died.</hi> We acknowledge Christian councells to be a godlie meane to exa mine and trie the spirites, but according to the scriptures onelie, for matters of faith; as in the example of the first Councell of Christendome, Act. 15. where the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was determined by authoritie of the scriptures. But that the Papists dare abide the triall by al Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, it is false: for they admit none, but by the Popes consent, they admitte nothing in them, but that the present Pope doth allow. Many Councells in Aphrica forbad appellations to Rome: the general Councell of Chalcedon, made the Bishop of Constantinople of equal dignitie with the Bishop of Rome: the Bishop of Constantinople condemned and accursed a Pope sor an heretike: the Pope of that time confirmed it, yet now it is not holden for Catholike. But I will spare examples vntill this lustie gallant dare aduenture the triall, whereof he maketh the challenge. But seeing there are many points of controuersies betweene vs and the Papists, which in no auncient councell came in question, he bobs vs with <hi>the last most learned, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and generall Councell of Trent, which was gathered of purpose for triall of hercticall spirites, whereunto all safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct being offered, we refused to come for triall.</hi> As though the Catholikes would haue come to the Councell of Nice, if nothing might haue beene therein deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but that which pleased Arius; or to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:12222:63"/>
of Constantinople, if nothing might haue beene concluded, but that Macedonius would allow; Or to the Councells of Ephesus and Chalcedon, if when all had beene saide, that which liked Nestorius and Eutiches, must haue bene holden for Catholike. Such is our case, we accuse the Pope to be an heritike, yea and to be Antichrist: the Pope will admit no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, but where he him selfe is iudge: nor any to haue any voice determinatiue, but onely such as are sworne to maintaine his heresies and ambition. It is great pitie, but the Protestants must come to such a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Such were many councells holden of olde time by heretikes, but for the most part, not frequented by the Catholikes. Some of our profession were at Trent, but what entertainement had they? euen such as their aduersaries could afforde them: they were not permitted to haue any speach, but as pleased their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, wherefore when they saw noe equitie vsed, as they could looke for no better, before they came, they left the heretikes to consult among them-selues, by example of auncient fathers in like Chapters of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The sift waie of triall, is to referre the matter to the olde Doctors, which liued before the controuersies began,</hi> of which we haue spoken latelie, and this we haue often vsed, and still vse against the Papists, in most controuersies, although the authoritie of man is no certaine rule to trie, which is the truth of God. Augustine against Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian vsed this waie rightlie, first confuting the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians by the authoritie of the holie scripture, and then by the testimonie of the auncient fathers also. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius also in a case determined by the holie scripture, did politikelie circumuent the heretikes, after the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of Sisinius the Nouatian, by the suggestion of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarius the Catholike, to put them to a foile, which had good successe, because the others cause was naught. But Epiphanius hath a hard saying against vs
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12222:63"/>
(as our answerer thinketh) <hi>It is enough to say against all heresies, the catholike church hath not taught this, the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue not admitted this.</hi> But I wene Epiphanius doth, not meane, that it is enough to saie so, except men can prooue it to be so. For els it is aseasy for heretikes to saie so against Catholikes, as for Catholikes against heretikes. And here out answerer voucheth Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, quoting onelie, <hi>lib. 2. contra haere:</hi> but no Chapter of so long a booke: wherebie, knowing him to be a common foyster, we maie well suspect his honestie in this voucher, vntill he shew vs, in what Chapter we shall finde it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The sixtwaie of triall</hi> with him <hi>is, to consider which is the Catholike or vniuersall Church, or great multitude of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, out of which the other part first departed.</hi> But to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is the Catholike or vniuersal Church, is no waie of triall, but the matter to be tried. And the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription that he maketh of the Church, is as vncerten: <hi>the great multitud of Christians, out of which the other part first departed.</hi> For the Catholike Church is not alwaies the greatest multitude. When the East Church was deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the West, the one was as great a multitude, as the other; yea considering the number of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces of the East, and the largenesse of them, it was the greater. And one heresie some times departeth out of another, as the Rogatians from the Donatists, the Eunomians from the Arrians, the Iacobites from the Eutichians, &amp;c. Neither doth Saint Augustine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Manichecs, make the consent of people, and the name of Catholike, of them-selues, to be a sufficient waie of trial, but among many thinges, which altogether held him, beside the authoritie of <note place="margin">Cont. epist. Fund. cap. 4.</note> the holie scriptures, he accounteth these, which with the truth, are a good confirmation, but can be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice against the manifest truth, as he confesseth in the same place. To the iudgement of Vincentius we will subscribe, to holde that, which euerie where, which

alwaies, which of all hath beene beleeued: so hath no point of Poperie. <hi>Hoc est etenim verè propriè<expan>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But we beleeue</hi> (saith the answerer) <hi>with holie Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius in his creede: that he which holdeth not the faith whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in all points, shall perish eternallie: howsoeuer our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries doe salue the matter in their Prophets, Berengarius, Husse, Wicklife, and Luther, whome they saie to haue bene holie men, and yet to haue erred in diuerse pointes offaith, and to haue held their errors obstinatlie to the daie of their death.</hi> And we beleeue with holie Athanasius, that whoeso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer shall not holde that Catholike faith (which he, or whoesoeuer vnder his name setteth downe in that Symbole or creed) wholl and vndefiled, without doubt he shall perish eternallie. But not euerie one that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in any small point of doctrine or faith, which is not of the foundation of our religion. For so doth not Athanasius saie, and our aduersarie falsisieth both his wordes, and meaning, to drawe him to that sense of his. Now if <hi>Berengarius, Wicklife, Husse, Luther</hi> cannot be conuinced of any heresie contrarie to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius Creede (though they erred in other points) they are not subiect to his sentence of eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, more then Cyprian, Augustine, Hierome, whoe erred also in some points of doctrine, yet are rightlie accounted saints, and elect of God, as they which held the foundation, and all articles of faith necessarie to saluation.

saie, that <hi>Berengarius, Husse, &amp;c. did erre in diuerse points of faith,</hi> meaning thereby diuerse articles of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius Creede, he doth vs and them great iniury: for that we neither saie, nor thinke: neither saie we, that they did obstinatelie holde those errors, wherein they were deceiued, although they did stiflie holde them, not as heretikes which are condemned in their owne conscience, but as men deceiued with zeale of truth, euen in those points wherin they were deceiued. <hi>But we beleeue,</hi> saith he, <hi>the contrarie,</hi> by which beliefe he will condemne the best and most auncient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fathers, who, as men, helde euerie one of them, <note place="margin">Epiph. lib. 1. Tom. 2. in praefat. Epiph. H. 38 Epiph.

                  <p>But for the right vse of this triall, he requireth two conditions to be obserued: <hi>The first is, that the partie do in deede holde that which is obiected, and not a certaine like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood of it:</hi> in which point he chargeth vs to slaunder them with the heresie of Pelagius, concerning free will, who held, that men without the helpe of Gods grace, by the power and force of nature, could worke well, but they require that a man should be preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and holpen with the grace of God. In trueth we do not obiect vnto them, all articles of Pelagius heresie, but yet they are not free; for Pelagius held that by the power of nature men might keepe Gods
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12222:65"/>
law, but more easelie by the help of Gods grace: the, former the Papists holde not, but they holde the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that a man holpen with Gods grace, hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and power to keepe Gods law. Their doctrine also <hi>of merite ex congruo,</hi> of workes preparatorie before grace, and such like, are nothing els, but branches of the Pelagian heresie. <hi>The like iniurie,</hi> he saith, <hi>we do them, in objecting the heresie of those that did sacrifice to <note place="margin">Epiph. h. 79.</note> our Ladie, which they do not.</hi> A great iniurie, I promise you: the <hi>Collyridians</hi> offered cakes onelie to her, the Papists offer candels, ouches, and brouches, monie and Iewels: The <hi>Collyridians</hi> did garnish a charret where her Image was, the Papists adorne taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (as they call them) yea chappels, altars, and Churches, to worship her: Epiphanius condemneth the studie of making her Image, and the Images of dead saints, as a deuellish attempt. He inueigheth most seuerelie, against the worshipping of the virgine Marie, of Angels, and of saintes departed, yetall this is Catholike among the Papists, and we offer them iniurie, to charge them with this olde heresie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not offer cakes, as the Collyridians did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The second condition is, that the heresie obiected, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted &amp; condemned for an heresy in the Primitiue Church, &amp; not onelie held by an heretike: for heretikes held manie trueths together with their heresies.</hi> And here he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth <hi>that Doctor Fulke doth them wrong, in saying that praiers for the dead, is an heresie, because the Montanistes, which were heretikes, did holde it.</hi> But he rather doth offer manifest wrong to Doctor Fulke, whovseth not <note place="margin">Pag. 41.</note> to reason so looselie: But rather concludeth that prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the dead is an error, because it was first inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and practized by an heretike. For all trueth hath an higher and more auncient spring, then anie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike or heresie. But for so much as he hath answered this wholl obiection sufficientlie, in his confutation of Popish quarrells, I will send the reader thither,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:12222:66"/>
where he shall finde, that which maie satisfie him in this matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The last kinde of triall, whereof he will speake at this time, is to consider the manner of olde heretikes, and to compare the same with ours. And here he would haue the two former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions obserued; To wit, that we consider such qualities one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as were accounted hereticall in them, and to examine them truelie in our selues.</hi> The maners of heretikes, is no sure way of trial: for heretikes come often times in sheepes clothing, pretending greater holinesse in conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then true Catholikes do. But let vs see how he will prooue vs heretikes, by this kinde oftriall. <hi>For example,</hi> saith he, <hi>Saint Augustine, doth note it, as an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retcall propertie in the Donatistes, to hate the sea of Rome, and to call it the chaire of pesttlence. Doth this agree to the Protestants, or to vs? as also defaming of the said sea for the <note place="margin">Cont. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For Petilian did not hate the sea of Rome, as the sea of Antichrist: For the Donatistes had their mock-Bishop at Rome also. But he railed vpon all the chaires or sees of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Bishops, and on the Bishops them selues, that were not of his schisme and heresie; and on the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike chaire of Ierusalem, as wel as on that of Rome. Againe, the Donatistes called the chaire of Rome the chaire of pestilence, when it was the chaire of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Bishop: we call it the chaire of pestilence, now that it is the seat of the beast, and great whore of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon, <note place="margin">Esa. 1.</note> Antichrist. As Esay calleth Ierusalem <hi>an harlot,</hi> which yet sometime had bene a faithful citie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the example of the Donatistes maketh nothing against vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another hereticall tricke Augustine noteth in them, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade the people, that the visibie Church had erred &amp; oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the true Church, banishing her from the sight of the world. Doe not our aduersaries,</hi> saith the answerer, <hi>saie the verie same.</hi> No sir, we haue nothing to doe with the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:12222:66"/>
whome the Papists doe resemble, more then <note place="margin">De<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnitat. eccles. c. 12.</note> we. For in the place quoted, there is no talke ofthe visible Church, as you note in your example. But this is the matter. The Donastites affirmed, that the Church was vtterlie lost in all other partes of the worlde, and remained onely in Africa, and in the part of Donatus. So the Papists affirme, that the Church was lost in all other partes of the world, and remained onelie in Europe, and in the part of the pope. But we holde, that the Catholike Church of Christ is dispersed ouer all the wholl world, where the name of Christ is called vpon, as Saint Augustine in the same place sheweth out of the scripture, that it must be euen among them, that either know not, or els acknowledge not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Romes authoritie. That he chargeth vs, for condemning all the Church for the faultes of some, as the Donatists did, we do not. But rather the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer faulteth herein, with the Donatistes, who vpon shamefull slaunders, inuented to deface the godlie life, of <hi>Luther, Caluine, Beza,</hi> and such like, laboureth to bring the trueth of their Doctrine in discredite, as the Donatistes did, by charging the Bishop of Carthage, and others with treason against <note place="margin">Cont. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In the epistle to <hi>Eusebius, he complaineth of one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, which sometime had beene a Subdeacon of the Church of Sanianum, who when he was forbidden to haue such accesse vnto the nunnes, as was against the discipline, and despised or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlie and wholsome precepts, he was remooued from the cleargie, and being him-selfe stirred vp against the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of God, he remoued him selfe vnto them, and was rebaptized. Also two nunnes with their tenants, out of the ground of the Catholike Christians, whether the same man remooued, or whether they followed him them selues, yet were they rebaptized, and were with the flockes of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellions, among the wandring flockes of women, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would haue no husbands, lest they should haue discipline. The proud fellow boasteth him-selfe in the madde banquets of detestable drunkennesse, reioycing that a moste broad license of naughtie conuersation is opened vnto him, from whence in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:12222:67"/>
the Catholike Church he was prohibited.</hi> Here is neither the hatred, and condemning of Monkes liues, nor drawing of nunnes out of cloistures, nor ioyning them in pretended wedlock, noted in the Donatists. But two light nunnes, by a quondam clearke, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaied by their consent, or following him out of the ground of Christian Catholikes, into the sect and groundes occupied by the Donatistes, &amp;c. In the same epistle also, he speaketh of the daughter of a certaine tenant of the Church, that was caried awaie by the Donatists, against her parents will, so that she was among them baptized, and tooke vpon her the forme of a Nunne, whome her father would by force and stripes haue compelled to returne to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, but he was forbidden by S. Augustine to vse such force, if she would not come with a good will. This maie touch Papistes also, which haue and do professe nunnes, monkes, and Priestes, yong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discret persons, against the consent of their parentes; but how it should be applied against vs, I cannot see. But here the notebooke was to blame, to quote these places, for such purposes: the answerer, I hope, is not so impudent, that if he had read the places him-selfe he would for shame haue noted them against vs, or els haue added as he doth. <hi>Finally, he noteth it as heretical in the Arrians, to appeall from traditions to onelie scripture lib. 1. Contra Maximinum.</hi> In all which booke there is no such matter: for neither doth Maximinus appeale from traditions, neither is he noted for so doing, by Saint Augustine. In deede he often times boasteth of the authoritie of holie scriptures, and in that conference, he manie times calleth for testimonies of holie-scripture, and professeth that he is, &amp; wilbe a disciple of the holie scriptures. But for this, he is not reproued of Saint Augustine, but still pressed with the authoritie of holie scriptures, whereof he falselie boasted, and when he doth but once call to witnes
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12222:68"/>
                     <hi>the councell of Ariminum.</hi> Saint Augustine in his answer, telleth him plainlie, <hi>that he ought not to alleadge with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie preiudice that Councell against him, as neither him selfe the Councell of Nice against the Arrians, but requireth that <note place="margin">Cont.

                  <p>
                     <hi>But Optatus before Saint Augustine</hi> (saith he) <hi>noted it as hereticall in the Donatistes, to breake altars, whereupon <note place="margin">Optatus. Con. Donat. lib. 6.</note> the bodie and blood of Christ were kept, as the wordes of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus are.</hi> You must vnderstand, that these altars were communion tables, made of wood and remooueable, couered with a linnen cloth in the time of celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which, in spite of Catholike Religion, some they brake, and some they seraped onelie: for which follie they are derided by Optatus. So plaied the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes with the communion tables in the beginning of Queene Maries raigne, calling them in despite <hi>oister bordes,</hi> and breaking them with as great furie, and without lawfull authoritie, as the Donatistes did. The like parts they plaied with the communion cups, of which he also complaineth, as also challenging to them-selues the Church yeardes, that the bodies of the Catholikes, might not be buried in them. So did the Papists in Queene Maries time. <hi>But the wordes of Optatus are</hi> (saith our answerer) <hi>that the bodie and blood of Christ were kept vpon those altars.</hi> He would haue vs thinke that the sacrament of the altar was kept in a pixe, as among the Papistes. But the wordes of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12222:68"/>
Optatus are not so. For albeit he calleth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion table an altar, as it was commonlie called at that time, yet he saith not, that the bodie and blood of Christ was kept vpon it: his wordes are: <hi>quid est enim altare, nisi sedes, &amp; corporis &amp; sanguinis Christi? For what is the altar, but the seat, both of the bodie and blood of Christ?</hi> And lest you should thinke that it was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent seat, wherein the sacrament was kept, as it is among the Papistes, he saith further, speaking of the breaking, and scraping of these wooden altars; <hi>Quid vos offenderat Christus, cuius illic per certa momenta corpus &amp; sanguis habitabat? what had Christ offended you, whose bodie and blood at certaine moments of time did dwell there?</hi> By which wordes he sheweth, that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bodie and blood of Christ, taried no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there, then vntil the time of the distribution of the same vnto the communicants. As for breaking downe of Idolatrous altars, and prophaning of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes belonging to them, we haue the word of God as a sufficient warrant, so that we cannot iustlie <note place="margin">Deut. 7. 5.</note> be likened to the Vandales, that were Arrians, or to Iulian the Apostata, which defaced the Religion of the Christians, so long as our Religion, by the scriptures, can not be conuinced of heresie, or Apostasie. For as heretikes and ethnikes destroied the Religion of Christ, with the places and instruments vsed in the exercise thereof, so did the Christians serue the Tempells of Idolls, and all other monuments of gentilitie, and heresie. The Papists do no more spare our holie Bibles, then we do their prophane bables. They breake our tables and cuppes, as we do their altars, and challices: they burne our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as we doe their Idolls. Finallie, it is the Religion that must iustifie, or condemne these actions: the actions are no sufficient trial of the trueth of Religon.</p>
                  <p>Here againe <hi>he appealeth to publike disputation, or to any

other indifferent waie of triall, that we dare afford him.</hi> As for publike disputation, we dare, if the Magistrates thinke it conuenient: but a most in different waie of triall, by writing their arguments in syllogismes, Doctor Fulke offered for certaine yeares agoe, before <hi>Campian</hi> crept forth with his seditious challenge: the offer still remaineth, take vp his gloue, you Papists, if ye dare.

The causes that he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of setting downe his proud censure, might seeme somewhat probable, if he had set downe <hi>Master Charks</hi> replie also.

Hamner,</hi> he saieth that he hath brought more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with his wordes, then the Censurer will be able to answer. But that is not the Censurers purpose, in respect of the desired disputation, and the disired disputation is a seditions challenge, as hath beene plainlie prooued. For otherwise, what arguments so euer for your parte haue beene brought by the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, haue bene by <hi>Master Charke, &amp; Master Hanmer,</hi> fullie answered: which is a sufficient acceptation of disputation offered (if no surther matters were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) and a more profitable kinde of disputation, then that you desire, the printed bookes extending far and neere, &amp; carying a certaine and vndoubted rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well of the argumentes, as of the answers: whereas in your desired disputation, it may well be thought, that you hoped to triumph rather in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of boasting wordes, to be vttered with impudent audacity by your brabling sophisters, and in the false reportes, spread by your lying sicophants, then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine anie victorie by sound arguments, or sufficient answeres: which thing wel appeared in the disputation that was graunted to <hi>Campian,</hi> and other of your sect, with <hi>Master Charke</hi> and the rest of the Godlie learned, that had conference with them.</p>
                  <p>But now because of that which <hi>Master Charke</hi> hath saide of <hi>Master Hanmer, bringing matter with his wordes,</hi> you will binde him to defend euerie syllable in <hi>Master Hanmers</hi> booke, &amp; are not ashamed to charge him <hi>that he will needes take vpon him the auochement of Master Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers doings,</hi> with what reason, euery man that hath but a crum of reason, may iudge. Therfore such matters as you require <hi>Master Charke</hi> to answere for, he maie if he thinke good in his next writing, satisfie your request, although he haue by no promise bounde him-selfe thereto, and <hi>Master Hanmer</hi> is sufficient to answere for him selfe, and therfore by me they shal be passed ouer with silence, being but quarrells and cauills, what the

                  <p>Although the same briefe kinde of declaring the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Master Charkes</hi> booke, doth not satisfie your minde, and therefore you passe ouer his replie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination, promising to verifie all that you haue saide and he denieth, in their particuler places, because in deede <hi>M.

                  <p>Touching the order, and diuision of the booke, that you will needes make, we must be content to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you, although no wise man doubteth (whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you pretend to the contrarie) but it had beene more easie both for your selfe, and for the replier, of whome you would seeme to haue a friendlie care, and moste of all for the vnderstanding of the reader, that you had followed Master Charke from point to point, ashe followed Campians challenge, if your bad cause could haue abidden the light of so cleare a method.

                     <p>YOu would conuince <hi>Master Charke</hi> of rayling, by his owne confession, because he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his labour imployed in certaine vehement spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, by you gathered together, to bring the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites in discredit, <hi>whose infections are well knowne abroade, and are now entred to worke treason in the land.</hi> Also, because he graunteth the speaches, which in all hatred of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish practizes, <hi>so directlie attempted against the maiestie of God, and the peace of this noble kingdome,</hi> he vttered, in diuerse places of his answere. But if you had not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the reasons, which he setteth downe, of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, and graunting of those vehement spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they had beene sufficient in any reasonable mans opinion, to discharge him out of that crime of rayling. For you your selfe confesse afterward, that euerie hotte word, vttered in Catholike bookes, by occasion of matter, is not to be taken for rayling. Now <hi>Master Charke</hi> standeth to the defence of his booke, to be Christian and Catholike, and him-felfe to be a true member, and Minister of the Catholike Church of Christ, and for occasion of matter, he alledgeth <hi>the infections of the Iesuites, well knowne abroad, and their late
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12222:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
entrie to worke treason in the land:</hi> Also those Popish pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, against which he vttered those speaches, <hi>to be directlie attempted against the Maiestie of God and the peace of this noble kingdome,</hi> so that such sharpe speaches (and yet but sparinglie vttered, in comparison of so many reproches, as you haue belched out against him and our religion) are not to be charged with the preiudice of rayling, neither in regard of the person, whoe did vse them, or of the matter, that did occasion them. At the least wise, vntill you had disprooued him to be a Catholike, or discharged your Iesuites of the crimes of heresie and treason, intended against them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he with slaunder deuised against their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (as the manner of the Papists is) seeke to discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditte their doctrine, but in detestation of their false doctrine, attribute such termes vnto the men, as for their doctrines sake they deserue.</p>
                     <p>But you are gratious to graunt him pardon, <hi>for that he confesseth hatred to haue beene the cause:</hi> as though ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, not of the persons, whome he wisheth to repent vnto saluation, but of the practizes, which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be against God, and the peace of the realme, may not be a iust cause of more vehement inuectiues, then he hath anie expressed. And yet you <hi>see not how any learned, or common honest man, and much lesse a preacher, can iustifie such vnciuill and outragious termes against his brother, by any pretence of Christianlike or tollerable hatred.</hi> I will not say how mány foule re proches be included in this one sentence, taking it according to your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: for I will graunt that you saie to be true, if it may be vnderstoode, of him that is a brother in deede. But that Iesuites are brethren to <hi>Master Charke,</hi> and such preachers as he is, I thinke neither the Iesuites, nor you your selfe (if you be demaunded, when you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake) will acknowledge. Therefore being such as <hi>M. Charke</hi> had before described them by their infections, treasons, practizes against God and the realme, he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:12222:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                     <p>The turning backe of the crime of railyng, which he vseth vnto you, was not for any excuse of the crime committed by him selfe, for he doth not at all excuse, but iustifie &amp; defend those speaches (which you cal <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>) as fit words against the wicked Monkish fryers, or fryerlie Monks, affirming, that if he were disposed to place your ordinary and extraordinary rayling in a ranke, he might gather of your reproches, <hi>more then can come into ten leaues:</hi> but this you saie is neither to the purpose, nor trewe: not to the purpose, because you were prouoked by his example, and iniurie, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan without example: He might answere you, that he began not with you, but you with him: neither did he prouoke you by any priuate iniurie, but if you count the cause of the Iesuites to pertaine vnto you, as a publike iniurie, then iudge in differentlie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the heresies and treasons of the Iesuites, doe not minister iust cause to him, of his hatred, and bitter speaches against them.</p>
                     <p>But that he could gather ten leaues of your ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, you say it is a licentious lie: For as Printers count leaues (that is wholl sheetes) there are but halfe ten in your booke, and albeit they be counted as they are folded, yet ten leaues are a greater part thereof, then can be filled with rayling termes onelie. So you saie and seeme to saie somewhat to your purpose; but <hi>Master Charke</hi> hauing tolde you before (vnto which your silence may stand for a confession) that <hi>almost eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie line soundeth loud with some foull reproch,</hi> who cannot see that it were easie to gather almost out of euerie line so many foull reproches, as would fill more then ten of your folded leaues. For of Printers large count, no reasonable man would vnderstand him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you would allow him also, to make as large let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and as fewe lines, as Printers sometimes vse to

                     <p>But this matter you may not <hi>so soone passe ouer, for that you thinke it of importance, to descrie she spirites of vs, that are aduersaries in this case.</hi> Rayling in deed is a fault, in whomsoeuer it be found: but it had beene requisite, that you had first defined what is rayling, that we might haue agreed vpon the matter in question. You tell vs afterward, what is not rayling, <hi>namelie, euerie hotte word, vttered in Catholike bookes, by occasion of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is not railing, nor the thing in question: for both Christ &amp; his Apostles, and many holy fathers aster them, vsed the same sometimes vpon inst zeale, especially against heretiks.</hi> So that vntilyou haue prooued Protestants to be noe true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, &amp; discharged papists from being heretikes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie hotte worde in our bookes, vttered against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, can not iustlie be accompted railing. Naie, if Catholikes by heate of zeale in a iust cause, or in a case that they thinke to be iust, be caried somtimes in vehemencie of speech beyond the bandes of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, as they maie be iustlie reprooued therefore, so they maie not straightwaie be condemned for heresie in so doing. Iames and Iohn were so farre deceiued with zeale, and in a cause that they thought to be cleare, and iust, that they would haue praied, that fire might come downe from heauen, by example of Helias, and destroy the Samaritanes, that resused to <note place="margin">Luk. 9.</note> receiue their master Christ, and were otherwise here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, for which they weere reprooued, but yet as they which knew not, or had forgotten of what spirit they were, yet not by and by reiected for heretikes.

                     <p>But it is good to examine your reason, by which you would prooue railing to be proper vnto <hi>gospellers</hi> (as you terme them) <hi>and thereby easilie take a scantling of the diuersitie of their spirits from Popish Catholikes.</hi> First, <hi>the mouth speaketh according to the aboundance of the heart,</hi> which is trew, in such sense, as it is spoken of by our Sauiour Christ: for wickednesse is first bred in the heart, before it breake forth of the mouth: but it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not thereof, that you conclude, when you saie, <hi>I meane a man maie be knowne by his speach:</hi> for then the wickednes of euerie hypocrite might appeare by his talke, which is vntrue. <hi>But Saint Peter said vnto

Simon Magus, vpon his onelie speech</hi> (saie you) <hi>I see thee to be in the verie gall of bitternes, &amp;c.</hi> yet was it no rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling speech, which Simon Magus vttered, nor dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled speech: for he plainlie professed, that he was desirous to buie the gift of the holie ghost; and last of al, it was not onelie speach: for the text saith, <hi>he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>mony</hi> for his march andise: for otherwise his onelie words, as they are reported by Saint Luke, were not sufficient to discouer so great wickednes of his heart: <hi>giue vnto me also this power, that vpon whomsoeuer I laie my handes, he maie receiue the holie ghost:</hi> it might haue bene thought, vpon this onelie speech, that Simon latelie baptized, was desirous to haue beene a Minister of the dispensation of the holie ghost, to the benefit of gods Church, by the graunt of the Apostles, if he had not profered monie also, by which his couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and other wicked blasphemous opinions of the holie ghost, were plainlie discouered. You shew your selfe therefore to be a man mightie in the scriptures, that can bring no better example or proofe, that one, by his onelie speech sometime, maie be sufficientlie conuicted, of the wickednes of his hart, then this of Peter, and Simon Magus; where onelie speech was not vsed, and the speech that was vsed, was not of it selfe able to discouer the heart of him that spake. In matters of greater controuersie betwixt vs, perhaps you are better exercised, or els we are like to finde feeble arguments on your behalfe. To proceede, you saie, <hi>the scripture is plaine in this point.</hi> what point? that a man maie be knowne <hi>alwaies</hi> by his speech: for that he maie <hi>sometime</hi> thereby be abundantlie conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, we doubt not. well, what saith the scripture? <hi>he</hi>

perfect, so that they neuer offended, no not in wordes; or that in whomesoeuer appeereth anie thing, which proceedeth not from the spirite of Christ (as in the best there do manie things) they are therefore to be iudged void of the spirit of Christ. And therefore we maie see what sound diuinitie you teach, and how well you vnderstand the scriptures, vpon which you conclude as followeth: <hi>Now then if we consider the quiet, calme, and sober spirit of Christ, and of all godlie Christians from the beginning, and the furious, reprochfull, and vnclean spirit of Sathan, and all heretikes from time to time, and do compare them with the writings of both partes at this daie, we maie easilie take ascantling of the diuersitie of their spirites.</hi> Verilie it shall be found as hard a matter, as it was before you made this demonstration. for notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we acknowledge the quiet, calme, and sober spirit of Christ and Christians, yet you confesse, and the scripture is plentifull, to prooue, that Christ and his Apostles against the wicked and obstinate enemies of the trueth, vsed most hott, vehement, and sharpe speeches, and they which haue trueth on their side maie vse the like in like causes, by their examples: So that by vehemencie of speech, the cause can not so easilie be discerned, neither is your scantling right to be taken thereby. Those kinde of speaches, for the moste parte, are to be accompted furious, reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and vncleane, which are vttered of malice against the trueth, when the same being spoken of zeale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst falsehood, maie wel stand with the quiet, calme and sober spirit of Christ. Yet are there also certaine vncleane, reprochfull and scurrilous speaches, which serue not so much to describe falsehood and sinne, to the detestation thereof, as they seeme of them-selues to bewraie the hatred, and intemperate heate of them that vse them against the persons of other; and these in no case are commendable, but to be reprooued, whether they be found in Papistes, or Protestantes,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:12222:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as neither of both perhapsmaie be cleerelie excused of this falt. By this it may be gathered what railing is properlie, not euery hot worde (as you saie) but such as are vsed in an euill cause against trueth &amp; iustice, of malice commonlie, sometime of immoderate zeale, &amp; such as be offensiue, in what cause soeuer, or of what zeale soeuer they be vsed, and such railing I dare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch you shall not be able to prooue, that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Protestantes, no nor to heretikes. For there be heretikes which not with railinges, and reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full speeches, make diuisions in the Church, beside the Doctrine of Christ, but with faire, smooth, &amp; flate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> talke deceiue the harts of the simple: therfore rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not a proper, and perpetuall note of heretikes.</p>
                     <p>Now as concerning your examples, first you begin with <hi>Master Charke,</hi> asking <hi>what more venemous wordes can be imagined then these of scorpions, poysoned spiders, and the like vsed by Master Charke against reuerend men.</hi> Here except you can first discharge your Iesuites of herisie, and treason, the wordes of scorpions, and venemous spiders, are no railing termes, but apt to expresse their venemous and poisonous practises: for they are vsed in scripture to describe the like mischeuous workes, as Apocal. 9. Esa. 59. 5. The rest of his speaches, haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the same, or the like phrases iustified in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, against corrupters of Religion, and enimies of publike peace, as we shewe your Iesuites to be, for the former, and their practises, to the confusion of some of them, haue beene discouered for the latter. With <hi>Master Hanmers</hi> termes I will not meddle, who is to answer for him-selfe, when you haue confuted his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, or els when he shall see it conuenient. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Fulke,</hi> the next man, whom you condemne to be of a ruffianlike spirit, because he saith (<hi>shew me Allin if thou canst for thy guttes</hi>) as though you raile not more of him, in your ruffianlike terme, then he in speaking of Allens guttes, whatsoeuer the cause or affection

were, hath answered alreadie in his own behalfe, &amp; in such sort, as more shame redowndeth to you that haue gathered together his vehement and sharpe speaches, vttered in manie bookes, and to those whome you complaine by him to be abused, while he giueth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his speaches, then all the eloquence you haue wil be able to wipe away in a larger treatise, then your defense of the Censure as yet appeareth to be. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fut. of Topish quarrelles:</hi> page. 20. and so forth in 16. or 17 pages. If it were no more but your marginall note, <hi>Docter Fulkes talent in railing,</hi> wherein you abuse an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie phrase of scripture, like an Italian Atheist, to mooue Sardonicall laughter, it were much more able to conuince you of a ruffianlike spirit, then anie terme that <hi>D.

                     <p>When you haue almoste done with <hi>Doctor Fulke,</hi> you take vpon you to shew the like rayling <hi>in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> (as you terme them) <hi>that you haue done in the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> and beginning with <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> you saie <hi>that his ordinarie terme, especially against Bishoppes and such like, as are his superiours, is to call them Nebulones, knaues: which beside the foull gall whence it proceedeth, is vnseemelie.</hi> For this you neither note nor quote anie one place, where he vseth that terme in such sort, as either his gall might thereby be espied, or the same signfying light persons, might not fitlie be applied vnto them, vpon whome he bestowed the terme. As for your popish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes, are not his superiours, but for the most part deserue sharper termes, then <hi>Nebulones,</hi> euen such as were fitte for <hi>Annas, Caiphas.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12222:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that race, which were as great prelates as they? Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing more against Caluin, you passe ouer to <hi>Luther,</hi> who in his booke against King Henrie the eight of England, ministreth vnto you larger matter to triumph against him: where in it maie be doubted, whether you had greater pleasure in discouering of <hi>Lu thers</hi> intemper at stile; then in displaying those odious and long since buried reproches, against that noble Prince, so great an enimie to your Romish Antichrist; which as they were vnseemelie in respect of either of their persons, him that did write, &amp; the Prince against whom he did write; so they were afterward misliked of <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe, who in as great humilitie, as before he did write in disdaine, craued pardon at his handes, not for the matter &amp; substance of his booke, but for his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerent <note place="margin">Ep. ad Reg. Angl.</note> handling of the same, against a King of so great nobility, &amp; of so good expectation. the cause that mooued him to such destemper was, for that he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that the booke was not endited by the King him selfe, but by some enimie of his, to procure his disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as he writeth in the same booke, <hi>Crederes ab insigni hoste regis hunc librum editum in perpetuam regis ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. You would thinke, that his booke was set forth by some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table enimie of the Kinges, to the perpetuall shame of the King.</hi> And in his Epistle of submission he declareth, that he suspected cardinall Wolsey to be the author thereof, which made him the bolder to write as he did against it. And in the storie of Sir Thomas Moores life, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by his sonne in lawe Master Roper (which I haue seene) it appeareth, that Kinge Henrie tooke great displeasure against Sir Thomas Moore, for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that booke, by which he receiued more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, then by anie thing in all his life. Luther ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore writing against him, that did abuse the name of the Kinge, in defence of an euill cause, thought he was not bound to spare him, because of the Kinges title, but that he might so much the rather be free to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12222:78"/>
inueigh against him. But this, to saie the trueth, might be some part of an excuse, though not a sufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense of his doing neuerthelesse it followeth not here of, <hi>that he could not be an elect vessell of God, or that he had no part of Gods spirit, or that he was herein worsse then anie russian or rakehell,</hi> as our seuere Censurer saith, without either malice or railing spirit, I warrant you. For Gods elect children, &amp; they that haue a great part of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, do sometimes fal into far greater crimes then this, and yet by his grace are brought to repentance, as Luther was for this vntemperat stile, and thereof made open confession in his epistle of submission. againe, he erred by immoderat zeale, yet in defense of the truth, which is not the cause that mooueth ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians and rakehelles to rage. Wherefore it is well with <hi>Luther,</hi> that hath alreadie answered the matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a more wise and merciful iudge, and standeth not at the curtesie of our solemne Censurer.</p>
                     <p>But it is more to your purpose, that you bring in Luther inueighing against the Caluinistes, where he had not (by our owne confession) a good cause, &amp; the Caluinistes againe as bitter against him: a tast where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of though you refer the matter to another place, you wil needes giue vs here, by citing of one place in stead of all the rest, and that is, of the Church of Tygurine against Luther, <hi>Tygur. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

those which confesse Christ. But how marueilouslie doth Luther here bewray himselfe with his deuilles? what filthie words doth he vse, and such as are replenished with all the deuilles in hell? for he saith, that the deuill dwelleth both now and euer in the Zuinglians, and that they haue a blasphemous brest insathani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, supersathanized, persathanized, and that they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a most vaine mouth, ouer which sathan beareth rule being infused, perfused, &amp; transfused to the same: did euer man beare such speaches passe from a furious deuill him selfe?</hi> Hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (saie you) are the wordes of the Tigurine Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes, which how faithfullie they are reported, by comparing them with the latine, and the true English of the same, euerie simple reader may perceiue. Now touching such matter as you gather out of them: first where they saie, <hi>how wonderfull doth Luther shew him selfe with his deuilles,</hi> you conclude in the margent, <hi>Ergo Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had deuilles, which Master Charke denieth:</hi> a fine and proper conclusion. The Tygurines speake of the terme of deuilles, which <hi>Luther</hi> so often repeateth against them, therefore he was possessed of deuilles actuallie: which is the thinge that Charke denieth.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie you saie, <hi>these wordes of the Tygurynes may easilie confute Master Charkes shameles lyes in defense of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as after shall be shewed:</hi> well hereafter commeth not yet, and therefore you might haue spared your curteous terme of <hi>shameles lyes,</hi> vntill you had shewed vs what they are. Yet I may not say that you haue a rayling spirite: but that euen as your Pope, though he be neuer so great an heretike, hath a prerogatiue that he cannot erre; so you haue a priuiledge that you doe not rayle, though you vse neuer so foull reproches, and giue no reason of them. More then this, here <hi>you wouldhaue the reader to consider with what conscience Charke doth call Luther a holie and diuine man, and M. Whitaker a man of holy memorie, seeing the Tyguryne Caluinists (who are their Masters) doe call him an arch-heretike and a furious deuill. Peter</hi> was iustlie reprehended of <hi>Paull</hi> for dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12222:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and as one <hi>that did not tread rightlie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the trueth of the Gospell,</hi> and of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> he was called <hi>Sathanas,</hi> and tolde that he was an <note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>offence,</hi> and that <hi>he sauoured not those thinges that are of God,</hi> but of men: the same Peter did thrise denie <note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> Christ, yea swore and forswore, curse and banne, that he knew him not. Thinke you then that <hi>M. Charke &amp; Master Whitaker,</hi> with any conscience might call him <hi>an holie and diuine Apostle, or an Apostle of holie memorie?</hi> verilie I would haue the Reader consider, both here, and almost euerie where, what a subtil Logician (for I wil not meddle with his conscience, wherofperhaps he hath small feeling) we haue to be our Censurer, which maketh such infallible conclusions, as no man, except he had more ouerweening of his witte, then vse of his reason, would make in a sophisme among chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the vniuersitie. And yet when you haue cryed out; <hi>Is not this open dissimulation and blinding of the people?</hi> where doe the Tygurynes call Luther, an arch-here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, and a furious deuill? For although Luther in deede did breake all Christian modestie, as one caried away with immoderate zeale, and that in a wrong cause; yet doe the Tygurynes thoroughout all their wholltreatise speake both charitablie of Luther, and as reuerentlie as was conuenient, to one which so much forgatte his owne creditte, while he inueieth against them. They bid him <hi>take heed that he make not him-selfe an author or a companion of sectes.</hi> Ergo by your Logicke, doe they cal him an arch-heretike? Nay let vs vse your own friendlie translation, <hi>let him looke that he do not declare him selfe an arch-heretike: who but you may conclude of these wordes that they do call him an arch heretike?</hi> They admonish him of the danger, wherein he was like to fall, if God did not keepe him, while he will not agree with them, which both confesse and teach Christ in all necessarie points vnto saluation, as well as he. Secondlie I aske, where they do cal Luther a furious deuill? They aske in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12222:80"/>
deed who did euer hear such speaches vttered by men that vse reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are not mad, or possessed with the deuil? wherof you can gather no more rightly, but that such speeches, wherein the deuil is so often repeated, are more like to proceede from mad men or demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niackes, then from a modest Christian: yet do they not cal him either mad man or demoniacke, much lesse a furious deuil: yea in the ende after they haue protested their hatred of the deuil, &amp; al his waies, they conclude, <hi>Deus faxit ne Listhero iuxta domini verbum eueniat, Ex abun dantia cordis os loquitur, God graunt that it may not come to passe vnto Luther, according to the Lords sayings, Of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.</hi> Now whether these be shameles lyes, that the Tygurynes do cal Luther an arch heretike, &amp; a furious deuil, let the readers iudge.</p>

out of the word of God, why Elias should after more then two thousand yeares be brought in for a patron of friars?</hi> you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, these examples are brought by the censurer, to prooue <hi>that different apparell, diet, or straight order of life, doe not make sectaries, as Master Charke hath affirmed, and now cannot defend, and therefore hauing nothing els to say, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth these vaine and idle interrogations in steade of proofes.</hi> Hear you not how confidentlie he speaketh what <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Chark</hi> hath affirmed? how boldely he pronounceth, that he is not able to defend, that he hath affirmed? and last of all how scornfullie he concludeth, that he hath nothing but vaine &amp; idle interrogations, in stead of proofes? would ye not thinke, that he which so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie charged <hi>Master Charke</hi> with shamelesse lyes (though he shewed none) had a care, that he himselfe should speake nothing but the trueth? And which in the end of the former section was so busie with the conscience of <hi>Master Charke</hi> and <hi>Master Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,</hi> that he burdened them with open dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and blinding of the people, is it like, that in the beginning of the next section he would make an open and moste impudent lie him selfe? for beleue me reader if thou wilt, or els read ouer Master Charkes answere to Campians seditious pamphlet thy selfe, and thou shalt finde my wordes to be true, that Master Charke doth no where affirme, in all that booke, <hi>that different apparell, diet, or straight order of life, doe make sectaries:</hi> I saie, neither in this forme of wordes, nor in any other to this effect or sense. Then iudge according to thy conscience, what a sincere Censurer this Papist is to Master Charke, and what a doughtie defender he is of his owne Censure.</p>
                     <p>But now to returne to you, sir defender, whom I may not accuse of lying, lest you charge me of rayling, although I take you in a manifest vntruth: was this the cause why ye found fault with <hi>M. Charkes</hi> method, to iumble together thinges that were in good order,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12222:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that you might fumble out such an open slaunder, &amp; be couered with the dust of disorder, that you your selfe had raised? you shew now of what spirit you are, euen of his that was a lier, and a false accuser from the beginning, and the father of the same things. But to <hi>that idle interrogation</hi> of Master Chark, as you terme it, <hi>what was there in Elias, Elizeus, or Daniel, that maie liken them to Iesuites?</hi> you answere <hi>there was to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose now in hand a different sort of life from the common sort, which made them no sectaries, as Master Charke would haue the Iesuits to be for that cause.</hi> I haue said before, for that cause onelie Master Charke would not haue them, neither doth he therebie go about to prooue them to be sectaires, although there is great difference in the singulare examples of those Prophets, and in multitudes of men, that seuer them-selues from the common sorte of true Christians, and that for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions sake, therefore those examples were idlelie brought in by the censurer, to prooue that lesuites are no sectaries. But to this you adde, which is more then you neede (as you saie) and in deede more then is for your purpose, to iustifie the Iesuites that dwell commonlie in the greatest cities, <hi>That Saint Ierome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth plainlie, that Elias and Elizeus were the beginners, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and patrones of Monkes, and monasticall life, whome he calleth for that cause Monkes of the olde testament, ep. 13 ad Paulinum, &amp; ep.</hi> 4. <hi>ad Rusticum.</hi> For Saint Ierome in the former place prooueth not at all, but onelie saith. <hi>Noster Princeps Elias, &amp;c. our prince is Elias, ours is Elizeus, our guides are the sonnes of the Prophets, which dwelled in the fieldes, and desert places, and made them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles neere the streames of Iordane.</hi> The like he saith of the sonnes of Rechab, which dranke no wine, or strong drink, and dwelled in tentes: &amp; this he saith, to approoue the dwelling of solitary men that were giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to studie, and contemplation in desert places, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of these holy men commended in the scripture,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:12222:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which extendeth not to Popish Monkes, or Iesuites, which thrust in them selues especiallie into places of most frequencie of people. <hi>In the epistle to Rusticus,</hi> he speaketh neither of Elias, nor Elizeus, but exhorteth Rusticus likewise to leaue the citie, and to get him into some solitarie place, if he will be in deede, that he professed him selfe to be called, <hi>Monachus,</hi> a solitarie man. He bringeth in deede the example of Iohn Bap tist, and the sonnes of the Prophets, <hi>Filij Propheta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum (quos Monachos in veteri testamento legimus) aedifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant sibi casulas propter fluenta Iordanis, &amp; turbis vrbium derelictis polenta &amp; herbis agrestibus victitabant: the sonnes of the Prophets whome wereade to haue beene Monkes or soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary men in the olde testament, did build themselues litlecoteges neere to the streames of Iordan, and hauing for saken the throng of cities, liued with potage and wilde hearbs.</hi> In the same e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle he saith, <hi>mihi oppidum carcer, and solitudo paradisus est: quid desideramus vrbium frequentias, qui de singularita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te censemur? vnto me the towne is prison, and the solitarie place is a paradise: what do we desire the frequencie of cities, which haue our name of being solitarie?</hi> These wordes of Saint Ierome do shew, that in the principall point of profession there is great odds betwixt your Iesuites, &amp; the solitarie men, of the olde testament. <hi>Sozomenus</hi> in <note place="margin">lib. bist. 1. cap. 12.</note> the place by you cited, after he hath commended the Philosophie or contemplatiue life of the solitarie men in those daies, hath these wordes: <hi>of this excellent Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie was the beginner (as some saie) Elias the Prophet, and Iohn Baptist:</hi> so that it is not so absolute as you sett it downe, but as some saie, and it is of a Philosophicall studie and life, in which if comparison be made with Popish Monkes, for one thing which they haue like, they haue three things vnlike, or contrarie to the profession and practise of those auncient <hi>Monachi,</hi> which might haue some resemblance with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Elias life in some thinges, and were more agree able to the example of the sonnes of the Prophets
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:12222:82"/>
which were students in diuinitie, as those olde Monks of the primitiue Church, readie to serue in the place of teachers, whensoeuer they were called.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That antiquity onely should let the Prophets to be examples of monasticall life,</hi> it is your owne vaine collection, and as vaine is your comparison of <hi>Adam, to be a paterne of marted men, Abel of sheepherdes, Caine of husband men, &amp;c.</hi> For <hi>M. Charke</hi> asketh what you are able to bring out of the word of God, why Elias should after more then two thousand yeares be brough in for a patrone of fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which for so manie yeares could neuer be espied in the Church, either of the Iewes, or of the Christians. As for the estate of maried men, sheepherds, husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, citizens, Tentdwellers, musitians, smithes, &amp;c. is either necessarie or otherwise commendable, then by the examples of those auncients, of which some in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of their antiquitie are not to be followed at all, as Cain, and the rest of his cursed line, who yet were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenters of profitable artes by the gift of God, and not by the worthines of the persons. As for the slate of the Munkes and friers, such as we striue about, is neither necessarie, nor profitable to the Church, but a great infection, and poison of the same. Nowe whether Iohn Baptist were a president to Monkes, whome <hi>Master Chark saith to haue beene an extraordinarie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Nazarite,</hi> whose example is not now laid vpon them that teach in the Church; you answere, that he doth wilfullie mistake the question; for that you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme not, that <hi>such extraordinarie austeritie is laid vpon anie man of necessitie, but that it is lawfull, and maketh no sect, when it is voluntarilie taken and vsed.</hi> You do wilfullie omit the pith of <hi>Master Charkes</hi> argument, who is not ignorant of your pretense, of voluntarie, but addeth that the seuerall offices of those that teach in the Church are expressed in the word of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no new order of Ministers by anie title or voluntarie assumption: but it is a suspitious
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:12222:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sect, howsoeuer seuerall persons maie as they see iust cause more or lesse, prescribe vnto them-selues, some extraordinarie austeritie of life for their priuate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise or chastisment. <hi>That Saint Iohns austeritie was for the moste parte voluntarie, and not of necessitie of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Nazarite,</hi> it is fondlie proued of you, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the superstitious sect of the Essenes descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by Plinie, and Iosephus, of which Plinie speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth verie little, but Iosephus at large, and in some points of austeritic noteth them to exceede any thing that we read in scripture of Saint Iohn Baptist; as of their continuall exercise in labour of their handes, their forbearing to spitte in the assemblies of men, their forbearing to ease their bodies on the sabboth daie, and such like superstitious toies.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>the austeritie of Saint Iohn,</hi> in that he did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie, and not by compulsion vndergo it, maie be called <hi>voluntarie:</hi> otherwise, in that it was appointed by the wisdome of god, whose spirit directed him, it was necessarie, and especially for the forerunner of Christ, to sing the dolefull song, and to call the people to repentance, and therefore, not without presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, drawne into example by them that are neither led with the same spirit, nor called to the same office and so no example nor platforme for the superstitious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Monkes, and friars, albeit they alwares kept as great austeritie in deede, as they professe in wordes. But it is a wonderfull argument for your Monkes, <hi>that the Nazarites did make a religious vow for their dedication to God, as your religious people do also vse.</hi> For it were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <note place="margin">Num. 6.</note> that you saie, if you could bring as good warrant for the vowes of your Popish votaries to be prescribed and accepted of God, as you bring for the vow of the Nazarites: otherwise it maie be said vnto you by God, as he speaketh by the Prophet, <hi>quis requisiuit, &amp;c. who, required these things at your handes?</hi> which if it were said <note place="margin">Esa. 1. 12.</note> of those things, which in some manner, and to some
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:12222:83"/>
end were required, how iustlie maie it be spoken of these, that in no manner, nor to anie end, are by God required at your handes? but that <hi>Saint Iohn was a Monk of the new Testament, and a patron of monasticall life</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you confesse it to <hi>be more then you were bound to prooue) so manie fathers as you name, do testifie with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi> And what if he were an example followed of those Monkes, that liued in moste of those fathers times, is he therefore a patrone to your Popish Monkes, of these late daies, and new orders? it will be more then hard for you to prooue that. Now let vs consider your authorities, which you affirme to testifie, that Saint Iohn was a Monk of the new testament, and a patterne of monasticall life.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Gregorie Nazian. orat. de. S. Bas. 1.</hi> hath this testimonie. onelie he compareth Basill with Saint Iohn Baptist, as resembling him in some thinges, as he doth with Peter, Paul, Iohn the Euangelist, and Stephan: except you will saie theese were all Monkes. Chrisostome in deed, <hi>Hom. 1. in Mark. calleth Saint Iohn prince of the Monasticall life,</hi> but not a Monke of the new testament, as I haue shewed before in answer to your preface. Neither doth <hi>Saint Ierome epist. ad Eustoch.</hi> saie that Saint Iohn was a Monke, and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of Monasticall life, but speaking of the life of an Anachoret, which liued by him-selfe alone in the wildernesse, he saith: <hi>huius vitae auctor Paulus, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator Antonius, &amp; vt ad superior a conscendam, princeps</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, but the Hermit.</note> 
                        <hi>Iohannes Baptista fuit. Of this life Paul was the author, Anthonie the beautifier, and that I maie ascend higher, the Prince or cheefe was Iohn Baptist.</hi> Where is Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist the Monke, or patterne of your Papisticall monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish life, when they liued not in the wildernes, but in cities, &amp; populous townes, not in caues, and tents, but in gorgious palaces? Although Saint Iohn be the cheife of them that liued in the wildernes, the same Ierome in the life of Paule the Heremite whome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:12222:83"/>
he calleth the author of the Anachorites life, hath these wordes: <hi>Inter multos saepe dubitatum est, à quo potissimùm monachorum eremus habitari caepta <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> quidam enim altiùs repetentes, à beato Helia &amp; Iohanne sumpsere principium, quorum Helias plus nobis videtur fuisse quàm Monachus, &amp; Iohannes antè Prophetare caepisse, quàm natus est. alij autem, in quam opinionem vulgus omne consentit, asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt Antonium huius propositi fuisse caput, quod ex parte verum est. It hath beene often douted among many, by which of Monkes especiallie the wildernes began to be inhabited: for some fetching the matter somewhat high, haue taken the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of blesseá Elias and Ihon, of which two Elias seemeth to vs to haue beene more then a Monke, and Iohn to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied before he was borne: but other (into which opinion all the common sorte consenteth) affirme that Antonie was the heade, or cheefe of this purpose, which is partlie true.</hi> By these wordes it is euident, that Saint Ierome counteth He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias and Ihon Baptist to be of a higher calling, then that they could be called Monkes or patterns of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall life: ascribing the beginning of them rather to Paul and Antonie, then to Helias, and Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, although they both, for some time, did lead an austere life in the wildernes. the same doth your next author <hi>Cassianus, Collat 18. Cap. 6.</hi> neither doth he once call Iohn Baptist a Monke, or patterne of monasticall life, but onelie sheweth that the Anachorites desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to encounter openlie with the deuill, feared not to pearse into the vast solitarie places of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, <hi>ad imitationem scilicet Iohannis Baptistae, to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of Iohn Baptist, who ledd his life in the wilderens:</hi> so doe not your Popifh Monkes, but lie in their warme nests in the cloysters.</p>
                     <p>What Sozomenus saith, I haue shewed a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Isodorus agreeth with Saint Ierome, and Cassia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, that the Anachorites which liue alone doe follow Elias, and Iohn Baptist, where as the Coenobites, which liue in companies (in that point more like your
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12222:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Monks) do follow the Apostles. As for <hi>Theoph. in c. 1. Lu.</hi> which you note next, hath nothing sounding towards the name of monkor monastical life, except you meane where he saith that Iohn liued in the wildernes, as Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as did. The last author you quote, <hi>Nicephorus Hist. li. 8. c.</hi> 39. hath nothing more then the verie words of Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene, that <hi>some men said that Elias was the beginner of that solitarie life of Christians, some that Iohn Baptist.</hi> And among all your authors, there is not one that saieth, Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist was a Monke of the newe Testament, or a patern of such monasticall life, as you defend, that there should be so great consent there, of that matter, where of you bragge so much. But names, and quotations of Doctors are sufficient, either for you, that by all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liehood neuer turned the bookes your selfe, or for your sottish schollers, that accept all your wordes without examination and triall.</p>
                     <p>After this followeth a vaine strife of words co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the signification of this terme <hi>sect,</hi> which of <hi>M. Charke</hi> is taken for a <hi>schisme,</hi> as it is manifest by the example he bringeth of the 1. Cor. 1. The Censurer sometime tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in good part, and sometime in euill: sometime he maketh it equall with the terme of heresie, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time more particulare: which contention seeing it is vnprofitable for the readers, I do willinglie omit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them that list to vnderstand ofit further, to the comparison ofboth their writings, where they shall finde, that <hi>Master Charke</hi> in effect preuenteth all his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillations, by saying that <hi>the names of heresie and sect areoften times confounded:</hi> which to prooue, the Censurer busieth him-selfe in vaine. It is somewhat materiall that he saith, <hi>the Corinthians erred in a point of faith, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the vertue or power of Baptisme, not to depend onelie of Christ, but of the dignitie of the Baptizer.</hi> And surelie there muste be some opinion touching faith, where there is a schisme, in the Church, though there be not a dissent in the necessarie articles of faith: but a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:12222:84"/>
schisme or sect may be, where neither the generall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor the societie of the Church is forsaken, as inthe example. 1. Cor. 1. which is contrarie to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptionof the censure. <hi>Sectaries are such as cut themselues of in opinion of religion from the general body of the Catholike Church:</hi> for so did not the Corinth. 1. Cor. 1. (howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur they had an opinion of some excellencie in the minister of Baptisme) nor the 1. Cor. 11. 18. where Saint Paul likewise chargeth them with <hi>schismes, when they came together to celebrate the communion,</hi> which text being likewise quoted by <hi>M. Chark,</hi> is cleane omittedby the defender. But now you would cleare your sectes of Monkes and Fryers from the example of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian schismatikes, by a fond similitude, supposing our <hi>ministers should saie in a contrarie sense of libertie, I will luie vnmaried after the order of my Lord of Canterburie. I will bem aried after the platforme of my Lord of London: I will haue two wiues together, after the fashion of Master Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of Salisburie: I will haue a wife, and a wench, after the custome of some other Archdeacon and preahcer.</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your example, if any Archdeacons be of such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, as you describe them, I would they had such pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment as to such fashions belongeth, and if you be hable lawfullie to conuince them thereof, I doubt not but they shal. As for the other 2. of being maried &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried, be matters in deede of Christian libertie, that euerie minister may choose that which he findeth to be most expedient for him, but if any minister should glorie of his continent life out of mariage, by hauing my Lorde of Canterhurie for his patterne, or of his chaste life in mariage, by following my Lorde of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons platforme, he might iustlie be noted for a schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike, as Saint Paull doth the Corinthians when they saide, <hi>I am of Paul, I of Apollo, I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</hi> For the platforme, order, patterne, or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of men in these cases, must not be their warrant, but the worde of God; which text is plaine, that in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:12222:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
profession of Religion we may not be called by the names of men, no nor by the name of Christ, or Iesus, therebie to make a diuision or seperation of our selues in excellencie from other, to whome Iesus Christ is common, as well as to our selues.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>euerie one of your sects termed of Benedict, Augustine, Frauncis, Dominike, Iesus, &amp;c.</hi> although in the generall doctrine of Poperie they al agree, yet haue they their seuerall opinions each one of the excellencie of thier orders, and patrons, which maketh a schisme, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times hath broken forth into great brawling, and open contention. It is too manifest, that the Monkes commonlie hated the Fryars, the Dominicans and Franciscans were at deadlie feede, the not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants enuied the obseruants, and they despised the children of their owne father Frauncis, as bastardes in comparison of them selues: and now the Iesuites are hated and inuicd of all other sects of Monkes, and especiallie of Fryars, whome they bring into great contempt, wheresoeuer they plant them-selues, in so much that the Fryers in some places haue slirred vp sedition against them, &amp; caused them to be expelled. It remaineth therefore that the Iesuites are a sect or schisme euen in Popery, as they are a detestable kinde of heretikes against the Catholike faith, which is common to al obstinate Papists, and it is true likewise, which Master Charksayeth, <hi>that the Pharises were a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious sect,</hi> ver did they not cut of themselues from the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, nay they bare the greatest sway in the Church: &amp; albeit some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> held great here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, yet they professed to imbraceal the doctrine of the Church: and so did the <hi>Saduces,</hi> in so much that some of them climed vp euen to the high priests office: yet were they a detestable sect, but of a bastarde Church, as the Iesuites are of the Popish Church of Rome.</p>
                     <p>His definition also (if you did not cauill and trifle about words) is true, that <hi>a sect is a companie of men, that differ from the rest of their religion, in matter, or forme of then
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:12222:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
profession.</hi> Whether you deriue the Etimologie <hi>à secando,</hi> of cutting, or <hi>à sequendo,</hi> of following, although I thinke <hi>Master Charke</hi> meaneth it of cutting, the absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities you gather are wilfull cauillations For Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopes, ministers, lawyers, iudges, &amp;c. though they differ in auctoritie, apparell, state, and forme of life, yet they differ not in forme of profession of religion from the rest of our religion. They be diuerse offices, and lawful callings in one profession of religion, but so are not Iesuites, and other orders of Monkes, and Fryers: for they, albeit they hold one religion with the rest, yet doe differ in the sorme and profession of that religion, beeing no necessarie offices or callinges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by God, but seuerall professions begonne by men, whose imitation soeuer they pretend. Therefore no wise man, but such a quarreling Censurer, woulde haue made the cases of Bishopes, iudges, lawyers, like in this point with Dominicans, Franciscans, Iesuites. Like wisedome and grauitie you shew in flouting of. <hi>Master Charkes</hi> definition, with your ridiculous compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, where he sayeth, <hi>a sect is a companie of men.</hi> For when, you haue sported your selfe, vntil you haue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried your selfe, and your reader, in the end you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that you <hi>are not ignorant, that in common speach this word sect may improperly signifie the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also, which professe the same, but not in a definition, where the proper nature of each word is declared.</hi> Whether it be properlie or improperlie so taken, because it is a brable of wordes, I will not contend, but if you exclude all improper or figuratiue speaches, whose sense is commonlie knowne, as this of <hi>sect,</hi> from definitions, you will driue them into a straight roome. For we may not saie, Logicke is a sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or arte <hi>bene disserendi,</hi> which in common speach signifieth to dispute well, because <hi>disserere</hi> in latine, doth properlie signifie to sow, or set in diuerse places: and seeing the worde <hi>sect</hi> in common speach, may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the men that professe such a seperation, why may
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:12222:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there not a definition be giuen of the terme according to that signification?</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>whether the Iesuites be a sect, according to Master Charkes definition,</hi> you will examine: after you haue tolde vs, that his conclusion is like that he made in the Tower against <hi>Campian,</hi> which was to dispatch him at Tyburne, nothing following of the premises: which fond comparison I passe ouer, seeing all men: knowe that conclusion was not of Master Charkes making, by which <hi>Campian</hi> was hanged at Tyburne, and all men may see what was Master Charkes disputation in the Tower, and how it was answered by <hi>Campian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to the matter in hand, you aske what is in M. Charkes illation, that can make the lesuites a sect, if it were all graunted to be true? <hi>the Iesuites receiue a peculiar vow to preach as the Apostles did, euerie where of free cost. First, to dedicate a mans life by vow to Gods seruice, you saie it is alowed in scripture, Numbers. 6. &amp;. Ps.</hi> 131. yea, that is euery mans dutie: but Master Charkes illation is of a peculiar vow, which by no scripture is allowed, but of such things onelie as God accepteth to his seruice, and are in our owne power to performe, as the vow of a Nazarite, the vow of sacrifices, of thankesgiuing, &amp;c. Other be either superstitious, or vnlawfull vowes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, <hi>to preach euerie where and at free cost,</hi> you thinke <hi>he should</hi> be ashamed to saie that it maketh a sect, <hi>seeing Christ commaunded his Apostles to preach euerie where freelie, and Saint Paul glorieth, that he had taught the Gospell of free cost.</hi> Yes Syr, this maketh a sect, for them to vow to exercise the office of Apostles, which are not called by Christ to be Apostles: the vow is vnlawfull, and the votaries are sectaries, not of the Apostles, but of that pseudo Apostle Laiolas, that was of his own ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Againe, where you saie, that <hi>the Apostles were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to preach the Gospell in all places freelie,</hi> it is false, for that precept, Mat. 10. <hi>giue freelie, as you haue receiued freelie,</hi> either is ment of the graces of healing, or if you
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:12222:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ioyne it with the other preceptes that follow, of not possessing golde, nor siluer, nor monie, garments, &amp;c.&amp; other prouision for the iournie, it is as they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for that viage, and not generall for all time of their Apostleshippe. For otherwise the Apostles should haue greeuouslie offended, in not preaching in all places of free cost, and Saint Paull in taking of double wages of somme Churches, that in some other he <note place="margin">2. Cot. 11. 8.</note> might preach freelie. Therefore as vpon good consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in some place the Apostles did preach of free cost, and so may men at this daie: yet for any man to vow, that in al places, and at al times, he wil preach at free cost, the vow is vnlawfull, because it is contrarie to the ordinance of God, which hath ordained and appointed that <hi>they which preach the Gospell, should liue of the Gospell,</hi> 1. Cor. 9. 14. And it cannot, but be to the iniurie, &amp; such as will procure contempte, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect vnto them that preach the Gospell, and liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinance of the Gospell, in taking the stipende for them appointed, that there should be a sect or company of men, which should professe alwaies and in all places to preach of free cost.</p>
                     <p>You proceede and aske, <hi>what then maketh them secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? to whippe and torment them-selues, if it were true? seeing Saint Paull chastened his owne bodie, and caried the bonds of Christ in his flesh: and the scriptures talke much of mortifying our members, of crucifying our flesh, and the like, and neuer a word of pampering the same.</hi> As though there could be no chastening of the body, bearing of Christs markes, mortifying the members, or crucifying the flesh, except men whippe and torment them-selues: or that whosoeuer doth not whippe him-selfe, doth pamper his flesh. Saint Paull <hi>did chastise his bodie,</hi> with abstinence and fasting: he did <hi>beare in his bodie the markes of Christ,</hi> by suffering imprisonment, stoning, whipping, not of his owne hand, but of the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Gospell. As for <hi>mortifying our members and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:12222:87"/>
crucifying our flesh,</hi> be higher matters, then any volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie exercise: and extend much farther in ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our whol corrupted nature, which it seemeth you little knowe or practise, for al your whipping, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of your selues, by your comparing of them to exercises of bodelie chastisement. Moreouer, <hi>the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of S. Iohn Baptists life,</hi> and of other Saintes of the new Testament, &amp; the olde, mencioned in the scripture, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoreth not your superstitious whippings. For albeit they did willinglie sometime abstaine from pleasures that are lawful, &amp; were tormented by other, yet none of them was a tormentor of himselfe. And as for the great store of examples, that you promise the reader in one Chapter of <hi>Marcus Marulus, lib. 3. cap. 10. of Saintes cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stizing their bodies with whippes,</hi> there is in deed some store of examples of voluntarie, not onelie chastening, but also tormenting of the bodie, but we haue smal warrant either that they were all Saintes, or that anie Saintes in such examples of tormenting their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies pleased God: yet is there verie fewe examples of them that whipped them selues. The first is <hi>of Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, the father of graie- friers, which being assaulted with the thoughtes of marriage, being angrie with him selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, did beat him-selfe verie hardlie with the corde wherewith he was girded. But when stripes litle preuailed, he tumbled him-selfe naked a great while in the deepe snow, and afterward binding to his wholl bodie the shapes of men made of snow, he spake vnto him-selfe, by the waie of rebuking, and said, loe Francis, here is thy wife, loe, here be thy children; either cloath them, that they be not so frozen for colde, or els forsake al things, and serue the Lord onelie. So (saith your author) at length he tamed the wantonnes of his flesh with whipps, and quenched the burning fire of lustes by embracing colde snow with his naked breaste.</hi> But the holy ghost, wiser then Francis, prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth marriage, which he did fight against, and not I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of snow, which he embraced, to be a remedie to quench burning Iust. I. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. But of whippers
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12222:87"/>
there are three more examples; <hi>Elizabet anunne of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magie,</hi> whipped her selfe certaine houres euerie daie. <hi>Maria Decegnies,</hi> that was married against her will, by often praiers, fasting, and whipping of her-selfe, mooued her husband to vow chastitie with her, where your author saith <hi>Naufragium, &amp;c. she had made ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of virginitie, being committed to the waues of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie: but while she leaneth to the board of fasting, praier, chastisment, vnhurt and vntouched she swamme out vnto the hauen of saluation.</hi> But the holie ghost giueth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Portum sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutis.</note> rule to them that be married, <hi>that the wife be not separated from her husband, except it be for a time of fasting and praier, and then to returne againe together, lest Sathan tempt them through incontinencie, and that they which are maried, should not seeke to be loosed. 1. Cor. 7. ver. 10. 5. 27.</hi> Beside these, there is a <hi>Dukes wife of Thuringia called He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth, that commaunded</hi> her maides to whippe her in her priuie Chamber: and these are the goodlie exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Saintes that vsed whipping of them-selues. Manie of the rest are <hi>wearing of haireclothes,</hi> as Thomas Becket, Maiorus, Bishop of Sarina, I wot not where, in the ile of Britanie. Medericus Eduensis Abbas: Lewes the 5. King of Fraunce: Cecilia, and Rade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundis wife of Clotharius King of Fraunce, vntill she had obtained the dissolution of the band of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, by binding her-selfe to chastitie, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the doctrine of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 7. as well as white and black resemble each other. Edmunde of Canterburie ware a coote of maile, wouen with leade. Macharius Abbat of Alexandria bare on his shoulders a sacke full of sand. A Monke in Saint Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, being commaunded by his elder, caried a great stone eight yeares together, twise in the daie, by the space almost of fiue miles. Hierome to Eustochium testifyeth, that he cried often day and night together, and ceased not beating of his brest vntill by the Lords rebuking, quietnes returned. An example more meete
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:12222:88"/>
to be followed of them that seeke the like cause, then any we haue had yet, which is confirmed by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Scripture, Psal. 22. Psal. 32. and 42. Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Archbishop of the nether Missia, ryding barefoot in winter, his feete were frozen to the stirop, and thowed with hotte water. Hospitius Monke of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceria vsed an Iron girdle: Philoramus a Priest liued enclosed in a stonie denne, being bound hand and foot with iron bandes, and the last daie of his life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed (if you will beleeue the storie) that he omitted no moment of time, in which he thought not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of God: he had beene better occupied, to haue attended on the flocke of the Church, whereof he was a Priest or elder. Martin a Monke of Massick in Campania had bound his foote in a chaine fastened to a rock, but being bidden by the Abbat Benet to beware that the iron chaine did not holde him there more then the chaine of Christ, he vnloosed the bandes, but would neuer departe further. Iohn a Monke stood three yeares vnder a hollow rock of a mountain, that his leggs thereby swelled, and broke into vlcers. Pacomius an Abbat walked barefoot tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the brambles and thornes, and returned into his celle with his feete all bloodie. Simeon a Monke tooke a rope from a bucket, and wound it about his bodie, vntill his flesh were eaten with it, and putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till stinke betrayed the secret: then the rope beeing loosed, he was expulsed out of the Abbey for his follie: but afterward being sought for by his Abbat, which was troubled with terrours in the night, he was found in a drie pitte in the desart, and brought back againe. Last of al, Sara an Abbesse in Scithia, by the space of 60. yeares, would neuer looke out at a window to beholde the water that ranne by, or the pleasant meddow. I praie God she were not worsse occupied within, then she might haue beene in beholding Gods creatures a broad. And these (except Saint Paules chastening
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:12222:88"/>
of his bodie, which he nameth first) are all the store of worthie examples, gathered, as you saie, out of all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie: and yet Paull being the first, Thomas Becket is the next: and although there be some of greater an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, yet, out of all antiquitie, you would not haue said, if you had read the Chapter your selfe, except you care not what you saie.</p>
                     <p>You adde further that <hi>Saint Hierome testifieth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, by an occasion giuen to a secret friend of his, that his skinne was well neere as blacke, with punnishment, as the skinne of an Ethiopian,</hi> Epist. 22. ad <hi>Eustochium: And that Iohannes Cassianus, that liued about the same time, hath infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite examples of the practize of the fathers in this point.</hi> Saint Hierome in deede writing to the noble virgine Eusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium, testified how litle he preuayled with such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate austerity, to subdew the lust of his slesh, vntil by importunitie of prayers, he obteined rest of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet minde from Christ. Although his wordes be not, as you haue set them downe, <hi>that his skinne was as blacke as an Ethiopian:</hi> but his deformed skinne was growen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with the hearines, or scurffe of an Ethiopians flesh, <hi>squalida cutis situm aethiopicae carnis obduxerat.</hi> In the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent you note that <hi>we will saie, Saint Hierome was noe Protestant.</hi> I answere, although we cannot allow Saint Hierome, or any man, that by hurting his bodelie health, with immoderate rigour of austere life, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his natural life in daunger: yet doe we imbrace S. Hierome, as a member of the true Church of Christ, whoe trusted not in any merite of such chaistisment, but onelie in the mercie of God by Iesus Christ. The like we say of any examples of godlie men, that are brought by Cassianus, whoe is not altogether so olde as you make him. Your rayling, and seoffing at Peter Martyr. I omitte, as meete for such a Censurer: but where you charge him <hi>to iest at Saint Basill and Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie Nazianzen, for hard handling of their owne bodies, in cap. 16. lib. 3. Reg.</hi> your note boke deceiued you: for in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:12222:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his comment vpon the Chapter he hath no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His iudgement els where may be to this effect, That notwithstanding the examples of the auncient godlie fathers, yet it is neither lawfull nor expedient, for a man with such rigour to handle his bodie, as it be not able to serue him in his calling. For as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of the bodie to bring it in subiection, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time necessarie: So weakening of the bodie, to make it vnable to serue the spirit in such outward actions, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the vse of the bodie, is neither wisedome, nor god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, what examples soeuer be pretended. For as it is not lawfull for a man, vnder any pretense of mortifying his flesh, to kill him selfe; so it is not lawfull for any man to torment his bodie, aboue the strength thereof; wherby sicknes must needes follow, and death may ensue. For against all examples of godlie men, that can be alledged to the contrary, we will oppose the wisdome of the holy ghost, in his elect vessel S. Paul, whoe calleth Timothie from such austeritie, wherebie his health was impaired, vnto a moderate vse of gods creatures. <hi>Drink no more water,</hi> saith he, <hi>butvse a litle wine, because of thy sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and often infirmities, 1. Tim.</hi> 5. 23. According to the proportion of which rule if many of the examples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remembred were exacted, they may perhapes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a zeale in the persons, but such as is not guided by knowledge of Gods will, reuealed in the scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Where you saie, <hi>If the Ministers of England would vse this cooling phisick, there should be fewer Eatons, and Hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches openlie punished, or flie the countrie, for incest &amp; rape,</hi> you would insinuate, that for lacke of chastisement of mens bodies, so great enormites breake out, and in part it may be true, so you touch none but such as are guilty, who when they be discouered, by your owne confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are not winked at in our Church, but openlie puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, what discipline soeuer you vse when anie of your Iesuites are ouertaken with such offences. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber God be thanked of such offenders among vs is not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:12222:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great, how small chastisement soeuer you thinke the Ministers doe vse, and therefore no cause why you should amplifie them in the plurall number, as though for one Eaton, or one Hynch, there had beene ten of each sorte at the least. Too manie, we confesse, of one, but fewer then one there could not be, except there had beene none. Howbeit we praise God that so fewe haue geuen such offence in so long peace of the Church, and praie God they be the last. Yet are they a small matter for you to insult against vs, if you looke homewarde, where for two, you may easilie finde two hundred, and for two poore Ministers, manie of your great prelates, yea your Popes, by confession of your owne historians, haue not beene behind any examples of incontinencie, and filthines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But if we will not practise this remedie our selues, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tristing, or making sad the holie ghost within vs (which you saie is our phrase) yet you will vs not to impute it as schisme, and heresie to them, which vse it moderatlie, as we maie ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Iesuites will, being not fooles, nor hauing iron bodies, but sensible as ours are.</hi> Hereto I answer, that the remedie of incontinencie we learne out of the scriptures, and haue no neede of your instruction for such matters, if God geue vs grace to practise that which we learne out of his word. The phrase whereat you scoffe, is not ours, but vsed by the holie Ghost him-selfe, though in a <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note> farre other sense, then you ascribe it to vs, in which meaning you will sooner be hanged for a traitour, then you are able to prooue, that anie approoued Minister of ours hath euer vsed the same in speach or writing. Among the familie of loue perhappes, which are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercosins with you Papistes, you may finde such blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous abusers of holie phrases of scripture. The imputing to schisme or heresie, ariseth of the Iesuites profession, and practise, which in such doinges pretend a greater merit, and perfection, then God requireth of Christians. Otherwise we doubt not but many of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:12222:90"/>
Iesuites can fauour them-selues wel enough in their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie whipping, especiallie those of our nation, or of anie other, except the Spaniardes, among whome the reliques of the olde whipping heretikes haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so ranke in some, that they haue beene seene in England to endure greeuous whipping for other mens sinnes, that liked not to suffer such penannce in their owne persons. <hi>The following of one mans rule</hi> (you sate) <hi>can make no diuision, because it is but a particular direction of life, and manners, grounded one the seriptures and practise of the fathers, and alowed by the superiours of the Church.</hi> But here you assume more then wilbe graunted: for neither is the rule of Laiolas grounded one the scriptures, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue the gouernours of the Church authoritie to allowe anie such rule: and last of all, it is so newe, that it hath no practise of the auncient fathers to shadow it. The first is prooued before, the second dependeth vpon the first, and the last of the newnes is manifest of it selfe.</p>
                     <p>But all this while you haue supposed, <hi>that Master Charkes reportes of the Iesuites life and vocation, were true, which is false: for there was neuer anie that tooke a vowe to whippe them-selues, and much lesse to doe it after the example of a sect, called by the name of whippers, condemned long agoe.</hi> Here, beside a double cauill, is nothing worthie the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering, for <hi>Master Charke</hi> meaneth not, that their vowe is to followe the condemned whippers: but that this whipping is after the example of that condemned sect, in that they wippe, and torment them-selues. Whereof if there be no perticular vowe expressed, yet seeing they vowe to followe the rule of Layolas, which includeth whipping of them selues, as you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, <hi>Master Charke</hi> hath not belied the Iesuites, as you note in your margent. And <hi>as concerning the sect of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, called whippers,</hi> you referre vs to Prateolus and Gerson, to prooue that they helde manie wicked opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for which they were condemned, and <hi>aske what
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:12222:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doth this make against the sober &amp; moderat chastisment which good men vse in secret, vpon their owne bodies, at such times, as they esteeme them-selues for mortification to neede the same.</hi> I answere, there is no neede that any man for morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication should whippe him-selfe, or els it is neede for al men so to whippe themselues, except Iesuites haue more vntamed bodies, then all other men. And therefore it is but <hi>ethelothreschia, a voluntarie Religion, or a superstition, after the precept and Doctrine of men, in colour of humilitie, and not sparing the bodie,</hi> described by Saint Paul Col. 2. 23. and as for Gerson, to whom you send vs, doth not <note place="margin">Tract. cont. slagiliantes.</note> onelie condemne the hereticall opinions of those whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, but also their whipping of them-selues, and that for diuers causes, of which I will rebearse some. First he accounteth it <hi>a tempting of God, to laie such a burden vpon men,</hi> as you do, which make whipping needfull for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification: <note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> whereby it followeth that it is needfull for all men, as mortification is, &amp; not for Iesuites onelie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie he saieth, <hi>that the law of Christ, ought no lesse in his seruice, to auoide the superstitions of the Gentilles, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, espiciallie these that are cruell, and horrible, then the olde law, in the which yet there is expresse prohibition,</hi> Deu. 14. <hi>where it is said, be ye seruers of the Lord your God: you shall not cut your selues: where the glosse is, you ought not in anie thing, to be made like to Idolatours:</hi> and in the hebrue it is, <hi>you shall not teare or rend your selues:</hi> Againe he saith, (for I doe but translate his wordes) <hi>lex Christi, &amp;c. the law of Christ is giuen sufficientlie in the tenne commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the keeping of which good simplicitie, and plaine faith, is enough to saluation, especiallie of laie men and common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without anie new imposition of moste greeuous burdens, according to the saying of Christ: if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commaundements. Neither is it anie thing worth, if it be said, that the people doe voluntarilie take vpon them such whippings, without any other commaundement, while it is found that there-vpon they doe more licentiouslie contemne Gods commaundementes in manie thinges. For the nature of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:12222:91"/>
man is stubburne, which since it is forsaken of the state of originalliustice, it is caried more greedelie vnto those things that are of mans inuention, then those that are of Gods bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And this is one degree of pride, which Bernard saith is found among Religious men, while they reioice more in absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, or particular voluntarie praier, then in all the regular discipline. Againe, the law of Christ, being set forth sufficiently, by the Apostles and holie Doctors, is not found to haue appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such nouelties of men, whipping them-selues, either by preaching, or otherwise, but rather to haue reprooued them, as moste suspect and daungerous, and which may growe to the slaunder of Christianes among the Iewes, Saracens, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes, as though the lawe of Christ were austere, cruell, and nourished in blood, not in mercie,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterward he setteth downe reasons, to dissuade this superstition, as he calleth it. <hi>Let diligent and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest exhortation be made, touching the praises of patience, which hath her perfect worke, preferring it before such vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie whippings, as Augustine saith agreeablie to Seneca, that the aduersities of this world, are not so much to be laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, as when they happen, patientlie to be suffered, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorough patience a vertue of necessitie. I am not so madde (saith Seneca) that I would be sick, but if I must be sick, I will beare it patientlie. Therefore there must be reckened vp diligentlie, and seuerallie, the diuers tribulationes, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time temporall, sometime spirituall, which daielie do giue and offer to vs, whether we will or nill, matter of patience, such as are sicknes, pouertie, &amp;c, and who is able to number all such tribulations? which are such and so manie, that we must not bring vpon our selues new sorowes: for the valiant suffering of such dailie tribulations is enough for the purging of greater sinnes, especiallie if contrition be encreased, and humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, in deede, or purpose, &amp;c.</hi> Yea the same Gerson saith farther, <hi>Imò sicut non licet, &amp;c. As it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a man of his owne authoritie to mayme, or gelde him-selfe, excepte it were for the healthe of the whole bodie. So it is not lawfull, as it seemeth, that a man should
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:12222:91"/>
violentlie draw blood of him-selfe, except it be for bodelie Physick: or els by the like reason a man might burne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with an hotte iron, which no man hath held or graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hitherto, except perhaps idolaters, or false Christians, such as are found in India, which thinke that they ought to be baptized with fire.</hi> Finallie, Gerson alloweth no whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, except it be enioyned as penance, and that it be executed by another man, and that moderatelie, and without offence giuing, or ostentation, and last of all without drawing of blood. And this booke of Gerson, as you wotte, is in print, to answere your que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>was there euer honest man but Master Charke, that would haue obiected so impertinent a thing in Print, as is the whipping of men by them-selues, vppon anie falselie pretended neede of Mortification?</hi> But Master Charke maketh you laugh, when he saith the sect of whippers was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned long agoe. You aske <hi>how long, and by whome?</hi> For they began anno 1273. vnder Pope Gregorie the 10. and were condemned both by him, and his successours, by which authority <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluine</hi> are likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. An high point in a low house: as though the authoritie by which men are condemned, is all the matter, not the cause for which. Adultery is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Mahomet, and by the same authoritie the Gospell of Christ: is it not lawfull to approoue the one condemnation, except a man allow the other? No maruaile though you laugh at this matter: for indeed it is verie ridiculous, as moste of your collections be. And whereas you affirme, that Pope Gregorie the 10. did condemne these Flagellantes, I suppose you are not able to bring any author of credit, that so doth write. For in his time they sprang vp, and continued almoste fourescore yeares, without anie solemne condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For anie thing that Prateolus, or who so wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth most diligentlie of here sies, can testifie. Prate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olus out of Carion sheweth, that 1343. they came to Spire in Germanie, when the diet of the Empire was

That the Iesuites are not onelie a sect, but also a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous sect, Master Charke prooueth, because they abuse the moste blessed name of Iesus, for a colour of their blasphemous practise, which is to roote out the Gospell of Iesus, and to bring in the heresie, and superstition of poperie. For this you will call him an angrie <hi>gentleman, with whome euerie thing is blasphemie, though it be but the wagging of a straw.

Secondlie, where you count <hi>abnegation of our owne will</hi> to be onelie commended and counselled to perfection, you declare what a profound diuine you are, when the verie text which you cite, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that it is necessarie for all the disciples of Christ, and that in paine of damnation: <hi>If anie man will follow me,</hi> saith he, <hi>let him denie him-selfe, and take</hi>

Neither is marriage, or priuate possession of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie goods, of it selfe, anie impediment vnto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Christian Religion. And if it were graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the perfection thereof did stand in such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession as you speake of, yet doth it not follow, that such professours should haue that praerogatiue, to be called absolutelie Religious: seeing they that make no such profession, maie be neuerthelesse sufficientlie Religious vnto saluation: neither do your examples iustifie this proud vsurped terme. For the name of learned men doth truelie agree to them that are so in deed, whereas to them that haue but smale learning,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:12222:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it doth not absolutelie agree, but with addition of something, smallie, meanely, pretilie, or such like. For no man can saie truelie of him, that knoweth onelie a litle grammer, latine, logick, &amp;c. that he is a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man: but of euerie true Christian man, we maie trulie saie, that he is a Religious man, although some be more religious then other. The name of <hi>Cleargie</hi> also, as it was vsed by the Fathers of olde time, maie be defended, and warranted by example of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in respect of the especiall lot, whereunto the Ministers of the Church are called, as the tribe of Leui was, notwithstanding that all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes <note place="margin">Luk 6. 13.</note> are the lotte or inheritance of the Lord. The name of <hi>Apostles,</hi> being giuen by our Sauiour Christ him-selfe, vnto his speciall embassadoures, he were a madde man that would controule, though other also were sent. What like warrant haue Monkes, and Nunnes to be called religious? verelie by these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples it appeareth, that which you saie of Master Charke to be verified of your selfe, <hi>this man waieth not what he saith, so he saie somewhat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the second point, Master Charke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth plainlie, if you were disposed to vnderstand him, that he misliketh Popish Monkes, and Nunnes, not onelie for the abhominable life of the greatest parte of them, but speciallie, for their superstitous, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall, and Idolatrous profession, wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the virgines of the primitiue Church, as much as in their lewd life, and loose conuersation. And therfore neither he nor Doctor Folke do vse any hereticall sophistrie, to condemne all for the ill life of a fewe, or to condemne a lawfull calling, for the misbehauiour of them that are in that vocation, and much lesse, for that men liue not so perfectlie in the same, as they did in the primitiue Church, about which hereticall consequences manie words are spent in vaine.</p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:12222:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>But now let vs heare what you answer to such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as <hi>Master Charke</hi> maketh betweene the olde monkes, and the newe. His wordes you recite in this manner. <hi>It is a plaine iniurie, saith he, to match those aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Monkes of the primitiue Church, with those of the popish orders: for the olde Monkes liued in their house without vowes, as studentes in diuinitie in Colledges: they were holie, painefull, learned, they laboured with their handes. Their societies were nources of good learning and godlie life, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish afterward the Church: whereto being once called, they ceased to be Monkes, and left their monasteries.</hi> Here first you charge him with bolde slaundering, as though he said that all Monkes and sriers are vnlearned, vnpain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and vnholie, whereas he saith not so, knowing that some are vnlearned, though neither all, nor the moste part, no not in this learned age: manie friers also take paines in preaching, which with more commendation and credit might holde their peace. Yet fewe Monkes labour that waye. <hi>As for labouring with the handes</hi> (saie you) <hi>though it be not necessarie to anie, if they be occupied in greater matters, yet their is no monasterie wherein some doe not exercise that function.</hi> But Saint Augustine in his booke, <hi>deopere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> holdeth it to be necessarie for all Monkes to labour, and admitteth not the excuses of praying, singing of Plalmes, reading, or preaching the word of God, for anie to be priuiledged altogether from not labouring with his handes, <hi>cap. 17. 18. That some in euerie monasterie with you are appointed to that function,</hi> as you saie, it is but a mockerie of the olde la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Monkes, and left for a shadow of some simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude with antiquitie, and not taking awaie the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence set downe by Master Charke. <hi>That manie Bishoppes are chosen out of monasteries, and that Pius 5. chose 70. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes out of one order,</hi> it is litle to the purpose. For the olde monkes were not onelie chosen to the office of rich and statelie Bishoppes, but to serue in the painefull of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of teachers, and pastours, and were, as Master
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:12222:94"/>
Charke saith, the nources of good learinng, of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of the Church, as your popish orders are not, out of which they may not depart to serue the Church, without a dispensation, and capacitie, as they call it. Your iest of his poore benefice by London, and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barres shoppe, are both a like, and the latter as well agreeth vnto him as the former, seeing it is wel knowne he neuer had anie benefice, rich or poore, in London, by London, or farre from London.</p>
                     <p>The first difference you confesse to be the greatest; although you speake of it last, where you saie <hi>he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that the Monkes of the primitiue Church made no vowes,</hi> the contrarie whereofyou prooue by manie te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of the auncient fathers, and in the end you conclud against Master Charke, asking what he will saie to this, and much more that mighr be brought for this matter? <hi>And maie he not blush</hi> (saie yon) <hi>to haue made (In saing that the religion of the primitiue Church made no vowes) so open and manifest alie?</hi> But may not all modest Papists blush in your behalse, seeing your owne fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as it seemeth, is hardned against shamefastnes, for that you haue made so open, and manifest a lie, in saying that Master Charke affirmeth, that the Monkes of the primitiue Church made no vowes? whereas he saith not so, but farre otherwise: for these are his words, <hi>they liued in their houses without any superstitious vowes.</hi> Is it all one to saie they made no vowes, &amp; to saie they made no superstitious vowes? the like impudence you shew, in charging him with cogging, and foisting, for placing his quotations of Saint Augustine in the margent, right ouer against the matter of vowing, which is both false, and vniustlie laide to his charge: the Printer had set them a litle wrie. For the quotation beginneth right ouer against the name of Austen in the leafe, or text, although the taile of it extende to the line in which he speaketh of vowes. The places that are quoted for vowes are speciallie against the mariage of them
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:12222:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that haue vowed sole life, yet haue we good testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the fathers, that such as are not able to keepe those vowes rashlie made, ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them-selues to the lawfull remedie of mariage. <hi>Epiphanius Cat.

                     <p>Where M. Charke denieth Saint Augustine to be a Frier; First you cauill, <hi>which Austen he meaneth, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe of Hippone, or of Canterburie: and both,</hi> you say, <hi>were Monks,</hi> and the later you make our first Apostle in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, yet was he an Apostle from Gregorie, not from Christ. What Doctor Fulke hath written of him, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth in his confutation of Popish quarrels, Pag. 43. But how prooue you that the elder Austen was a Monke, as monkes were termed in his time? you cite, <hi>Ep. 89. &amp; tract. 1. de com. vita clericorum,</hi> and <hi>Possidius, or Possidonius in his life.</hi> To the first quotation I answere, that Saint Augustine in that epistle confesseth not that he was a Monke; onelie he acknowledgeth <hi>that he once solde all that he had, and gaue it to the poore.</hi> But that he had priuate possession when he was Bishoppe, Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidonius doth plainlie declare. The second quotation is of no worke of Saint Augustines, but of I know not what bable rule, of some impudent counterfeiter, whose style is as like Augustines, as an asse is like a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To the third I answere, that the writer alledged saith, that <hi>Austine when he was made prieste, or elder, of the Church of Hippo, did institute a colledge or monasterie of studentes, with in the Church, which were especiallie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to serue afterward in the Church, as they also that were afterwarde brought vp in other monasteries, set vp by his schollers.</hi> But neuertheles he neither calleth Augustine, nor any of his schollers Monkes. For these Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by Augustine him-selfe, are called <hi>diuersoria,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelles, or Innes, <hi>Demoribus eccl. Cath. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 33. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distincte from Monkes, which in those daies were onelie Anachorets, or Caenobites, both liuing in the

wildernes, whereas these liued within cities, yet in streighter discipline, then the common sorte, vnder the gouernement of a verie Godly, and excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, in Christian charitie, holines, and libertie, not in superstitious vowes, &amp; are called by Augustine none otherwise, but a laudable kinde of Christianes. And all this maketh him neither Monke nor Frier. You say he was not called so in English, but in latine, <hi>Frater, and Monachus.</hi> For the name of <hi>Monachus,</hi> I haue answered, that you are not hable to prooue it by authenticall author or testimonie. And I doubt not, but he was called brother, as all Christians are called one of an other, but not as Friers are called <hi>fratres.</hi> You adde further out of Saint Ambrose, <hi>that he ware a blacke hoode, and a girdell of lether, Ser. 94. so that nothing wanted in him to the verie habit of an Augustine Frier.</hi> But seeing there are of Ambrose his sermons numbred in all but 93. this bastarde bable where this of the hood and the girdle is written, must be set out for a wrangler, and he had beene worthy to be set one the pillerie, that fayned such a sermon vnder the name of Saint Ambrose, to giue creditte to the Augustine Friers. Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidonius testifieth <hi>that his apparell, shooes, and bedding were of moderate, and competent habit, neither too fine, and costlie, nor too verie abiect, or contemptible;</hi> In which he kept the meane. As for the blacke hoode, and lethern belte, he that liued 40. yeares with him (as you say) can tell vs nothing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so that you haue neither the weede, nor the profession of Friers in S. Augustine.</p>
                     <p>Where the example of Christ is alledged, to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the institution of Iesuites, which Master Charke affirmeth to be blaspemous against his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, you confesse <hi>that Christ did not whippe him selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had no rebellion in his flesh, as you haue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vse mortification of your bodie, according to Saint Paules counsell, Coll. 3.</hi> You shew how wiselie you vnderstand <hi>mortification,</hi> which you referre to the bodie onelie,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:12222:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where Saint Paul commandeth vs to <hi>mortifie our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which are vpon earth.</hi> And least you should thinke he meaneth your head, your armes, or your shoulders, he addeth, <hi>fornication, vncleanes, lust euill concupiscence, couetousnes, and such like,</hi> which be the members of the olde man, that must be mortified, &amp; not the natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man, or the partes thereof. But though you haue no example of Christ whipping himselfe, yet you haue <hi>of long fasting, praying, and lying all night one the ground, which notwithstanding you thinke we ministers wil not imitate:</hi> for prayer, and fasting we know it to be our dueties, hauing not one lie the example, but also the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Christ for it. But for lying all night on the grounde, we finde no example of Christ. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist Luke. 6. which you quote for it, saith, that Christ <hi>continued all night in prayer:</hi> but that he lay all night on the grounde, he saith not so: you declare your selfe, as well by this, as by many other things, to be verie well studied in the scriptures. Where Master Charke saith that <hi>Christ came eating and drinking,</hi> did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the publicke assemblies, and was sometime en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained at great feastes, he sheweth the forme of Christes life, differing from Iohns the Baptistes, which was more austere, whose example is more like your profession, then that example of Christ, although your vocation be nothing answerable to his.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>pouertie,</hi> Master Charke asketh, <hi>what worldly blessing giuen vnto Christ by his father, did he at any time abandon? how doth his example recommend wilfull po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie to you Iesuites, or to any, except you would by vertue of the example haue all men be of your order, because all should be followers of Christ, and holde it as commaunded or recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for an example to be followed of all, whatsoeuer he hath done before?</hi> And then the Pope aboue all other by his owne claime, must be the poorest of all, and become a brother of your beggerlie order. To this you an swere, by asking, <hi>if it were not wilfull pouertie, for him the</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:12222:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>was Lord of all to liue of almes?</hi> Yes verilie he did willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 9.</note> forbeate, to challenge that which was his owne: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles it was necessarie for his office, to become poore, that he might inrich vs with his grace: so is it not for Iesuites, or any other to whome God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen such benefites, as they should not neede to liue of almes. You aske further, <hi>if he that counselled men, tore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all they possessed, for his service, and to giue all to the poore, that would be perfect, did not he recommend voluntarie pouertie, though he commaunded it not?</hi> Surelie if the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitte of his seruice doe require it, there is no doubt, but that it is euerie mans durie to renounce all that he possesseth. But what necessitie compelleth the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites to any such seruice of his, but that they may liue of their owne, and eare their owne breade? As for the place you quote Luk. the 14. is verie Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisticallie applied to actuall forsaking of mens posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: whereas it is manifestlie to be vnderstood, of renouncing in affection, &amp; is not counselled onelie to some, but commaunded of necessitie to all: <hi>euerie one of you</hi> (saith he) <hi>which renounceth not all that he possesseth cannot be my disciple.</hi> For euen as bearing his crosse is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for all Christians, so is willfull pouertie: and <hi>it is impossible for anie rich man to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen:</hi> which places if they be vnderstood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">

as the yong man professed him-selfe to be, in whome nothing wanted.

And Luke. 12. where he willeth his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to sell their possessions, and giue almes, he sheweth the dutie of all men, which is not to spare their owne patrimonie, but euen to sell their possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, rather then the poore shoud perish for lacke of necessaries, yet not to make our selues beggers, or to be pinched, that other might haue ease, but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie might be obserued, as the Apostle saith, 2.

<pb facs="tcp:12222:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we haue the testimonie of <hi>Wierus,</hi> a man verie expert in such matters, who maketh reporte of diuers Nunnes so abused, by vncleane spirites, yea of diuers Nunneries, in which manie were so dealt with all, and namelie a notable nunnerie in the borders of <note place="margin">De praest. dae. lib. 3. c. 9. tertiae editio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note> the prouince of Collene; where the deuill in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a dogge in the daie time, was seene to fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them in moste beastlie manner, about 26. yeares agoe.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:12222:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>

For of them that could not conteine, after they had vowed virginitie, I haue shewed before the plaine testimonies of Saint Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome and Epiphanius.</p>
                     <p>Now are we come to those <hi>nine articles of Doctrine, with which you haue charged Luther:</hi> how iustlie, we shall see by &amp; by. <hi>The first is, that you affirmed Luther to teach, that there is no sinne, but incredulitie, neither can a man damne him-selfe, doe what mischeefe he can, except he will refuse to beleeue.</hi> To this Master Hanmer answereth; that all sinnes proceade of the roote of incredulitie, as al good workes from the roote of faith: but this you will not vnderstand, and bring in a contradiction of Master Charkes, which doth pronounce, that in wordes and matter, you reporte an open vntruth. And so you doe, for any thing that you bring in your defense. For Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saieth not absolutely, but in comparison, <hi>that there
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:12222:101"/>
is no sinne, but vnbeleefe, as our sauiour Christ sayth to the Pharisies, if you were blinde, you should haue no sinne; and of <note place="margin">Ioh 9. 41.</note> the obstinate Iewes; If I had not come and spoken vnto them, they should haue had no sinne. If I had not done those workes, among them, which no other could doe, they should haue had <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 22. 14.</note> no sinnes.</hi> Luthers meaning is therefore, that vnbeleefe is the greatest, and onelie sinne, that damneth a man, because all other sinns are forgiuen to him that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth &amp; is baptized, according to the promise of god. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, where Luther speaketh expresselie <hi>of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an baptized,</hi> you say simplie, <hi>a man:</hi> where he saith, <hi>with any sianes, how great soeuer;</hi> you sate, <hi>doe what mischeefe he can.</hi> And as for your blasphemous collection, <hi>that a man cannot leese his saluation, if he would neuer so faine, &amp;c. and that he may doe what he will, so he fall not into incredulitie;</hi> Luther him-selfe in three wordes, sheweth how farre it is from his meaning, in his answere to the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of errours out of his doctrine, which delt more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie with him, then you. For they said, <hi>Baptizatum etiam volentem, &amp;c. that the baptized man, though he be willing. cannot leese his saluation:</hi> Luther answereth, <hi>Quia fides tollis omnia peccara, &amp; facit volentem non pecca re. Rom. 1. because faith taketh awaie all sinnes, and maketh a man willing not to sinne.</hi> For euen in his booke <hi>de captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Bab.</hi> he addeth this condition, which you doe fraudulentlie omitte. <hi>Siredeat, vel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> fides, if faith doe returne or stand.</hi> For by the same faith or rather the trueth of Gods promise, all other sinnes are swallowed vp; because God cannot denie him selfe, if thou shalt confesse him, and cleaue faithfullie vnto him that promiseth. To conclude, faith and good workes be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seperable: and the faithfull man, although by corruption of nature, he is apt dailie to fall away from God, into most greeuous sinnes, yet by grace he is either preserued from heinous sinnes, or els he is brought to repentance, and sorrow for the same. <hi>So</hi> that Luthers doctrine of faith and vnbeleefe, if it be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:12222:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnderstood rightlie, as he doth often expiicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, is full of comfort to a troubled conscience, yet giueth not bridle to sinne or carnall libertie. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, howsoeuer you wrest his wordes from his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you shew yourselfe no lesse an impudent liar, then the false witnesses, that deposed against our sauiour Christ, that he said: <hi>destroie this temple, and within three dayes I will raise it againe:</hi> which wordes in deede he spake, but not in that sense, they deposed: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are condemned by the holie ghost, as liars, and false witnes bearers. Luther saith, <hi>onely infidelitie is the trouble of the conscience: because there is nothing but sinne and damnation, where there is no faith:</hi> you conclude, that <hi>nothing is sinne, but vnbeleefe.</hi> whereas in vnbeleefe there is nothing but sinne: <hi>and being iustified <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23. Rom. 5. 1. Rom. 8. 1.</note> by faith, we haue peace with god.</hi> And <hi>there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Christ Iesus, who walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</hi> Againe, where 'Luther saith, that <hi>nothing maketh a wickedman, but infidelitie, because it is the roote of all wickednes, and bringeth with it all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> you conclude, <hi>that no other sinne maketh a man wicked:</hi> which is true, if it be vnderstood of him that hath faith. &amp; is truly penitent for his sinne, &amp; hath it pardoned by Gods mercie. For to such one, though his sinns were as <note place="margin">Esa. 1.</note> redde as scarlet, they are made as white as wol, neither is he to be called <hi>Prauns,</hi> a wicked man, but <hi>rectus,</hi> or <hi>iustus,</hi> a right or a iust man, who shall liue by his faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The second doctrine</hi> is so manifest a cauill, that you doe in a manner acknowledge a satisfaction, both by Master Hanmer, and Master Charke, onelie you would haue it considered, how these wordes of Luther do sound in the eares of the people. <hi>The: enne commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements appertaine nothing to vs.</hi> As though Luther did sette downe this Aphorisme so barelie, that he did not plainlie declare his meaning.

For God hath imprinted these notices in all men, euen in their creation. Wherefore euen the gentiles, to whome Moses was unknowen, and to whome God hath not spoken, as to them, do know that God is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, God is to be called vpon, parentes are to be honoured. men must adstaine from murther and iniurie of others, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these thinges displease God, and are punished of him.</hi> In the end he concludeth thus: <hi>Dico igitur seruanda esse hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

did appertaiue to the gentiles, because they were wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their nature: much more to Christians, in whose heart they are written also by the spirit of god.

                        <hi>Thirdlie,</hi> you reporte that Luther said: <hi>It is a false opinion, and to be abolished, that there are. 4. Gospels. For the Gospell of Iohn is the onelie faire, true, and principall Gospel.</hi> For this you cited <hi>his preface in nouum Testamentum.</hi> which Master Charke cannot finde, nor anie man els that I heare of, in latine. You saie, <hi>it is not your fault.</hi> At the least it is your fault, that in so straunge a report you haue not sette downe his wordes in latine, if euer you sawe the preface your selfe. As for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt edition, or often chaungeing of Luthers workes by him-selfe we haue not to do with it: for whie might not Luther reforme his owne workes, if ought in them were erronius or offensiue? But it is a cauill that you adioyne, <hi>of the confession of Auspurg,</hi> whereunto the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes perhaps ascribe too much, as Alasco writeth: For though there be diuers editions thereof, differing in wordes, yet are they not contrarie in sense, as appeareth by the <hi>harmonie of confessions,</hi> latelie set forth at Gencua. Now sir, so much as we finde sounding toward your reporte, I will sette downe, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der maie iudge, how vprightlie you do charge Luther with denying three of the foure Gospells. <hi>Enarrat. in epist. Petri argumentum: Primùm omnium notandum, &amp;c. First of all it is to be noted, that all the Apostles do handle the same doctrine, for which cause it is not well done, that men do number but onelie foure Euangelistes, and foure Gospells, whereas whatsoeuer the Apostles haue left written, is one Gospell. For the Gospell signifieth nothing els but the preaching, and publishing of the grace and mercie of God, by our Lord Christ deserued, and purchased to vs by his death: and that thou maiest take it properlie, it is not that which is conteined in bookes, and is comprehended in letters;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:12222:103"/>
but rather a vocall preaching, and a liuing worde, and voyce, which soundeth into the wholl world, and is so openly blowen out like a trumpet, that it may be heard euerie where, neither is it a booke, which conteineth a law, in which are many good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as it hath beene commonlie taken heretofore: for it doth not commaund vs to worke any thing, where by we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come iust, but it sheweth vnto vs the grace of God freelie, and giuen without our meritte, namelie that Christ hath beene our mediatour, and hauing made satisfaction for our sinnes, hath abolished them, and made vs iust, and saued by his workes. Now whoesoeuer doth either preach, or write these thinges, he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the true Gospell, that which all the Apostles, and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arlie Saint Paull, and Saint Peter in their Epistles haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Therefore whatsoeuer is preached of Christ, is one Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, although one handle it after one manner, an other man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, &amp; in diuerse manner of wordes, do reason of it. For the matter may be handled, either in long, or in short speach, and be described either streightlie, or largelie. But seeing all perteineth to this end, to teach Christ, to be our sauiour, and that we are made iust, and saued by faith in him, without our workes, it is one word, it is one Gospell, as there is but one faith onelie, and one baptisme in all the Church of Christ. Therefore thoureadest nothing writen by any of the Aposties, which is not conteined in the monuments of the other Apostles. But they which haue handled this point especiallie, and with greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that faith alone in Christ doth iustifie, they are the best Euangelistes of all. And in this respect you may more rightlie call the Epistles of Paul the Gospel, then those which Matthew, Marke, and Luke haue written. For these men describe not much beside the storie of the Acts, and miracles of Christ. But the grace which is wrought vnto vs by Christ, none doth sette forth more fullie, or more rightlie, then Saint Paul, especiallie in the Epistle to the Romanes. Now seeing there is much more moment in the word, then in the factes, and miracles of Christ, and if we should want the one, it were much better to lacke the Acts, and history, then the word and doctrine; it followeth that shose bookes are to be had in highest price, which handle the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:12222:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doctrine cheeflie, and the wordes of our Lord Iesus Christ. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if there were no miracles of Christ extant, and we were altogether ignorant of them, the words were sufficient for vs, without the which we could not so much as liue. Therefore hereof it followeth, that this Epistle of Saint Peter is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted among the most excellent bookes of the new testament, and is the true, and pure Gospell, as in which he doth nothing els, but that which Paul, and the other Euangelists do, teaching sincere faith, that Christ is giuen vnto vs, which hauing taken away our offences, doth saue vs, &amp;c.</hi> This that he speaketh, naming Matthew, Marke, and Luke (say you) <hi>signifieth some tooth against these three Gospells.</hi> And what tooth I pray you? <hi>because these three Gospells speake too much of good workes.</hi> As though S. Paul in his Epistles, and namelie in that to the Romanes, doth not speake as much of good workes, as all those three Gospells: and Saint Peter, though breeflie, doe not speake as much in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But in the preface in question, you affirme that Luther hath these wordes: <hi>The Epistles of Paul, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doe farre passe the Gospells of Matthew, Marke, and Luke, which yet more prooueth Luthers euill opinion of those three Gospells.</hi> I doubtnot (albeit I neuer sawe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face my selfe) but Luther doth plainlie expresse, in what respect the Epistles of Paul and Peter doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the histories of the Gospell, written by Matthew, Marke, and Luke, euen as he doth in this preface vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his exposition of Saint Peter: Because these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles are more occupied, in setting forth the Grace of Christ, and the fruit, and benefit of his passion; which no more prooueth his euill opinion of those three Gospells, then when Christ preferreth <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> before al the Prophets, it prooueth his euil opinion of all the Prophets: or when he preferreth him, that is least in the kingdome of heauen, before <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> it prooueth his euil opinion of <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> These brutish Papists thinke all men voide of common sense, when they make such impudent conclusions.</p>

                     <p>As for your first charge, that <hi>it is a false opinion, and to be abolished, that there are foure ghospels: For the ghospell of S. Iohn is the onely faire, true, and principall ghospell:</hi> when you can alledge the words of Luther in latine, to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your report, and, because we know not how to come to the sight of that preface, will set downe two senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that goe before them, and as manie that followe them, you shall receiue a reasonable answere. But vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you haue thus much performed, I am perswaded, you wil be as farre to seeke, as <hi>Campian</hi> was for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porre of <hi>Luther, that he should call the Epistle of Saint Iames Stramineam,</hi> strawie, or like strawe. And yet you take vppon you <hi>to shew the intollerable impudencie of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Chark, and his fellowes in the Tower, against Master Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian, for that he could not presentlie shew out of their bookes, where these wordes are written by Luther; especiallie of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Whitaker (whoe to the admiration, and laughter of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations) hath set forth in latine, that Luther neuer called the Epistle of Saint Iames Stramineam.</hi> And I pray you good sir, where doth Luther so call it? For admitting your reporte of his wordes (<hi>Iacobi autem epistola pre illis straminea est: the epistle of Iames in comparison of those of Peter, and Paul is like strawe, or but strawie</hi>) we finde not yet that he doth so call it absolutelie, but in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; which may be done without contempt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch: As when the Apostle saith, <hi>the law hath but a</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>shadow of good thinges to come;</hi> he meaneth not, that the law to alintents, &amp; purposes, is nothing but a shadow, for then it should be a vaine thing, but in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the truth exhibited in the Gospell. The intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable impudency therefore is yours, and your fellows, and the laughter, and admiration of all nations (if all nations may heare of your shameles follie) may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, rather then <hi>Master Whitaker,</hi> that blush not to say absolutelie, Luther called the epistle strawy, when he spake onelie in respect, and comparison of greater plentie, of more waightie matter, in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:12222:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Peter, and Paul, then in that of Iames.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>the matter presseth Master Whittaker verie heauily, for that he being a reader in diuinitie, could not choose but haue read those wordes alledged by learned men, aboue a hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, against Luther.</hi> As though he is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, whatsoeuer he readeth by papistes alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. In deede this siaunder of Luthers reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that Epistle, and calling it strawie, is often thrust in, by Popish writers, yet without alledgeing the place where, or the wordes in which it is written. Prateolus out of <hi>Lindane</hi> of late hath sette it forth in <note place="margin">Lib. 10.</note> these wordes: <hi>eam non modò reiecit epistolam ceu canone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignam, sed contumeliosissimè quo<expan>
                              <am>

You see therefore what credit is to be giuen to Popish writers in their reports against <hi>Luther.</hi> Now <hi>whether Saint Iohn did speake lesse of good workes in his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, then the other three Euangelistes,</hi> you handle a vaine question, when you confesse, that Iohn writing by the same spirit, could not but haue manie thinges to the same effect.

                        <hi>The fourth doctrine of Luther</hi> you reported to be this:
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:12222:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>If anie woman can not, or will not proue by order of the lawe the insufficiency of hir husband, let her request at his handes a diuorse, or els (by his consent) let her priuelie lie with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or some other man.</hi> Master Charke answered, that this was Luthers counsel, while he was a Papist, which he reuoked after his conuersion. For this you charge him with such wilfull and shamefull dishonestie, as can not be excused: and aske how he will looke his owne friendes in the face hereafter? with such fonde insultation against him, as was vsed in the preface, whereunto hath sufficientlie beene answered, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer your impudencie. <hi>For Luther would not reuoke his former counsell,</hi> saie you, <hi>but do farre worsse, namelie take the man by she lockes, and touze him, except he did it.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in plaine trueth, <hi>Luther</hi> meaneth nothing els, but to compell such a man, to an open diuorse, as I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in answer to the preface, and as the woll discours of <hi>Luthers</hi> wordes shall make plaine, euen to a partiall reader. <hi>Serm. de matr,</hi> speaking of the causes of diuorse, Priores autem quos Christus ex matris vtero, &amp;c. The former sort, whome Christ saith to be borne eunuches from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, are those, which are called impotent, which by nature are vnable for procreation, and multiplying, In whome coldnes, and infirmities do exceede; or els are so affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in bodie, that they are not meete for the life, that is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie: such as a man maie finde both men and women. These as exempted by God, and so created, as they are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the blessing of generation and multiplying, are to be put awaie. For in them there is left no place for that word of God, increase, and multiplie: euen as if God had made some lame, or blinde, which are free from walking, or seeing. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning such, a great while a goe, I committed to writing a counsell for confessours, which they should vse, if the husband or wife came to them, to aske counsel what they should do, for as much as their yoke fellow is not able to render the due bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence; and yet the other partie can not be without it, when he feeleth sufficientlie, that the creature of God in him-selfe to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:12222:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be of habilitie. Then they slaundered me that I taught thus: that if the husband can not satisfie his wiues wantonnes, she ought to flie from him to another. But I suffered those froward triflers to lie. The sayinges of Christ and his Apostles were peruerted, and made worse: what maruaile if the same thing happen to me? But who shal be hurt thereby, they them-selues shall see at the length. Therefore after this manner I gaue counsell. If to a woman meete for the matter, there do happen a husband that is impotent, and she can not openlie be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to another man, and she vnwillinglie went against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vsage, and would not haue her credit and fame to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured, whereas in this case the Pope requireth without cause manie witnesses, that she should speake to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band after this manner; Beholde my husband, you cannot ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto me the due beneuolence, and you haue deceiued me, and my youthfull bodie, beside this you haue brought me into perill of my good name, and health, or saluation, neither is there before God anie matrimonie betweene vs. Fauour me I praie you, that I maie contract a secret matrimonie with your brother, or your next of kinne, so that you may haue the name, that your goodes maie not passe to strange heires, and suffer your selfe willinglie to be deceiued by me, as you haue deceiued me, against my will. I proceeded also further, that the husband in this case ought to assent vnto his wife, and by that meanes, to yeelde vnto her the due beneuolence, and hope of issue. And if that he refused, that she by secret flight should prouide for hir owne safegarde, and goeing into an other countrie, be married to an other man. Such counsell I gaue euen them, when as yet the feare of Antichrist did holde me. But now my minde were to giue farre other counsell, and to such a husband which should with such craft beguile a woman, I would laie hand on his lockes, and pull him vehementlie, as the prouerb is. And the same I iudge of the woman, although it be more rare, then in men. For it auaileth not anie thing to defraud the neighbour, in such waightie causes, as touch the bodie, substance, credit, and happines: it were needfull, that he should be commaunded no tably to pay for such deceitfulnes.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:12222:106"/>
Thus farre <hi>Luthers</hi> wordes truelie translated. How say you now? is not this sufficient to declare Luthers minde, that he would reuoke his former counsell of priuie contract, or flying awaie, and compell the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to an open diuorse?</p>
                     <p>But if anie man thinke this is not sufficient, you shall heare what he writeth further, concerning this matter, while he rehearseth how many causes in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie are allowed for diuorces? <hi>Decima quarta est, quam supra recensui, simaritus &amp; vxor impotentes, &amp; euirati: at<expan>

The fourteenth cause is that which I rehearsed before, if the husband, and wife be impotent and vnapt for generation: and this is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie cause among these eighteene cause, which is sufficient to dissolue the matrimonie, although the same also be bound with many conditions, before the tyrantes will permit it.</hi> And yet againe speaking of those causes, which he him-selfe allowed for diuorcement, he saieth: <hi>Quae nune personae segregari queant intersese, videbimus. Tres ergo causas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui, ob quas diuortium fieri potest, prima, quae iam &amp; in superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oribus recitataest, cùm marious &amp; vxor impotentes ad rem fuerint, membrorum, aut naturae causa, &amp;c. Now what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may be separated one from an other, we will see. Three causes I knowe for which there may be diuorce. The first, when the husband and the wife are impotent, and vnhable for the matter, through cause of their members, or nature, howsoeuer that may be, of which sufficient hath beene spoken.</hi> Is not all this as plaine as can be, that Lutherspeaketh of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce necessarie to be had in that case? As also in the same sermon afterward he teacheth, that all diuorces are to be made by publike authoritie, and with the knowledge, and consent both of the common wealth, &amp; of the Church, or of one of them at the least. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I maie rightlie vse your owne wordes against you, which you doe vniustlie abuse against M. Charke;

                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>whether he were a Papist or noe, when he gaue this first counsell to such as heard shrift,</hi> you moue the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conclude against his plaine wordes (as it seemeth) that he was none. Well, let vs heare your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. <hi>First,</hi> you saie, <hi>that many yeares after his conuersion, he sloode in feare of the Pope, and said nothing against con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> How many yeares, I beseech you? For as soone as the Pope excommunicated him, and condemned his writings, to be burned at Rome, he did open lie burne the Popes Canon law at Wittemberge, which was, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Dom.</hi> 1520. before that time he acknowledged the Popes authoritie, and humblie submitted him-selfe to his Censure, if either the grosse abuse of pardons might haue beene reformed, or he him selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced by the scriptures to haue erred. But from that time, he neuer stoode in awe of the Pope, as that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen fact declared, and there had passed but foure yeares before, since he first began to inueigh against the abuse of pardons.</p>
                     <p>Your second reason is, <hi>that it appeareth evidentlie, by his wholl discourse in the place alledged, where he saith plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie (beside other things) that the Papists did seeke advantage against him for this opinion of his, and to that ende did misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte his wordes.</hi> The wholl discouse I haue set downe, that you may see how euidentlie it appeareth. For that the Papists did slaunder him, it is graunted, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie it doth not euidentlie appeare, that <hi>Luther</hi> at that time was no Papist. For doth not one Papist slaunder another sometime? was there not spight and malice betweene friers of other orders, against them of that order that <hi>Luther</hi> was of, &amp; especially the Dominicans,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:12222:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which might cause them to peruert his words &amp; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>As for other things beside, and seeking aduantage against him for this opinion,</hi> you sucked out of your fingers ends: for in the wholl discourse there is no such matter.</p>
                     <p>Your third reason is, <hi>that Papists teach no such doctrine, but cleane contrarie:</hi> as though some Papists haue not their priuate opinions, which are not generallie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Neither is there any thing in substance, but in circumstance, contrary to the Papists doctrine, in that counsell of <hi>Luthers.</hi> For the Papists in the case of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, or frigiditie, doe graunt a diuorce, which <hi>Luther</hi> thought, without triall of law, might be made by priuate consent, or in case of the impotent persons dislent, by voluntarie departing of the other: so that this reason disproueth him not to haue beene a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist at that time, any more then the rest.</p>
                     <p>The fourth reason is, <hi>that putting such a thing in writing, he should haue beene resisted presentlie, if he had bene of your Church.</hi> But that followeth not, especiallie if the writing were not publike, but priuate to a fewe gostlie fathers, perhaps of his owne order, and house, and his aduise, or opinion onelie, not a matter obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natelie defended. And yet it appeareth, that is was notwel brooked, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his enimies had an inkeling of it.</p>
                     <p>Your last reason is, <hi>that it appeareth by his owne wordes, and the computation of time, when he wrote this booke, that he had left Papistrie a good while before.</hi> In deede if you can conuince vs by his owne wordes, that he had left Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie, when he gaue this counsell, you haue some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage against Master Charke; but that is yet to come. As for the computation of time, in which he wrote this sermon of Matrimonie, wil not helpe you to prooue, that he was no Papist, when he wrote the shrifte aduise. For he speaketh of it as of matter that was verie olde, <hi>olim,</hi> he saieth, <hi>long agoe.</hi> For the booke was written much about the time of his mariage, which was fiue yeare after his open renouncing of the

with another. And that Saint Paul here sayeth of a heathen yokefellow, the same is to be vnderstood of a false Christian, that if any of the maryed persons, would compell this other to impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not permit to follow Christ in life, then is the party free to match in maryage with whome he listeth. Which thing if it were not lawfull by Christian right, the faithfll man should be compelled to followe his vnfaithfullmate, or els against his wil, his nature and strength repugning, to remaine vnmaried with great daunger of his soule. But that Saint Paull here denieth, saying, in such, a brother or a sister is not subiect to bondage, nor captiue, nor solde as a slaue: as if he said: in other causes, where man and wife dwell together, as in the due beneuolence of mariage, and such like cases, the one is bound to the other, and is not at libertie. But in such, where the one compelleth the other to impietie, or departeth awaie, there the other is not captiue, nor compelled to cleaue to this person anie longer. And if he be not holden as a captiue, he is set at libertie, and made free, he may betroth himselfe to an other, as if the other party, that was ioyned in matrimonie to him, were dead. But what if the second mariage fall not outrightly, that the one would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the other, the husband the wife, or contrariwise, to liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Gentiles, and that impiouslie, or if the one fledde from the other, vntill the third or forth mariage were come vnto, should the husband haue license so often to mary a new wife, as the other is such a one, as we haue said alreadie, so that he should haue tenne, or more wiues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We cannot stoppe Saint Paules mouth, nor wrestle against him they that will vse his doctrine, his words are plaine, that a brother, or a sister are free from the lawe of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, if the one depart, or do not consent to dwell with the other.

Therefore where the one denieth the due seruice, then he robbeth, &amp; taketh away by force his body, which he hath giuen to another, which is properly repugnant to the right of mariage, yea and dissolueth the mariage. Therefore it is the Magistrates dutie to bridle his wife. yea and to put hir to death. This if the magistrat omit, the husband must imagine that his wife is stollen awaie and slaine by theeues, and consider how to marie another. Is it to be borne at any time, that a man should be spoiled, and robbed of his owne bodie? and is it to be tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if the wife doe take awaie, and steale hir selfe from hir husband, or be taken awaie by other?</hi>

But euerie one (saith he) hath his proper gift, one man after this manner, another man after that. Here he professeth that his desire can not be fulfilled, and that God will not bestow vpon euerie man that excellent gift. And this text lay thou vp in the innermoste closet of thy brest, For it comprehendeth manie thinges in it, and setteth forth mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, no lese then continencie. For if a man shall compare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with virginitie, certainlie virginitie is the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifte. Neuertheles, mariage (saith Paule in this place) is the gift of God, as well as continencie. A man also is more excellent then a woman, yet is shee the worke of God, as well as he: for all those thinges are aequall before God, which otherwise do differ among them-selues. Whatsoeuer he hath made, it calleth him the maker, the creatour, and Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither doth anie thing name him more highlie, then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing, whether it be great or smale.

and virginitie be of equall value: for both is the gift and creature of God, albeit the one more excellent then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they be compared one with the other.</hi> These wordes of <hi>Luther</hi> are plaine inough, to shew his opinion of the excellencie of virginitie aboue matrimonie, in some respects; allthough in regarde that they are both the gifts of God, he affirme them to be equall. For the giftes of God maie be the one more excellent then the other, (as he confesseth of virginitie) yet is not the one more the gift of God, then the other.</p>
                     <p>But all this is litle worth (you maie saie) if that, which you bring in next against him, be true.

that then he maie not well misse her 24. houres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is a fond conclusion. For the like necessitie of thinges, bindeth not to the like often vse of the same thinges. As if I should saie, meate and drinke is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for the life of man, as breathing, it followeth not, that a man must eate and drinke euerie moment, because he must breath euerie moment. Correction, we saie commonlie, is as necessarie for children, as meat and drinke, and yet I trow it followeth not, that children must of necessity be beaten once in 24. hours.

Therefore they haue no more then all other Christians.</hi> By these wordes it is euident, that Luther maketh this equallitie in the grace of regeneration, &amp; the common effects thereof, not in the speciall gifts that follow, according to the seueral measure of grace, that God giueth to euerie one, and therefore it is out of season to dispute here, of the degrees of rewardes, or the excellencie of Gods giftes, in some more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: no nor of the merit of good works, except you wil saie, that the grace of regeneration is giuen according to merit.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:12222:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
effect, as not to discourage men from doing good, but to dissuade them from trusting in their owne doing, when it is at the best. And seeing there is so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in the best deedes of men, he encourrageth men to labour more toward perfection. He teacheth men therefore, to a scribe to the grace of God, that which is properlie his and to acknowledge their owne infirmity, which without his grace can do nothing but euill: which grace secing it is sufficient for vs, in that his power is made perfect in our weakenes, there is no discouragement, either vnto faith, or good workes: for the sufficiencie of his grace shall comforte vs in faith, and the strength of his mercie, shalbe glorious in our infirmitie. Wherefore this Doctrine of Luther, doth no more discourage men from doing good, then he that saith, whosoeuer hitteth not the pricke, doth misse the marke, doth discourage men from shooting as nighe as they can. The second example of impietie is, when he saith, <hi>A man hath not in his power to doe euell. Whereby</hi> (saie you) <hi>how doth he encourage all lewde people to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, deliuering them from the fault thereof?</hi> But <hi>Luther</hi> doth neither of both. For albeit he say, that it is not in the power of man, to make his waies euill, because noe man hath anie power to do anie thing, but from God, <note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> in whome we liue, mooue, and haue our beeing: yet doth he not deliuer the wicked man from the fault of his wickednes, because he sinneth willinglie, though he can do nothing els but sinne, being destitute of the grace of God, and therefore sinneth necessarilie: for proofe whereof <hi>Luther</hi> alledgeth <hi>Augustine de spiritu &amp; litera. cap.</hi> 4. saying, <hi>Liberum arbitrium sine gratia non valet, nisi ad peccandum, &amp;c. freewill without grace auaileth not, but to commit sinne, &amp;c.

Via enim hominis est ea, quam ipsi vocant naturálem virtutem faciendi quod est in se. Ecce haec non est in arbitrio hominis, seu liberi arbitrij.

Ieremie cap. 10. saith thus: I know O Lord, that a mans waies is not in his owne handes, neither is it in man to direct his owne steppes. what could be said more plainlie? if a mans owne waie, and his owne steppes be not in his owne power, how shall the waie and steppes of God be in his power? for the waie of man is that, which they call the natural power of doing that which is in him. Beholde this is not in the will of man, or of freewill. What is free will then, but a thing of title and name onelie? How can a man prepare him selfe to good, when there is not in his power so much as to make his wates euill: for God gouerneth euen the euill workes in the vngodlie, as he saith in the 16. of the Prouerbes. God hath made all thinges for him-selfe, euen the wicked man against the euill daie, and Rom. 1. God hath deliuered them into a reprobate minde, to do those thinges which are not conuenient.</hi> All power of doing is of God, whether it be good or euil that is donne. For the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer could not liue, nor lift vp his hand, but by the power which he hath of God; who also ordereth euen the wickednes of the murtherer to good, either for the punishment of him that is slaine, or for his reward, if he be slaine for the defence of his trueth, and in a good cause, and euermore turneth it to his glorie. Yet is not the malice of the murtherer from God, nor the murtherer deliuered from the fault of his wickednes; because he doth not intend therein to serue God, but his owne crueltie. And this is that which <hi>Luther</hi> doth both saie and meane, far from the slaunderous reporte
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:12222:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this malitious cauiller, as his owne words do beare witnes.</p>
                     <p>The third example of impiety is, that Luther teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>that to fight against the Turke, is to resist God him-selfe: whereby</hi> (saie you) <hi>what a path maketh he to the empire of infidelitie?</hi> But in truth, Luther teacheth not that it is vnlawfull simplie and absolutelie, to fight against the Turke, but to fight against the Turke vnder the Popes banner.

The two experiences are these. First, that all praiers and Counsells of preuailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Turkes, haue beene hither to frustrate, and the strength of the Turke is increased by our warres. The second is, that vnder pretext of making warre against the Turke, the Popehath vsed to rake mony to gether for their pardons: And he concludeth, that without repentance and the ouerthrow of the Popes tyrannie, there is no hope to preuaile in warre against the Turkes, because God is not on our side, butiustlie incensed against vs. <hi>Quantòrectius (saith he) faceremus &amp;c. How much better should we do, if first with our praiers, yea rather by changeing the wholl course of our life, we reconcile God vnto vs? And then that the Emperours &amp; the princes would restraine that Idole of Roome, from tyrannie, deceit, and destroying of souies. For that I also maie once prophecie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I know I shall not be heard. Except the Pope of Rome be brought vnder, all Christendome is vndonne. Let him flie, as Christ hath taught, into the mountaines, he that can; or with confidence let him offer his life to death, vnto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish murtherers. The Popedome can worke nothing, but sinne and destruction, what will you more? But who shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the Pope? Christ by the brightnes of his comming, and none other. Lord who hath beleeued our preaching? he that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:12222:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath eares to heare let him heare, and let him absteine from the Turgish warre, while the name of the Pope preuaileth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heauen. I haue said.</hi> By this you maie see, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> fauored not the empire of infidelitie; but sheweth by what meanes it maie be resisted. Againe, he forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not defense against the Turke, but inuasion of the Turke, when we maie be at peace with him. For that it is lawfull to fight against the Turke in our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense, he sheweth his opinion, <hi>in consut. Rat. Latomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anae,</hi> where he derideth the follie of Latomus, and the diuines of Louane, which racked the decree of Pope Leo to this sense, that it was needles to answer the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaties of religion: which is as great wisedome of the schoole of Louane in proceeding against Luther, <hi>as if when the Turke doth set vpon vs, which is no waies lawfull for him, and yet he will not be staid, we should send the diuines of Louane embassadors vnto him, which should saie vnto him, It is not lawfull for thee to fight, and if thou do, we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee, and so suffer him to raunge at his pleasure, and yet boast that we haue gotten the victorie. Nay (saith he) let vs laie aside praiers and all spirituall armour, and cease to resist the deuill, denouncing vnto him, and saying: It is not lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for thee to trouble the Church of God.</hi> So that <hi>Luther</hi> by these wordes declareth his iudgement, that it is as lawfull for vs, and as necessarie, with bodelie armour to defend our selues against the <hi>Turke</hi> assailing vs, as it is to fight against the deuill, with spirituall armour, and to confute enemies of the trueth by the word of God.</p>
                     <p>For a fourth example of impietie, you adde, <hi>when he reprehended the Pope, for defining beside scripture, that the soule is immortall, and calleth it a monster of the dunghill of Rome, what ground of impietie doth he not laie?</hi> In deed if <hi>Luther</hi> should denie the immortalitie of the soule, as Pope Iohn the, 23. did, and was therefore conuicted, and condemned in the Counsell of Constance, wee would accurse <hi>Luthers</hi> memorie, as much as the Popes. <note place="margin">Sess. 11.</note>

But if <hi>Luther</hi> reprehended the Pope, for deliuering that vpon the creditte of his owne definition, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which is manifestlie grounded vpon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of holie scriptures, what a slaunderous penne haue you? He was charged by the Collectors, <hi>art. 37.</hi> to haue saide thus. <hi>Certum est, in manu Ecclesiae, &amp;c. It is certaine, that it is not in the hand of the Church, or of the Pope at all, to decree articles of the faith, nay nor yet lawes of manners, and good workes: To this article Luther answereth thus. Probo hunc sic, &amp;c. This article I prooue thus. 1. Cor. 3. No man can lay any other foundation, beside that which is alreadie laide, which is Iesus Christ. Here thou hast the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation laid by the Apostles: but euerie article of faith is part of this foundation: therefore none other article can be laid, then is alreadie laid? There may be builded vpon, as the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith. And therefore the Pope ought to be laide, and builded vpon the same foundation, but not to lay any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for all things to be beleeued are fully set forth in the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Yet I permit that the Pope may make articles of faith to them that beleeue in him: such as these are; That the bread and wine are transsubstantiated in the sacrament: That the essence of god doth neither beget, nor is begotton: That the soul is the substantiall forme of the bodie: That he him seife is the Emperour of the world, &amp; King of heauen, and an earthly God: That the soull is immortall. And all those infinite monsters in the Romish dunghill of decrees, that such as his faith is, such may be his Gospell, such his beeleeuers, &amp; such his Church, and that like lippes may haue like lettice, and the cup a couer meete for it. But we which are Christians, and not Papanes, doe know that there is nothing pertaining either to faith or good manners, which is not abundantlie set forth in the holie scriptures: that there is neither authoritie nor place for men to decree any other thing.</hi> These wordes declare, that what doctrine is true, and needefull to be knowne, must be receiued from God by the holie scriptures; not from the Popes decrees, or from any mortall mans au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. It is maruaile you doe not charge <hi>Luther,</hi>

with holding the pluralitie of Gods, because here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the Pope, for defining, that the essence of god can neither beget, nor be begotton, as wel, as with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the immortality of the soul. both which articles are to be taken out of the holie scriptures, not from the authoritie of the Popes definition. For though the Pope define any thing which is true, yet it must not be receiued vpon his creditte, but vpon the authoritie of Gods worde. And seeing the Popes decrees doe containe such a number of vntruethes, the articles of faith from the Popes decrees may receiue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, rather then authoritie. But all thinges must be examined according to the worde of God wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which is the truth, yea euen the scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the mouth of the deuill. Againe, I wish the reader to consider, how truelie you saie, that <hi>Luther cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that opinion of the immortalitie of the soule, a monster of the dunghill of Rome,</hi> when he speaketh of the infinite monsters of falsehoode, that are found in the dunghill of the Popes decrees, where of he maketh no expresse mention in answere to this article.</p>
                     <p>The last example of impiety is, when <hi>Luther affirmeth, and mantaineth, that neither man, nor Angell on earth, can laie any one lawe vpon any one Christian, further then he will him-selfe. What foundation</hi> (say you) <hi>doth not he ouerthrow of all Christian commmon wealthes.</hi> Luthers short answere to this, is. <hi>Hoc non de ciuilibus legibus, sed de Ecclesiasticis dixi, &amp; est sententi a Pauli. Coll. 2. This I speake not of ciuill lawes, but of Ecclesiasticall lawes, and it is the sentence of Saint Paul, Coll. 2.</hi> What foundation now doth he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, or teach, of any Christian common wealth, when he speaketh of the freedome of conscience, from all constitutions of men? These be the great <hi>monsters of impiety, which cut the sinewes of al vertue, &amp; do open the high way to all dissolution.</hi> Wil you neuer be ashamed, to slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their doctrine, which you are not hable to confute?</p>
                     <p>But now <hi>for the bodelie and sensible conference of Luther

with the deuill, you wonder with what face Master Charke can denie it:</hi> &amp; we wonder with what mouth you can affirme it. That the Tygurines giue testimonie of it, is a lie, as I haue shewed before. And the wholl discourse of Luthers wordes shall make manifest, that his confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is onelie of a spirituall fight in minde, &amp; no bodelie conference, as Master Charke answered at the first. His wordes in his booke, <hi>de missa priuata, &amp; vnctione sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> are these. <hi>Sed forsitan agnoscatis quàm firmis nitatur columnis vestra causa, si in horam incidatis tentationum.

Contigit me semel sub mediam noctem subitò expergefieri. Ibi Satan mecum caepit eiusmodi disputationem.

But peraduenture you may acknowledge vpon how sure pillers your cause leaneth, if you fall into the howre of tentation. I will make my confession before you reuerend &amp; holy fathers: giue me good absolutition, which I wish may hurt you least. It happened that once I waked sodainlie about midnight. There Satan began this disputation with me. Hearken, saith he, thou verie wel learned Doctor Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. thou knowest also, that thou hast saide the priuate Masse by the space of, 15. yeares, almost euerie daie: what if such priuate Masses were horrible idolatrie, &amp;c?</hi> These words are manifest that Luther speaketh of a spirituall temptation, such as euen good men are subiect vnto, in which Sathan obiecteth vnto the conscience of men, such things wherein they haue offended God moste greeuouslie.</p>
                     <p>The atguments that the deuill layeth against him, are not so much against the Masse, as against Luthers sinne, to bring him in dispaire for saying masse, being a sinfull man, as appeereth by these wordes which he attributeth to the deuill. <hi>Prome vbi scriptum est, quód ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo impius, incredulus, possit assistere altari Christi, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Bring forth where it is written, that an vngodly man, an vnbeeleeuer may stand at the altar of Christ, and consecrate, and make the sacrament in the faith of the Church: where hath God bidden or commaunded this?</hi> For Luther had defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him-selfe, and sought to quiet his conscience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was an annointed priest, because he celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the faith of the Church, although he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie in respect of the weakenes of his owne faith, &amp; the multitude of his sinnes.

                        <hi>These three wordes (the deuill is a lyar) I should not haue knowne, vntil now, except you most notable diuines had taught me. If I were a Papist, vnexpert of all temptations, whome Satan would not neglect, beeing carles, and snorting, as he neglecteth them that follow their lusts, &amp;c. I should be such a Giant also, stout and valiant against the enemie, that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. If you should beare the stripes of the deuill, and heare his disputations, you should not longsing the song of the Church, &amp; after the accustomed manner. I verilie doe see sufficientlie in Dauid, and the rest of the Prophets, how greeuouslie they wrestle and groone in those combates, and such like, against the deuill, and his horrible violence. And Christ him-selfe (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though without sinne) in what aboundance of teares, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, did he siriue for vs, in those conflictes against Satan For he vrgeth mans heart exceedinglie, &amp; ceaseth not, except he be driuen backe with the word of God. And I am plainlie perswaded, that Emser and Oecolampadius, and such like, were sodendlie slaine wieh these horrible stripes, and shakings. For <note place="margin">Rash iudge ment.</note> the harte of man cannot abide this horrible and vnspeakeable violence, except God be with him. For Satan in the twinckling of an eie, sodendlie ouerwhelmeth the wholl minde with terrors and darkenes, and if he finde nothing but a man vnarmed, and not instructed in the word, as it were with a litle finger, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmeth him all at once. It is true in deed, that he is a lyar, but his lies are not of a simple craftes man, but much more craftie, and prepared to deceiue, then mans capacitis can comprehend. He doth in such sort set vpon a man, &amp; take holde of him, and that sound truth which can not be denied, and that he vrgeth, and sharpeneth so craftelie and subtillie, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it so cunninglie, that he may deceiue them, that take the best heede of him, &amp;c. As, that cogitation, which strake the heart of Iudas, was true: I haue betraied innocent blood, this could not Iudas denie. But this was a lie, therefore I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of the grace of God. And yet the deuill vrged this lie, this cogitation so violentlie, that Iudas was not able to ouercome it, but despaired. Therefore good brother, Sir Papist, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill doth not lie, when he accuseth or vrgeth the greatenes of</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:12222:121"/>
                        <hi>sinne. For thereby he hath two graue witnesses, that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproouable, the law of God, and our owne conscience. I can not denie but I haue sinned, I cannot denie my sinne to be greate, I cannot denie that I am guiltie of death and damnation, &amp;c. but there Satan lyeth, when he vrgeth further, that I should dispaire of grace: As Cain said, my sinne is greater, &amp;c. And in this conflicte thou hast neede of the helpe of God from heauen, that either some brother be present, which may comforte thee outwardlie with the promises of God, or that the holie ghost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie in thy heart, through thy brothers word, do lift vp, and encourage the, and comfort thy heart, that thou maist deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thus with thy selfe, I haue in deede confessed before the deuill, beeing conuicted by the law of God, that I sinned, that I am condemned as Iudas: but I turne my selfe vnto Christ with Peter, and looke backe to his infinite benefite, and merit, &amp;c. he hath condemned all horrible condemnation, &amp;c.</hi> Now I reporte me to euerie indifferent reader, whether <hi>Luther</hi> doe not speake here of a spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicte, or tentation vnto desperation, for his saying of priuate masse, after he knew that it was idolatrie, not of any bodelie conference, about the abolishing of the masse. Secondlie, that Luther doth not yeald to the perswasions of the deuill, wherewith the defender confesseth, that both good and euill men are assaulted, but according to the difference by him obserued, resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth the assault, and obtaineth victorie thorough Christ.</p>
                     <p>But now let vs heare what arguments our defender bringeth, to prooue this bodelie conference. First, <hi>the confession of the Tigurine Caluenists.</hi> but that is false. The Tigurines did onelie reprooue Luther for his intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat inuectiues, and naming of deuilles so often; our wise defender concludeth, <hi>ergo</hi> Luther had deuilles. Secondly, he saith, <hi>it is euident that this conference was more then spirituall, by the deuilles preface, wherein he calleth the frier, right learned Doctor, according to the vaine of pride, wherewith he saw him puffed vp, &amp;c.</hi> But what reasonable
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:12222:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man seeth not, that this presace of his title, was but a bitter scorne of the deuill? no flattering speach, to <hi>make him readie to receiue his impressions,</hi> as the defender saith. As for the sound of Satans voice, described in the place alledged in the Censure, there is none such. For the booke <hi>demissa angulari,</hi> so often alledged by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, is none other, but this, <hi>de missa priuata, &amp; vnctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne sacerdotum,</hi> as appeareth by the verie wordes, noted by the Papists, <hi>in lib. de missa angulari,</hi> which are found here in this boke, <hi>de missa priuata, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore the sound of Satans voice, is but some papists dreame vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, which our defender would now hide, vnder the title of <hi>de missa angulari.</hi> The third reason is, <hi>for that Luther confesseth some of his fellowes to haue beene slaine by this conference.</hi> What he saith in his rash iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Emser, and Oecolampadius, where of the one was a Papist, the other a Protestant, you heaue hard in his own words, which prooueth no bodely conference. For those terrible blowes and shakinges, where of he speaketh, are no more bodelie, then the busfeting of Satan, where of Saint Paul speaketh. And who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7.</note> but that by such spirituall buffeting of Satan, a man that is ouercome with exceeding sorrow, may sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie die? except he be assisted and comforted by the grace of Christ, as Saint Paul was. <hi>Finally, the bushell of <note place="margin">de missa an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulari.</note>
                        </hi> sault (saith our defender) <hi>which Luther confesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to haue eaten together with the deuill, prooueth that he had bodelie conference with him.</hi> First, the booke is not extant, and if any such were, yet it prooueth no bodelie conference. For no man is so madde to thinke, that the deuill and Luther did corporallie eate salte together. But the eating of busshelles of salte with one, is a prouerbe, signifying long experience of him, as Tullie in his booke <hi>de amicitia</hi> vseth that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a man must eate manie bussheles of salte with one, before he ioyne in friendshipe with him, that is, know him, and trie him throughlie. And this
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:12222:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(if Luther speake of eating of salte, with the deuill) his meaning is, that he had long experience of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults and temtations of the deuil: as Saint Paul saith, we are not ignorant of the deuises of Satan, nor of any bodelie conference, such as Prateolus out of Lindanus <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 11.</note> doth report on these wordes. <hi>Nec defuere virifide dignis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simi, qui sibi visum demonem corporaliter cum Luthero con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersari adfirmarent. Neither haue there wanted men most worthie of credit, which did affirme, that they haue seene the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill corporallie conuersant with Luther.</hi> O pleasant inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At lest they should haue told vs their names, the place, the time, the manner, the shape in which they sawe the deuill conuersant with Luther: and if he were not in anie strange shape, how they know that it was the deuill. But there is no lie so incredible, that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth anie further proofe to slaunder Luther, then that <note place="margin">Censure. Defense.</note> some papists haue affirmed it.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Luthers death, which the papists af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to haue died. dronken, and slaine by the deuill, our defender saith, (<hi>as it is thought</hi>) and (as it is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecturrd</hi>) but the wordes of Hosius, as they are cited by Lindanus and Prateolus, are absolute. <hi>Tandem sub vitae finem, <note place="margin">Prateol. in Luther.</note> (inquit Hosius) reipsaeuenit. Probè. n. potus &amp; hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, postridie manè in lecto repertus est mortuvs. At length toward the ende of his life, saith Hosius, it came to passe in deed (namelie that he was in a moment slaine by his familiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill)</hi> for being well <hi>tipled and merie, the next daie in the morning he was found dead in his bed.</hi> The defender be-like being ashamed of the matter, doth qualifie it with thought, and a <hi>coniecture,</hi> raueth against Master Charke, for opposing Sleidan onelie against three popish witnesses, whome he quoteh: as though one writer, receiuing information of the manner of Luthers death, from them that were present, is not more to be credited, then an hundred Papists, which faine of malice, or receiue of malitious rumors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie one witnes of credite, whatsoeuer may sound
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:12222:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the slaunder, and the defacing of Luther. For the credit of Sleidans storie, I referre men to his owne Apologie, in which he declareth, that the chiefe sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance thereof, is taken out of publike writings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes; which is sufficient to iustifie him against all Papists in the worlde, from any purpose of lying or faining, especiallie seeing he doth not interpose his iudgement of matters in controucrsie, as Historians commonlie vse to doe; but onelie reporteth them as he found them in publike monuments. And therefore deserueth more credit with all indifferent men, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer Latomus bableth of eleuen thousand lies, or Lindane reporteth of Charles the Emperour, which Surius ascribeth to Iulius Pflugius Bishoppe of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, although he affirme the like of Charles the Emperour.</p>
                     <p>But now you wil beare vs down with a sound testimo ny of <hi>Iustus Ionas, that was present at Luthers death, and was his deare friend, &amp; his cooke,</hi> to prooue that he was drunk. But why do you cal <hi>Iustus Ionas Luthers</hi> cooke. It is wel knowne, that Iustus Ionas was a reuer end learned man, and a Doctor in Diuinitie, he had as litle skill in cookerie as you. Your answere will be, that Ponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus the Popish Chronicler so calleth him. And surelie I should meruaile what monster were meant thereby, but that I reade in Surius, that his name was <hi>Iustus Cocus,</hi> and that he called him-selfe (as he saith) Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Ionas. For Papists can tell euerie mans right name better then him-selfe. So they trifle with the names of Caluine and Luther. But to the purpose. What saith Iustus Ionas, or Ionas Cooke, if you will haue his name so? Forsooth that Luther, a litle before his death, said to him, and Coelius, and certaine other, that were present, <hi>Orate Deum pro Domino Deonostro, &amp; eius Euangelio. Praie to God for our Lord God, and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell.</hi> Surius addeth further; <hi>vt ei bene succedat, &amp;c. that it may haue good successe, because the Councell of Trent, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:12222:123"/>
he abhominable Pope doe set them-selues against it. Here</hi> (saie you) <hi>Luther praied for Christ at his death, which either you must ascribe to drunkennes, or to some worse affection, he beeing in his perfect wittes, as the author affirmeth.</hi> And is it with you a signe of drunkennes, to praie that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ vpon earth, and his Gospell may haue good sucesse? You would haue beene as angrie, as the high priests and scribes were, if you had beene in their time, with the children, that cried in the temple, <hi>Osan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na to the sonne of Dauid,</hi> that is, Lord send health or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie to the sonne of Dauid, blessed be the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our father Dauid, that commeth in the name of the Lord. You might cauill as well, that Christ hath taught vs to praie for God the father, when he taught vs to praie, that his name might be sanctified, his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come, his will be done. If Luther had said sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, praie to God for our Lord and God Christ, It had beene an hard construction, to inferre vpon those onelie wordes, that he was drunke: but now when he expresseth, that he would haue them praie for the successe of Christes Gospell, which was oppugned by Antichrist, and his blaspemous Chapter of Trent, no man, except he were madde with malice, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this speach proceeded of drunkennes. The Apostles Act. 4. doe pray vnto God to stretch forth his hande vnto healing, <hi>that signes and wonders may be done in the name of his holie sonne Iesus:</hi> doth this praier argue any euill affection in the Apostles, against the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Christ, which had giuen them power to worke miracles in his name. None but an Arrian would so gather. Noe more of this praier of Luther, that God will defend the Gospell of Christ, against the enemies thereof, any reasonable man would conclude, that Luther was drunke. Prateolus out of Lindane against the testimonie of Iustus Ionas, Michaell, Caelius, and Ioannes Aurifaber, which were present, with manyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned and noble persons at Luthers death, hath
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:12222:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing to oppose, but <hi>tamen haud temere, R. P. Hosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um literis prodidisse credas, Lutherum bene potum &amp; hilarem, &amp;c. Yet belecue thou not, that the reuer end father Hosius hath rashlie committed to writing, that Luther beeing well tippled and merie, was the next day found dead in his bedde.</hi> So these impudent Papists, will haue one enemy of Luther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing absent many hundred miles from the place of his death, bringing noe witnes, argument, or probabilitie of truth, but his bare worde, to be credited before so many learned and noble persons, as were present, and eie witnesses, concerning the rumor of Martine Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers departure out of this life. But Hosius was a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe and a Cardinall forsooth: as though a maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Papist, when he hath a white rochet put on his backe, or a redde hat clapt on his head, were sopriui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged by his titles, that he must needes be credited though he lie neuer so impudentlie.</p>

                        <hi>Touching the dissention of Luther with others, that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Gospell,</hi> Master Charke doth graunt that in some points he disagreed from them, and yet he saith, there was a singular care among them of the vnitie in the Gospell. But this our defender taketh in so euill part, that he calleth it in tollerable impudencie, speciallie that for profe thereof, Master Charke citeth the acte of concorde agreed vpon at Marpuge, Anno. 1529. vpon the reporte of Brentius (which since hath shewed him selfe an obistinate heretike, and author of the opinion of the vbiquitie of Christes bodie) who reporteth that the Zuinglians were vanquished, and yet he giueth them this testimonie, that they desired with teares to be called bretheren, which Luther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused. But what the agreement was, the booke of Acts printed both in Latine and Dutch doth testifie vnto the worlde. The 15. Chapter of which conuention, con cerning the matter in controuersie was this: <q>

betweene Caluine, Melancthon, Vitus, Theodorus, and other.</p>
                     <p>And now we are come to the odious inuectiues against the liues of Caluine, and Beza, taken out of a vile libell, written by Ierome Bolsec, an vnlearned, vngodlie, and vnshamefast knaue; who once was a Carmelite frier, and flying from his cloister, came first aud deceiued the Dachesse of Ferrara for a time, but his knauerie being knowne, and he espied, he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished from her; and then within three daies studie, he professed him selfe to be a Phisition, and came to Geneua; where being contemned of the learned in that science, he would take vpon him to be a diuine, &amp; openly inueighed against the doctrine of prae destinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not as a Papist, out as a meere Pelagian, for which he was condemned and banished the Citie, and after for like troubles, he was twyse banished the territorie of Berna. After that, when he thought the Churches of Fraunce should haue continued in peace, he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned repentance, and sought reconciliation of the Church of Geneua, labouring ambitiouslie to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the ministery: but when warre &amp; persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on befel vnto the Church, contrary to his expectation, he returned to his leech craft, and reuolted againe to Poperte: and in satisfaction of his Apostasie hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and refined these lies against Caluine and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za. Anp this is that reuerend man whome our defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der commendeth, for wisedome, learning, and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie.

                     <p>But because our defender will needes make a briefe recapitulation of the matter, and tell vs that there were six reformers of all our English Religion, it shall not be amisse to consider what waightie matter he can bring. <hi>The first</hi> (saith he) <hi>was Luther him-selfe, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth expressely him-selfe without glose, that the first motion thereof came from the diuill him-selfe in proper person, lib. de missa priuata &amp; vnctione sacerd.</hi> How false and slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous this reporte is, the reader maie see, by Luthers owne wordes, before sette downe. <hi>The second, Carolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stadius</hi> (saith the defender) <hi>was by Luthers procurement, as vnworthie to liue among Christians, banished out of all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the Duke of Saxonie and so ended his life misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in labouring the ground, as your owne Historiographer Slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan writeth, lib. 5.</hi> Sleidan in deede doth write, that he was banished, as one that seemed to fauour the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes: but he writeth also, that by Luthers procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was admitted to purge him-selfe of that crime. But <hi>that he ended his Life miserabliein labouring the ground,</hi> Sleidan our owne historiographer doth not
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:12222:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
write, and it is an impudent lie, as it is manifest by your owne Historiographer Surius, who in Anno 1530. writeth, that Carolostadius of an Archdeacon of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberge, became a deacon of Zurich, and after the death of Zuinglius, he remooued to Basile, and there in the ministerie of a Zuinglian Church (as he saith) ended his miserable life miserablie. Certaine it is that Carolostadius was a vaine man, and had great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, yet it is a shame to lie vpon the deuill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third,</hi> you saie, <hi>Oecolampadius, was so lewd a man, as by Luthers affirmation, he was slaine by the deuill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: lib. de missapriuata &amp; vnct. sacerd. or as some other thinke, killed him selfe with his owne handes. Lind. dial. 3. dubit.</hi> It is true that <hi>Luther</hi> vttereth his rash and falle sentence of Oecolampadius vpon occasion ofsome fly ingtale, that he had heard of the soden death of Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius. She like he affirmeth in the same place of Emser the Papist: if his authoritie be good for the one, whie is it not for the other? But the trueth is, that Oecolampadius as he liued holilie and vp right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, so he made a Godlie and quiet end, and was sicke in his bedde 15. daies before he departed, as is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in the storie of his death, set forth by that reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend learned man <hi>Symon Grinaeus,</hi> who was present, and saw, and heard all that he writeth, with manie more witnesses of sufficient credit. In his sicknes he was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited by all his friendes, both of the Senators of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersitie, and of the people. So that it is a most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les fiction, either that he died sodainlie, or that he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himselfe, as that malitious Papist Lindan writeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fourth reformer,</hi> saith our defender, <hi>was Zuinglius, who hauing receaued the proofes of his new doctrine of the sacra ment, from a spirit in the night (as him-selfe writeth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that he knew not whether he were black or white) liued in such sorte, as he was detested by Luther, and finallie stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp the Suitsers his countrimen to fight, was slaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the field, and his bodie burned.</hi> That Zuinglius was
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:12222:126"/>
flaine in the field, and his bodie burned by the Papists, it is confessed: but that he stirred vp his countriemen to battell (which were prouoked by intollerable iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) it is false. He went with his countriemen as a Preacher, according to their custome, and it pleased God, that he was martyred by the enemies of the trueth. As for the proofes that he receaued from a spirit in the night, you shall heare the wholl matter in his owne words. <hi>lib. de subsid. Euchar.</hi> But first you must vnderstand, that he rehearseth the whole storie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the abolishing of the masse at Zurich, &amp; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that a certaine scribe opposed him-selfe against it, the 12. of Aprill, and obiected that those phrases (vnto which Zuinglius compared the wordes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, <hi>This is my bodie</hi>) the seede is the word of god, the fielde is the world, the enuious man is the deuill. &amp;c. were spoken parabolically. Zuinglius maintained that neuertheles, there was in those sayings the same trope or figure, that is in the wordes of the supper: so the decree was made concerning the abolishing of the masse. After this he writeth after this manner.</p>

There remained yet not the lest endeuour; namelie that we should bring forth examples which wereioined with no parable. Therefore we began to thinke of all that we could, to vnfolde all that we could, but yet none other example, came to minde, but that is set forth in our commentarie, or els whatsoeuer came to minde, was like vnto those examples. But when the 13. daie drew neere, I tell the trueth, &amp; that so true, that though I would conceale it, my conscience compelleth me to vtter that which the Lord bestowed vpon me, being not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to how great reproches, and scornes I lay forth my selfe; when (I say, the 13. daie of Aprill drew neere, me thought as I was a sleepe, that with great tediousnes I was againe disputing with the scribe my aduersarie, that my mouth was so stopped, that my tongue denying her office, I was not able to speake out that which I knew to be true: which trouble, as dreames are wont sometimes to mocke men in the deceitfull night (for here I declare no higher matter then a dreame, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning my selfe, although it is no light matter that I learned by this dreame, thankes be to God to whose onelie glorie I vtter these thinges) which vexation (I saie) seemed to trouble me vehementlie.

                     <p>MAster Charke being charged to haue falsified the Iesuites wordes, defendeth his reporte by testimony of <hi>Donatus Gotuisus,</hi> out of whose treatise con cerning that matter, he professed at the first to rehearse their wordes. And that it is lawfull for him to charge them vpon an other mans reporte, he bringeth exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Censurer, who reporteth intollerable slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Luther</hi> vpon the credit of <hi>Lindan, Cocleus, Hosius.</hi> This replie the defender thinketh not sufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he bringeth three witnesses, and Master Charke but one. As though three false witnesses were of more credit, then one that speaketh the trueth, after it is tried and knowne. For what <hi>Luther</hi> affirmeth, his owne writinges do declare, so that if a thousand Papistes would sweare against him, that he hath written other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then he did, his writinges being open to al mens vew, the world might condemne them al of falsehood. And if <hi>Gotuisus</hi> haue reported vntruelie, the blame is
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:12222:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his, and not Master Charkes, who citeth his reporte. But in the end it shall appeare, that <hi>Gotuisus</hi> hath done the Iesuites no wrong, but either in their owne words, or in their meaning, truelie deliuered the substance of their doctrine, howsoeuer they maie cauill to cloake the matter, as the defender here compareth Master Charke to a bird taken by the legge for lying, and seeking euerie hole to escape.</p>
                     <p>The first is, that he chargeth the Censurer with foure lies in one sentence: this the defender calleth <hi>most ridiculous accusations, and asketh if men do not pitie the poore minister, that stoopeth to so miserable helpes for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe:</hi> so he laugheth at his lies, when he can not iustifie them, and turneth the woll matter to a scoffe, when he hath not one word to answer for him-selfe. he think eth not the matter worthty he defense, because the lies are madein no waighty causes. And yet a man may iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie note how looselie he writeth, that hath no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of trueth, the nto rappe out four lies in so short a compas of time and place. What wil he do in maters of greater importance? I neede not aske: for you may see how often he hath beene taken in most impudent and shameles assertions, such as maketh me often to thinke that he is no professor of diuinitie, which hath anie grounded knowledge him-selfe, but some cosening Copesmate chosen out for his impudencie and verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, to broch such stuffe for vnlearned readers, as the note gatherers were ashamed to put forth vnder their owne names.</p>
                     <p>But to returne to our starting holes, the second saith sit defender, is, <hi>that Master Charke and his fellowes, draw all matters against the state, as Pasie the madde man dealt with his Master to defend him-selfe, when he was neere a shrewd turne, for some prankes plaid with his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> and here by name <hi>doctor Fulk is charged with this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize, and with parasiticall and palpable flatterie,</hi> who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth <note place="margin">

But in trueth Mastet Charke needed not any coards to draw matters against the state out of your writinges: for you offer frankelie more, then it would be your ease to answer, if you durst shew your face. And truelie he said that you charge the Magistrates and Bishoppes, as if they were careles, what doctrine is deliuered to the people, when you ask <hi>what he and his fellowes dare auouch in their sermons, speeches, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, which they are sure shall neuer come to exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third <hi>hole is, by laying all his lies vpon one Gotuisus: where his falsehood appeereth, in that he did not in all his whole discourse so much as once name, or quote his auther Gotuisus, either in text or margent. MasterCharke</hi> answered before, that the authors name is quoted in the most bookes, &amp; so it is to be seene, in the margent ouer against those wordes of the text, <hi>out of a treatise concerning this matter I haue enterlaced their owne wordes, as they are to be found in the same booke.</hi> Where the quotation is <hi>Donati Gotui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si, lib. de fide Iesu &amp; Iesuitarum.</hi> This being to be read ofeuetie childe in manie hundred copies, of what metrall is his face made of, that doth so confidentlie denie it, because (as he saieth, beleeue him ifyou list) <hi>he could neuer happen vpon anie copies, that had him quoted.</hi> And if somehad it, he asketh why al had not? as though he were ignorant, that a fault, or an omission escaped in a fewe copies, maie be reformed or added in the rest, when it is espied. The other surmises that follow, whie <hi>Master Charke</hi> should not quote his author <hi>Gotui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> are vaine, seeing he hath quoted him, as also the other charges of treacherie, and malitious meaning, for so much as there is no proofe of them, but his bare word, are as easilie denied by vs, as they are by him affirmed. If in the particulars that follow, he be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring anie substantiall matter, to confirme anie one of them, it maie be considered, as the cause shall require, and occasion be offered.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe first article of the Iesuites doctrine, you say, is this: <hi>It is not sinne whatsoeuer is against the worde of God.</hi> Here you charge Master Charke with guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing, and that you take vpon you to shew, by an example of a lawyer that should saie, <hi>it is not treason whatsoeuer is against the Prince and common wealth,</hi> which soundeth odiouslie, as though nothing committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Prince and common wealth, were treason. But in what asses eares should it so sound? when euerie reasonable man must needes vnderstand, that there be offences against the Prince and common wealth, as fellonie, misprision of treason, Mayhem, and such like, which yet are not offences in so a high a degree, as treason is. The thing in question you confesse, <hi>that there is something that doth repugne the law of God, and yet is no sinne at all, if it be without will or consent, as the first motions of concupiscence are.</hi> Another cauill you haue, that his authors haue not onelie these wordes, but somewhat more, as when they saie, <hi>Sinne is not, whatsoeuer repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the law of God, but, &amp;c.</hi> If Master Chark had denied the rest, it were somewhat that you saie: but seeing you graunt they haue all that he rehearseth, he is without blame, and whether it be part of a definition, it skilleth not, seeing it is part of their affirmation. A third cauill is, <hi>that he chaungeth the place of the negatiue, which in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming propositions altereth often the sense: as for peccatum est non quicquid, he saith, non est peccatum quicquid.</hi> If Master Charkes chaunging in this place did alter the sense, you would haue tolde vs of it: but seeing the sense is all one, the chaunge is no fault. <hi>Lastlie, for repugneth the law of God</hi> (you say) <hi>he putteth, it is against the worde of God.</hi>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:12222:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But here by your leaue you make a peece of a lie, for in his first answere he saith, <hi>it repugneth the law of God,</hi> which when he repeateth in his replie, <hi>it is against the worde of God,</hi> it can haue none other sense, then before. That you will admit as much, as the Iesuites in word or sence haue vttered, it is as much as Master Charke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
                     <p>Now to the obiection against the Iesuites definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made by Master Charke: you saie that <hi>to prooue that sinne is no act, he obiecteth that iniustice is a sinne, and yet no act.</hi> He were a poore sophister that could not espie your paultrie in this place. Master Charke doth not prooue that sinne generallie taken is no act: but he affirmeth that there is some sinne which is not an act. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iesuites in their definition haue not geuen the right <hi>Genus</hi> or materiall cause of sinne. Now for <hi>iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> (to passe ouer your knauish example of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution <hi>of Campian and his fellowes, so innocent and learned men, by great iniustice</hi>) You take vpon you to teach Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Charke an high point of learning, <hi>Of the difference betweene a vice that is an habite, and a sinne that is a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler fact, which perhapps</hi> (you weene) <hi>he learned not before,</hi> &amp; yet euerie young sophister in Cambridge knoweth it well enough. But Master Charke speaketh of generall iniustice (as his wordes are plaine) which is a sinne in not doing the thing commaunded, because it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest transgression of the lawe of God, whoe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth the wholl and euerie part to be fullfilled, and is the sinne of omission, which you make the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond obiection. But <hi>euerie omission,</hi> you saie, <hi>includeth an act,</hi> which is a grosse absurditie, meaning such an act as is sinne. For I maie doe a good act, while I omit a better: the omission of a better act is sinne, the doing of a good act is no sinne. To tith mint and anise, is a good act of it selfe, for it was commaunded by God, &amp; must not be omitted, yet was it sinne to omit mer cie and iustice, as the wordes of Christ are plaine; <hi>this you</hi>

                        <hi>ought to doe, and not to omit the other.</hi> The examples you bring <hi>of one resoluing not to goe to Church, Helie deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining not to punish his children, and the watchmen not to sound the trumpet, where the determination and resolution as the cause, is the principall part of the sinne,</hi> are foolish. For there maie be omission which is sinne, where there is no resolution, and determination to the contrarie, of that which should be done, but negligence, or forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes: yea there is omission which is sinne, where there is no power in vs to performe that should be done, as in all the reprobate and vnregenerate, and in the regenerate also in part, which neither doe, nor can in this life, loue God and their neighbour in such perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as the lawe of God requireth. There is omission also through ignorance of Godes lawe, which is sinne, and deserueth stripes, and yet ignorance the cause thereof, is no act, but the lacke of knowledge.</p>
                     <p>But being ouercome by scripture and reason, you flie to the authoritie of the auncient fathers, and first you quote <hi>Chrysost.

                     <p>Last of all you charge vs <hi>with that definition of Saint Augustine contra Faust. lib. 22. cap. 27. Peccatum est factum, vel, &amp;c. Sinne is something done, or said, or coueted against the eternall lawe.</hi> But if this were a perfect definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what needed the Iesuites to frame another, according to whose definition, this of Saint Augustine is larger then the word defined, and in respect of the sinne of omission, it is streighter then the terme of sinne: yet it serued Saint Augustine for his purpose in hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the facts of the Patriarches, mentioned in the scripture, which were to be praised, and which to be dispraised. As for Ambrose in the place by you quoted, <hi>lib. de paradiso, cap.</hi> 8. hath another definition, then Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, and a more perfect, taken out of Saint Iohn. <hi>Quidest enim peccatum</hi> (saith he) <hi>nisi praeuaricatio legis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinae, &amp; coelestium inobedientia praeceptorum. For what is sin, but the transgression of the lawe of God, and a disobedience of the heauenlie commaundements?</hi> This definition of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose is perfect, and maketh flatlie against you: for he that doth not that which god commaundeth, sinneth, although in the meane time, he doe some other thing that is good, or not euill, yea although he sleepe and doe nothing.</p>
                     <p>Where Master Charke doth distinguish the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ordinances of God, which are good, from the: corruption, and preuarication that is in them, which is euill, you picke a fond quarrell to him and make him to saie, <hi>that deuills and euill men doe not repugne against the law of God, and that they doe not sinne proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:</hi> Which is false, for he saith no such thing: but that euill men, as they are the creatures of God, are not against the law, but the euill in men, and so of the rest: yet euil men doe sinne properlie, and repugne
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:12222:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
against the law of God, by the euill that is in them: as in your owne example, the Phisitian cureth his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, not as he is a man, but as he is a Phisitian, and by knowledge of Phisicke, which is in him. And as for the repugnance of contrarietie, whereof the question is in the definition of sin, it is not in the creature of god, but the corruption of that good crearure. A blacke horsse is not contrarie to the colour of white, but the colour of blacke; so not an euil man, but sin of an euil man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the iustice of Gods law: So a Phitisian driueth away an ague, yet aPhisitian is not contrary to an ague, but thevertue of the medicine, which he ministreth. When euerie childe may vnderstand your cauilling, it is no meruaile, though you charge <hi>M. Chark</hi> with such absurditie, and ignorance, yea with heresie: and that out of <hi>Augustine, Tom. 8. fol. 665.</hi> not telling vs of what edition you speake, so that it were harde to finde (if it were worth the search) that which you talke of: but you are to be pardoned, for your note was vnperfect, &amp; did not expresse in what homelie, vpon what Psalme.</p>
                     <p>The second fault of the Iesuites definition, is, <hi>that they call it an humane or reasonable action, Master Charke</hi> would rather saie, <hi>a beastly or vnreasonable action, of a man indued with reason.</hi> Here you take on, and aske whether <hi>Master Charke</hi> be so vnlearned in all foundation of Philosophie? And Aristotle, and <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> are called to witnes, that sin proceedeth from the minde indued with reason: and what other thing I beseech you, doth <hi>Master Charke</hi> saie? his wordes are plaine, as I haue set them downe, and the same that you cite <note place="margin">Tom. 6. defide. cont.

It hath. a better colour that you obiect, of the morall workes
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:12222:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of iustice, temperance, &amp; other vertues in the gentils, which <hi>M. Chark</hi> wil acknowledge to be sin, and yet they seeme to be agreeable to right reason; &amp; so they are in part, so far forth as they be directed by that light, which is left in men, proceeding fró the eternal word of god: but in so much as that light shineth in darkenes, and the darkenes comprehendeth it not, no acceptable worke to God can be brought forth therebie. Yea for so much as all the morall workes of the gentiles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected not the right ende of obedience, and glorie of God, whome they knew not, their wholl actions were <note place="margin">Psa. 109. 7. Pro. 15. 8.</note> therebie vitiated, and corrupted, so that they may iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlie be called sinne. Euen as praier is turned into sin, and the sacrifice of the vngodlie is abhomination to the Lord. And <hi>M. Charke</hi> faith truelie, <hi>whatsoeuer is not of faith is sin,</hi> be it reasonable as you speake, or against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And in deede against right reason it is, that the gentiles in their morall workes, sought not to obey God according to his lawe, and therefore euen their best workes of iustice and temperance were sinne. But this is so <hi>iumpe</hi> (you saie) <hi>that an horse might be a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for that his actions proceed not of faith.</hi> In deed if <hi>Saint Paul</hi> had spoken of the actions of brute beastes, as your <hi>Saint Francis</hi> (witnes your Legend) did preach to brute beastes, you had iumped neere the matter: but when none but an asse would vnderstand <hi>Saint Paul</hi> to speake of any other actions, then such as proceede from men, you iumpe as neere as Germans lippes, that were nine mile a sunder. But you <hi>will answere to Saint Paul with S. Ambrose, that he meaneth whoesoeuer doth a thing against that, which faith prescribeth, that is against a mans own conscience, and iudgement, he sinneth.</hi> The words of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> are these. <hi>Rectè peccatum appellat quod ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">in ep. ad Rom cap. 14.</note> fit quàm probatum est. He doth rightlie call that sinne which is done otherwise then is allowed.</hi> Now this allowance or approbation, is not referred to euerie mans corrupt conscience, or ignorant iudgement as you expound it,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:12222:133"/>
but is measured by faith, which is a certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and perswasion, grounded vpon the worde of God, as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> sheweth in the 14. verse of the 14. Chap. <hi>I know &amp; am perswaded by our Lord Iesus, that nothing is vncleane of it selfe:</hi> which faith when the Gentiles had not in their workes, their works were sinne. And therfore you abuse <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> by your glose, to restreine the prescription of faith onelie to that which a man doth against his conscience and iudgement.</p>

In truth <hi>S.

If an heathen man (saiest thou) doe cloath the naked, is it sinne, because it is not of faith? yea, out of doubt, in as much as it is not of faith, it is sinne. Not because the deede it selfe, which is to cloath the naked, is sinne, but not to reioyce in the Lord of such a worke, none but an vngodlie man will denie to be sinne.</hi> This and much more to this effect, hath <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> in that place against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> which with the papists denied that such workes of the infidels were sinne. But albeit <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> be directlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, yet <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> (you thinke) may helpe you <hi>in Ezechiell: cap. 29. whoe saith thus.

Augustine</hi> at large teacheth in both the bookes and places last cited. For those good facts are of the reliques of Gods image, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together blotted out, which God doth reward as his owne worke in them: but in as much as they doe not those good deedes well, they are sinne in the doers, as <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> saieth: and therefore neither <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi> nor <hi>Saint Ierome,</hi> are against <hi>Master Charke</hi> in this cause.</p>

This difinition maie seeme to be false, but if it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently discussed, it shall be found to be most true. For that sinne is to be vnderstood therein, which is onelie sinne, and not also the punishment of sinne, as I haue shewed before, when I rehearsed certaine thinges out of my third booke of free will. Although euen those sinnes, which not vnworthelie are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sinnes not voluntarie, because they are committed either by them which know not, or which are compelled, can not be committed altogether without the will, because euen he which sinneth of ignorance, sinneth willinglie, when he thinketh that to be donne, which ought not to be donne. And he which doth not those thinges which he will, the flesh lusting against the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>

                        <hi>lusteth truelie vnwillinglie, and there in doth not what he will: but if he be ouercome, he consenteth to concupiscence wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie, and therein doth not what he will, being free from Iustice, and a seruant of sinne. And that which in children is called originall sinne, when as yet they vse not the free choise of will, is not absurdlie called also voluntarie, because being drawne from the euill will of the first man, it is made as it were comming by inheritance.</hi> The same in effect he saith <hi>C.</hi> 15. answering that he had set downe, <hi>de duabus animabus c. 14. Propterea vera est, &amp;c. That definition is true for this cause, for that, that sinne is defined which is onelie sinne, and not that sinne which is a punishment of sinne.</hi> Againe he saith. <hi>sine voluntate nullum esse petcatum, siue in opere, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue in origine: that there is no sinne without will, either in the worke, or in the beginning.</hi> By which sayings Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines iudgement is plaine, that in the particular worke, there are sinnes, that are not voluntarie; as those that come of ignorance, or compulsion, or as concupiscence &amp; original infection, yet al these may be called voluntarie in respect of the first mans offence, in whome was freedome of will, which Master Chark graunteth, and therefore that childish insultation
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:12222:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
needed not, but to shew your pride in contempt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as though al learning had beene bred with you, and were like to die, if you did not plant it in vs. Saint Augustine therefore is cleere, that that sinne which is a punishment of sinne, is not voluntarie, and that his definition (as he calleth it) was onelie of sinne, which hath none other consideration, but as sinne: his disputation being against the Manichees, which deriued sinne from an euill God, and not from the free will of man, or deuill, first created good, by the onelie good God. <hi>But you haue scripture to prooue euerie act or omission which is sin to be voluntarie: because Christ him selfe saith, that those things which do defile a man, do come from the heart,</hi> as though nothing might come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptroote, the heart of man, which is not voluntarie. You your selfe affirm, that euil thoughts are not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, which he saith come from the heart. Mat. 15. 19.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning <hi>the obiection of originall sinne,</hi> there hath beene inough said out of Saint Augustine concer ning the other <hi>obiection of manslaughter, donne without consent of will,</hi> which you affirme to be <hi>innocencie,</hi> God defend euerie good Christian from such innocencie. At least wise you might haue made such a fact com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by error, a voluntarie sinne, by the first mans sinne, that was of free will, which if it had not beene, no man should haue erred in that case, or anie other. But the text (you tel vs) calleth him an innocent man, <hi>liberabitur innocens, &amp;c, the innocent shall be deliuered from the hand of the reuenger</hi> So great a Rabbin as you would seeme to be, by your quotations out of <hi>Rabbi Isaac, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Mose,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Leui,</hi> should not be ignorant, that in the hebrew text the word is <hi>harotzeach,</hi> that is <hi>the killer,</hi> &amp; not <hi>the innocent,</hi> which yet is adiudged to escape pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment <note place="margin">Num. 35. 25.</note> of death, by the politike law, because in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of mans iudgement, he hath not offended: for which cause also Deut. 19. his <hi>blood</hi> is called <hi>innocent.</hi> Yet his flying to the citie of refuge, and imprisonment

there, vntill the death of the high priest, argueth as Master Charke saith, that there is somthing in his fact or the error, by which he committed the fact that hath neede of forgiuenes by Christ, wher of the high Priest was a figure. Neither was <hi>the citie of refuge appointed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for the triall of the slaughter, whether it were willinglie or vnwillinglie committed</hi> (as you saie) but also for a kinde of punishment, and detestation of manslaughter; so that if the sleaer were found out of the City, before the death of the high Priest, the auenger of blood might kill him, and not be charged with his blood, Where you refuse the mysterie of Christes death in the death <note place="margin">Num. 35. 27</note> of the high Priest, and flie to the fantasies of the Iewes, you declare that you care not what you bring, so you maie obtaine your purpose.

Saint Ierome also, <hi>Dialog. aduers.

Onelie he defendeth his Polygamie, by the custome of that time, and the contention of his wiues for their lodgeing with him, and last of all, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorizeth

vpon the wholl storie, drawing the error of Iacob and all the rest to a mysterie.

And yet he is not ashamed to gather Master Charks absurd positions, not one according to his meaning, and but one onelie agreeable to his wordes. First <hi>that sinne is no action,</hi> where he holdeth that all sinne, as the sinne of omission, is no action. Secondlie, that no euill men doe sinne, but the euill in men: which he saith not, but <hi>that man, as he is the creature</hi> of God, is not against the lawe, but the euill in man. Thirdlie, <hi>that sinne is not voluntarie,</hi> which he saieth not generally, but of some sin, speake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properlie. Forthlie, that sinne, <hi>is no humane or reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable action.</hi> which he saieth, rather to be a beastlie and vnreasonable action of a man endued with reason. Fiftlie, <hi>that it requireth neither will nor knowledge in the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:12222:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doer.</hi> where he saith, <hi>that the transgression of Gods law is sin, in some case and sort, which is without the will and knowledge of the doer.</hi> Last of all, that fooles, and madde men may as properlie commit sinne as others: but this he saith not at al, but that <hi>the infirmites of follie and madnes shal not excuse sin,</hi> and that if a madde man, or a foole kil a man (in the Censurcrs iudgement) it is properly no sinne. Whereof you may inferr, that it is sinne properlie, but not that it is as properlie sinne, as in others. But if madde men and fooles coulde not commit sinne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie, whie are they punished for sinne? To conclude where you saie, <hi>that Master Charke reiecteth Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine about the definition of sinne, it is false.</hi> For these are his wordes. <hi>Howsoeuer you alledge Austen to approoue your definition, it is no waie so large, as sinne, and iherefore a most vnlearned definition.</hi> These words of his declare, that he reiecteth not Augustine in this matter, but your false and fraudulent allegation of him, which is manifestly shewed before, by Augustines sound iudgement, in his retractions.</p>

                     <p>But where Master Charke rehearseth not the verie wordes, but the meaning of Saint Augustine, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him-selfe, in what sense he saith, that concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is not sinne, you set abroad all the sailes of your rayling, and venemous tongue and penne against him. Saint Augustines words are, <hi>dimitti concupiscentiam car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de nupt. &amp; conc. cap. 25.</note> in baptismo, non vt non sit, sed vt in peccatum non imputetur.

Concupiscence of the flesh is remitted in baptisme, not so that it is not, but so that it is not imputed to sinne. And albeit the guilt thereof be loosed, yet it remaineth, vntil al our infirmitie behealed, the renuing of the inward man profiting from daie to daie, when the outward man shall haue put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:12222:143"/>
for it remaineth not substantiallie, as a bodie or a spirit, but it is a certaine affection of euill qualitic, as a sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> These words declare, that concupiscence being an affection of euill qualitie (which is as much to saie, as sinne) remaning in the regenerate, although it be not imputed to them as sin, for that if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> against it, it shall not preuaill against them to condemne them. A sinne not imputed, is a sinne of his owne nature. The sinnes of Gods elect are not imputed to them, they are forgiuen, the guilt is taken awaie, they are wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed awaie in the blood of Christ, they are as white as wooll, and as snowe: yet of their owne nature they are foule, abhominable, and detestable transgressions of Gods lawe: so is concupiscence against the lawe, <hi>thou shalt not lust,</hi> as Augustine often confesseth, therefore of it selfe sinne, euen in the regenerate, to whome it is remitted. The similutude of a sickenes also, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Augustine doth often compare it, sheweth the same. For a sicknes if it be not healed, either by strength of nature preuailing, or by medicine, doth either cause death, or remaineth as long as life: so concupiscence of itselfe, would kill, if the medicines of Christs redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not ouercome the malice of it, and in the ende take awaie the disease from the rootes.</p>
                     <p>But for a cleerer proofe, Master Charke alledgeth, that Saint Augustine in an other place saith plainlie, it <note place="margin">Cont. Iul. lib. 5. cap. 3.</note> is sinne. You answer, <hi>that he saith onelie of concupiscence in generall, that it is sinne, and not of concupiscence in the regenerate,</hi> But that Saint Augustine speaketh of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence in the regenerate, it is manifest by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for that he saith, <hi>concupiscence of the flesh, against which the good spirit lustesh,</hi> which is onelie in the regenerate. <note place="margin">Cont.

For no mans spirit should rightlie lust against his fiesh, except the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ did dwell in him.</hi> But <hi>that concupiscence without

consent is properlie no sinne,</hi> you saie, <hi>Saint Augustine proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by the wordes of Paule him-selfe, who calleth it sinne in the chapter last remembred:</hi> but that is false: he only retaineth <note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> his vsuall acception of the word sinne, for actualsin, as Saint Iames doth, whose termes of conception, and bringing forth also he vseth: yet he concludeth that concupiscence without consent is euill, is to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised, to be brideled, to be fought against, to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, which prooueth sufficientlie, that it is sinne, though not actuall sinne, yet properlie sinne, from which we can not be deliuered, but by the grace of Christ: sinne of another kinde, sinne in another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, called sinnne in the scripture, and therefore without controuersie (except we will trifle in vaine contention of termes, and childish sophismes, where the matter is plaine) sinne in deede, and properlie, which of his owne nature deserueth death, but that it is purged by the blood of Christ, as all other sinnes, of what sort or degree soeuer they be, in those that are saued. That Saint Augustine vseth other whiles the termes of <hi>veniallie, and mortallie,</hi> when he speaketh of sinning, it can not defend your distinction, wherebie you holde, that <hi>there be some sinnes so smale, as of their owne nasure they deserue not damnation:</hi> contrarie to the scripture, that saith generallie, <hi>the reward of sinne is death.</hi> Whereas Saint Augustine meaneth onelie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of sinnes, whereof some are lesse, some are hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, yet all deserue death. For Saint Augustine must be vnderstood according to the scripture, but the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture must not be racked to agree with Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto concerning the doctrine of the Iesuites, that concupiscence in the regenerate without consent is not sinne. Against this doctrine <hi>Gotuisus</hi> opposeth the wordes of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Mat. 5. 28. whosoeuer shall see a woman to lust after her, he hath alreadie committed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie with her in his heart:</hi> which text you confirme as
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:12222:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you said before to be alledged ignorantlie, and against him-selfe, because here is a manifest consent of the heart expressed, to make concupiscence adulterie. And for that purpose you cite Saint Augustine: and to all this you aske, <hi>what sir William replyeth?</hi> and answer your selfe, <hi>Surelie nothing, but maketh a long idle speake, of praedicatum and subiectum, as pertinent to the matter, as Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring crosse to Billings gate.</hi> If William Charkes booke, might be had no where, but in your report, you would make miserable matter of it. But they that list to see how impudentlie you lie, shall finde in his booke, first that he confesseth, that the effect of concupiscence, which is adulterie by consent, is a breach of the 7. commaundement. For which he doth not alledge the place as you misconster him. Secondlie that Christ v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a word, which in greeke is <gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>Augustine</hi> him selfe in the place by you cited, maketh <hi>three degrees to actuall sinne: suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, delectation, and consent.</hi> The first he compareth to the deuills temptation, which when it was without man, was not sinne in man: but now that euerie man is tempted of his owne concupiscence, how can you say it is not sinne in man, as it was in the deuill? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the long speake of <hi>subeictum &amp; praedicatum,</hi> that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Charke maketh, is comprehended in lesse then three lines. And last of all, whereas you saie, that to quit the Lord moste carefully from sinne, he alledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Saint Iames, you peruert, and that wilfullie, both his saying, and his meaning, and scoffe at him in your doggs eloquence, as you are accustomed. But he saith expresselie, that <hi>Saint Iames doth carefullie quitte the Lord, from being a sinfull cause of sinne, when he turneth vpon man the whole worke, and all the blame of sinne, from the first
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:12222:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sinne of tempting, to the ripe and full birth thereof: saying that a man is tempted of his owne lust, and therewith drawne away, and as it were with a bait entised.</hi> Which things (saith Master Charke) can not be in bare concupiscence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were sinne, and a sinfull cause of sinne. And in deede, if euery thing conceaue, and bring forth a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the same kinde, that the damme is of, what should the mother of sinne be but sinne?

You aske <hi>if he doth not holde that God is the author of sinne, in diuerse places of his works: namelie lib. 1.

Onelie he misliketh Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine in one place, where he saith, that induration, and excecation pertaine not to the working of God, but to his foreknowledge, where the scripture expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie saith, God doth harden, God doth blinde, not as an euill author, but as a iust punisher, as Augustine els where confesseth, for which he is cited <hi>cont.

Yet two places of Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine you adde, and both fraudulentlie. The former <hi>cont.

For as much as concerneth vs, we should be alwaies without sinne vntill this euill were healed, if we did neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto it vnto euill.</hi> He saieth not absolutlie, <hi>we should be without sinne,</hi> but <hi>as much as concerneth vs,</hi> because that euill is in vs, without our will or consent, which maketh actuall sinne. Otherwise not manie lines before, he calleth it, <hi>vitium mortuum, a vice dead, but yet to be buried,</hi> that is throughlie healed.: and addeth further, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo igitur mortuum dicimus hoc peccatum in baptismo, &amp; How then doe we saie, that this sinne is dead in baptisme</hi> (as this man also saith) <hi>and how doe we confesse, that it dwelleth
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:12222:145"/>
in our members, and worketh manie desires against our wills which we resist by not consenting (as this man also confesseth) but because it is dead in that guilt in which it held vs, and till it be healed by perfection of buriall, it rebelleth euen being dead. Although now it is not called sinne, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in which it maketh guiltie, but because it is made by the guilt of the first man, and because, by rebelling, it laboureth to drawe vs to guiltines, except the grace of God doe helpe vs.</hi> This place of Saint Augustine shewteh that it is sinne. and whie it is so called, although it differ much from actuall sinne. Againe when he saith, it is dead vice, in respect that it is remitted to the renegerate in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, yet it is as a stinking carcase of the enimy, which vntill it be buried will infect: by which it appeareth what a pestilent thing it is, of it selfe, though by grace it be ouercome, and must be buried in vs, till it be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie abolished.</p>
                     <p>The other place, <hi>lib. 2. de gratia, cap. 40.</hi> you cut very short, and vtter in these wordes. <hi>Quibus sinon consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur, nullius peccati reatus contraehitur.

man neede to saie, <hi>forgiue vs our debtes,</hi> for his vitious or wicked desires, although he consent not vnto them, you define out of Saint Austine, that he neede not.

Yet should we not be such, as we shall be after this mortall hath put on immortallity: for then there shal be in vs no desires of sinnes.</hi> Secondly you quote. <hi>conc. 3. in Ps.</hi> Where he answereth this question, in these words: <hi>Quantum quidemegs sapere possum, &amp;c. As farre as I can perceiue, the whole guilt of the disease and infirmitie, from whence those vnlawfull desires are mooued, which the Apostle calleth sinne, is loosed by the Sacrament of baptisme, with all those that obeying it, we haue done, saide, or thought: neither should this disease hereafter hurt vs, though it be in vs, if we yealded obedience to none of the vnlawfull desires thereof at anie time, either in worke, speach, or secretassens, vntill the sicknes it selfe be healed, when that which we pray for, is fullfilled, either when we say, thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come, or when we saie, deliuer vs from euill.</hi> Thirdlie you quote <hi>de perfect iustisiae, c. vltimo.</hi> Where against the Pelagians, which holde that a man might be iust with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out actuall sinne, although he could not be without concupiscence, which is called sinne, because it is sin to consent vntoit, and is mooued against our wil, he hath these words: <hi>Subtiliter quidemista discernit, &amp;c.

confumed in the lauer of regeneration, the baptized saie in their praier, forgiue vs our debtes, &amp;c</hi> Out of all these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces this I may gather: First, that Saint Augustine doth not so constantlie affirme, as you saie, as a Doctrine most certaine, but modestly deliuereth his opinion, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>as farre as my wisdome serueth,</hi> and, <hi>except I be deceiued.</hi> Secondliehe speaketh not of those motions, that be in vs, which consent to some, though not to al of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but <hi>in case we neuer consented to anie of them.</hi> Thirdly he rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his reason, <hi>because they he alreadie forgiuen, to there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate in baptisme.</hi> And sorthlie, he calleth them <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull desires of sinne, against which we praie to be deliuered.</hi> So that all thinges weighed, as you haue Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine in some sort fauorable, to the wordes of your as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion in this piont, yet he is not so ranke, and full one your side, in the sense of the matter, as you would bear vs in hand.</p>
                     <p>Now followe a number of cauillations against M. Charkes wordes, which I will brieflie runne ouer. First where he saieth. <hi>Are not all the first motions of iust meerely naturall, and euer more of some cause giuen by vs, and dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within vs, namelie the corruption of Adam? This fonde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> (saie you) <hi>includeth two contraries: for of they be meerlie naturall, then are they not of anie cause giuen by vs.</hi> This fonde argument (saie I) hath two faultes. One is ambiguitie, sought where it needes not, in the word meerelie naturall, which Master Charke shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be by corruption of nature, and then the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent followeth not: for to that corruption, cause is giuen by vs, and in vs, in the sinne of Adam. Secondlie you saie, that <hi>it is false that all first motions of iust are meerely naturall: for in lewde men they are often voluntarie.</hi> Iump, as you are wont to saie. For if <hi>will</hi> goe before them, then are they not first, we speake of motions, which goe before will, and therefore are called first motions: wherefore your example <hi>of awaking a madde dogge,</hi> and distinction <hi>of naturall in the roote, and voluntarie in the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:12222:147"/>
branch,</hi> doe not excuse, but increase your heape of waste words, as when you be awake you maie perceiue.</p>
                     <p>Another cauillation you haue, <hi>that Master Charke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully auoideth the simulitude of first motions with the pulse, because they be not like in all thinges,</hi> which is vntrue, but because they are not like in qualitie, in the which they are compared. For the first motions vnto sinne are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, vitious, vnlawfull, as Saint Augustine calleth them, so is not the motion of the pulse: therefore not like. But <hi>while he reasoneth against your example of the pulse, he vttereth three foúle absurdities, &amp; most grosse errors,</hi> if we beleeue you. Which are they? saie on, &amp; take heed you lie not. <hi>The first is, that he placeth concupiscence of the flesh (whereof we talke) in the resonable part of the minde, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> in the sensitiue parte.</hi> That is false: for his wordes are, <hi>you cannot conclud from that part of our soule, whereby we haue life and sense onelie, to that part where in our reason and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are placed.</hi> In these wordes he denieth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence vnto the sensitiue part, but extendeth it to the reasonable parte, where also the affections are, where vertues and vices haue their seat, in as much as the reasonable soule is distinguished into two pars, the one that vseth reason, the other that should obeie reason. And therefore you speake verie grosselie, and falselie, when you saie, <hi>The first motions are nothing els, but the rebellions of our sensitiue partes.</hi> And your reason is as grosse in diuinitie, as your position is in philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, <hi>because it is called flesh, and the concupiscence of the flesh, &amp;c.</hi> where <hi>flesh</hi> signifieth the whole corruption of man, as it is manifest by the workes of the flesh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed by Saint Paull in the text you quote, Gal. 5. where there is not onelie whordome, glottonie, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, and such like, but Idolattie, witchcraft, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, &amp;c. which are sinnes against faith, and knowledge, and doubtles haue thir first motions, as well as other sinnes, that are principallie committed with the body, as adultrie, drunkennes, &amp;c. and may haue their first
<pb n="921" facs="tcp:12222:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
motions both in the body, &amp; in the minde, but chiofly in the minde. Therefore while you charge Master Chark with intollerable ignorance, you bewraie intollerable want of knowledge, in one that would be taken both for a philosopher, and a diuine.</p>
                     <p>The second absurditie, you saie, <hi>is greater, in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that the sensuall parte of man is not so much corrupted by originall sinne, as the reasonable parte.</hi> But master Charke saith, <hi>the former (that is, that parte of our naturall soule where bie we haue life and sense onelie) is not in the same sorte cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted as the second: neither doth sinne so worke in naturall life, and sense, as it doth in the heart, by the corruptions and guiltines of the soule.</hi> Now these words do declare a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison in qualitie, not in quantitie: for the question (if you be remembred) was of a similitude, which is a comparison in qualitie, not in quantitie. But if he hadmade comparison in quantitie, I thinke there is no wise man, but feeleth temptations against the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and faith, greater and more dangerous, then to commit sinne in the abuse of any of the senses. And seeing all that defileth man commeth first from the heart, I maruell how you place concupiscence in the sensitiue part, except you place the sensitiue parte in the heart. Although it is not without fraud, that you change Master Charkes wordes, who speaketh alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of life and sense, and you onelie of the sensitiue part, in which you include the inward senses, as well as the outward, where as Master Charke speaketh of the outward onelie, as his examples of smelling, seeing, hearing, and feeling declare.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third absurditie is ioyned with flat Pelagianisme, where he saith, that the necessarie actions of life and sense, remaine now in man, as they were before his fall.</hi> For which is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a saying of <hi>Saint Augustine de Eccles. dogm. cap. 38.</hi> that <hi>if anie man shall affirme, that man both in bodie and soule, is not chaunged into worse, he is deceiued with Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme.</hi> But Master Charkes wordes are, that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarie
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:12222:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
actions of life, as eating, drinking, &amp;c. and of sense, as smelling, ate of them selues all free from sinne, remaining as they were in man before his fall, he doth not denie that they are changed into worsse, but that of them selues, they are not sin. It is not sinne to eate, but a man may easilie sin in eating: it is not sinne to see, but by sight a man may easily fall into sin. Neither doth your author saie, that the actions of life &amp; sense, are sinne, but he speaketh against them that thought by the fall of Adam, the bodie onelie was subiect to corruption, the liberue of the soule being vnhurt. Now if you holde that the simple, and necessarie actions of life and sense, are sinne, I wounder how you can deny the first motions, and vnlawfull desires of sinne, to be sin. But <hi>you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> them from sin, because they be not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie,</hi> which is serase true of the senses, for a man need not to see except he will, seeing he maie close his eies. But <hi>against this point of voluntarie,</hi> you say, <hi>he obiecteth ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sinne, which is answered before, and shewed how it is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie.</hi> And I answere, that the first motions are voluntarie, by the same reason. Secondlie he obiecteth, that god saieth in Genesis, <hi>euerie cogitation of mans heart is euill euermore.</hi> To that you answer, <hi>that it inclineth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, by reason of concupiscence left in vs.</hi> Thus God and you agree not. He saieth, <hi>it is euill,</hi> you saie, <hi>it inclineth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>but yet is not that inclination sinne without consent.</hi> But God saieth, <hi>it is onelie euill, and that alwaies.</hi> Thirdlie you saie he obiecteth the commaundement, <hi>Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby the first motions, being against the great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, must needes be sin. But that you saie is false. <hi>For though we be stirred by this commaundement to all perfection, that we can in this life, yet no more is inioyned vs thereby, vnder paine of sinne and damnation, but onelie that we doe not yealde consent to sin.</hi> If you say, that god imputeth not vnto vs, that are his children, all breach of this commaundement to our condemnation, I would agree with you. But that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:12222:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
anie man in this life can keepe this commaundement, or that no transgression thereof, except it be with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, is damnable sinne, I doe vtterlie denie. Yet you make Saint Augustine author of your interpretation. <hi>First, lib. de spirit. &amp; lit. cap. vltimo.</hi> Who both affirmeth, <hi>that this commaundement is not fullfiled by anie man in this life, and also that there is no perfect iustice in this life, but that man hath profited moste, which knoweth how farre he is from perfection of iustice.</hi> Againe, <hi>that there is no iustice in this life, but by faith, &amp; therefore walking by faith, he may be saide not to sinne against the iustice of this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, seeing he is not to be blamed, if he loue not God so perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctlie, as when he shall knowe him perfectlie.</hi> But all this is to be vnderstood of the new man, so farre forth as he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, according to the Image of God. And therefore he concludeth in the end, that of what qualitie soeuer, or of what quantity soeuer, we can define iustice in this life, <hi>there is no man voide of sinne, and it is necessarie for euery man to praie for remission of sinnes, and to presume of no iustice of his owne, but of the grace of God.</hi> Secondlie you <note place="margin">lib. 1. de doct. Christ ca: 2.</note> quote <hi>lib. 1. de doct. Christ. cap. 2.</hi> where there is nothing to the purpose. Thirdlie, <hi>de natura &amp; gratia, cap. 69.</hi> where he saieth, <hi>this commaundement is not heauie, where there is that loue, whereby faith worketh, where this loue is not, it is heauie.</hi> But that the breach of this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is not sinne, where we yeald no consent, he saieth not one word. Lastlie, you quote <hi>lib. 2. de pecc. merit. cap. 6.</hi> where this commaundement is not once mentioned. Thus you thinke to carie awaie the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with dumme quotationes, when in the places quoted, there is nothing to vpholde your assertion.</p>
                     <p>Next followeth a question, <hi>whether Protestantes or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists do represse the raines of lusts,</hi> which he knoweth best, that searcheth the heart, &amp; the raines. <hi>But the doctrine of the protestantes</hi> (saie you) <hi>doth take awaie both raines and bridle out of our handes, while they teach the first motions to be naturall, and that we cannot let their effect, but that they
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:12222:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
worke sinnes in vs, whether we consent or not.</hi> But that is false, for we saie, that by the grace of God, we maie resist their effect, which is to worke actuall sinne, if default be not in our selfe: yet we saie they are sinne of them selues, for which we ought to sigh and grone, with the Apostle. And where you saie, <hi>we haue no hope of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, because we sinne, though we consent not,</hi> and thereof <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Now are we come to the tenth commaundement, which is contrarie to the Iesuites doctrine, which you say, the Censure, out of S. Augustine expoundeth to be meant of consent. <hi>lib. 1. denupt. &amp; conc. cap.</hi> 23. where <hi>S.</hi> Augustine doth not so expound this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, <hi>thou shalt not lust,</hi> but sheweth as he doth in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before noted, that it is not fullfilled in this life.</p>
                     <p>Next to this, you saie, <hi>it pleaseth Master Charke to put downe foure manifest lies, saying, As the Papists make of the tenth commaundement two commaundements, so this fellow maketh of two seuerall breaches of two diuerse commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, but one sinne.</hi> And both these you saie are slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But how both these, if they were slaunders, should make foure lies, I doe not yet see, except it be by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication. Your answere is, <hi>first that the Catholikes make but one of the tenth commaundement: but the question is which is properlie and distinctlie the tenth commaundement.</hi> Verie well, if it be a question, and such a question as you conclude not to be defined in your Church, you doe ill to make it an argument to conuince him of slaunder. For if that opinion be true, that maketh but one commaundement against coueting, which few pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists doe follow, and yet many auncient writers doe holde, as you confesse; then doe the rest make two commaundemetes of that one, against coueting. <hi>Yes
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:12222:149"/>
Saint Augustine,</hi> you saie, <hi>contendeth in diuerse places, that these two clauses, thou shalt not haue strange Gods, and thou shalt not make any grauen Idoll, are but one commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore, that the two other of coueting, make two distinct commaundementes.</hi> That S. Austine liketh that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, I denie not; but that he contendeth for it, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. And you your selfe note six auncient writers, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly <hi>Origen, Procopius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Hesychius, S. Ambrose, &amp; S. Ierome, that follow our diuision, assigning foure preceptes to the first table, and six to the second.</hi> To which may be added <hi>Greg. Nazianzen, decalog. Mosis carmine, &amp; Augustine</hi> or whoesoeuer was author of those books, called <hi>quaestiones ex veteri &amp;. N. T. quaestione</hi> 7. Beside the authority of those olde fathers, reason is against it. For whereas you saie, <hi>this clause, Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours wife, is the ninth commaundement, and the rest the tenth,</hi> Moses is against you, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. placing, <hi>thou shalt not couet thy neighbours house</hi> first, and then, <hi>thou shalt not couet thy neighbours wife,</hi> which were a confusion, if that which is in the second place were the ninth, &amp; that which is in the first, were the tenth: beside the transposition, that part of the tenth commaundement should be ioyned with the ninth. Therefore, seeing the same Moses placeth the coueting of the wife, Deu. 5. in the first place, it is manifest, that both those clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses make but one commaundement, els should it be vncertaine, which is the ninth, and which the tenth. Againe, where you saie, <hi>it is moste conuenient that the twoe</hi>

                        <hi>generall internall consentes vnto the two lusts, of carnalitie, and couetousnes, called by Saint Iohn concupiscence of the flesh, and concupiscence of the eie, should be expresselie and particularlie forbidden by two distinct commaundements,</hi> I answere that it is more couuenient, that concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of all sinnes against the second table, should be forbidden in one generall commaundement. And it is meruaill how in Saint Iohn you forgotte <hi>the pride of life,</hi> which he ioyneth with <hi>the concupiscence of the eies,
<pb facs="tcp:12222:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and of the flesh:</hi> which was as needefull to be forbidden as the other two: though you saie <hi>the internall temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the other commaundement are neither so frequent, nor so daungerous as those two.</hi> Yes verely, the temptations to ambition, rebellion, disobedience, malice, lying, &amp; such like, are both as frequent, and as daungerous, as vnto bodelie lust, and couetousnes.</p>
                     <p>To that you sate, <hi>they are sufficientlie forbidden by the wordes set downe in the commaundements them-selues,</hi> it may be answered, so are the other two; and therefore, all lust with consent, is forbidden in euerie one of them, as lust vnto adulterie, in the commaundement prohibiting adulterie, desire of reuenge in the commaundement prohibiting murther, by our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christs owne interpretation and authority, by like reason, ambition, or lust of disobedience, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement that biddeth parentes to be honoured, couetousnes in that which forbiddeth theft, the lust of lying, or slaundering, in that which forbiddeth false witnes. Therefore the commaundement of lust bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one and general, must needes be the tenth, and the comaundement of hauing no gods but one, &amp; the true God, the first: the commaundement of not making, nor worshipping Images, the second: which are two perfectlie distinct preceptes, the one commaunding the true God to be honoured alone: the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding the worship of God to be spirituall, and forbidding all carnall imaginations of Gods worship, as by Images, or any other thing of mens deuise, wherebie they chaunge the glorie of the immortall God, into the shape of a mortall man, beastes, fouls, or any other thing. Therefore he that worshippeth Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as a God, breaketh the first commaundement, he that worshippeth Iehoua in the calfe that Aaron made, or the calues that Ieroboam set vp, or by offering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to the brasen serpent, offendeth against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commaundement. This diuision therefore is
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:12222:150"/>
both most conuenient, as that which distinguisheth all good workes, and all sinnes, by their proper precepts, and also necessarie, as that which maketh tenne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, euerie one perfectlie distinct from the other, and that sheweth all men all manner of sinne, as well that which is in act, as that which is in desire, not onelie that which is with consent, but euen that also which proceedeth of the corruption of nature, and is resisted by the spirit of God. Therefore that which you saie vntrulie, of the first two braunches, is true of the last, that they conteine but one thing, namelie a prohibition of concupiscence, against any of the other five preceptes of the second table.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>it is a weightie argument that the 70. interpreters doe recite them distinctlie, as two commaundementes in their Greeke translation.</hi> How shall we know that? You an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, <note place="margin">Ex. 20. &amp; Deut. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>by repeating the verbe twise.</hi> But that is a slender proofe, for the verbe is twise repeated in the Hebrew text, and in Deut. 5. once changed. In the twoe first commaundements, there are foure verbes denied: <hi>there shalls not be, thou shalt not make, thou shalt not bow downe, thou shalt not serue.</hi> Yet these two, you will haue to be one. But whie doe you flie from the authority of your vulgare latine interpreter, which in both places, maketh the prohibition of concupiscence one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, in Exod. by adding the copulatiue which is not in the Hebrew, but a pure negatiue, <hi>Non concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisces domum proximi tui, nec desiderabis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

against concupiscence, although the sinne were set foorth in diuerse wordes. And it is as great reason to make a seuerall commaundement for euerie worde that followeth, as to make the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence of the house one, and of the wife, another. But you doe better to acknowledge the matter doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as beeing no matter of faith, and not defined by your Church, because of the authority of so many aun cient fathers against you: yet you haue no colour, to shift of your Idolatrous woshipping of Images, except you confounde the two first commaundements in one: neither can you exclude the commaundement against concupiscence without consent, except you deuide the tenth commaundement into two, reteining the distinction that ought to be of euerie precept from other, and making the law perfect, which prohibiteth all sinne, as I haue shewed before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But it is a greater slaunder,</hi> I weene, <hi>that the Protestantes charge you to leaue out the second commaundement against I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, where you doe but include it in the first.</hi> As though you haue not in your English primers, &amp; other bookes where you set forth the tenne commaundements, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together left out that precept, as ten thousand bookes wil testify against you. And as for your including, is but a crafty hiding of it from the common people, lest they should learne to detest your grosie Idolatrie, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake your malignant Church, as the mother of all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations against God, and his true worship. Your <hi>distinction of mentall adulterie, from actuall adulterie, and of mental theft from actual theft,</hi> to make foure commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of two, is grosse, &amp; vnlearned. For why should not mental murther, mental disobedience or rebellion, mentall slaunder or lying, require enerie one a seueral commaundement, distinct from actual murther, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all rebellion, disobedience, or treason, actuall slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or lying? And so in the wholl we should haue thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene commaundements at the least. Or els <hi>Master
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:12222:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Charke</hi> hath truelie charged you, to make the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall breaches of two diuerse commaundements but one sinne, and the breach of one commaundement to make two seuerall kindes of sinne: as you doe in the breaches of the commaundements against adulterie and theft. Where our sauiour Christ saith expresselie, that the <hi>looking on a woman, with desire of lust, is adulterie,</hi> which he should rather haue saide, according to your where is forbidden in the seauenth commaundement, distinction, it is sinne against the ninth commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which you saie is against mentall adulterie. And so he should haue saide no more in effect, but mentall adulterie, is mental adulterie. But our Sauiour Christ referring that sinne to the commaundement against adulterie, sheweth that concupiscence without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, is an other sinne, and not onelie in an other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the same kinde, as mentall and actuall adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie are, and as <hi>anger, racha, thou foole,</hi> are against the sixt commaundement.</p>
                     <p>The last reason of the censure, to prooue that the first motions to lust are not forbidden, is, <hi>because they are not in our power.</hi> where the scripture saith, <hi>This comaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>which I giue the this daie, is not aboue thee.</hi> Master Chark replieth, that the assumption of this argument (which is, to resist the first motions, is not in our power) is false. You rehearse his wordes thus: <hi>Our first motions are not altogether out of our power, for that the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie doth more and more subdue them.</hi> Here you cauill, that <hi>albeit good men do cut of infinite occasions and causes of motions and temptations, yet can they neuer subdue all moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> But Master Charke said, <hi>It is neither true, that all these first motions are altogether out of our power, &amp;c. neither doth it follow, that we are not subiect to the lawe for such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as we can not resist, the fault being ours through cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, whie we can not resist them.</hi> So that in the first part of this saying, he confesseth some motions to be out of our power to resist, some not out of our power, which
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:12222:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you also acknowledge: and therefore your assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it be general, is false: if it be particuler, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion cannot be generall, that to resist all the first motions of lustes is not commaunded: orthus, the law forbiddeth no first motions.</p>
                     <p>To the second parte of Master Charkes saying, you answer nothing, that is of the consequence of your as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption: namelie that the fault being ours through corruption, and such as our first father did willinglie bring vpon him and vs all, our wante of power to resist offences, can not exempt vs from the iustice of God. This was so strong, that you had not so much as a cauil against it. But as though you saw it not, you runne by, into your vsuall path of girding our Ministers: <hi>who,</hi> you saie, <hi>talke of continencie and mortification, (ech one hauing his yoke mate readie for his turne) as good fellows do of fasting, that sit at a full table.</hi> And yet I think it is more praise, to keepe temperance at a full table, then to abstaine where there is hunger, and nothing to eate. But I pray you sir, doth continencie and mortification belong onelie to vnmarried men? You are as good to saie that no maried man can be a true christian, seing mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is necessarie for all Christians, and continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie also, not from the vndefiled bedde, but chastitie from all vncleannes is commaunded generallie to all true members of Christ: How the wiueles votaries in poperie performe continencie, and mortification, but euen of that one earthly member of vncleanes, the world is to full of examples, and the iustice of god will one daie make manifest.</p>
                     <p>To the place of Moses Master Chark saith the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation is false, and corrupt, which saith, <hi>the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is not aboue thee,</hi> where Moses saith, <hi>it is not hidden from thee.</hi> And that the place is so to be translated, and to be applied to the reuelation of the Gospel, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie declared by the plaine text, and by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereofin the epistle to the Romanes. cap. 10. 6.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:12222:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To this you answer, that <hi>he prooueth it neitherby the words of text, nor by Saint Pauls application.</hi> O wretched shift. when he quoteth the Chapter and verse, where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle beginneth to speake of this place of Moses, in these wordes: <hi>The righteousnes which is of faith, saith thus: Say not in thy heart who shall go vp into heauen? that is to bring downe Christ: or who shall go downe into the deepe?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 30. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>that is to cal Christ from the dead. But what saith the scripture? The word is neere in thy mouth, and in thy heart: this is the word of faith which we preach.</hi> Here is the application of the text to the Gospell, and not to the lawe. <hi>But the text</hi> (you saie) <hi>is not so euident: for Saint Ierome either the author, or the corrector of this translation, knew what the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew words importe, and how they are applied by Saint Paul, as well as William Charke.</hi> Here is a vaine and an odious comparison, without neede or cause. For who will graunt vnto you, that S. Ierome was either author, or corrector of the vulgar translation, that we now haue? None surelie that fauoreth the credite of Saint Ierom, who though he haue some in this age, as well Papists, as Protestantes, better learned in the hebrew, then he was, yet was he farre better learned, then that he would haue suffered, either in translation, or in corre ction such grosse faults, as be in that vulgar translation which we now haue. <hi>As for Saint Pauls application of that parte of the sentence, which he toucheth,</hi> (you saie) <hi>make eth wholy for yow, as after shall be shewed.</hi> Well, when you shew it, we shal shape you an answer. But now to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of the text itselfe. <hi>Niphleth,</hi> which, as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that <hi>it fignifieth to be hidden</hi> so you affirme, that <hi>it signifieth also, to be maruelous, to be hard and difficult, as appeareth, Psalm. 13 9and 2. Sam. 1.</hi> which we do not deny, so you vnderstande to be difficult and hard for want of knowledge, and not for want of power. For you are not hable to bring an example, where this verb <hi>Phala,</hi> which most properlie signifieth to be hidden or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, is taken in that sense you would haue it here,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:12222:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
namelie to be harde or difficulte for lacke of strength. That it signifieth to be meruelous, it is because mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueling is vpon causes, that are hid or vnknowen. The Chaldee and Greeke must either be answerable to the Hebrue, or els they are to be reiected as vntrue or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper translations. Although the Chaldee word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the same that the hebrew: whereunto if you ad the signification of separation, yet it must be separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from knowledge, and not from strength, or els it answereth not vnto the originall. As also the greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which signifieth (as you saie) <hi>exceeding, immeasurable, greate, passing all meane, &amp;c.</hi> must be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood for exceeding measure in knowledge, or els it is not right: and so maie your latine, <hi>suprate,</hi> be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood also, as Saint Ierome translateth the same verb, Ps. 139. where it is manifestlie taken for maruelous, in respect of the want of knowledge. And therfore none of these three wordes, vsed in the three auncient tongues, hauing a negation before them, do expresse so much as you would gather by the vulgar translation, the law is not aboue thy strength. Wherefore you may take bayard whome to your owne stable, that make such ignorant and impudent conclusions, as an Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian beast, that had learned but a while vnder Apulei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, would not make for shame.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>if Saint Ierome will not satisfie vs, you bid vs take Saint Austen, who</hi> (saie you) <hi>handleth both the wordes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of Moses, and also the application vsed by Saint Paul of parte of the sentence: and prooueth out of both the very same conclusion that we do, to witte, that the law is not aboue our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to keepe it: and for confirmation thereof he addeth mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other textes of scripture, as, my yoke is sweete, and my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then light: also, his commaundements are not heauie, and the like, concluding in these wordes, we must beleeue most firmelie, that God being iust and good, could not commaund impossible thinges vnto man.</hi> That you maie vnderstand how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie waies he mocketh vs, with his dumme quotations,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:12222:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and shameles collections, I will sette downe the wholl Chapter which he quoteth. <hi>De natura &amp; gratia. c. 69. Valde autem bona sunt praecepta, &amp;c. The commaundements are verie good, if we vse them lawfullie. Far euen by the same whereby it is moste firmelie beleeued, that God being iust and good could not commaund thinges impossible, hereof we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished, both in easy things what to do, and in hard things what to craue. For all thinges are made easie to loue, to which alone the burthen of Christ is light, or that alone is the selfe same burthen which is light. According to this it is said: And his commaundements are not heauie, that he to whome they are heauie, maie consider, that it could not haue beene said of God, they are not heauie, but because there maie be such an affection of the heart, to which they are not heauie, and may aske that which he lacketh, that he maie fulfill that which is commaunded. And that which is said vnto Israel, in Deutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie, if it be Godlie, if it be holylie, if it be spirituallie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, signifieth the selfe same thing: for when the Apostle had rehearsed this testimonie, The word is neare in thy mouth, &amp; in thy heart (which this man hath in thy hands, for in the heart are spirituall hands) this saith he, is the word of faith, whih we do preach. Euerie one theresore being conuerted, as there is commaunded, vnto the Lord his God, with all his heart, and all his soule, let him not accompt the commaundement of God to be heauie: For how is it heauie, when it is the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of loue? For euerie man either loueth not, and therefore it is heauie, or he loueth, and then it can not be heauie. He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, if, as Israel is there admonished, he be conuerted to the, lord his God, with all his heart, &amp; with all his soule. I giue you, saith he, a new commaundement, that you loue one another: and he that loueth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the law: and, loue is the fulfilling of the law: according to this is that also spoken, If they walked in good pathes, they should haue found the pathes of righteousnes to be light. How then is it said, Because of the wordes of thy lippes, I haue kept hard waies? but because both is true. They are hard to feare, and liht to loue. Therefore loue begonne is iustice be gonne, loue proceeded, is iustice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:12222:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great loue is great iustice, perfect loue is perfect iustice, loue I meane comming out of a pure heart, &amp; a good conscience, and out of faith not fained, which then is greatest in this life, when for it the life it selfe is contemned. But I maruell if it haue not wherein to increase, when it is departed out of this mortall life. But where soeuer, and whensoeuer it is so full, that nothing can be added vnto it, yet is it not spread in our hearts by the workes of nature, or will which are in vs, but by the he lie ghoste, which is geuen vnto vs, which both helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, and worketh with our health. for that is the grace of God by Iesus Christ our Lord. to whome with the father and the holie ghoste be ascribed eternitie and goodnes for euer.</hi> In this discourse of S. Augustine is declared, that the commaundements of God are made possible, and not heauie to be fulfilled by the grace of God, nor by the strength of man, either of nature or will, and that by two meanes, faith and loue. Faith, by which we craue &amp; obtaine forgiuenes of our imperfection, and loue by which we cherefully endeuour to accomplish in work, so much as we can, which we can not do perfectly in this life, in as much asno mans heart is pure in this life, &amp; no mans loue is perfect in this world. yet <hi>faith purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our harts, that by themselues are vnclean, obtaineth,</hi> as the sameS. Augustine saith, <hi>that which the law commaundeth.</hi> But how far is this from the popish assertion, to wit, <hi>The law is not abooue our abtlitie to keepe it.</hi>

                        <hi>THe Iesuites,</hi> you saie, <hi>do not vse these termes of defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: that the scripture is imperfect, maimed, or lame:</hi> and thereof I will not contend: but the same in effect they holde, as Master Charke saith: when they affirme <hi>that all things necessarte to saluation are not contained in the scripture.</hi> Your <hi>similitude of a marchant leauing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements partelie in writings, and partelie by word of mouth, and referring the resolution of doubtes vnto his wife,</hi> is not sufficient in this case. For our Sauiour Christ li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for euer, whereas his seruants and the men of whome his Church, which is his spouse, consisteth, are changed in euerie generation. So that there can be no certaintie of his commaundements, but onelie by his writings: which if they containe not all thinges necessarie to saluation, they are imperfect, lame, and maimed. And where you saie, <hi>that Saint Augustine prooueth the contrarie at large, lib. 1. cont. Cresc. c. 32.</hi> it is vtterlie vntrue. For he saith expresselie, concerning the question of rebaptising them that were baptized by heretikes, <hi>Sequimur sanè nos in hac re etiam Canonica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum authoritatem certissimam scripturarum. We truelie doe follow in this matter also the most certaine authoritie of the Canonicall scriptures,</hi> whereunto he adioineth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Catholike Church after some disceptation about the matter, whose counsell agreeable to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie scripture, no man doubteth bur it is to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Theverie same doctrine</hi> (you saie) <hi>teacheth the said fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lib. de side &amp; operibus cap. 9. and also ep. 66. ad Don.</hi> In the former is no worde to the purpose, he speaketh of the Eunuch whome Philip baptized, whose confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:12222:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Christ being verie shorte, some thought to be sufficient for anie man that should receaue baptisme, whereas there is a more distinct knowledge, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler explication of this faith, in other places of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture set downe, that is to be required of them, that are catechised and come to baptisme. In the last quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation I thinke there is a faulte, either in your Printer, or in your notebooke, which setteth downe <hi>ep. 66. for ep. 166.</hi> which is directed to the Donatistes, whereas the other is to Maximus. But in this epistle to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natistes there is nothing that prooueth this matter, that the scriptures containe not all things necessarie to saluation. Onelie he exhorteth the Donatistes to vnitie, shewing that out of the same scriptures, which teach Christ to be the head, his bodie the Church, is to be discerned and learned.</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>the twelue pointes of doctrine set downe by the Censure, as not conteined expresselie in the scripture, and yet to be beleeued, Master Charke</hi> answereth, that seuen of them are in scripture, the rest not necessarie to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued. But here you saie, <hi>the question is of expresse scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not of any farre fet place, that by interpretation may be applied to a controuersie.</hi> If you meane by expresse scripture, that which is expressed in so many wordes, as the thing in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersy, we deny that we haue anysuch question with you. For we holde that any thing, which by necessary demonstration can be concluded out of the scripture, is as true, as necessary to be beleeued, as that which is expressed in plaine wordes. And so we meane when we saie, <hi>all thinges necessarie to saluation are conteined in the holie scriptures.</hi> And as for your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>of inuocation of Saintes, praier for the dead, purgatorie,</hi> and the like, if you can winne them either by manifest wordes, or by necessarie conclusion, we are content you shall weare them, and we also wilyeald vnto them: otherwise you prate without proofe, of expressed in the scripture, trifling vppon the terme <hi>expressed,</hi> which
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:12222:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
either we vse not in this question, or els we meane ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, certainlie declared, and taught in the scriptures, either in expresse wordes, or by necessarie conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p>But now let vs see how <hi>Master Chark is distressed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering these twelue particulers.</hi> For the first of the seauen, which he acknowledgeth to be contained in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripture, which is, <hi>that there is two natures, and two wills in Christ,</hi> he citeth these wordes, <hi>Rom. 1. of his sonne, which was made vnto him of the seede of Dauid, according to the flesh.</hi> Also <hi>Math. 26. not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> here you saie, that <hi>the interpretation of the Church being set aside, and the bare text onelie admitted, these places cannot conuict an heretike.</hi> yes verelie, the onelie authoritie of the textis sufficient to confit me faith, and to conuince an heretike. For the former point thus. The diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and humanitie are two natures: in Christ is diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and humanitie: <hi>ergo</hi> two natures. The maior is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest: the minor is plaine by the text, the sonne of God one nature, the seede of Dauid an other nature. For the fecond point. The will of God, and the will of man, the one contradictorie to the other, are two willes. In Christ was the will of God contradictorie to the wil of man: <hi>ergo</hi> two wills. The <hi>minor</hi> is prooued out of the text, <hi>not as I wil, but as thou wilt,</hi> seeing Christ was both God &amp; man. <hi>That the Monothelits in the 6. Councill of Costantinople could not be conuinced out of the scriptures,</hi> it is an intollerable slaunder of that reuerend assemblie: for euen by this text, and manie other, their error was made manisest: wherunto albeit the consent of the aun cient fathers was added, yet is there no word in all that 4. action, which you quote, to prooue that they were not sufficientlie confuted out of the holie scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
                     <p>The second point is, <hi>the proceeding of the holie ghost from the father, and the sonne equallie:</hi> for which Master Chark quoteth <hi>Ioh. 15. 26. When the holie ghoste shall come, which
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:12222:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I will send you from my father, the spirit of trueth, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the father, &amp;c.</hi> Against this you cauill <hi>that it prooueth not the proceeding equallie,</hi> and cite Cyril for your witnes in 15. <hi>Ioh.</hi> who out of this place prooueth that (<hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually</hi>) as wel as the <hi>proceeding,</hi> seeing the heretikes might be ashamed to say, that the spirit of the father, was sent by the son, as by a minister: which also if they should saie, he disprooueth, for that if the sonn were as a minister, he should be of an other substance then the father, and the spirit proceeding from the father, being of the same substance with the father, should be greater in nature then the fonne, whereas the sonne saith plainlie of the holy ghoste, he shal glorifie me, &amp;c. An other cauil you haue, <hi>that this place telleth not, whether he proceeded by generation, or without generation, from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> But it is sufficient that neither this place nor any other place of scripture teacheth, that the holie ghoste is begotten, therefore we beleeue without generation.</p>
                     <p>The third point <hi>is, the vnion of the word vnto the nature of man, and not to the person of man.</hi> which because you <note place="margin">Pet. Lumb. Lib. 3. dist. 5.</note> did set downe obscurelie, M. Charke did not rightlie vnderstand: yet the text that the quoteth. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. 14. <hi>The word was made flesh,</hi> includeth that assertion also: seeing there was no person of the man, when the vnion was made vnto the nature of man, but the word in taking vpon him the nature of man, did vnite him selfe to it, &amp; in vniting tooke it, as it is euident, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
                     <p>The fourth doctrine <hi>is, the baptising of infants,</hi> for which Master Charke quoteth. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12. <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant of eight daies shall be circumcised.</hi> Against this you haue manie trifling cauills, <hi>that baptisme is not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, of the sexe, of the eight daie.</hi> Against which I oppose the authoritie of Saint Augustine, which <hi>lib. 1. cont. Crescon. Grammat. cap. 31.</hi> confuteth the rebaptization of such as were baptized by heretikes, by example of them that were circumcised, by the Samaritantes, whose circumcision was not to be repeated: to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:12222:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whome the like might be obiected. But it is sufficient, that wherein baptisme answereth to circumsion, the reason is one in both. Circumcision was the sacrament of regeneration, as baptisme is: the one giuen to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes, <hi>ergo</hi> the other. The cerimonie of the eight day, had an other reason, not needefull to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in baptisme. The distinction of the sexe is taken awaie by Christ, in whome there is neither male, nor female. <hi>That Beza was striken dumme with this question, in the conference at Poyssie, it is a slaunder of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius de Xanctes,</hi> confuted by Beza him-selfe. But you had rather followe Saint Augustine, who contendeth and prooueth, <hi>that baptizing of infantes is onelie a traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apostles, and not left vs by anie written Scripture, lib. 10. cap. 23. super Gen. ad lizeram.</hi> So you write, but I will set downe Saint Augustines wordes, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may see, what contention and proofes he vseth, hauing protested of his ignorance, how the reasonable soule commeth into the bodie, he concludeth that the baptisme of infantes fauoreth their opinion which thinke, that soules are procreated of the parentes. And of the baptisme of infantes thus he writeth. <hi>Consuctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do tamen matris Ecclesiae in baptizandis paruulis nequaquam spernenda est, neque vllo modo superflua de putanda, nec om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino credenda, nisi Apostolica esset traditio. Habet enim &amp; il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laparua aet as magnum testimonij pondus, quae prima pro Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto meruit sanguine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fundere. Yet the custome of our mother the Church in baptizing of infantes is not to be despised, nor by any meanes to be thought superfluous, nor to be credited at all, if it were not an Apostolike tradition: for euen that litle age hath greate weight of testimonie, which first obteined to shed blood for Christ.</hi> You see that here is neither contention, not profe, that it is onelie a tradition, &amp; not leftin writing: for he alledgeth one testimonie out of Scripture, of gods acceptation of that age to martirdome, much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to baptisme: and manie other testimonies might be brought for the same purpose, as Matt. 19. 14.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:12222:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
1. Cor. . 7. 14. &amp;c. As for <hi>Origen,</hi> he doth onelie make mention of the baptisme of infants, according to the obseruance of the Church, to prooue originall sinne. But whether it stand onelie vpon tradition, and not vpon the scripture, he saith not one word.</p>
                     <p>The 5. Doctrine is, <hi>the changeing of the Sabbath into Sondaie.</hi> M. Charke quoteth Apo. 1. 10. <hi>I was in the spirit on the Lordes daie.</hi> Here you cauill <hi>that there is no mention of Saturdaie or sondaie, much lesse of celebration of either, and least of all of the changeing of the Sabbath into an other daie.</hi> But if it please your Censurship, are you ignorant what day of the weeke is called <hi>dies Dominicus,</hi> the Lordsday? whether saturdaie or sondaie? if it be sondaie, as al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christes name confesse, here is as much mention thereof, as is needfull for the daie into which the change is made. Or if that be not sufficient, you maie haue further, Act. 20. 7. 1. Cor. 16. 2. And whie is the first of the Sabbath called the Lordes daie, but in respect of the celebration there of, in honour of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world by Christ? For otherwise, all daies of the weeke are the Lordes daies, in respect of their creation. Thirdlie, seeing the Lordes daie was one daie in the weeke, vsed for the assemblie of the Church, for their spirituall exercises of Religion, it is certaine, that the change of the Iewish Sabbath was made into that daie, except you would be so waywatd; to saie there were two daies in euerie weeke, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to be celebrated whereas the lawe of God requireth but one, and giueth libertie of bodelie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in sixe daies. So that the change of the Sabbath daie is sufficientlie prooued out of the Scripture, into the Lordes daie.</p>
                     <p>The sixt point is, <hi>about foure Gospells, and the Epistle to the Romanes,</hi> which Master Charke saith to be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of the scripture, but yet he quoteth no place of scripture, where onelie he saith the inscription expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the names of the writers. <hi>But what a mocker is this?</hi>
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:12222:166"/>
(you saie) <hi>Are the bare names of the Apostles sufficient to prooue that they were written by them? who can prooue by scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that these names are not counterfet, as in the Epistle to the Laodiceans, in the Gospells of Bartholomew and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, &amp;c.</hi> But abide you sir: your question hath two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the one, that the 4. Go spells are true Gospells: the other, that the epistle to the Romanes was written by Saint Paul, and not that to the Laodiceans. To the former it is answered, that they are prooued, by other vndoubted bookes of the scripture, both of the olde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and the new: secing they declare that to be fullfilled of Christ, which was spoken in the lawe, in the Prophetes, and in the Psalmes. To the other it is answered, that admitting the Epistle to the Romanes to be scripture, the inscription of his name is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prooue that it was written by Saint Paull. And so of therest. Although the name of the writer is not materiall vnto saluation, when the booke is receiued to be Canonicall as diuers bookes of scripture are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, whose writer is vnknowne. <hi>That Epistle</hi> which is called <hi>to the Laodicians,</hi> is not receiued, and therefore the inscription is vnsufficient, as the Gospelles of Bartholomew, and Thomas, and such like, which are knowne to be countefet, by the dissent they haue from the other canonicall scriptures. Whereas you require <hi>one place of Scripture to prooue all the foure Gospelles to be canonicall,</hi> you declare your wrangling, and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward spirit. But name you anie one point of Doctrine writen in anie of those foure Gospells, and the same shall be aduouched by other textes of scripture, and so maie eucrie point conteined in them, if neede were. But you affirme, <hi>that Origen saith, he reiecteth the Gospell of Saint Thomas, onelie for that the tradition of the Church receiued it not.</hi> Which is false. He saith, he hath read the Gospell after Thomas, after Mathias, and manie other, <hi>Sed in his omnibus nihil aliud probamus, niss quod Ecclesia, idest, quatuor tantùm euangelia recipienda. But
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:12222:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in all these, we allowe nothing els, but that which the Church alloweth, that is, that onelie foure Gospells are to be receiued.</hi> In these wordes he affirmeth, that he approoueth the iudgment of the Church, he saith not, that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or traditions of the Church was the onelie cause whie he reiected those Gospells: for he said before, they were receiued of heretikes: and wherefore? but in maintenance of their heresie, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the holie scriptures. That all counterfet Go spells were reiected by the Church, it is confessed: but the Church had this iudgement of discretion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the canonical scriptures, against which Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius saith nothing. But <hi>when Faustus the Manichie <note place="margin">lib. 1. cont. Hebion. &amp; lib. 1. haer. 46.</note> denied the Gospell of Saint Mathew (saie you) saith not S. Augustine, Mathaei Euangelium probatum aduersus Faustum Manichaeum per traditionem? The Gospell of Mathew was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged against Faustus the Manichie by tradition.

And where you saie, that <hi>euerie litle gesse at our pleasure is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prooue what we will, whereas no testimonies of your part will serue, except they be so plaine and euident, as by no waits they maie be auoyded, and thereupon charge vs to be Lordes of the scriptures,</hi> it is as manie other of yours, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable slaunder. For as I haue shewed before, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters necessarie to saluation, we admit no gesses, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifest wordes of scripture, or els that which is necessarilie concluded out of manifest wordes, and principles confessed: and such if you haue anie, bring them forth, and we will hearken vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Ouer against the article <hi>of punishing heretiks by death, which,</hi> (you saie) <hi>was a long time denied by our selues to be allowable by scripture,</hi> you note in the margent <hi>Luther against Latomus de incendiariis,</hi> of burners. For what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I maruell, seeing in that booke he complaineth of the Louanistes, not for burning heretikes, but for bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his bookes. For the mention which Saint Paull is thought of some to make of an Epistle written to the Laodicenses, you are not a litle netled, that Master Chark condemneth both you and Saint Ieromes tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of ignorance. You saie <hi>he should not obiect igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance so peremptorilie to you, you ought not so rigorously to haue beene reprehended,</hi> and you name a great manie aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers, which <hi>may be sufficient, to wipe awaie Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Charkes bitter reproch against you.</hi> But let vs see howri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:12222:170"/>
and bitterly he hath delt with you, yea how peremtorilie he obiecteth ignorance to you by his own wordes. <hi>The Episile to the Laodiceans, although manie make mention of it, Paull maketh none: so that either you ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantlie passed ouer the greeke, or willfullie addicted your selfe to the olde translation, being in this place plainlie corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For by the originall Paull speaketh of an Epistle from Laodicea, and not writen to the Laodicenses, as you vntrulie assirme.</hi> Here is all that he saieth: you are a daintie Parnell that count your selfe so rigorouflie reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and so bitterlie reproched in those wordes, where ignorance is not peremptorilie obiected, as you saie, but either that, or willful addiction to the olde transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I know not vpon what ground, you doe so peremtorilie call S. <hi>Ieromes translation.</hi> Master Charke hath more cause to complaine of you, for that you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that he saith, <hi>the greeke text hath of an Epistle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by S. Paull from Laodicea.</hi> For he saith not, an Epistle written by Saint Paull, but <hi>from Laodicea,</hi> by whome so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it was written. Where you cite manie that thought mention to be made of one written by Saint Paull to the Laodiceans, he confesseth as much.</p>
                     <p>But it is more against Master Charke, that you haue two Greeke editions, the one of Pagnine, the other of Plantine which make for you, as you affirme. But what if you be deceiued in them, as great a clarke as you would seeme to be, that maie not be touched with the least suspicion of ignorance.

For the Epistle of Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:12222:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which your two greeke editions haue, and the Epistle of the Laodicenses which your vulgar translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath, cannot signifie an Epistle written to the Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicenses, but from Laodicea, or from the Laodiceans, which in sense maie be al one with the most vsuall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that expresseth the preposition <hi>from.</hi> Therefore it is true that Master Charke saith, by both the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by the vulgar Latine text also, that albeit manie make mention of an Epistle, written by Saint Paull to the Laodiceans, he him selfe maketh none.</p>

                     <p>His third reason is taken of the wordes of S.

                        </gap>, which are able to make thee wise, you harpe onelie vpon the word, of instructing, which the vulgar interpreter vseth, not sufficient to answere the greeke verb <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>: and yet if it be rightlie vnderstood, as perhappes he meant, it signifieth to furnish, and not to teach properlie: so the sense might be, that the scripture is able to furnish thee with knowledge to saluation: and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> a sufficiencie.</p>
                     <p>Now to your pelting cauilles. You aske, <hi>if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which can shew Timothie the waie to saluation, and bring him also to it, if he will follow them, be sufficient for the wholl Church, so that all Doctrine by tradition is superfluous?</hi> I answere, yea. For there is but one waie to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all the Church. But you obiect, <hi>that euerie Epistle of Saint Paull enstructeth a man to saluation, yet it not sufficient for the wholl Church.</hi> I answere, that euerie Epistle of Saint Paull is not sufficient to instruct a
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:12222:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man to saluation, or to make him wise vnto saluation. But that which Saint Paull spaketh, is of the wholl scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, not of euery epistle. For you might as well obiect, that euery chapter and verse instructeth a man toward saluation, rather then to saluation, but not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie: yet the wholl is able to make a man wise vnto saluation. Your second obiection is, that <hi>the Apostle speaketh principallie of the olde Testament, and will Master Charke saie that the olde Testament is sufficient to Christian men for their saluation, without anie other writt?</hi> Yea I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you: for there is no Doctrine in the new, but it was taught in the olde. Saint Paull affirmeth that <hi>he said nothing, but that which the Prophetes, and Moses had spoken of thinges to be performed.</hi> The new Testament hath no other Doctrine then the olde, onelie it testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the performance of those thinges in Christ, which the olde Testament foreshewed to be performed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, because you grate so much vpon the exclusion of other writt, Saint Paull addeth <hi>by faith in Iesus Christ,</hi> which containeth all that is written in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning the storie of performancet, and seales of this faith. And if the olde were sufficient, how much more is the olde &amp; the new together, a rich &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant Doctrine. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Euerie Scripture, which is euerie seuerall booke, or euerie seuerall Chapter, or euerie seuerall verse, is not able to make the man of God perfect, and perfectlie prepared to euerie good worke: but the wholl is: therefore the translation must be, the whole scriptures, and not, euerie scripture.</p>
                     <p>But now to your tow reasons. In the first you saie, <hi>that Saint Paull could not meane to Timothie of all the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together, which we now vse, for that all was not then writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi> To this <hi>you confesse that he answereth, there was inough
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:12222:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
written then, for the susficient saluation of men of that time, and therest is not superfluous. But this, you saie, is from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi> Yea is? how so, I praie you? you answere, <hi>it was sufficient with the supplie by worde of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> vnwritten:</hi> but that is contrarie to the purpose for Master Charke telleth you, that from the time that any, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> was written, that scripture contanied sufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Before the scripture was written, the same doctrine in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance was deliuered by reuelation, that afterwarde was written. The continuance thereof was not onelie by bare tradition, but also in euerie age renewed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation. Againe, the age of men was lo long, that there remained alwaies faithfull and ceratine witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the doctrine aliue, so that it could not be corrúpted, but it was easie by those witnesses to be refuted. But when the age of man was drawne into the streights of 70. yeares, or litle more, as Moses <note place="margin">Psal. 90. 10.</note> sheweth, the Doctrine of the Church was committed to writing, euen as much at the first, as was sufficient for the instruction of the people vnto saluation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie supplie of traditions.

                     <p>GOtuisus reporteth the Iesuits, to saic, <hi>that the want of holie scriptures muste be supplied by peecing it out by traditions, Cens. f.</hi> 220. Here you repeat your olde friuolous quarrel, <hi>that the Iesuites haue no such vnreuerent words.</hi> Master Chark chargeth you out of Hosius, with a farre worseisaying: <hi>that if traditions be reiected, the verie Gospell it selfe seemeth to be reiected. For what els are traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then a certaine liuing Gospell?</hi> But thereto you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere not one worde, and the meaning of those words, reported by Gotuisus, you mainteine egerlie, thorouh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this section, as you did in parte in the 12. section, that the scriptures are not sufficient, and that there must be traditions receiued beside the scripture. To what ende, but to supplie the want, and insufficiencie of the holie scriptures? Nay, saie you: <hi>Though both parts
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:12222:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Gods worde, that is, both written, and vnwritten, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie vnto Gods Church: yet both of them do stand in their full perfection, assigned them by God, neither is the one a maime, or impeachment to the other.</hi> You meane, they are as perfect, as God made them, not that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word is sufficient to teach all trueth, vnto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the man of God. And so for all your vaine compasse of wordes, the sense is all one. The scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is but a part, or a peece of Gods worde, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are an other peece: and this peece must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that, or els it is not, a perfect or sufficient instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of itselfe for Gods Church.</p>
                     <p>The comparison you make <hi>of ioyning S. Lukes Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to that of Saint Matthew, or Saint Paules epistles to them both,</hi> to resemble your patching of traditions to the written word of God, is both odious, and vnlike, and, without begging the wholl matter in question, gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing. For the adding of the writings of one Euangelist to another, or of an Apostle to the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes, is but the heaping of heauenlie treasure, to the further inriching of the Church in all light of spirituall knowledge: so the accession of the bookes of the new testament, is as it were the vnfolding, or laying open of the same diuine riches, that was perfectlie contayned in the olde testament, for the saluation of all Gods elect, that, liued vnder that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. But your traditions (as you maintaine them) argue an insufficiencie of the holie scriptures, which allso you confesse your selfe, and are not a more plaine, or plentifull application of the mysteries comprehended in them. Therefore though you can for manners sake, otherwhile, forbeare odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous speeches aginst the dignitie of holie scriptures, yet euen that odious conclusion gathered by Gotui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus must needes follow of your doctrine, concerning the insufficiencie of scriptures, and the necessitie of traditions.</p>

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:12222:175"/>
word of god, argueth imperfection in the word of god. Your stale obiection of Saint Iohns Gospell written af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reuelation, is alreadie answered. For al bookes of scripture, that haue beene written, since the fiue bookes of Moses, are no addition to the word of God, but a more cleere explication of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> first com mitted to writing by inspiration of God. Neither do they teach an other waie of saluation, then Moses did, but set forth the same more plainlie by demonstration, by examples of Gods iustice, and his mercie, by threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings, by exhortations, by explication of his promises, by shewing the accomplishment, and the manner of perfourmance of them in Christ and his Church. And this they do moste absolutelie, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and plentifully, to the saluation of Gods people. <hi>These things,</hi> saith S. Iohn, <hi>are written, that you should <note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 31.</note> beleeue that Iesus is Christ, the sonne of God, and that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, you maie haue euerlasting life in his name.</hi> Here you maie as well cauill, that not onelie the Gospell of Saint Iohn, or the miracles written in the same, is necessarie to be beleeued vnto saluation, but all the rest of the scripture also, foolishlie opposing thinges that are no waie repugnant, but the one including the other. For the beleeuing of Saint Iohns Gospell, doth not exclude, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, all other bookes, and partes of holie scripture, which teach the same meane of saluation, or any thing thereto pertaining. <hi>But how holdeth this argument</hi> (saie you) <hi>no man maie adde to the booke of Apocalips, ergo no man maie beleeue a tradition of Christ, or his Apostles. Maie we not as well saie, ergo we maie not beleeue the actes of the Apostles?</hi> No sir, for we make our argument in this man ner, No man maie adde to the booke of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips, much lesse may anie man adde to the wholl Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of the olde, and new testament. And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, there are no traditions of Christ, and his Apostles, to be credited, as needefull to saluation, which are not
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:12222:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>

Or in what sense?</hi> as though his meaning, and sense of adding were not manifest, as also his accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the I suites, the Papistes do adde, to the word of God, their traditions, a necessarie to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet not expressed, or contained in the word of God. <hi>But if God</hi> (saie you) <hi>left anie doctrine by tradition vnto the Church, and our ancetours haue deliuered the same vuto vs, especiallie those of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Church, what shall we do in this case? Shall we refuse it? It seemeth dangerous, and I see no reason.</hi> The question is not, whether we should refuse anie thing that God hath left: but whether God hath left anie such tradition to be beleeued vnto salua tion, which is not contained in the holie scriptures. But if our ancetours of the primitiue Church, haue deliuered anie such tradition vnwritten, as left by Christ, what shall we doe? <hi>you see no reason to refuse it.</hi> But if you will learne reason, when it is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you maie see more then you do now. Are your ancetors of the primitiue Church greater then Saint Paull? Is there anie testimonié of man, greater then the witnes of an Angell from heauen? yet if Saint Paull him selfe, or an Angell from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, should preach an other Gospell then Saint Paull had preached, and is contained in the holi
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:12222:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
scriptures, that false Gospell were to be resused, and the author thereof to be accursed. Now that Saint <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> Paull preached nothing, beside the doctrine, contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the scriptures, he is a sufficient witnes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Act. 26. 22. But why see you no reason to refuse such traditions so obtruded? Forsooth <hi>because the same men, that deliuered vnto you the scriptures, and saide this is Gods writen worde, and saide of other forged scriptures, this is not Gods written worde, the same deliuered to you these doctrines, saying; this is Gods wordes vnwritten.</hi> So that by this reason, you haue no other foundation of your faith, but the testimonie of men: who as they may speake the truth in one matter, so they may lie, or be deceiued in an other. As euen by your owne reason the Grecians, the Armenians, the Georgians, the Moscouites, and all other sectaries are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue all that to be the word of God vnwritten, which the same men affirme to be such, that deliuered the canonicall scriptures to them, and said it was the word of God written. But in steade of this vnsure, and sandie ground, the children of God haue a more firme rocke, to builde their faith vpon: namelie the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of trueth, sealing in their heartes the testimonie of men, concerning the truth of Gods worde written. In which the same spirit also testifieth of the sufficiencie of the word written vnto saluation in such sort, as if we receiue the word written for truth, we must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne for false, what word soeuer speaketh either the contrarie, or addeth any thing as wanting, and not set forth in the word written. And this I say, not as though the primitiue Church, or the godlie fathers of the same, haue brought in any thing vnder the name of tradition of Christ, or his Apostles, as necessarie to saluation, although some of them in matters of rites, &amp; ceremonies, haue alledged tradition beside the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, yet in such things as are now for the most part abolished, either because they were not deliuered by
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:12222:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Apostles, as it was pretended, or els because such matters are mutable, and not perpetuall, though they were receiued from the Apostles.</p>
                     <p>But let vs examine the examples that you ioyne to your reason. First, <hi>Saint Augustine, and Origen doe teach vs, that baptizing of infantes is to be practized in the Church, onelie by tradition of the Apostles.</hi> For which you quote. <hi>August. lib. 10. ad gen. lit. cap. 23. Origen. in cap. 6. Epist. ad Rom.</hi> What Saint Augustine saieth and how the baptisme of infantes is practized by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the scripture, I haue shewed before, <hi>sect.</hi> 11. As for Origen, in the place quoted, hath neuer a word to any such matter. But of these impudent allegations, we haue had too many examples alreadie. The second example is, <hi>Saint Hierome and Epiphanius tell vs, that the faste of the lent, and oher the like, is a tradition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Hierom. Epist. 54. ad, Marcella. Epiphann. Haer.</hi> 7. 5. Hieromes wordes are these against the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanistes. <hi>Nos vnam quadragesimam secundùm traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Apostolorum, toto anno, tempore nobis congruo, ieiuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We fast one lent or fourtie daies according to the tradition of the Apostles, in the wholl yeare, in a time conuenient for vs: they make three lentes, or fourtie daies fast in a yeare, as though three sauiours had susse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: not but that it is lawfull all the yeare long, except in the pentecostor fiftie daies, but that it is one thing to offer a gift of necessitie, an other thing to doe it of free will.</hi> Here Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome saith, that one fourtie daies fast, is of the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostles, but other writers say otherwise. For <hi>Damasus</hi> in his <hi>Pontificall</hi> saieth, that Telesphorus Bishope of Roome did institute this seauen weekes faste, before Easter. <hi>Telesphorus</hi> him-selfe, in his <hi>decretall Epistle,</hi> saith, <hi>that he, and his fellow Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes gathered in a Councell at Roome, did ordeine this

                        </gap> before his time there was great controuersie betweene the next successours of the Apostles, concerning the daie of the celebration of Easter, and that the coutrouersie was not onelie of the daie, but also of the fast: some fasting one daie, some two dates, some more. So that of the Apostles tradition, we haue no certaintie in any monument of antiquitie. Againe it is to be noted, that <hi>Hierome holdeth it vnlawfull to faste betweene Easter, and Whitesontyde,</hi> which he calleth <hi>Peatecoste,</hi> by the same tradition of the Apostles, which yet in the Popish Church is not obserued at this daie: for beside the fridaie fast, they haue also the gang weeke fast in that time, which in Saint Hieromes age was accounted vnlawfull to fast in. Your other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <hi>Epiphanius</hi> speaketh not of your fourtie daies lent, but of a shorter, and yet a streighter. For these are his wordes: <hi>Aquo verò non assensum est in omnibus orbis ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum regionibus, quòd quarta, &amp; prosabbato ieiunium est in Ecclesia ordinatum. Siverò etiam oportet constitutionem A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolorum proferre, quomodo illic decreuerunt quarta &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabbato ieiunium per omnia, excepta pentecoste, &amp; de sex dieb. paschatis quomodo praecipiunt nihil omnino accipere, quàm panem, &amp; salem, &amp; aquam, qualemque diem agere, &amp; quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo dimittere in illucescentem dominicam, manifestum est. And of whome is it not agreed in all regions of the world, that one wednesdaie and fridaie fast is ordeined in the Church: But if we must also bring forth the constitution of the Apostles, how they haue there decreed one the wednesdaie, and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daie a fast, thoroughout all except pentecost, and of the six
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:12222:177"/>
daies of Easter, how they commaund to take nothing at all, but bread, and salte, and water, and how to spend the daie and how to giue ouer against the dawning of the Lords daie, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</hi> Here he speaketh but ofsixe daies before Easter daie, and of an other manner of diet, then the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Church holdeth to be necessarie. Secondlie, he speaketh of the fourth daies or Wednesdaies fast to be appointed by the tradition of the Apostles which yet neuerthelesse the Romish Church doth not obserue. Thirdlie, that the Pente cosse or fiftie daies, by the tradition of Apostles, are exempted from the Fridaie fast, which tradition is not kept in the Popes Church, except you will saie that Pentecost is taken for whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son weeke, and then the custome of the PopishChurch is directlie contrarie to the tradition of the Apostles: for Wednesdaie and Fridaie that weeke are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> daies. And as for the Wednesdaie fast, as well as the Fridaie, Epiphanius is so earnest, that he addeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Deinde verò, st non de eodem argumento quartarum, &amp; Prosabbatorum, ijdem Apostoli in constitutione dixissent, eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amaliter vndi<expan>

And moreouer if the same Apostles in their constitutions had not spoken of the same argument of wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, &amp; Fridaies, we could otherwise throughly make proofe of it. But they write exactly ofit, and the Church hath taken it vp, &amp; assent hath bin geuen in al the world.</hi> You see he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth not onely a decree of the Apostles, but also the consent of all the world, for the wednesdaie fast, as well as the Fridaie fast. So that if the Apostles tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beside the scripture be necessarie for lent, whie is it not also for wednesdaies fast? And if wednesdaies faste is not necessarie, no more is lent fast.</p>
                     <p>Further you affirme, <hi>that Dionystus and Tertullian saie, that praiers, and oblations for the dead, are traditions of the Apostles, De Eccles. hier. c. 7. de corona milit.</hi> but <hi>Dionystus,</hi> al beit we do not acknowledge him for a man of such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie,

of wordes, that shalbe song in the Church, it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and the later Church hath vsed her libertie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to alter that forme which Saint Basill saith was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by the Apostles themselues without writing. By this I hope it is manifest, what kinde of traditions are of equall force, or authoritie with the scripture, euen they which haue their ground in the scriptures, and none other.

                     <p>Your next testimonie is out of <hi>Eusebius, lib. 1. Eu. Demonst. cap. 8.</hi> whole wordes you mangle after your manner, leauing out at your pleasure, more then you rehearse. Eusebius hauing shewed the excellencie of Christ aboue Moses, declareth also that there are two manners ofliuing in Christianitie, the one of them that are strong and perfect, the other of them that are subiect to manie infirmites, and that whereas Moses did write in tables without life, Christ hath written the perfect preceptes of the new Testament in liuing mindes, &amp; his disciples following their Masters minde, considering what Doctrine is meete for both sortes, haue committed the one to writing, as that which is necessarie to be kept of all, the other they deliuered without writing, to those that were able to receiue it, wich haue excelled the common manner of men in knowledge, in strength, in abstinence, &amp;c. And this is the meaning of Eusebius in that place, not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie traditions necessarie to saluation of euerie man,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:12222:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which are not taught in the holy scriptures, but of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine precepts, tending to perfection, not enioyned to all, but written in the heartes of some.</p>
                     <p>The third man is <hi>Epiphanius, who</hi> (you saie) <hi>is more earnest then Eusebius, writing against certaine heretikes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apostolici, which denied traditions, as our Protestantes do.</hi> Which is but a tale: for they were more like to Popish monkes and friers, then Protestantes: For they professed to abstaine from marryage, &amp; to poslesse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and such other superstitions they obserued. But what saith Epiphanius for traditions? <hi>He saith that we must vse tradition. For all thinges can not be taken out of the scripture: wherefore the holie Apostles deliuered somethings in the scriptures, and something in tradition.</hi> Mine answer to Epiphanius, is the same that it was to Basilius, Namelie, that such things as were not expressed in plaine wordes in the scripture, were approoued by tradition, being neuertheles such thinges as were to be concluded necessarilie out of the scripture. As in the question, for which he alledgeth tradition, it is manifest: <hi>Tradiderunt, &amp;c. the holie Apostles of God</hi> (saith he) <hi>haue deliuered vnto vs, that it is sinne after virginitie decreed, to be turned vnto marriage.</hi> This the Papistes doubt not, but that they are hable to prooue out of the scripture, except where the Pope dispenseth. And we acknowledge, that where the vow was made a duisedly, to a Godlie purpose, and abilitie in the partie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, that it is sinne to breake it, neither can the Pope dispense with it.

in vaine.</hi> To the first, I answer, that it prooueth no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions necessarie to saluation, which are not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the scriptures: as is more manifest, by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third text: for where Saint Paul saith, <hi>so I teach in all the Churches of God. 1. Cor. 14. 33.</hi> he saith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatelie before, that <hi>God is not the God of sedition, but of peace. &amp; 1. Cor. 15. 1. 2. 3. the Apostle speaketh</hi> manifestlie, of the doctrine of the resurrection, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he him-selfe in that place writeth plentifullie, and in manie other places of scripture, the same article is taught moste expresselie. You see therefore how sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiallie Epiphanius prooueth tradition vnwritten, out of the scripture, to be necessarie to saluation: which is our question.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But with Epiphanius</hi> (saie you) <hi>ioyneth fullie and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Saint Chrysostome, writing vpon these wordes of Saint Paul to the purpose. Stand fast, and holde traditions: out of which cleere wordes Saint Chrysostome maketh this illation. Hinc patet, &amp;c. Hereof it is euident, that the Apostles deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered not all by epistle, but manie thinges also without wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and those are as worthie credit as these. Therefore we think the tradition of the Church to be worthie of credit, it is a tradition, seeke no more.</hi> The sense of these wordes is, that the Apostles, in their preaching, did expresse manie things, more perticularly then in their epistles: not that they preached anie thing necessarie to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that the same was contained either in their epistles, or in other bookes of the holie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And so I saie of the tradition of the Church which is a doctrine contained in the scriptures, though not expressed in the same, or in so manie wordes: as the three persons, and one God in trinitie, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in vnitie to be worshipped, &amp;c. is of equall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with that which is expressed in the scriptures: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the ground of our faith, standeth not vppon the sound of wordes, but vppon the sense, and true meaning of thinges them-selues. And this is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:12222:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meaning, not of traditions altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the compasse of the scriptures, and yet held ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to saluation. For of the sufficiencie of the scri ptures he speaketh in diuers places, and namelie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that cleere text. 2. <hi>Tim. 3. Hom 9.</hi> of the scripiure he saith. <hi>Siquid vel diseere, velignorare opus sit, illic addisce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. If anie thing be needefisli to know, or not to know, in the scriptures we shall learne.</hi> But because you saie, <hi>those wordes of Saint Paulare cleere. 2. Thess. 2. for vnwritten tradititions,</hi> I praie you, what argument can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude out of them? Saint Paul deliuered to the Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians, something by preaching, and something by writing, <hi>ergo</hi> he deliuered something that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the holie scriptures, written either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or anie other of the holie men of God, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that purpose. Who is so childish, thinke you, to graunt you this consequence? therefore for anie thing you haue brought or can bring, or anie thing that the fathers haue said or can saie, the word of God writ ten is perfect, and <hi>hable to make a man wise to saluation, by faith in Iesus Christ,</hi> which is to be had sufficientlie in the holie scriptures, as Christ him-selfe doth witnes. Iohn. 5. 39. And so the former conclusion doth still stand. It is great iniquitie to receiue traditions alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beside the holie scripture, as necessarie to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which must needes argue the holie scriptures of imperfection, and vnsufficiencie. Neither doth the consent of Antiquitie refute this assertion of Master Charke, seeing the auncients, as it is said, spake either of doctrine not expressed in word, but contained in deede, in the scriptures, or els of rites, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: the perpetuall obseruation where of is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satie to eternall life, as is prooued by the discussing of manie of them, which the elder fathers do father vpon the tradition of the Apostles, as much as anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they name.

Likewise you saie <hi>he prooueth by the same tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we must not rebaptize those which are baptized of heretikes, lib. 2. de bapt. capt. 7. &amp; lib. 1. cap. 23. &amp; lib. 4. cap. 6</hi> It is true, that he perwsadeth him selfe, that this custome of not rebaptizing, came from the Apostles tradition, yet doth he by many arguments out of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prooue, that such are not to be baptized againe, which haue beene once baptized, although by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, and therefore he saith of the same matter, <hi>Hoc planè verum est, quia ratio &amp; veritas consuetudini praepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenda est. Sed cùm consuetudini veritas suffragatur, nihil oportet firmius retineri.

                     <p>Againe, you saie, <hi>He prooueth by tradition the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pentecost commonlie called Whitsontide. ep. 11 &amp;c.</hi> 1. If it were as you saie, it is but a matter of ceremony, not necessarie to saluation, but in the power of the Church to alter, as many like, which are abrogated. But in trueth he prooueth it not, as you say, by traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For these are his wordes. <hi>Illa autem quae non scripta, &amp;c.

And whencesoeuer they came, the matter is not great in such thinges, as of their owne nature are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and therefore alterable by discretion of the Church in all times. <hi>Whether the Apostles were baptized, which is the next matter,</hi> that you saie, <hi>he prnoueth by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> it is a question not so needefull to be decided, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may be prooued out of scripture that some of <note place="margin">Math. 3. 5. 7.</note> them which were Iohns disciples, were baptized by him, and so it is like were all the rest: seeing <hi>Ierusalem, and all Iurie, and all the coast neere vnto Iordan were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi>

Where Saint Augustine sheweth that the holie ghost would haue vs to vnderstand, that althinges were fulfilled in his baptisme, which though they be not expressed in that scripture, for breuities

sake, yet by order of the tradition we know that they are to be fulfilled. Where tradition is not taken for that which is altogether beside the scripture, but that which according to the scripture deliuereth what is to be obserued, concerning the celebration of that sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the seale of mortification, and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>That the Lordes supper should be receiued before other <note place="margin">Epist. 118.</note> meates,</hi> he thinketh of it as of other ceremontall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>that it came either from Apostolike tradition, or from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of generall councell,</hi> yet is it a thing not necessarie alwaies to be obserued: for your selues doe housell sicke folkes, at all times of the daie, or night, without respect, whether they haue tasted any thing or no: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise as a matter of order, and decencie, it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs also, to minister that sacrament before din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to them that be fasting, if the case of necessity require not the contrarie.</p>

But the truth is, that by the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of exorcisme, exsufflation, and renunciation, that is vsed in baptisme, he goeth about to prooue, that infantes before baptisme be in originall sinne, and in the power of the deuill: as is euident by both the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which prooue not exorcisme to haue beene recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by tradition, but by the end of that ceremonie (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what beginning soeuer) vsed in the Church at that time that infants are borne in originall sinne, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the power of Sathan, before they be baptized.

But although it (originall sinne) may be sought out by noe reason, by no speach it may be expressed, yet is it true that by true Catholike faith from auncient time is preached, and beleeued thoroughout the wholl Church, which would neither exorcise, nor exsufflate the children of the faithfull, if shee did not deliuer them from the power of darkenes, and from the prince of death.</hi> Here the auncient doctrine of original sinne is confirmed by the olde ceremonies of exorcisme, and exsufflation, which were vsed in baptisme, to signifie that infants were by that sacrament deliuered from the guilt of originall sinne, by which they were vnder the power of darkenes and death.

persons, or to any purpose whatsoeuer: and that there is not in them a certaine and infallible sense, to iudge of the Churches doctrine, or to finde out the true Church from all false congregations, by the trueth taught in the scriptures, but that the authoritie and common vnderstanding of the Popish Churches tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is the onelie true sense, &amp; inflexible rule of the holy scriptures. wherebie also it is manifest, though you denie it neuer so stoutlie, that you doe impute the wresting of the scriptures, vnto the imperfection of Gods worde set forth in them, and not onelie to the malice of the wrester. For if the will of God be but as well expressed in them, as the will of princes is in their written lawes, and proclamations, the one maie as well be found out, by reading and weighing of the holie scriptures, as the other may be out of prophane writings, especially where the spirit of God, graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the praiers of the elect, openeth their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, not onelie to conceiue, as the naturall man maie, by studie, and ordinarie helpes, the true scope and purpose of God vttered in them, but also to beleeue, and embrace whatsoeuer the Lord their God hath propounded in them. Therefore though the scripture may be wrested to the destruction of the vngodlie, as Saint Peter sheweth, yet Master Charke telleth you, that it cannot so be wrested, but that still it remaineth the <hi>light vnto our feet,</hi> and the <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne vnto our steppes:</hi> and euerie parte thereof, is like the arme of a great Oke, which cannot be so wreste, but that with great force it will returne into the right posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the shame and perill of the wrester, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of his you doe so dissemble, as though you had neuer seene it.

the kingdome of vs ministers, where the letter of the scripture is worsse wrested by vs to all errors and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnes, then euerie waxen nose was yet bended, to diuerse fashions. O ye senseles papists, had you neuer a man of moderat iudgement, to set forth against vs, but this loosetongued Gentelman, which so he maie raile with full mouth against vs, hath no care how his slaunders maie be coloured? Doe we peruert the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to all errors? then surelie, we holde no trueth: there neuer was anie heresie, neither can there be anie heresie, but that with manie errors, it maintaineth and holdeth manie truethes. Yea the Deuill him-selfe the father oflies, beleeueth some truethes, and for shame dare not professe the maintenance of all errors. We thinke verie hardlie of Antichrist, and his brood the papists, yet we maie not saie, that they wrest the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to all errors, and licentiousnes: for if they so did, they should not deceaue so manie by shew of trueth in errors, except they did professe some articles of trueth in deede. <hi>As for the wresting of the Scripture to all licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi> let God and all the world of reasonable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different men iudge, how iustlie we maie be charged therewith. If we be licentious in our liues, God will finde it out, and let man, where he findeth it, punish vs. But if we wilfully peruert the scriptures to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of all licentiousnes, the Lord reward vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our deedes, and be not mercifull to them, that sinne of malicious wickednes.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>it is no fault in the scriptures</hi> (saie you) <hi>that they may be abused.

And of my louing brethren that be Catholike, I must farder require one thing (the sute is for them selues) that, when in a manner they sensiblie feele the trueth, they would not refuse to follow the same, that by outward worke they may declare their inward will. Here of I am more carefull, for that I see heresie and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode to be of that countenance and colour, that it is often li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, before it be beleeued: where gods trueth, for terrour and bitternes that it beareth, is not alwaies followed, where it is wel knowne &amp; trusted.

Mans will must in all such cases of terrour and difficultie, geue ouer to Gods ordinance, whose commaundements, though they seeme to the worldlie burdenous, yet to the good and ghostlie, &amp; paucis amantibus (saith Saint Augustine) they are

And this let euerie man assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redlie know, that whosoeuer counteth confession so heaiue, he neither feeleth the waight of sinne, nor yet sufficientlie fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the appointed paine for the same.

In which person ech nature so retaineth the essentiall proprieties of it selfe vnconfounded, or destroied, that he is but one person our Lord and sauiour Iesus Christ. Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that some actions arepeculiar to his godhead, some proper to his manhood, and some proceeding iointlie from him, as he is God and man. As God he <note place="margin">Iohn. 5. 17. Mat. 9. 4.</note> worketh euen as his Father, he knoweth the th oughts

of mens heartes, he knoweth the last daie, whereof he is ignorant as man. Againe that he did eate, drinke, <note place="margin">Mar. 13. 32.</note> sleepe, sorrow, die, it was proper to his humanitie. Finallie that he preached the Gospell, wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, offered sacrifice for our sinnes, rose againe, &amp;c. and such like thinges, he did as the Mediatour God and man. And although by reason of the vnitie of the person, that is often spoken of the whole person, which is peculiar to either nature, or of God, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to man, or of man, which is proper to God: yet to preserue the essentiall properties of ech nature, we must wiselie distinguish, that which is proper vnto the diuinitie, from that which is proper vnto the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whereof we see <hi>Master Allen</hi> hath small regard. while he affirmeth that all these functions of Christ, whereby he offereth sacrifice as a Priest, vseth sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, praied to God, is made the head of the Church, the gouernour of the Church, and the iudge ofthe Church, pertaine vnto him in respect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his humane nature. For of the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ofhim-selfe, the Apostle expresselie affirmeth, that <hi>it was made by his eternall spirit,</hi> which being offered by an inferior nature, could not haue beene accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto God. Heb. 9. 14. Also that Christ God and man, is the head of the Church, and aduanced in his humanitie, to be iudge of the worlde, it is in respect and consideration ofhis godhead, vnto which his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie is vnited. For as he is the image of the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible God, by whome all thinges are created in heauen and earth, he is the head of his bodie the Church, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. &amp;c.

And therefore, it must needes, according to Saint Augustines iudgement, concerne the shape of his seruice and manhood taken on him, in which he preached so, that yet it pleased him to affirme, that his Doctrine was not his owne, but his Fathers that sent him: and healed the contrite in heart, which is nothing els, but to forgiue sinnes to the penitent, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such a sort, that it might well appeare to be receiued and practised by the vnction of the Spirit of God, and sending of his Father, whereby the Sonne of man might doe that as Gods minister in his manhood in earth, which both he, and his eternall Father, with the holie Spirit of them both, doe worke by their owne, one, and equall authoritie in heauen euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastinglie.</hi>

That the sonne of man had power vpon earth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue sinnes, he him-selfe affirmeth Mat. 9. 6. but this was the power of his godhead, which was not restrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor abased, by the shape of a seruant, in which he appeered on earth. That he was authorized by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the holie Ghost, to preach remission of sinnes vnto the penitent, it pertaneth indeede vnto him, in respect of his manhood, although Saint Augustine in the place by <hi>Allen</hi> quoted, saieth not so, but citeth the place of Esaie, to prooue that Christ, in respct of his

That the annointing of Christ should be meant of his humanitie, no man doubteth that is of anie right vnderstanding. For without all controuersie the inferiour and lesse euer receiueth blessing of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and greater. <hi>There can be no question then, but all soueraigntie and supreme iurisdiction, which he exercised ouer the Church, being his bodie and spouse, in that respect that he was either Priest and</hi> Bishop of our soules, <hi>as Saint Peter calleth him, or els as he was out head and pastour, it is certaine, that all this came vnto him by his fathers sending, and the vnction of the holie Ghost, and the benediction of the holie Trinitie, to which he was inferiour accor ding to his manhood.</hi>

                        <p>We doubt not that <hi>Christ was a Priest, as touching his humanitie,</hi> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, but we beleeue that he was a Priest, as he was the mediator, God and man. Fot as some ministeriall partes of that office did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that he should be a man, áccording to which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he might be subiect, so other parts of the same office required the authoritie of God. For none but God, hath authoritie to reconcile man, and to bring him into the holiest place, into the presence and sight of God, whereunto he hath full right of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and dignitie. The forcible testimonies that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Allen citeth out of the Apostle, Heb. 5. &amp; 9. haue no force to prooue, that Christ is not a Priest, as he is God and man, although they prooue that he is a Priest, as he is man. But contrariwise if these scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be well marked, which the Apostle doth alledge out of the second Psalme: <hi>Thou art my sonne, this daie haue I begotten the:</hi> and out of the 110. psalme, <hi>thou art a Priest for euer after the order of Melchiseàech,</hi> they will make euident proofe vnto vs, that Christ not onelie in respect of his humanitie, but also in respect of his deitie, is our eternall high Priest, as he is our sauiour, our mediator, our redeemer, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places the Apostle sheweth more plainlie, and I haue argued purposelie, and plentifullie against the slaunderous note of the Rhemistes in my confutation of the Papistes quarreils against my writings. pag 64. vnto the end, whereunto I referre the reader for more full satisfaction. <hi>That Christ in his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:12222:203"/>
is made the supreame gouernor and head of his Church,</hi> we do constantlie bleeue: but that he hath this excellent authoritie, in respect of his humanitie alone, and not in respect of his diuinitie, we can not acknowledge. For in respect of his diuinitie his person is capable of all honour, glorie, power, and authoritie, which in the onelie respect of his humanitie it were not. <hi>That he is appointed to iudge the world also, in his humanitie,</hi> we confesse according to the scriptures: but seeing I haue prooued before, that to be iudge of the world, is <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 25.</note> proper to the deitie, we must needes confesse, that the man Iesus Christ, is appointed to be iudge of the quick and the dead, not onely as an high minister de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of God, in respect of his humanitie, but as God him-selfe, of supreame authority in respect of his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. For to holde that Christ, is no otherwise iudge of the world, but as an high minister, as kings and Princes are iudges of the earth, as high ministers by deputation onelie of Gods authoritie committed to them, and not by right of their nature, I see not how it can be excused from grosse Nestorianisme. The scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which protest, <hi>that all power in heauen and earth is geuen to Christ,</hi> are to be vnderstood in deede of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of his humanitie, and crowning of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, with glorie and maiestie: but thereof it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that Christ enioyeth all that power, that is giuen to him, by the onelie right of his humanitie. For except Christ were God, as verilie as he is man, he were not able to receiue such a gift, which no creature can haue, except he be also creator and God himselfe, therefore Christ truelie as man, receiueth that which is giuen, but in respect and right of his godheade, he is able to receiue and exercise that power, which none can haue but God onelie. These thinges indeede maie seeme vnto the simple to be farre fetched, and farre from the question of priests power to remit sinnes, but they are much farther from the truth of our Catholike

                        <p>The due consideration of Christes authoritie, and excellent office touching his manhoode, will nothing helpe to restore the decaied honour and iurisdiction of Popish priesthoode, except you can both prooue your Popish priests capable of such honour and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as the sonne of God is, and also bring forth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes out of the holy scriptures, for that high calling, whereof you boast. That any faithful Christian, whome you to maintaine an Antichristian authoritie, call <hi>Miscreantes,</hi> haue dishonoured Christs dignitie, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his incarnation and office of his redemption, it is a slaunder stronglie aduouched, but slenderlie prooued. For first Caluine affirming <hi>Christ to be a priest in his wholl person, God and man,</hi> derogateth nothing from that dignitie, neither is he iniurious against the second person in trinitie: for <hi>Christ is an high priest after the order of Melchesidech,</hi> and our redeemer, not as a minister and seruant onelie, but as the sonne, as the King os peace and righteousnes, without father, without mother, without genealogy, hauing neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his daies, nor end of his life, al which things can not be restrained to the humanitie of Christ, but are proper to him as he is equall and eternall with his father. That <hi>Richerius</hi> should denie that Christ in his manhoode should iudge the world, it might well be a slaunder of that grosse potheaded Cyclops Villegag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which when he durst not abide the inuasions of the barbarous people in <hi>Gallia antarctica,</hi> where he had enterprised a conquest, he quarelled with Richerius,

And as touching his slaunderous libell, that you send the reader vnto, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you &amp; them to the answere &amp; confutation of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherius.

And if it be graunted that Christ so praieth for vs, yet it tendeth nothing towardes the intercession of Saints, but rather against it, because the interceffion of Christ is sufficient without them, yea if the intercession of Saints were prooued, it draweth not of necessity praier vnto Saints after it, and therefore there were smal purpose in them that denie Christ in such forme to praie for vs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Saints, which thing being either graunted or denied, prooueth neither too nor fro, that Saints are to be praied vnto or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>We doe Christianly confesse according to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and with the Church of Christ, that our sauiour Christ not onelie by power equall to his father, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his diuine nature, but also by graunt of God his father, in his humane nature, which is farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to his father, doth remit sinnes absolutelie, and of soueraigne authoritie, in respect of his diuinitie, as the mediatour God and man and that he did the same vpon earth also, as a minister and preacher of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reconciliation, according to his humanitie. But hereupon it followeth not, by any order, or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of consequence, that whoesoeuer denyeth meere man to haue authoritie, or power to forgiue sinnes, is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12222:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
iniurious to Christs person, and the dispensation of his flesh, or mysterie of his holie incarnation. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that man haue this authoritie which is God, yet it followeth not that such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as are onely men, are capable of the same authoritie. The diuersitie betwixt the state of our sauiour Christ, and others is so great, that nothing can be communicated to others, which is proper to him in respect of his diuine nature. And such a thing is the absolute power to forgiue sinnes, for which he hath made satisfaction to the iustice of God, which, whensoeuer we speake of the remission of sins, may not be forgotten. For the mercie of god forgiueth no sinne, but that for which his iustice is thorouglie satisfied in the obedience and iustice of our Lord and redeemer Iesus Christ. Therefore as no other man hath the dispensation of his satisfaction, but himselfe, so no other man can giue absolute forgiuenes of sins but him-selfe. But as all his ministers haue power to pronounce forgiuenes of sins to the penitent, which is noe more but to expresse his will and pleasure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the remission of sinnes, and in what sort and condition he bestoweth the same, so haue they power to teteine sinnes, not of them whome he will pardon, but of such as doe not repent, and therefore by his worde, are denied of forgiuenes: so that man in this case followeth the iudgement and authoritie of God, not God the iudgement and authoritie of man. For if a trew priest, elder, or minister, of the gospell, lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie authorized, would forgiue the sins of an hypocrite, that faigneth repentance, they are not forgiuen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: and if man would reteine the sinnes of a true penitent, yet are they forgiuen before God. For to man is giuen no absolute power to forgiue sins, any more then there is giuen to man an vndouted iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to discerne betweene hypocrites and true faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full persons.</p>
                        <p>But where you saie, <hi>that God could without derogation to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12222:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his godheade, communicat with the sonne of man, and graunt him in consideration of his assumpted nature, the rule &amp; redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of his people, the gouernment of our soules, the assoyling of our sinnes, &amp;c.</hi> I must know how farre you extend your consideration. For if you meane therebie, that God in respect of, or according to this assumpted humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, did communicate to our sauiout Christ, none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but such power as he might without derogation to his deitie, haue communicated vnto <hi>Moses, Samuel,</hi> or any other, which was a meere mortall man, for the redemption of our soules, and forgiuenes of our sins, I doe vtterlie abhorre your Nestorian, and worsse then Nestorian blasphemie but if you meane, that such pow er, as might without the derogation of his godhead be communicated to the sonne of man, is by him deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ministers of his Church, which execute the office of shepheardes, and teachers in his place, I doe gladlie confesse, that without all vnseemelinesse and derogation to his eternal honour, the ministers of the Church haue power, by his graunt to reteine, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue sinnes, that is, to declare the iudgement of God, in forgiuing or reteining of sinnes, according to such conditions as he hath expressed in his holie worde: which iudgement, according to those conditions, is so ratifyed by God him-selfe, that it is as certaine, as if it were pronounced, and vttered by his owne voice out of heauen. But where you speake <hi>of pardoning, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of penance,</hi> I must once againe distinguish of your meaning. For if you meane, by your Popish terme of <hi>penance,</hi> repentance, so that you saie, man hath power to giue repentance, which is a conuersion of the heart vnto God, and a chaunge of the minde from sinne to obedience of God, I spit at your blaspemous saying. For it is proper onelie to God, to giue repentance to Israell, and to all true Israelites of the gentiles his elected children, as the holie ghost teacheth, <hi>Acts. 5. and</hi> 11. in which places, your pupills the Rhemists,

And further I will not denie, but that God hath geuen pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vnto the gouernours of his Church and household, to pardon such penance, thatis, to remit vpon due and good consideration, some part, or the wholl of that time, and exercise, which to such penitents by them is enioyned: but that any mortall creature hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to pardon penance, in such sorte, that the partie which is to receiue the pardon, neede not to be peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for his sinnes, I stand still to the flat deniall.</p>

And whereas he saith, that the sonne of man had power to forgiue sinnes vpon earth, he meaneth not that he had it, as meere man: but as God and man in one person, and that his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode was no let vnto him, to exercise that power of his Godheade. <hi>Iohn. 3.</hi> he saith, <hi>the sonne of man came downe from heauen,</hi> and that <hi>the sonne of man is in heauen.</hi> But this is not to be vnderstood of the sonne of man, according to his manhood, but according to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as many other such speaches are in the scripture, which in respect of the vnitie of the person, ascribe to the one nature, that which is proper to the other, as <hi>Act. 20. to feede the Church of God, which he hath redeemed with his owne bloode.</hi> where redemption by his bloode is affirmed of God, which is proper and true, in respect of Christs humanity.

For faith alone doth iustifie afterward our Lord looketh into their murmuring, and saith, that it is easie for the sonne of man on earth to forgiue sinnes. But none truelie can forgiue sinnes but God alone, therefore he which forgiueth, is God, be ause no man remitteth but God.

But when his enimies vrged him, hee showeth his power more manifestlie: for he saith, that you maie knowe, that the sonne of man hath power on earth to forgiue sinnes.

idle, or vnoccupied, in the worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, yea that the godhead did not worke the principall and moste necessarie part thereof, it is too too abominable, and intollerable heresie.

                        <p>That God of his meere goodnes and mercie hath vouchsafed man of so great honour, that of him selfe deserueth eternall shame, it is more reason to wonder at Gods mercie, then to insinuate anie peece of mans dignitie or worthines. That it hath pleased god to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce some men to the gouernment of his Church vpon earth, we haue cause to magnifie his maiestie, that disdaineth not our base condition, but putteth his honour and authoritie vpon them, driueth vs not from them by the excellencie of their nature aboue ours, but familiarly inuiteth vs to obedience of his wil, that we may attaine to his promis of eternal happines. The title of this chapter, <hi>That our sauiour Christ gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Apostles, the same power of remitting sinnes, which God the father by commission gaue vnto his sonne, as he was man,</hi> we do all agree: but that Christ did exercise a more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne authoritie in forgiuing sinnes, then he did

bestow vpon his Apostles, or their nature was capable to receiue, it is prooued sufficientlie in the Chapter going before. Neuerthelesse I will examin all partes of this chapter, and if in anie thing I dissent from you, I will shew that you dissent from the trueth. And first where you professe onelie to seeke out the dignitie of Priesthood, touching the right that the order clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in remission and retention of mans sinnes, you should haue done better, to haue sought and set out the duetie of such persons also, to whome such dignity is committed, lest, as it falleth out in your bastarde Popish Priesthood, the dignitie be onelie sought for, the labour and duetie almost, or altogether neglected.

a purpose, gaue them this peace againe, in manner of a solemne benediction, and therewith said: Sicut misit me Pater, &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go mitto vos. Euen as the father hath sent me, so I do send you. And when he had so spoken, he breathed on them and said, Accipite spiritum sanctum: quorum remiseritis peccata, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittuntur eis: &amp; quorum retinueritis, retenta sunt.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue you the holie ghoste: whose sinnes soeuer you shall forgiue, they are forgiuen them: and whose sinnes you shall retaine, they be retained. <hi>This is the place, lo, in which the iudgement and rule of our soules with all authoritie in correcting our sinnes, in moste expresse and effectuall termes, and in moste ample manner is giuen to the Aposiles and their successours. Christ him seife doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate vnto them the iurisdiction that he receiued of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: he giueth them in a solemne ceremonie that same spirit of God, by which in earth him-selfe did remitte sianes: hema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them an assured promis, that whatsoeuer they pardoned or corrected in mans life, the same should stand in force before God.</hi>

                        <p>Our sauiour Christ in this place, doth first of all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize his Apostles, to execute the office of publike preaching of the Gospell in all the world, vnto the which he had before chosen &amp; appointed them. Then doth he furnish them with giftes of the holie Ghost meete for so high and painfull a calling: last of all he ratifieth the effect of their ministerie, to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in the remission of the sinnes, of all them that beleeue their preaching: and in the retaining of their sinnes, that do not obey the voice of the Gospell, to beleeue it. For the power of remitting sinnes, must not be separated from the office of teaching, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is annexed by our sauiour Christ: who doth not giue his Apostles authoritie to remit sinnes, so that he would transferre into them anie thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto him-selfe. For it is proper to him to remit sinnes: which honour, so farre forth as it pertaineth to his onelie person, he doth not resigne to his Apostles,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12222:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but commaundeth them in his name to testifie the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of sinnes, that he might reconcile men to God by their ministerie. For I haue shewed before in the words of S. Hilarie, that to speake properlie, God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by men remitteth sinnes, not following the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of man, but man following the iudgement of God, which is to pardon all penitent sinners, and to retaine the sinnes of vnbeleeuers, vnto eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Therefore it is much more then the place doth afforde, that you affirme the iudgement and rule of our soules, with al authoritie in correcting our sinnes in most expresse and effectuall tearmes, and in moste ample manner is giuen to the Apostles, and their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors in this place. For Christ in this place doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute Apostles, and not Iudges, messengers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarers of his good pleasure and will vnto men, not ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of mens soules: he giueth them power to remit or retaine sinnes in his name, to the inestimable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all penitent sinners, and to the terrour and in crease of damnation of all vnbeleeuers: he giueth them not al authoritie, and that in moste ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in correcting our sinnes: neither are there in the place anie expresse or effectual tearmes, our of which such omnipotent authoritie can be concluded, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when we come to your syllogisme, we shall platnlie declare. Againe, there is no mention in the text, of anie iurisdiction communicated vnto them, but of the office of teaching, whereunto Christ was sent for a time, which he committeth to his Apostles and their successours. For these wordes of our sauiour (<hi>As my father hrth sent me, I also do send you</hi>) can not be enlarged generallie, to all such purposes as God sent Christ: but must be vnderstood, according to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he speaketh of, that is, of the office of Preaching &amp; teaching, which Christ at that time did cease to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute in his humanitie, remaining yet still the onelie doctor and teacher of his Church, because he is author
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12222:214"/>
of the doctrine that is taught, and by his holie spirit teacheth continually, in giuing effect to the labours of his Apostles, Euangelists, Prophets, Pastours, &amp; teach ers, which he hath giuen vnto his Church, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ministerie of instructing the same in al truth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to the eternall saluation of his elect: He substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuteth therfore his Apostles in that necessarie office of preaching the Gospell, he enableth them by his spirit, which he testifieth vntothem by an holy signe, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from him.

                        <p>There is no dout, but the Apostles had power to remit sins, but yet for al your thetorical interrogations, none other, then I haue expressed before; nor greater, then may stand with the glory of Christ, who maketh not men equal with him. when he authorizeth them as his seruants, to be ministers of his mysteries, and stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes of his gracious giftes. And Paul trulie said much, when he affirmed, <hi>that god was in Christ reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciling the world to himselfe, not imputing to them their offences</hi> (which clause I know not why you haue omitted) &amp; <hi>hath put in vs that word of reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation.

the scripture shal we read of this your sacrament, or the institution thereof? what is the visible worde or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof? yet you saie, <hi>that this text doth in moste cleare, and vndoubted sense, giue to them the like right in that case, that Christ him-selfe had, by the sending of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that is to saie, the verie same authoritie, that he had in respect of his mediation and manhood.</hi> So that be like Christ, as Mediator, hath no authority peculiar to himselfe, in respect of the excellency of his person, but that which is communicable vnto others, and is communicated to his Apostles. But that is a strange doctrine, neuer heard of before in the Church of God, except it were from the mouth of Nestorius, or any of his disciples. For our sauiour Christ receiued in his manhoode, that which no other man is able to receiue, because he one lie is God and man: <hi>he receiued the spirit, not according to measure,</hi> Iohn. 3. 34. as all men muste do that receiue it: therefore no man can receiue such power by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in measure, which he receiued by the spirit infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or without measure. But <hi>Saint Augnstine</hi> is called to witnes, <hi>that this text doth giue theverie same authoritie to the Apostles, that Christ had in respect of his mediation, and manhoode.</hi> Whereas Saint Augustines words import no such thing, but onelie shew, that Christ, though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to his father in respect of his Godheade, yet as he is our Mediatour, is sent of his father in respect of his manhood. But of the verie same authoritie that Christ had in respect of his mediation, giuen to the Apostles, he speaketh not a word. That you ioyne his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hood to his mediation, as though the mediator were nothing but man, or as though the man Iesus Christ, which is our onelie mediator, were not <hi>Immannell,</hi> that is, God with vs, it is not without some smack of Nestorian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, wherebie you seeme so to separate the man from God, as though any thing might be verified of the man, which in respect of the vnitie of person, might not be verified of God, or as though there were not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12222:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such a perfect vnion ofthe two natures in one person, that although they both continue vnconfounded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining their essentiall properties, yet any part of the office and authoritie of Christ, which he exercised in his humanitie, might as latgelie, as fullie, and with the verie same authoritie, be committed ouer to any other mortall man, to be exercised, as it was by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. But <hi>Theophilact is cited to be an interpreter of Saint Augustine, whoe saith vpon these wordes, as the father hath sent me, &amp;c. in the person of Christ: take vpon you my worke, and be sure that I will be with you,</hi> meaning that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth to them the office of teaching, whereunto he was sent by his father, but of equall authoritie with him, he speaketh no worde. Which place you haue verie licentiouslie translated, to draw it to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For the words are no more but these, as Philippus Montanus hath translated them: <hi>Meum opus, inquit, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipite, &amp; confidite quod vobiscum sum futurus. And in the ende he willeth men to consider the dignitie of priests, that it is diuine. For it perteineth to God to remit sinnes: so there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they to be honoured, as God. For although they be vnworthie, what is that? they are the ministers of Gods giftes, and grace worketh by them, euen as he spake by Balaams asse. For our vnworthines hindreth not grace. so because by meanes of priests, grace is graunted, they are to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> Thefe wordes of <hi>Theophilact</hi> declare, that although he ascribe much to the dignitie of Priests, yet he doth not allowe them the verie same authoritie, that Christ had in respect of his mediation, but a farre inferior mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie.</p>

Our Lord and master Christ Iesus promoted his disciple, to a glorious Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: whoe becing made the proppes and staies of all the earth, haue established the wauering worlde: whereupon the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist sayeth thus of the earth and the Apostles: I haue surelie and firmelie set the pillers thereof. For the disciples no doubt be the verie pillers strength, and staie of trueth, whome Christ saith that he doth send, euen as his father did send him, that thereby he might declare to the worlde as well the dignitie of their Apostleship, as open to all men their excellencie and the might of their power: and no lesse signifie vnto them, what way they had to take in all their life and studies. For if they be so sent as Christ him selfe was sent of the father, it is requisite to consider, for what worke &amp; purpose the father euerlasting sent his sonne in flesh to the worlde.

                        <p>The wordes of Saint Cyrillus declare no more then I haue said before, that the Apostles were sent of Christ as Christ was sent of his father, to call sinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by their ministerie of preaching, not that they were sent with as large commission, in euery respect,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12222:216"/>
as Christ was sent, to be our mediator and redeemer. The wordes of Cyrill which you haue mangled and chopped at your pleasure, I will recite wholl together, that the reader may see, how iniutiouslie you would draw to farre other meaning, then his saying wil yeald. <hi>In Ioh. lib. 12. C. 55.</hi> vpon these words. <hi>Dicit ergo eis iterum, pax vobis: sicut misit me pater, &amp; ego mitto vos.</hi> He writeth thus. <hi>Ordinauit his verbis orbis doctores, &amp;c. He ordeined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by these words, teachers of the world, &amp; ministers of the diuine mysteries, whome he sent as lightes, to the lightening, not of the region of the Iewes onelie, which according to the measure of the legall commaundement, extended from Dan to Bersebe, as it is written: but he commaunded them to lighten the wholl worlde. Therefore Paul saith truelie, that no man taketh ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vpon him, except he be called of God. For our Lord Iesus Christ called his disciples vnto the glorious Apostleship, which staied the world that was moued, beeing made the pillers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Whereof by the Psalmist, he saith, of the earth, and the Apostles,: I haue strengthned the pillers thereof. For his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are the pillers and strength of truth. Whome he saith that he doth so send, as he him-selfe is sent of his father: that also he might shew the dignitie of their Apostleship, and open to all men the greatnes of their power, and with all might shew, what way they ought to follow in their studies, and in their life. For if they be so sent, as Christ is sent of his father, how is it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to consider, vnto what the father sent his sonne? for so, not otherwise, they may be able to follow him. But if expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to vs the cause of his sending many waies, one while he saide: I came not to call the iust, but sinners to repentance: an other while, The holl haue no neede of the Phisitian, but such as be diseased: And moreouer, I came downe from heauen (saith he) not that I might doe mine owne will, but the will of him that sent me: And againe, God sent not his sonne into the worlde, that he should iudge or condemne the world, but that the world might be saued by him. All which thinges he signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in most few wordes, saying that he doth so send them, as he was sent by his father: that hereof they might vnderstand,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:12222:217"/>
that sinners are to be called to repentance, that they which ar diseased might be healed both in bodie and in minde. And in the dispensation of thinges they must not doe their owne will, but the will of him that sent them, and that the world by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and the doctrine of faith must be saued. All which things with what great diligence they performed, you may learne with small labour, in the booke of the Acts of the Apostles &amp; in the Epistles of Paul.</hi> Thus farre Cyrillus whose saying if you had not clipped and gelded for your aduantage, would haue made no colour for your purpose, but against it.</p>

                           <hi>And truelie it was the singular prouidence of God, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the graunt of the gouernment of mens soules to his Disciples beeing but mortal men, mention should be made of his owne right therein, that the wicked should neuer haue face to disgrace the authoritie of them, that dependeth so fullie of the soueraigne calling, and commission of Gods owne sonne. This high wisedome was practized also, to the vtter confusion of the wicked and wilfull persons, at their calling to the office of preaching and baptizing. The which function lest any contemptuous person should in such base men disdaine, Christ alledgeth his owne power and preheminence, to which the dignitie of priesthoode is so neere, and so euerlastinglie ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that euerie dishonour and neglecting of the one, is great derogation to the other.

But to worke all in light and order, I will build vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, the intended conclusion, that the a duersaries maie see and behold the force of our faith, and the singular weaknes of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12222:219"/>
their assertions, I thus ioyne with them in arguments bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and plainlie without couert. That power and commission which was giuen to Christ by his heauenlie Father, concerning remission or retaining of sinnes, was giuen to the Apostles at his departure hence: But Christ him selfe did truclie, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie, and in proper forme of speach, by his Fathers sending and and commission remit sinnes:</hi> Ergo, <hi>The ministers of Christ maie, and doe truclie and perfectlie remit sinnes. Or thus more briefilie: As Christ was sent of his Father, so are the Apostles sent by Christ: But Christ was sent to forgiue sinnes:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Apostles be fent to forgiue sinnes also. The second part of the reasons, which is, that Christ had power of his Father to remit sinnes, and was sent for the same purpose, is sussicienlie prooued in the Chapter before. The first part of the argument standeth vpon the sure ground of Christs owne wordes, which be these. Like as my Father sent me, so I doe send you. Which wordes were so plaine and so deepelie noted for this intent, of Saint Chrysostome, that with admiration of the dignitie and excellent calling of Priesthood, he thus trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie discourseth vpon them. I will report his saying in Latin, as Germanus Brixius hath translated it: all that speaketh for</hi>

Nam quasi iam in coelum translati, ac supra humanam naturam positi, atque nostris ab affectibus exempti, sic illi ad principatum istum perducti sunt. And in English thus it is: What e's canst thou make of this, or what lesse, then that the power and iurisdiction of all heauenlie things is by God graunted vnto them? for it is said: whose sinnes soeuer you doe holde or reteine, they be retained. For Gods loue, what power can be giuen in the world so great? the Father bestowed all manner of power vpon his Sonne, &amp; I finde the verie selfe same power of all thinges to be deliuered to the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12222:219"/>
Apostles by God the Sonne. For now as though they were al readie translated out of this life to heauen, and there promoted aboue mans nature, and discharged of all our feeble affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are aduanced to the Princelie soueraigntie, whereof we now haue said. Thus farre Chrysostome. So doth this worthie father helpe our cause, and so doth he thinke of the excellent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority giuen by the father to his Sonne, &amp; deriued from him to the ministers of his holy will &amp; testament in earth.

                        <p>He that seeth not the difference of the ministerie of man from the power of God in those actions, wherein God worketh by man, gropeth in the darke, &amp; seeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as he ought to see. Therefore, let vs come to the light of your logick, and thereby consider, if we can, the distinction of the one from the other. If the <hi>maior</hi> or first proposition of your former syllogisme, be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of a power or commission graunted to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Christ, such as might haue beene graunted by God to anie other meere man, then your <hi>Minor</hi> is not true, that Christ by such a power and commission onelie, setting his Godhead aside, though truelie and effectuallie, yet not in proper forme ofspeach, by his fathers sending and commission remitted sinnes for then could he not be the author of remission of sinnes, but onelie a minister thereof: and therefore in proper forme ofspeach, he could not be said to forgiue sinnes,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12222:220" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is proper onely to god, but to preach the forgiue nes of sinnes, in Gods name, or to testifie that God did forgiue sinnes, as the ministers of the Church do. Butif the <hi>Maior</hi> be vnderstood, of such power &amp; commission as was giuen to Christ, as the Mediator, in respect of his manhood, but yet such, as he couldnot receiue &amp; exercise, but in respect of his godhead, &amp; such as could not be graunted to any, but vnto that person which is God &amp; man, such is the absolute &amp; principall power of remission of sinnes, then I denie that such power was giuen to the Apostles at his departure. For when Christ him-selfe did truelie, effectuallie, and in proper forme of speech remit sinnes, he did it as God, hauing equal, and principall authoritie with the father, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ghost so to do. The conclusion of your second syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, I graunt, that the Apostles were sent to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue sinnes, but retaining the former distinction, of the authoritie of God, and the ministerie of man. For as Christ was sent of his father to preach the remission of sinnes, so were the Apostles sent by Christ to preach remission of sinnes: therefore such power as he had, by preaching onely of remission of sinnes, to forgiue sinnes such power be graunted to his Apostles, whome he ordained preachers in his place: but the proper pow er of his deity he graunted not, nor any power which is proper to the person of the Mediator God and man. Theresore these wordes of Christ, <hi>As the father sent me, so send I you,</hi> must not be extended further then our sauiour Christ in that place meaneth. For els infinite absurdities might be concluded thereof, as that he sent his Apostles to redeeme the world, to die for the sinnes of the world, to be sauiours of the world, &amp;c. or that he sendeth all ministers of the Church, to whome this commission extendeth, to clense leapers to raise the dead, to giue sight to the blinde, and to do all other miracles, that he was sent to do. According to this distinction, that Rhetoricall amplification of

Chrisostome, is to be vnderstood: and doubtles won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull great is the authoritie, that man doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in the name of God, although that which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to God, be not attributed to men. The simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that Chrysostome vseth in the same chapter, <hi>Lib. 3. cap. 5.</hi> of a King graunting power to one of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, to imprison men, and to release them, sheweth that he knew the difference of the Lord, from the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, who if he abuse the authoritie committed vnto him, deserueth sharpe punishment, and therefore hath not absolute authoritie, to do all things as his Lord, and can not transgresse in doing. And in the next Chapter he sheweth, that Priestes do exercise this power of forgiuing sinnes, by teaching, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and by praier. <hi>Not onelie by teaching and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing, but also by the helpe of praiers:</hi> and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest difference sheweth Saint Ambrose, when he saith, Christ would haue his disciples to do in his name the same thinges which he did on earth, partlie in his fathers name, and partlie in his owne name.</p>

the sonne of man, which of it selfe is greeuous inough, as he doth controll the worke of the spirit of Christ, which is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost, in whome both he and his Church doth remit sinnes.

He sendeth them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <hi>Now for the holie Ghostes power and prerogatiue in the same action, which was breathed on the Apostles, we must further conferre with such as call in question matters so plaine. And first I am in goodhope, that no man will denie, but Christ gaue them the holie ghost for no other purpose so much, as to remit sinnes: Secondlie, I doubt not of their faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liese in this point, but they will confesse the holie ghost to be of power by nature and proprietie to forgiue sinnes: Thirdlie, I claime of their sinceritie thus much more, that Christ being as well God as man, was well able, for the furniture of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to giue them the holie ghost: all which being confessed of all men, and denied of no Christian aline, how the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so beset with all proofe on euerie side, standeth not, let the aduersaries tell me. In the Apostles there can be no lack touching that officie, for the execution whereof they receaued both Christes commission first, and the holie spirit of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde: In Christ there can be no default, who was well able to giue, and in deade did giue the holie ghost: In the holie ghost there can be no let nor lacke, whose power is infinie, and his verie proprietie to remit sinnes. All thinges then standing on so safe and sure groundes, the giuer, the gift, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer competent, and fullie answereable each to other on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie side, let the discontented ioyne in argument, let him alledge, why the Priests so authorized by Christ, and

so assured of the holie Ghost, maie not either pardon or forgiue penance.

                        <p>The commission that our sauiour Christ receiued in his manhood to preach remission of sinnes, was by him committed to his Apostles, but in such ample manner, as Christ had power to remit sinnes, it is not prooued, that Christ did communicate the same with his Apostles. <hi>The visible signe of breathing,</hi> by which our sauiour Christ testified, that he did giue them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost, declareth that they were enabled with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall giftes, to exercise their function, the chiefe and principall end whereof, was to pronounce in his name remission of sinnes to the beleeuers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and condemnation to the contemners. And this authoritie of the Apostles, concerning the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of our offences, I know no man that denieth. And therefore you spend vainlie the one halfe of your booke'in proouing that which no man doth denie, namely, that the Apostles and their lawful succesiours had, and haue power, by Christes graunt, to remitte or to retaine sinnes. The matters in question are these. 1. <hi>Whither Popish Priestes be the lawful successours of the Apostles. 2. What manner of power is this which is graunted.</hi> and thirdly, <hi>How it is to be exercised, by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gospell, or by Popish absolution and pardons.</hi> For we denie your shauelings, for the most part vnlearned, to be the Priests or elders of the Church of god, towhome this power is deriued from the Apostles: we denie an absolute power to be graunted, but a ministerie of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, and assurance of that which God onelie doth properlie and principallie. Thirdly we deny that by Popish shrift, absolution, and pardons, this power is to be exercised, but by preaching of the Gospell,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:12222:222"/>
whereunto are annexed the sacraments, as seales of the doctrine. These questions would haue beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlie handled, without such a tedious discourse, to prooue confuselie the power that is graunted by Christ to his Apostles, which is not denied: but the kinde of power about which you wander vncertainly, somtimes making it to be a meere ministery &amp; seruice vnder god, the onelie worker therein: sometime more then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurelie insinuating, that it is the verie same authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and none other but the same, which Christ did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise vpon earth, and now hath committed it ouer, or communicated it to Priestes, as though he were bound to stand to their sentence, in remitting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining sinnes, or that they might remit as well as he, and he must accept whatsoeuer they do in that case.</p>
                        <p>But seeing you wil not go directlie to worke, we must follow you in your crooked path, as well as we maie. And for the first part of your conference, where you <hi>are in good hope that no man wil deny, but Christ gaue them the holy ghost for no other purpose so much as to remit sinnes,</hi> I must say vnto you for my parte, that forasmuch as remission of sinnes is the principall scope of preaching the Gospel, they were indued with giftes of the holie ghost, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to call men to repentance &amp; forgiuenes of sinnes, and to assure the repentant and beleeuers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, by that authoritie and commission which they receaued of Christ. But if you meane, that Christ gaue them the holie ghost, for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose so much, as that they should heare mens shrift, and giue them absolution in such forme of wordes, as your Popish Priests do vse, without preaching the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to them, and setting forth the grace of god in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, I denie that they receaued the holy ghost for any such purpose. The other two partes I graunt: but I know not what is your conclusion. If you wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they haue power to remit sinnes, I graunt it, neither do I know anie man that denyeth it:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12222:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But if you meane to conclude thus; because the holy Ghost which was giuen to the Apostles, is of power by nature, &amp; proprietie to forgiue sins, therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did as properlie forgiue sins as god himselfe, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie your consequence. And it seemeth you meane such a matter, when you saie, <hi>In the holie Ghost, there can be no let nor lacke, whose power is infinite, and his verie propertie to remit sinnes:</hi> which is verie true: but yet it followeth not thereof, that whosoeuer is endued with the holie Ghost, hath infinite power, and maie properlie remit sinnes. For the holie Ghost is giuen in measure to all men, not that his substance is diuisible, that it maie be apportionated, but that his gifts are distributed by him selfe, in such measure, as the wisdome of God seeth to be moste conuenient. His essence is infinit and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, but he is said in Scripture to be present with them, or in them, on whome he bestoweth his graces and giftes. Therefore I see not what conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can be made of the holy ghostes infinit power, and verie propertie to remit sins, to conclude that the Apostles, which receiued the holie Ghost, rereiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, or the verie propertie to remitre sinnes.</p>
                        <p>Where <hi>you will the discontented to ioyne in argument, why the Priest so authorized by Christ, and so assured of the holy Ghost may not either pardon, or giue penance,</hi> Thus I ioyne with you: For remitting of sinnes I see authoritie: but for giuing of penance, none: therefore I graunt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and denie the latter. For if by <hi>penance</hi> true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be vnderstood god onelie can giue repentance, who onelie can turne the heart of man to feare him. If you meane popish penance, that is enioyning of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorie works or punishment, I denie that it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the scriptures, neither can it be contained in retaining of sinne. Where you saie, that <hi>neuer man aduouched that high action vpon his owne authoritie,</hi> it is vntrue: for Antichrist, that lifteth him-selfe to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with God and Christ, auoucheth vpon his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12222:223"/>
owne authoritie, although to cloke his manifest impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, &amp; that he might deceiue the simple, he pretendeth the name &amp; authoritie of God &amp; Christ. But that the Apostles and their true successours, by the warrant of Christ, &amp; his power receiued by the holy ghost, maie as ministers &amp; seruants remit or retaine sins, we do most willinglie consent and confesse. But then they practise this power as seruants, when they beinterpreters and declarers of the Lordes will and pleasure, and require not that God should followe their sentence, or attend how they be affected to forgiue or retaine, and so to subscribe vnto their doing: for that is an Antichristian vsurpation, farre from the meaning of that power. which Christ did graunt to his A postles.</p>

                           <hi>Some holie writers vpon this text of S. Iohn, in which the order of Christes authorizing his Apostles for the remission of sinnes is described, doe dispute of the difference of giuing the holie Ghost then to his Disciples, and afterward on Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sondaie: some note the eternall ceremonie that our Master v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, when he gaue them the holie spirit, which was by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on them, that such outward actions might both be an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to them of that excellent gift, which they inwardlie then receiued, and should further be an euerlasting instruction to the Church, that Gods grace and giftes be often ioyned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall elements for the solace of our nature, that delighteth to haue our outward man schooled, as wel as the inward man nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished. These and manie things moe be of profitable remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and consideration, but not so much to our purpose. Therefore let vs see, whether the iudgement of the holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe not wholie helpe our present cause, prouing the Priests ministerie, through the holie Ghostes authoritie, that our declaration standing on the plaine wordes of scripture with their vndoubted sense, maie obtaine inuincible force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the aduersaries, &amp; worthie credit of the true beleeuers.</hi>

their opinions are to our matter in controuersie. S.

I like better of Cyrillus iudgement. which thinketh they presentlie receiued the holie Ghost in some measure, but not so plentifullie, nor with such diuersitie of giftes, as on the daie of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost. That the grace of God is testified, assured, and sealed vp vnto vs, for the help of our infirmitie, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signes, and externall elementes ioined thereto, we know &amp; confesse: but as for the solace of our nature, or delight to haue our outward man schooled, I knowe not what they meane. It is great mercie of God to beare with our weakenes, but it agreeth not with the discipline of the Gospell, that we should delight in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thinges, but rather to exercise our faith, in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and heauenlie meditations.</p>

                           <hi>Et certè solius veri Dei est, &amp;c. And suerlie it pertaineth to the onelie true God, that he is able to loose men from their sinnes. For to what other person is it lawfull, to deliuer the transgressors of the law from sinne, but to the author of the law him-selfe? for so in mennes affaires we see it to be done. For no man without punishment doth reprooue the lawes of Kings, but the Kinges them-selues, in whome the crime of transgression hath no place. For it is wiselie said, that he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plous, which shall saie to a King, thou doest vniustlie. By what meanes then did our Sauiour graunt to his disciples the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and power of the diuine nature? because trulie it is not absurde, that sinnes may be remitted by them, which haue the holie ghost in them-selues. For when they remit or retaine, the spirit which dwelleth in them, remitteth or retaineth by them. And that shalbe by them, as I thinke, by two meanes: first by baptisme, and then by repeatence: for either they induce men that beleeve, and are approoued for holines of life, vnto baptisme, and diligentlie expill from them that are vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie; or where the children of the Church doe offend, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them indeede, and pardon them that repent. As Paul did once commit the fornicator among the Corinthians, vnto the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit might be saued, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him againe, lest he should be drowned with greater sorrowe. Therefore when the spirit of Christ, dwelling in men, performeth the worke of the true God, how shall he not be God by nature, which naturallie possesseth the power and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the diuine nature, when he hath so excellent authority vpon the lawe of God.</hi> This last argument of Saint Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, by which he prooueth against the <hi>Macidonian</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, that the holie Ghost is verie God, declareth that he neuer meant to deifie Priests, with the same autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that is proper to god, by which it should follow, that the holie Ghost were not God, if men had that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of remitting sin, that god hath: wherefore it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that men are onely instruments by which the holie ghost speaketh &amp; declareth his own will of remission of sins, &amp; not that the holie Ghost is subiect to the Censure
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12222:225" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of man, which were intollerable blasphemie. And therefore if the same father did anie where cal the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Church, protectours an<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d curers both of bodies and soules, it cannot be drawne to anie such meaning, as though they were in deede deified, and made, as you would saie, partakers of Gods nature, to worke Gods owne office in the world, but the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of God, appointed to serue for the eternall saluation of the Elect, both in bodie and soule. Their order is diuine, and they exercise the office of the holie ghost, as S. Ambrose saith, but yet so, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is communicated vnto man, that is proper to God. Who they were that did simplie and plainlie tearme the principall Pastours of the Church halfe gods, &amp; not meere men, you do not expresse: perhaps you meane the Author of that blasphemous verse, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the the Pope, and by him not refused, <hi>Nec Deus es, nec homo, quasi neuter es inter vtrumque.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12222:225"/>
sic enim scriptum est: Accipite spiritum sanctum: quorum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseritis peccata, remittuntur eis, &amp; quorum retinueritis, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenta sunt. Ergo qui soluere peccatum non potest, non habet Spiritum sanctum. Munus spiritus sancti est officium sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotis, ius autem spiritus sancti in soluendis ligandis que crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nib. est. He thatreceiueth the holy ghost (his meaning is in the taking of orders) receiueth therewith the power to binde and loose. For so is it written, Receiue you the holie Ghost: whose sinnes you doe forgiue, they are forgiuen them, whose sinnes you doe reseine, they are reteined. Therefore they which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forgiue mens offences, they haue not the holie ghost (that is to saie, they haue not the gift of the holie Ghost, which is giuen to the officers for their execution of their function in Christes behalfe) for the gift of the holie Ghost is the office of the priest: and proper right of remission of sinnes standeth in the holie Ghost. Thus wrote Saint Ambrose against the heretikes of his time, and both toucheth and ouer ouercommeth all the falsehoode of our daies, against the minesterie of man, which so ioyneth Gods spirit in all these diuine functions, that it cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blasphemie and special contempt of God, be contemned.</hi>

                        <p>Saint Bernarde is not to be despised for his youth, where he agreeth with the most auncient and eternall truth, reuealed in the holie scriptures.

Afterward when God, the sonne of God, Iesus forgiueth sinnes to the man sicke of the palsie, saying, sonne, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, whereupon he was thought to blaspheme of the Iewes, which knew not that he was God, saying: that this man blasphemeth, for it perteineth to none to forgiue sinnes, but to god alone.

For it were an easie matter for <hi>Eunomius, Macedonius,</hi> or anie other heretike, that was against his godhead, to replie, that by ministerie of God, the holie Ghost might as properlie forgiue sinnes, as Priestes do by the ministerie of Christ, and of the holie ghost: yea so farre forth, as thereby they are made halfe Gods, yea deified, and made Gods in deede. But you vtter repugnancie, when you saie, <hi>that, by Gods authoritie and proper power, Priestes do forgiue sinnes.</hi> Where you make it not proper to God, which is common to others with him. Therefore you should speake more properlie to saie, that God the holy ghost by his owne authoritie and power proper to the deitie, doth forgiue sinnes in their ministery, &amp; men thereto authorized, do no more, in proper speach and sense, but testifie and declare what God doth: for which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and testification, seeing they are the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours and messengers of God vnto the world, to declare his pleasure of reconciliation or condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are said to forgiue sinnes, or to retaine them which they do not properlie, but pronounce the sentence of God concerning the remission or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mens sinnes. And that this was the meaning of the Auncient fathers concerning the authoritie and power of Gods ministers, it is moste manifest by this argument, whereby they choke the enuier of the holie ghostes diuinitie: from which you cutte of all the sinnewes and force it hath to prooue it, when you communicate to men,

that which is proper to God, and aduance men aboue the nature of meere men, when you deifie their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, by meanes of the giftes of the holie Ghost giuen to them, and make them of abilitie to exercise the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per workes of God.

Now the third part of the place before alledged out of S. Iohns gospel, concerneth the words of Christes promis and warrant made vnto his Apostles: out of which wordes distinctly vttered we must see what force may be further added vnto our Catholike assertion, for the pristes autho rity to remit and retaine sinnes. And surely if none of the former wordes of commission, nor any other mean or mention had beene made of the holy ghostes assistaunce herein, these onlie woordes vpon the credit that faithful men owe to Christ, had bin suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to haue assured the world of the authoritie of priesthood, &amp; of the wholl cause that now is called in controuersie. For what can be said either of god or man more properlie or more playnlie then this:</hi> whose sinnes you shal forgiue, they be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: whose sinnes you shal retaine, they be retained? <hi>I must needes heree complaine of these vnfaithful and vnhappie times, that in the continuall lothsome bragges of the scripture, and Gods word, in perpetuall tossing and tumbling of the booke of the Bible, in endlesse contention and disputation of most high mysteries in them contained, haue wholie conuerted the cleerest and onely vndoubted meaning of such places specially, as moste touch the verie life and saluation of all mankinde, and which be of all other thinges in termes of scripture most open and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, sull foolishlie and vnlearnedlie haue both the simple sort handled Gods word, as in such grosse ignorance of al thinges they needes must, and their new procured Masters also, in not much more knowledge and farre passing pride can not otherwise do, but whilest they plaie them selues in things of smaler im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, they are to be laughed at, rather then lamented: but if the deuil driue them farther, as he lightlie doth, wherere he se quietlie possesseth, and cause them to dallie, and delude the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of scripture, that principally concerne the state and saluation of vs al then we must with al force resist, lest we leese the fruite

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12222:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you oppose figure to plainenes and colorablenes. As for your Metaphor of colour, I will not meddle with it: but if you meane thereby, as it is commonlie taken for dissimulation, I protest that Christ in no speach euer vsed anie. As for plainenes, he sought, when he vsed figures, or rhetorical colours. Therefore as I graunt, that in institution of Sacraments, Christs wordes were euer plaine, so Ivtterlie denie, that in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of sacraments Christes wordes were neuer fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue: and I holde him for a verie either ignorant, or impudent person, that dare affirme the contrarie. That the wordes of Christ could not worke with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular efficacie grace and vertue, and therewith giue to the ministers iust authoritie, for the execution of Christs meaning, being vttered in figuratiue speaches &amp; parables, without infinite error, is a brutish affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as afterward I wil shewe, by manie particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. In the meane time, that which commeth neare to this cause, what boie that learneth Moselanes figures will denie, that these speaches, <hi>of binding, of loosing, of the keies, of the kingdome of heauen, of Peter being a rocke, or stone, on which the Church is builded,</hi> are figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue speaches and parables, meaning not proper bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, loosing, keies, Rocke, or building, but parables, or thinges like vnto those? But against this you obiect, with interrogation, <hi>did God speake parables, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the solemnitie of so manie sacrifices, &amp;c?</hi> Yea veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, then did he moste of all speake parables. For then he signified, that reconciliation was onelie by Christs death, whereof all these sacrifices were parables, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes and figures, as the Apostle declareth, Heb. 9. verse 9. in plaine wordes. And yet it followeth not, that euerie word was figuratiue or parabolicall, which he vsed in the institution of euerie sacrifice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the seuerall sorte of the beast or creature, with the sexe and kinde, and other partes of the ceremonie thereto belonging, might be in proper tearmes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12222:232"/>
iustifying of that monstrous paradox, that no figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue speaches were vsed in the institution of sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or that in the institution of sacraments, Christs wordes were euer without figure. But you vrge vs farther, asking, <hi>whether he did speake parables, when the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lambe was to be instituted?</hi> I hope you plaie not the lad, to trifle about the distinction of parables and figures: but you meane that he vsed no figuratiue speaches, as your first proposition was. I answer you, he did, and that doe I plainelie prooue when he said, <hi>the Lambe</hi> so taken, prepared, and eaten with haste, <hi>is the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ex. 12. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>Lordes passeouer,</hi> where indeede it was a sacrament, and signe thereof, and not the Lordes passeouer, in proper speach. Moses also reporting the Lords institution, biddeth the people to <hi>slaie the passeouer,</hi> and the people are willed to teach their yonge children, ignorant of <note place="margin">Ex. 12. 21.</note> the end and vse thereof, that <hi>it is the Lordes passeouer,</hi> and so diuerse times both in the 12. and 13. Chapters <note place="margin">Ex. 12. 27.</note> it is repeated, that the lambe so slaine, is the passeouer of the Lord. Therefore it is plaine, that God did vse figuratiue speach in the institution of the Sacrament of the Lambe, euen when he did teach the people the vse and end thereof: not to obscure the mysterie, but by similitude of passing ouer their houses, where the posts were sprinckled with the blood, more plainelie to expresse and set forth the same.</p>
                        <p>You aske the third time, <hi>whether God did speake by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure to Abraham, when he commaunded him to circumcise the male of euerie one of his people, Gen. 17?</hi> I answere you, yea, he did speake by figure. For when he begane to speake of that matter ver. 10. He said, <hi>this is my couenant betweene me and you, and betweene thy seed after the, which ye shal keepe: that euerie male among you be circumcised.</hi> Which that you should not doubt to be a figure, in the next verse following he expoundeth it saying: <hi>that circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shalbe a signe of the couenant that is betweene me and you,</hi> And verse 13. he saith, <hi>so shall my couenant be in your
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12222:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
flesh, for a perpetuall couenant.</hi> And in the 14. verse, <hi>the soule of the vncircumcised male, shalbe rooted out from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, because</hi> (saith he) <hi>he hath transgressed or made void my couenant.</hi> The like demaund you make <hi>of the institution of the Sabbaoth,</hi> which I knowe not whether you num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber among the sacraments or no. In Gen. 2. where it is said, that <hi>God rested from all his worke, which he had made,</hi> there is a figure, because he ceased onelie from creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not from gouernment and preseruation of those thinges which he hath made. And in the 35. of Exod. whereunto you send vs, if you take the wordes of the law, without anie figure (<hi>whosoeuer shall do anie worke on the Sabboth day, shal die the death</hi>) you condemne a great manie, whome our sauionr Christ doth excuse, not onelie from punishment of death, but euen from breach of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, Luke 13. &amp; 14. Mat. 12.</p>
                        <p>To your last question I answere, that he neuer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in the olde lawe, or the new: but if you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, <hi>by speaking on thing and meaning an other,</hi> figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue speaches, I saie he often vsed them, when anie externall worke was to be practized for euer by charge of his worde among the people, as is moste euident in the sacramentes of circumcision and the passeouer: therefore your distinction is falsc, &amp; friuolous; for God hath vsed figuratiue speaches often times, in the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the sacraments, not to deceiue the people, that they should take one thing for an other, but the better to expresse the vertue and effect of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacitie of the people. As in calling <hi>the Lambe the pascal,</hi> they were more liuely put in minde, both of the temporall benifit, and passing ouer, and also of their spirituall deliuerance. When <hi>circumcision</hi> is called <hi>the couenant,</hi> whereof it was a signe, the people were admonished, what was the spirituall meaning thereof, namelie, that they should cut of the olde man with all concupiscences of the flesh, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of all them, that shall accept him for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12222:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wherunto we seeme to attribute al credit: as though we denie any one word of expresse scripture, &amp; do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, whatsoeuer the scripture doth affirme in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse words, or denie, whatsoeuer the holy scripture in expresse words doth deny, according to such sense and meaning, as the scripture must haue, as it is agreable to it selfe in all places. The expresse wordes of scripture touching the Lords supper are these: <hi>that it is the body &amp; blood of Christ:</hi> we confesse and beleeue as much. The expresse wordes of scripture concerning the Apostles authoritie, in pardoning or reteining sinnes, are, as they haue beene often alledged. we beleeue they, and their successours (of whome there is no expresse word) haue power to remit or reteine sins. The expresse words of scripture concerning the Lords supper are also, <hi>The rocke was Christ:</hi> we beleeue that the rocke was Christ. <hi>The cup is the new testament:</hi> we beleeue that the cup is the new testament. Also by expresse words, to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles there is graunted power <hi>to binde and to loose.</hi> We confesse and beleeue that they haue power to binde and to loose. And yet I trust we may be bolde to saie, without breaking the sacred bondes of expresse scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: The rocke was not Christ, in nature of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie and diuinitie, but a sacrament of Christ. The cup is not the new couenant it selfe, but that which is in the cup is an holie signe or seale thereof. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had no power giuen them, to binde men with chaines or coardes, nor to loose the chaines &amp; coards of them, that be bound by other: but a spirituall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to binde and loose spirituallie. In like manner we doe not breake the sacred bandes of expresse scripture, when we affirme that the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bread and wine are not by transsbustantiation turned into the naturall bodie and bloode of Christ, or the bodie and blood of Christ in the sacrament are not corporallie receiued, but spirituallie. For the contrarie of these we finde not expresselie in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12222:235"/>
scripture. So when we saie, the Apostles had not power to remit sinnes properlie, which is peculiar onelie to God, but to aslure men in Christes name, whose em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours they were, of the forgiuenes of their sinnes by Christ, we breake no bandes of expresse scriptures. For we confesle the wordes according to their true meaning, agreeable with other places of scripture, that teach it to be peculiar to God, to remit sinnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie. An embassadour is said to make peace or warre, when he declareth, according to his commission, his Princes determination of peace or warre. The Kinges Liuetenant hauing such commission, offereth or graun teth pardon to rebells or other offenders, where he doth onelie declare the kinges pleasure, in pardoning or releasing their offences. As for the Popish bragge of all our fathers, with the practize of all nations, and the verie expresse iudgement of the Church of God, to be for your assertion, how vaine it is, will easilie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, when you come to cite fathers, shew forth the practize of all nations, declare the iudgement of Gods Church, and when the contradictorie shall be manifestlie prooued and brough forth against you.</p>

That the sacraments are commended in knowne terms of greatest and most efficacie that could be, we cofesse: but therof it followeth not, that they were not in some part commended by figuratiue speeches, which are often and almost alwaies, if they be rightlie vsed, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne, and of greater efficacie, then proper tearmes. That you saie, <hi>the sacraments were not commended by way of Preaching,</hi> it is a grosse and impudent absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when they were instituted and commended to be seales of the doctrine, that was preached, for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of faith, which is builded vpon the hearing of Gods word preached.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12222:236"/>
did he <hi>affect obscurity by parables before his resurrection.</hi> For his parables were vttered for better and more plaine vnderstanding of his obedient disciples, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to the reprobate contemners of his doctrine, they seemed hard and inexplicate, and were, as all things are vnto them, and as Christ him-selfe was, a stumbling block, and stone of offence, that they might fall and perish. That our sauiour Christ did open the senses of his Apostles, that they might vnderstand the scriptures, they were the better able to vnderstand fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue speeches, of which the scripture is full. But <hi>that he did more carefully expresse his meaning, for the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his holie disciples,</hi> I do denie, for he had alwaies before as great care to expresse his meaning: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out care was alwaies hable to vtter his diuine pleasure, considering that he had appointed the doctrine, which he preached before his resurrection, to be committed to writing, for the publike and perpetuall instruction of his wholl Church.

Yet I do not remember that anie of the olde writers do put anie great difference betwixt the authorities of Peter and the rest of the Apostles, concerning the remitting of sinnes, which is a thing perteining indifferentlie to the wholl order of priesthood, and therfore no more proper to the Pope or Peter, then to Priestes and Apostles: though Origen noted well, that the iurisdiction of Peter seemed by these words to be enlarged aboue the residue, by that our sauiour said to him, that, whatsoeuer he bound or loosed in earth, it should be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or bound in the heauens: where to the rest he spoke of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen onelie in the singular number. I speake onelie of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clause of binding and loosing with the keies thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. For there is no doubt, but great preheminence of rule and iurisdiction is promised before in the sametext now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and els where actuallie giuen vnto him, more then to the rest of his breethren. Neuerthelesse euen this power of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and loosing, common to all the holie order, was in him first seuerally planted, for the commendation of vnitie and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as Saint Cyprian sath, and so the same authoritie giuen</hi>

To the sonnes of Zebede onelie it was said, that they were Bonarges, that is, the Children of thunder, ergo they had greater authoritie then the rest of the Apostles.

should haue beene opened, taken awaie, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen shut vp from them that gladlie would enter, if they knew which way? The keies in deede do signifie power and authoritie: but that onelie Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath those keies, and not the Church and euerie true Pastour of the same, or that Peter by them had greater power and authoritie, then the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, which had them also, you shall neuer be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make demonstration. Your remembrance ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you well, that all the olde writers do make no difference, betweene the authoritie of Peter and the rest of the Apostles, concerning the remitting of sins. But you do forget, that the power of bynding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, was by our sauiour Christ graunted equallie to all the Apostles, and to their successours, though it were once singularlie vttered to one. The subtiltie of Origen, to make <hi>a difference betweene binding and loosing in all the heauens, and in one heauen onelie,</hi> beside that it is vaine in it selfe, yet is it not brought of Origen to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Peter aboue all the Apostles, whome both vpon the place of Mat. 16. and this also, he confesseth to haue receiued equall power with Peter: but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Peter and such as Peter was, before them that haue thrise reprehended offenders, and beeing not heard haue bound the sinner vpon earth, iudgeing him as an heathen or publicane: whereof he inferreth. <hi>Quanto melior fuerit, qui ligat. &amp;c, how much better he is that bindeth, by somuch he that is bound is bound more then in one heauen, and how much better he is that looseth, by so much he shall be more happie that is loosed: for he is loosed in all the heauens.

more properlie signifie the authoritie and iurisdiction giuen to the spiritual Magistrates, for punishing by temporal pain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, and releasing by mercie, as they see occasion, the same appointed penance againe, or els it properlie concerneth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie release of sinne it selfe, or retaining the sinne, which they vpon iust causes will not forgiue. These thinges would grow to ouer tedious a tale, and ouercurious for the simple, whome I would moste helpe in these matters: and I shall briefllie touch so much hereof, as is necessarie, hereafter when I shall dispute of pardons. For in deede these two textes of binding and loosing, as well spoken to Peter, as to the residue afterward, shall be the ground of our wholl discourse there, and therefore till then, we must touch these textes no further, but as in common pertaineth to remitting or retaining sinnes. For they are brought indifferentlie of the holie fathers with the foresaid wordes of Saint Iohn, in which, as I haue declared, the verie institution of penance and Priestes iudgement of our soules and sinnes, be moste properlie grounded. Theresore that by all these wordes, so often vttered by our sauiour, you maie well perceiue the verie literall and vudoubted meaning to be, that Priestes haue authoritie by Christes warrant to remit and retaine sinnes, I will recite one or two places of most auncient fathers, that they ioyning with such plaine wordes of sundrie places of scripture, maie make all most sure, to such as can by anie reason be satisfied. First Ialledge the saying of</hi> S. Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, <note place="margin">Homil. In natali Petri &amp; Pau.</note> 
                           <hi>an olde author, &amp; a blessed saint. He doth by conference couple together these textes whereon we now stand: thus hespea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth verie pithely, therefore you shal heare his owne words: Ne qua vos, fiatres, de creditis Petro clauibus regni, more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strarum clauium cogitatio terrena promoueat, Clauis caeli lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua est Petri, quam singulorum meritae censendo Aposiolus v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicuique regnum coelorum aut claudit, aut aperit: Non est ergo clauis ista mortalis artificis aptata manu, sed data à Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto potestas est iudicandi. Denique ait eis: quorum remiseritis peccata, remissa erunt, &amp; quorum detinueritis, detenta erunt. Thus he saith in our tongue: Least anie earthlie cogitation mooue you to think of anie such materiall keies as we occupy in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12222:241"/>
earth, when you heare of committing the keies of the kingdome to Peter, you must thus vnderstand, that the key of heauen is Peters word or tongue, because the Apostle weighing well eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our deserts, openeth or shutteth to euery man the kingdome of Christ. This key therfore is not made by mortal mans hand, but it is the power of iudgement giuen by Christ. To be briefe, he saith to them al:</hi> whose sins you shal forgiue, they shal be forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.<hi>Thus saith</hi> Maximus, <hi>ioyning together fitly two textes for one purpose, &amp; out of both maketh a moste forcible argument, that the iudgement of our soules, which is a passing authoritie, and the verie letting in, and keeping out of heauen, is addicted by the keies to Peters, and the Apostles ministerie. For which cause also S. Gregorie calleth all Christes Apostles, and the iust occupiers of their roomes, the dores by which we must enter into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or euerlastingly byde out: which is a feareful saying to al such as contemne their authority. His</hi>

                           <hi>wordes be these: Quid cuncti Apostoli, nisi sanctae Ecclesiae ostia, existunt? cùm eis dicitur, Accipite spiritum sanctum, quorum remiseritis peccata, &amp;c. ac si illis apertè diceretur: per vos ingrediuntur ad me hi quibus vos ipsi panditis, &amp; repellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quibus obseratis. What are all the Apostles else, but the dores of holie Church? Seeing it is said of them, take you the holie Ghost. whose sinnes you doe forgiue, they be forgiuen: euen as though in plainer termes it had beene spoken thus: by you all must enter that will come vnto me, those, I saie, to whom you open the dore by loosing of thir sins, and those that be put backe, that you locke out.

Thus farre S.

For we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it is the vndoubted meaning of Christ, that his ministers should haue authoritie, effectuallie to remit or retaine sinnes. But the verie literall meaning (so you call the grammaticall sense) is otherwise then you take it. For in those two textes, <hi>binding and loosing</hi> are plaine Metaphors, as all men wil confesse, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12222:242"/>
can put a difference betweene proper and figuratiue speaches. And in the third, of remitting or retaining, either we must acknowledge a Metonymie, or els the Proper office &amp; authoritie of God is made common to men. The places of the auncient fathers that you cite, make nothing at al to cleare the controuersie on your side, namelie whether Priestes forgiue sins as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as God him selfe. First the saying of <hi>Maximus,</hi> or whosoeuer was author of that Homelie, <hi>interpreting the keie, of the kingdome of heauen, to be Peters word or tongue,</hi> doth signifie, that by preaching he exreciseth that power of iudgement, by which he openeth or shutteth the kingdome of heaué, according as euery one recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, or refuseth his Doctrine. Againe, comparing this power of iudgeing, with the text of S. Iohn, he declareth <hi>that Peters keie is common to him, with all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and their successours.</hi> S. Gregorie also comparing them to dores, meaneth not to take anie thing from our sauiour Christ, the onelie dore. Also in the same place he sheweth in plaine words, that they are dores, to let in and keepe out by preaching. <hi>Et quia Doctores sancti praedicatione quidem sequentibus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And because holy teachers by preaching truelie, are open to them that followe them, and by their authoritie shut to them that resist, they are not vnworthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie called dores: that is, open to the conuersation of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and shut to the terrours of the proude.

What admiration I praie you is this of this word, that he professeth that he came out from God? so great thinges and so proper to God, O ye holie and blessed men, which had obteined the keies of the kingdome of heauen, for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of your faith, and haue obtained right of binding and loosing in heauen and earth, had you seene done by our Lord Iesus Christ the sonne of God: And doe you now first protest,

                        <p>But <hi>I will adde S.

That I be not ouer tediuose, I will report his saying in English onelie: Those (saith he) that dwelleth in earth and are conuersant amongst men, haue receiued power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>

Earthlie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in deed haue power to binde, but that pertaineth to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their subiectes onelie: but that which I now talke of, that is proper to the Priests, touching the verie soule it selfe, and is so ample, that it reacheth to the heauens aboue: yea &amp; that so largelie, that whatsoeuer the Priestes doe beneath, the verie selfe same God wil allow and ratifie in heauen aboue, and so the Lord will confirme the iudgement and sentence of the seruants. Thus farre speaketh Chrysostome. His words be so plaine that to stand long on them, for farther proofe of my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then the verrie face of the sentence doth importe, it were
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:12222:243"/>

For man maie here rather maruell to see such strange power vpon Christes wordes giuen to the holie order, and yet that to be so litle esteemed of wicked men and so litle regarded euen of the honester sort of simple folkes, that few either seeke after their iudgement in cause of their soules, or duelie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that power in them which passeth all other prelacie, that euer either man or Angell receiued in this great contempt (I saie) of most holie things, wickednes is rather to be wondered at, and lamented, then by long reasoning to be confuted.

For I haue my selfe met with many such, as could be content, as they saide, to acknowledge vpon so plaine scripture the singular priuiledge giuen to the Apostles, and thereupon if they might haue had an Apostle, they would not haue sticked to haue made there confession and sute to him for the remission of their sinnes: but because I had not the like wordes of Christ spoken to all priests particularlie, they thought it was no reason that any such challenge should be made for them: nor any such charge to be giuen to others to confesse their sinnes vnto them.

Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these most strong groundes euerie man plainlie may argue, the like power yet to be in the Church of God in euerie case, euen as Christ did institute at the beginning, when he gaue the charge to the Apostles first. For looke what forme of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and order of the Church was thought vnto his wisedome to be best then, the same must needes be best now (I speake for the substance of thinges: for by diuersities of time and person some alteration may rise in the circumstances) Therefore if it were good at that time that one should be the generall Vicar of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12222:246"/>
Christ, and pastour of all the sheepe, for which he shed his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed blood, it is good yet also: if some had authoritie then to consecrate Christs body, some haue the same power till this time: if some then must needes baptize &amp; preach, other some must now also do the same: finally if certaine then had commission by Christ, &amp; the holie ghost giuen them to remit sins, &amp; therewith power by his word both to pardon &amp; punish, to bind &amp; to loose, it must by force of the foresaide argument necessarilie be induced, that some at this date must haue the like office. For els Christ could not continue the same power &amp; office in the Church which he for the Churches sake did first institute: &amp; which he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his heauenlie wisedome moste necessarie for the Chucrhes gouernement. But I think no man hath yet so shaken of shame and feare of God, that he dare holde that Christ was not hable to mainteine all power, rule, and iurisaiction, with all kinde of functions which he instituted for the benefite of the people till the worldes ende, both him-selfe and the holie ghost promised to be present for that purpose till the generall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that those functions were necessarie for his euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting common wealth, his solemne institution and carefull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of them doe declare: that he meaneth no lesse to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the same which he then instituted, not onelie the foresaid reasons, but that saying of Saint Paull doth prooue:</hi> He gaue vnto the Church some to be Apostles, some to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, some to be Euangelists, some to be Pastours and <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> Doctours: and all this to the worke and maintenaunce of the ministerie for the persiting of the Saints, and vpholding of Christes bodie, till the time of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeing of Gods sonne. <hi>Thus doth Christ prouide for his deare Church in all manner of seruice and office euen til the last daie. Wherebie it is most cleare, that the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes beeing once giuen to the Church can neuer cease, whiles man of his continuall frailtie ceaseth not to sinne.

Likewise to preach and baptize, to excommunicate, and to receiue againe.

                        <p>Your conclusion is true, that the power extended to al the Apostles successors; but it is not strongly prooued, by the example of Thomas, Matthew, Paull, and Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, who were Apostles them-selues, in the highest degree: and therefore I like better the solution of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus, which vnderstandeth the intention of Christ, to haue beene of the wholl order of the Apostles, and their successours, although more then Thomas had beene absent, at such time as he gaue that power, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the examples of <hi>Eldad,</hi> and <hi>Meldad,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the number, that were chosen to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, to assist <hi>Moses,</hi> although they were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with the rest before the tabernacle, yet they were indued with the spirit of prophesie, because they were of the number appointed.

Christ deliuered the keies to the Church (saith S. Augustine) that whatsoeuer she loosed in earth should be loosed in heauen, and what soeuer she bound in earth should be, &amp;c. that is to saie, that whosoeuer would not beleeue, that sinnes should be forgiuen him in his Church, they should not beforgiuen vnto him: but whosoeuer did beleeue, and being corrected, did turne him-selfe awaie from them, being placed in the bosome of the same Church, should be healed by the same faith and correction. For whosoeuer doth not beleeue that his sinnes maie be forgiuen vnto him, is made worsse by dispairing,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12222:249" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as though nothing remained better for him then to beleue, when he is vnfaithful &amp; vnbeleeuing of the fruite of his conuersion.</hi> These wordes of <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> do shew, that sinnes are forgiuen to the penitent, and faithfull, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the doctrine of repentance and forgiuenes of sinnes, which is preached in the Church. The place of <hi>Optatus vrging the vnitie of Peters chaire against the schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes that were deuided from the communion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church,</hi> ascribeth no greater authoritie to Peters chaire in exercising the keyes, or anie other power of the Priesthood, then to all other chaires. <hi>That E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius allowethrepentance after baptisine against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharistes,</hi> it prooueth no more an other sacrament of penance, then that we do, euen as he, graunt that there is place of repentance before god, &amp; reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto the Church, for such as do daily fall after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. But contrary wise it appeareth, that Epiphanius alloweth but one sacrament of repentance, which is baptisme. <hi>Andyet</hi> (saith he) <hi>we take not awaie the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God knowing the preaching of the trueth, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Lord, &amp;c, the pardonable nature, the vnstedfastnes of the soule, the weaknes of the flesh, the deepenes of the sense of manie men, because no man is void of sinne, and pure from filthines, though his life be but one daie vpon the earth. And perfect repentance in deede is in the lauer of baptisme but if a man fall, the holie Church of god doth not loose him, for it gran teth him a returne, and after that repentance an other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> The Greeke word is <gap reason="foreign">

Prooue that he speaketh not of any sacrament of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Pentance, but sheweth that God receaueth them that fall after baptisme, vnto repentance, according to the preaching of trueth, and of the mercie of God. I muse what you meane, when you saie, <hi>that Epiphanius termeth baptisme perfect repentance, with Saint Paul to the Hebr. cap. 6.</hi> For the Apostle to the Hebrewes hath no such terme, either in that chapter, or in anie other place of that epistle: except you dreamed of such a matter, because he professeth to <hi>leaue the first principles of religion, as repentance from dead workes, &amp;c.</hi> which pertaineth to the doctrine of baptisme, and Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, and to grow to perfection. In the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, as Lactantius saith, there is confession, because there is faith: there is also repentance, which wholsomlie healeth the sinnes and wound to which the weakenes of the fleshis subiect: by which it is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that there is remission of sinnes in the Church, continuing vntill the comming of Christ to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Whereof let him reade the 26. Homely of Saint Gregorie, pertaining almost whollie to that purpose. I will repeat a few wordes onelie out of it, committing the rest to the diligence of the reader. Libet intueri (saith he) illi discipuli ad tanta onera humilitatis vocati, ad quantum cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men gloriae sint oeruecti. Ecce non solùm de semetipsis securi fiunt, sed etiam alienae obligationis, &amp; relaxationis potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem accipiunt: principatumque superniiudicij sortiuntur, vt vice Dei quibusdam peccata retineant, quibusdam relaxent.

Horum profectò nunc in Ecclesia Dei, Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi locum tenent, ligandi atque soluendi authoritatem sumunt:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:12222:250"/>
grandis honor, sed graue pondus est istud honoris. It is my meaning now, to beholde to what marueilous honour the Disciples of Christ be exalted, which before were called in their base state to great burden and troubles. For now, they be not onelie in assurance of their owne state, but they haue obtained power of binding and releasing other, and the verie soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of heauenly iudgement, that in Gods owne steade, they may some mans sinnes release, and other offencesreteine, Loe, those that once feared the straight sentence of Gods owne iudgement are made the iudges of other mens soules, to condemne or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer where they list, that before doubted of them-selues. And now truelie in these mens roomes are the Bishops of Gods Church, and receiue the authoritie of binding and loosing, and their owne state ofregiment. High surclie is their Chaire, but greater is their charge. S. Gregorie said so farre.</hi>

                           <hi>But Saint Augustine shall make vp this matter, with words of such waight, that I trust euerie man shall see the trueth, and almost feele the grossenesse of falsehood thereby. He wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus vpon this verse of the Psalme</hi> Eructauit, <hi>which is the 44. in number with him: Pro patribus tuis nati sunt tibi filij, constitueseos Principes super omnem terram: In place of thy parentes thou hast Children borne thee, them thou maist make the Princes of the wholl earth. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did beget thee, they were sent them-selues, they preached in their owne persons, and finallie they were thy fathers.</hi>

                           <hi>But could they alwaies corporallie abide here? And though one of them said, I would gladlie be dissolued and be withChrist,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>yet for your sake I counted it more necessarie to tarie in flesh. Thus he said: but how long could his life last? he might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine til this daie, much lesse for the time to come. What then? is the Church desoiate after the departure of her parents? God forbid.</hi> In steade of thy parentes thou hast sonnes, <hi>saith the text: what is that to saie? Marie the Apostles sent by Christ are as fathers, and for them God hath raised vp chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or sonnes, which be the holie Bishops of the world. For at this daie the Bishops that be throughout all Christendome, how rose they to that roome? The Church calleth them fathers,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12222:251" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and yet shee did beget them, and she placed them in that roome of their fathers: Non ergo reputes desertam, quia non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Petrum, quòd non vides Paulum, quòd non vides illos per quos nataes: de prole tua tibi creuit paternitas: pra pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus tuis natisunt tibi filij, constitues eos principes super om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem terram. Do not therefore think thy selfe desolate, because thou hast not Paull, because thou hast them not now present, by whome thou wast borne: of thy owne issue, fatherhood is growne to thee: and for thy fathers thou hast brought forth sonnes, them shalt thou make the rulers ouer al the earth. Thus much out of Saint Augustine. By whome you maie perceaue the great prouidence of God that euerlastinglie vpholdeth the ordinance of his sonne Christ Iesus, as well now by the children borne from time to time in the Churches lap, as before in the spring of our faith by the Apostles sent and appointed in person by Christ him-selfe.</hi>

                        <p>I suppose the title of your booke, will admonish you not to restraine this office onelie to Bishops, which so often you haue made common to all priestes. For Gregory also in the same homyly nameth often times all pastours of the Church, to whome the power of binding and loosing doth appertaine, which are many other beside Bishops. Moreouer, inueighing against the ignorance, and vnworthines of them that occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such places, which take vpon them to loose, where God doth binde, and binde where God doth loose, he concludeth, <hi>that then the absolution of the gouernours of the Chuch is true, when it followeth the will of the eternall Iudge.</hi> By which saying, and more to the like effect in that place, he declareth his iudgement, of the kinde of power or authoritie which the Church hath, that it is not absolute, but subiect vuto the will of God, and is an expressing of Gods forgiuenes, or retaining, not a proper forgiuing or retaining. The saying of <hi>Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> prooueth in deede, a continuance of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Apostles in the office of Bishops, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

it followeth not, that onelie Bishops, as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from priestes, haue this power: for not onelie Bishops be the children of the Church, but all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men to whome the inheritance of the world is like wise appointed.</p>

Alpower and euery iurisdiction or right of Christs Church, remaineth as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, and in as full force and strength at this daie, and shall till the worlds end so continue, as they were, by Christ graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted first in the persons of the Apostles or other, instituted. But the power of remission of sinnes, was giuen properlie and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse termes to the Apostles:</hi> Ergo <hi>the same remaineth still in Gods Church. Whereupon it is so cleare, that the Priestes at this day haue as ful power to forgiue sins, as the Apostles had. And this argument of the continuance of all offices and righte of the Church, is the moste plainest and readiest waie, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to helpe our cause now taken in hand, but vtterlie to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue all false doctrines and detestable practises of heretikes. For they must here be examined diligentlie what common wealth that is, what Church that is, in which Christ doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrue the gouernment giuen to the Apostles? where it is that the power not onely os making, but also of practizing al sacraments hath continued still? what companie of Christian people that is, wherein the Apostles, Doctors, preachers, ministers, through the perpetuall assistance of Gods spirit, be continued, for the building vp of Christes bodie, which is the number of faithful people? What Church that is, which bringeth forth from time
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12222:252"/>
to time sonnes to occupy the romes of their fathers before them. It is not (good reader) the pelting packe of</hi> Protestants? <hi>It is not, I saie, and they knowe it is not their petie congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that hath till this daie continued the succession of Bl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes, by whome the world, as Saint Augustine saith, is ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as by the Apostles, and first Fathers of Religion. Surely our mother the Church hath hene long baren, if for her Fathers the Apostles, who died so long since, she neuer brought forth children til now to occupie their roomes, and great lacke ofru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, if she haue made her onelie contemners to be her owne go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours. No, these sellowes holde not by her, but they holde against her: these sit in no seat Apostolike, but they by all force dishonour the seat Apostolike: these are not they,</hi> qui pro patribus nati sunt tibi filij: <hi>but these are the sonnes,</hi> quos enutriuisti &amp; genuisti, ipsi spreueruntte. <hi>If you aske of these men how they holde? they seeke no Fathers after whome they maie rightly rule: they seeke no large rew of predecessours in whose places they may sit: they aske no counsell of Gods Church, by whose calling they should gouerne: but they make a long discourse of statutes and temporall lawes, to couer their ambitious vsurpation, that in great lacke of Christes calling, their vniust honour may be approoued by mans fauour. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by let them holde their temporall dignities, their landes, their liuelihoodes, their wiues also, if ther can obtaine so much at the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealthes handes: but their spiritual functions, their ministering of Sacraments, their gouernance of our soules, and what els soeuer they vsurpe without the warrant of Gods Church, the longer they exercise them, the farther they be from saluation, and the neerer to eternall woe and miserie. But to come to our purpose: it is our Church Catholike, in which all holie functions haue bene practized after Christes institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion euer since his ascension vp to heauen. And therefore this principall power of remitting and retaining sinnes, must needes be contained in the Church by her ministers and priests as it was begonne in the Apostles before.</hi>

you set as a matke for vs to shoote at, while we liue. ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie your argument, if one word were awaie, I would willinglie graunt: but the word <hi>properlie,</hi> you are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer able to prooue while you liue, nor all the papists in the world after you are dead: therefore in respect of that word, I denie your <hi>Minor.</hi> And yet I graunt, that you inferre vpon it your conclusion in such termes as you haue set it downe: <hi>that lawfull Priestes, Elders, or ministers of Gods Church, at this daie, haue as fullpower to forgiue sinnes in their seuerall charges, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had in their gener all commission.</hi> But here you will needes examine vs, <hi>what Church that is, in which Christ doth preserue the gouernment giuen to the Apostles?</hi> The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church forsooth. 2. <hi>Where the power of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the sacraments</hi> (if you meane that, by your termes of making and practizing) <hi>hath continued still?</hi> in the Catholike Church. 3. <hi>What companie of Christ an people that is, wherein the Apostles, Doctours, preachers ministers through the perpetuall assistance of Gods spirit, be continued, for the building vp of Christes bodie, which is the number of the faithfull?</hi> Still I answere, the companie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church. 4. <hi>What Church that is, which bringeth forth from time to time, sonnes to occupie the romes of their Fathers before them.</hi> Here I answere, manie hereticall and malignant Churches: but onelie the Catholike Church hath continued from the beginning in such propagation.

Therefore it is not, <hi>no, no,</hi> that wil be able to pul vs out of the Apostolike chaires, in which we teach nothing but the Doctrine of the Apostles, consonant vnto the Doctrine of the Prophets. These Fathers we seek to holde of, and all other that holde of the same line, we hold with them: as for large view of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours, we know it must necessarilie insue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Prophets, and Apostles, because of the perpetuall continuance of the Church. And therefore we take not vp olde, mouldie, and mothen parche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to seeke our progenitours names, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinitie of Doctrine with the Apostles, as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> calleth it, knowe we are Apostolike, and set in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike places.

                        <hi>ANd to</hi> Caluin <hi>or other of his secte, that require the like vertue and force of the holie Ghostes assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in all men that take vpon them to remit sinnes, as it was giuen to the Apostles, who first receiued that power, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: that the same gift of the holie Ghost is yet in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the same Sacrament, no lesse then in the Apostles. For though they had more plentifull sanctification whereby they were in all their life more holie, and more vertuous, then lightlie anie other, either Priestes or laie men, were after them, yet the giftes of the holie Ghost, touching the ministerie and seruice of Gods Church, which were not so much giuen them for their owne sakes, as for the vse of the common wealth, and for the right of practizing certaine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly functions requisite for the peoples sanctification, as they were also giuen to diuers that were neither good nor vertuous, and therefore lacked that, which properlie is that grace of the holie Ghost that is called of our schoole men, gratia gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum faciens, such a grace as maketh a man accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to</hi> God. <hi>Therefore, the holie Ghost breathed vpon the Apostles then by Christ, and giuen yet to Priests in their ordering by Bishopes; is a gift of God, and a grace of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghost, not whereby man is made rertuous, or cunning, or happie before God, but it is a gift onelie of God, whereby man is called aboue his owne nature and dignitie, to haue power and authoritie, to doe and exercise anie function in Gods Church to the spirituall benefit of the people, which is not onelie not alwaies ioyned to vertue and holie knowledge, but it full often, by calling, due to them which are moste wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

without anie impaire of their authoritie. And these kinde of giftes and graces of the holie Ghost, be called gratiae gratis datae, certaine giftes giuen to men for no desertes of their persons, but freelie, for the vse of other men, to whome they be beneficiall, euen there, where they be hurtfull to the bestowers.

And in this sense, the spirite of God breathed vpon the Apostles, was a gift of the holie Ghost, whereby man should remit by lawfull power the sinnes of the people.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Whosoeuer shall vndoubtedlie remit sinnes, and absolue sinners, must haue the same gift of the holie Ghost, which the Apostles had, whereby he cannot erre. And this gift no man denieth, but it maie be in a wicked and vngodlie man. For euen such an one may preach the doctrine of Christ, of remission of sinnes, publikelie, and priuatlie, if he haue the calling, that is required to that office. Neither doth <hi>Caluine,</hi> or any other that are of his iudgement, otherwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

the like force of the holie ghostes assistance, in al men that take vpon them to remit sinnes. For there is not onelie a power, but a knowledge required in him that shall assuredlie and vndoubtedlie forgiue sinnes. And therefore the papistes doe vnreasonably make a diuorse, of the keie of power, from the keie of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: which power, if it be no guided by knowledge, doth nothing, but insteade of opening and shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the keies committed to the Church, throw forth the keies, as the blinde man casteth his staffe, which cannot happen so right in to the locke that they should open it, to the penitent sinners. For it is not the Priestes authoritie that can open the dore of comforte to a sinners conscience, except he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto him, out of the word of God, how and by what meanes, he maie be reconciled vnto God. <hi>That the holie Ghost is giuen by Bishopes to Priestes in their orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> it is more boldlie affirmed, then euer it can be prooued: for Christ onelie hath authoritie to giue the holy Ghost, and therefore to declare, that it commeth from him alone among men, he breathed vpon his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: which though the Bishops doe, vntill their longues ake, yet can they not furnish their parties by them ordered, with giftes meet for their calling, as Christ did his Apostles. They must make choise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to the Doctrine of the Apostle, of those that haue those gratious and necessarie giftes of God before, and to them they must commit the power and authoritie to exercise the same, to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like benefice of the Church. But if they wil giue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to them, that haue no wisdome to exercise the same, they make the most foolish iudges of all the world, and such are worthelie contemned. Therefore howsoeuer you distinguish grace, you must not seeke to winne credit to them, which haue nothing but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense of authoritie, when they be voide of all vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, how to vse it, as manie hundreds, yea thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes

cursed be they by Gods owne mouth, if they doe it either neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, because it is the worke of our Lord, or with affection of pride and Pharisaical dominion, as though they were Lords of the sacraments and Christian Religion, and not ministers or seruitours of Christ in his Church.

And therefore that their mercie and iudgement ought to be tried and measured by his sentence, and not his by theirs. These thinges were to be admonished and reprehended then: but now the disease lieth on the other side, and they offende rather in ouer much lenitie. For as both be contemned of the wicked, so there is almoste amongst the good none left, but loosing now a daies, when men had rather be bound in sinne, then bound in penance for sinne. Therefore the office os binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing requireth truelie good knowledge, much discretion, zeale and stowtnes in Gods quarell. For as it is moste high, so surelie it is moste hard and burdenous. It pitieth my heart to see it so litle esteemed, but much more, that it should be lesse esteemed through their ignorance or euill life, to whom the keies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission be committed. The keie of remission and retaining sinnes, they had of God in their orders, but discretion, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, vertue with other qualities, meete for the exercise of that office, they must by praier and industrie obtaine, lest whilest they profit other men to saluation, they become repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate them selues, as Saint Paul said of him selfe in case of preaching.</hi>

For though for counsell and comforte, and such other respectes, a descrete and learned man were rather to be wished for then a worsse, yet being assured that the partie is called by Gods Church to the function, and hath iurisdiction ordinarie, or graunted extraordinarilie by the appointint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of lawfull superiours, and if by schisme and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or otherwise he be not suspended from the practize of the said functions, I need nothing to doubt for his other lackes, but much more for mine owne sufficience, or lacke of contrition, or some other like want in my selfe, why the fruit of the Priests absolution cannot be deriued vnto me, as else, if it were not my owne default, it should by force of the sacrament vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie be.</hi>

                        <p>Except you haue no regarde of the propertie of speach, I maruell you can saie, this function is so proper to gods owne iudgement and heauenly court, and yet allowe the iudgement of <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> that <hi>all power of remission and absolution is properlie Gods, and mans but by ministerie:</hi> In which sentence, if you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, we should haue small controuersie with you, touching the argument of this first booke of your treatise. The wordes of Ierome vpon the 16. of Saint Mathewe are these: <hi>Et dabo tibi claues regni caelorum. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum locum Episcopi &amp; presbyteri non intelligentes, aliquid sibi de Pharisaeorum assumuns supercilio, vt vel damnens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentes, vel soluere se noxios arbitrentur: cùm apud Deum non sententia sacerdotum, sed reorum vita quaeratur. Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musin Leuitico de leprosis, vbi iubentur vt ostendant se sacerdotibus, &amp; si lepram habuerint tunc a sacerdote immun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difierent: non quòd sacerdotes leprosos faciunt, &amp; immundos, sed quòd habeant notitiam leprosi &amp; non leprosi, &amp; possint dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernere qui mundus, quiuè immundus sit. Quomodo ergo ibi le prosum sacerdos mundum vel immundum facit, sic &amp; hîc alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat vel soluit Episcopus &amp; pres biter: non eos qui insontes sunt vel noxij, sed pro officio suo cùm peccatorum audierit va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietates,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12222:257"/>
rietates, scit qui ligandus sit, quiue soluendus. And to the I will giue the keies of the kingedome of heauen. This place Bishopes and priests not vnderstanding, doe take vpon them somewhat of the pride of the Pharises, that either they condemne innocentes, or thinke that they due loose guilty persons, whereas before God, not the sentence of priests, but the life of the parties accused in iudgement is enquired of. We reade in Leuit. of the Lepers, where they are commaunded to shew themselues vnto the priests, and if they haue the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, then they are made vncleane by the prieste. Not that the priests doe make men Lepers and vncleane, but for that they haue knowledge of a Leper, and of him that is no Leper, &amp; can discerne who is cleane, &amp; who is vncleane, Therefore looke how priest doth there make a Leper cleane, or vncleane, so here doth a Bishop or priest binde or loose, not them that are vnguiltie or guilty, but according to his office, when he hath heard the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of sinners, he knoweth who is to be bound, or who is to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi> In this saying of S. Ierome diuerse things are to be considered: First that the gift of the keies &amp; the power of binding &amp; loosing graunted to Peter, by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and al mens in his time, peiteineth to euerie Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe, elder, or priest of Gods Church. Secondlie that God onelie doth properlie and absolutelie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue sinnes: and thirdlie that the priests sentence vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth is but declaratorie, vpon his knowledge of the offendours of Gods sentence, as the priests autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to make a Leper cleane or vncleane, was onelie vpon certaine knowledge to pronounce that which God had wrought vpon him to his punishment or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, and according thereunto, either to seperate him, or to receiue him into the congregation. <hi>That pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in those daies was giuen greater then the fault required, you finde not in Saint Ierome, either in the one place, or in the other,</hi> that you quote. Onelie in the later vpon the text of Mat. 23. which you cite of importable burthens, he saieth. <hi>Hoc generaliter aduersus omnes magistros, qui grauiaiubent, &amp; minora non faciunt. This is spoken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12222:258" rendition="simple:additions"/>
against all such Masters, as commaund burthenous things, and them-selues doe not lesser thinges.</hi> So that you would seeme to auoide Saint Ieromes iudgement vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a false surmise. For Saint lerome findeth as much fault with the prelates of his time, for loosing them that are guiltie, as for binding them that are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. <hi>The contempt of your priests</hi> which you lament, is both for there ignorance, &amp; vnlawfull calling. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you <hi>assure them of the keie of remission and reteining of sinnes to be giuen them by God, in their orders, and then you send them to obteine discretion, knowledge, vertue, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther qualities meete to exercise that office by praier and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie,</hi> you take a wrong course, and contrarie to that which the Apostle prescribeth: for he will haue men first, to be tried and then to minister. They must first by praier and other ordinarie meanes, seeke to be fit for their office, &amp; afterwarde lawfully be admitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. But where this order is peruerted, they may haue calling and admission by men, but I see not how, they can haue power and approbation of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint Ieromes sentence standing, your conclusion of the fruite of an ignorant priests absolution is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, though there were no doubt of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>

                           <hi>For this I dare be bolde to saie, that the lacke of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed fruite of any sacrament, ariseth a thousand times oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by the vnworthines of the subiect, and him that receiueth the sacrament, then vpon any lacke of the giuer and minister thereof, and namelie in this sacrament of the Churches dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline it chaunceth more often. For as Saint Basil saith: Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas remittendi peccata non est absolutè data, sed in recipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis obedientia, &amp; in consensu cum eo qui animae ipsius curam</hi>

Therefore, for Christs loue, let vs cast pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill oftner of our owne case, then vpon other mens states: for we

Thus in English: Remission of sinnes, whether it be by baptisme or by other sacraments giuen, it properlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth to the holie ghost, and the preheminence of the forece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effect is onelie his: the solemnitie of wordes, the inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Gods name, and the externall signes prescribed to the priests ministeries, by the Apostles to make vp the visible sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: but the thing it selfe, and effect of the sacrament, the holie ghost worketh: and the author of all goodnesse putteth his hand inuisible, to the externall and visible consecration of</hi>

As also that he sayeth within few wordes after, that <hi>the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth promise remission of all sinnes to them that worthely repent,</hi> he concludeth plainlie against your long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, wherin you would haue it seeme, as though the priest had absolute power of remitting, and not an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of declaring the sentence of God concerning such. And Saint Cyprian, or whoesoeuer is author of that worke, <hi>De cardinalibus Christi operibus,</hi> confirmeth that which I saide, that the minister doth not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12222:259"/>
giue the effects of the sacrament, but onelie the outwarde seales thereof, as Iohn Baptist doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. His whol sentence I will repeate, because you haue not so fullie set it downe, not so truelie translated it. <hi>Veniebat Christus ad Baptismum, non egens lauacro, in quo peccatum non erat, sed vt sacramento perennis daretur autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, &amp; tanti virtutem operis, nulla personarum acceptio com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendaret: quoniam remissio peccaterum siue per Baptismum siue per alia sacramenta donetur, propriè spiritus sancti est, vt ipsi soli huius efficientiae priuilegium mancat.

The solemnitie of wordes and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of the holy name, and the signes appointed for the ministery of the Preists by the Apostles doctrine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, doe celebrate the visible sacrament: but the thing it selfe, the holie ghost formeth and worketh, and the author of all goodnes doth inuisiblie put his hande to the visible consecrations: and the fatnes of the diuine vnction doth power the fullnes of grace into the ministeriall sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and doth make consummate or make perfect the matter of the sacrament.</hi> That the ministers desertes doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alter the sacramentes or the effect of them, it is no controuersie betweene vs, howsoeuer you would make the ignorant beleeue that Caluine is of another

opinion, wherein his writings are moste manifest to the contrarie. Where you <hi>approoued him that is lawfullie called, to haue receaued the gift and grace of the holie Ghost, which is the selfe same that the Apostles receaued of Christ for the like functions,</hi> you take too much vpon you: for the ordinarie and externall calling, to exercise an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ministerie, where of Cyprian discourseth, may be without receauing of the holie Ghoste. Againe no man hath authoritie to giue the holie Ghost, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, more then in Baptisme or anie other parte of the ministerie of the Gospell. Thirdlie, where you <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire lawfull calling and ordaining in the minister of the sacrament, that the receiuer being rightlie qualified, maie obtaine like benefit of whomsoeuer the office is exercised,</hi> you exclude lay men and women from ministring of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptisme, which your doctrine doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte. Finallie, where you <hi>assure the minister of the continuance of his authoritie, by that gift of the holie Ghost, be his life and desertes neuer so euill,</hi> you saie verie much. For what if he be an Idolater, a persecutor of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or degenerated into Mahometisme, wil you say his gift and authoritie doth still continue? nay, you saie it continueth, though he be neuer so ignorant. Then if he be a naturall foole, or a mad man, or one void of all Christian knowledge, either when he was ordained, or fallen since into such extremitie of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet by your rule, he retaineth his gift. Nay, if he be for heresie, schisme, or notorious euill life law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie embarred from the vse and exercise of remitting sinnes, and other like spirituall functions, yet his gift of the holie Ghost continueth still with him. This is in deede an indeleble character, that is imprinted so deepe, that nothing can scrape it awaie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept perhappes a glasse or knife in degradation: For as I take it, you meane of him that is onely suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from his office, as though the practize onelie, and not the authoritie for a time might be taken from him.</p>

For being answerable to his ordinance, it can not but be agreeable with his honour. But because in desperate cases our aduersaries haue taught their fellows there to wrangle vncurteouslie where they can not mantaine reason pithelie, I will not onelie serue my cause, but sometimes pursue their follie, though I doubt not but the wisdome of God shal more and more appeare, touch

Our yong masters may be glad, to grow so high in gods Church, as to be reprooued with them who were condemned thirteene hundreth yeares since: and though they be so modest, that lightlie they list not crack of their auncestours, yet we will not defraud them of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, nor healpe our cause by dissimulation of their great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. It is their pusillanimitie, I know, that they will not often in distresse of their doctrine, call for aid of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were doubtlesse verie auncient, and manie of them within the first six hundred yeares. In other causes</hi> Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius <hi>might healpe: in some</hi> Iouinian <hi>would attend vpon them:</hi> Manes <hi>might do them often high pleasure.</hi> Iulianus the apostata, <hi>a prince for their purpose,</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>one of the Apostles age, would stand by them: surelie if our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And truelie I can not dissemble with them in this cause, that now is in hand: they haue one patron against vs, of yeares very auncient, and of reason much much like vnto themselues,</hi> Nouatus <hi>is his name, of whome the followers were called of the Church</hi> Nouatians, <hi>but them-selues liked to be called</hi> Cathari, <hi>that is to saie, cleane and vndefiled persons. Their opinion was, that such as did fall into anie mortall sinne after Baptisme, could not by anie man or meanes be assoiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and for that they dissalowed the Churches wholl practize of mercie and remission of sinnes in the sacrament of penance, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing dissagreeing from</hi> Caluin, <hi>that condemneth the saying of Saint Ierome, as sacrilegious, where he writeth that penance is as a second beord of refuge, whereby after shipwrack a man may be saued. Neither did</hi> Nouatus <hi>denie, but himselfe might
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12222:262"/>
haue mercie, and giue pardon after mansfall, but the Church could not therein meadle, as he thought, without singular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to Christ, and his onelie prerogatiue. And that he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in this matter fullie with our men, that they maie take more comfort on him, you shall perceiue by</hi> Socrates <hi>one of the writers of the Tripartit historie, who saith thus: Nouatus scribebat Ecclesus ne eos qui Daemonibus immolauerant, ad sacramenta susciperent, sed inuitarent quidem ad poenitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, remissionem verò Dei relinquerent potestati, cuius solius est peccata remittere. Nouatus wrote his letters to diuerse Churches, that they should not admitte anie man to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, that had sacrificed to Diuelles, but that they should onelie mooue them to doe Pennance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte to God the remission of their sinne, who onelie can forgiue mans offences. And therefore though in some other point</hi> Nouatus <hi>did ouerpricke his children, yet herein they fullie meet in one.</hi> Epiphanius <hi>writeth, that he denied salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to those that did fal to greeuous crimes after their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, and therewith did holde, that there was but one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which was done in baptisme, &amp; after that the Church to haue none. How hansomelie he defended this error, and vnmercifull heresie, ye shall see anone by Saint Ambrose, who learnedlie followed and chased him or his followers in an wholl worke written for that purpose. In the meane time it were good for the more credit of the man and his cause, to note with the auncient Doctors of his daies, his conditions, his comming vp, his proceeding, and practizes. S. Cyprian, who was most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested with him, &amp; knew him best, geueth him this praise: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatus was a man that delighted much in nouelties and newes, of insatiable auarice, a furious rauin, with pride and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable arrogancie almoste puffed past him selfe, knowen and taken of all Bishoppes for a naughtie packe, condemned by the common iudgement of all good Priestes for a faithlesse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, curious and inquisitiue them to betraie, for to deceiue, alwaies readie to flatter, in loue neuer faithfull nor trustie, a match euer fired to kindle sedition, a whirle winde and storme to procure the shipwrake of faith, and to be short, an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie

                        <p>In the latter end of the Chapter next before, you said in your brauerie, that you would leaue Caluine wrestling with his owne shadow, and follow on your purpose, and course of matter, a greate parte whereof is, as it appeareth, to wrastle with your owne shadowe. For no man ther is in these dayes, especially of them whome you count your aduersaryes in this cause, but doeth acknowledge, that it standeth well with gods honour, that mortall men should remit sins, according to that commission which they haue reccaued of him, who only hath power absolutely and properly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte sinnes. The heresie of <hi>Nouatus</hi> is also generallie condemned of all men, neither holde we anie error common with him, in denying the priestes authoritie, much lesse any heresie. To omitte therfore your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent declaration, who be moste in daunger of heresy, I acknowledge your argument to be good and found. <hi>Nothing that is answerable to Gods ordinance, can be disagreeable to his honour: the authoritie of the Church is agreeable to Gods ordinance: therefore not contrarie to his honour?</hi> But if your Priestes will claime further autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, then is answerable to Gods ordinance, as you do in their name, that is to saie, that they haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er properlie to forgiue sinnes, then they claime that which is not agreeable to Gods honour. For it is God alone that properlie taketh awaie sinnes. And Gods ordinance is, that they should be declarers, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters and expressers of his holie will and pleasure concerning remission of sinnes, not properlie pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, forgiuers, or remitters of sinnes, as though the sentence in heauen depended vpon the sentence in earth, and not rather the sentence of man, should be framed, and depend vpon the sentence of God.

                        <p>The heresie of <hi>Nouatus,</hi> of diuers writers is diuersly reported: some affirme that he vtterly denied allre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to them that had fallen after Baptisme: other that he denied only the absolution and admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into the Church vpon any repentance or submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of them, that for falling into idolatrie for feare of persecution, were excommunicated or excluded from the Church. As for the popish Sacramente of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, was not instituted in his daies: but the power, that the Church hath in loosing them that werebound in such cases, or of assuring the penitent osfenders of remission of sinnes, he vtterlie denyed. <hi>But,</hi> you saie, <hi>he was nothing disagreeing from Caluin, that condemneth the saying of Hierome as sacrilegious, where he writeth that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is a second borde of refuge, whereby, after shipwrack, a man maie be saued.</hi> In which affirmation you vtter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vntruethes at once. For Caluine denyeth not with <hi>Nouatus,</hi> the benefit of repentance, absolution, loosing, or forgiuenes of sinnes after Baptisme, as you shamefullie slaunder him, but reprooueth the sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call papistes, which to the derogation of Baptisme, and the perpetuall fruite thereof, cal their pretended <hi>sacrament a second borde aftershipwrack,</hi> as though the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Baptisme beeing lost, they should haue remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes by this counterfet sacrament of popish penance and absolution. Secondlie, Caluin simpliecon demneth not the saying of <hi>Ierome</hi> as sacrilegious, but saith, that whose saying soeuer it is, it can not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, but it is plainlie impious, if it be expounded according to their meaning. <hi>As though</hi> (saith he) <note place="margin">Inst. lib. 4. c. 19. Sect. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>by sinne Baptisme were cleane put out, and not rather that it is to be called into remembrance to the sinner, so often as he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:12222:263"/>
thinketh of remission of sinnes, that thereof he maie gather him-selfe together be comforted, and confirme his faith, that he shall obtaine remission of sinnes, which was promised to him in Baptisme. Now that which Hierome spoke hardlie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, that by repentance Baptisme is repaired (from whence they fal, which deserue to be excommunicated from the Church) these good interpreters draw to their impietie. Therefore you maie saie moste aptlie, if you call Baptisme the sacrament of repentance, seeing it is giuen for a confirmation of grace and faith in them that think vpon repentance.</hi> These words of Caluin declare that he thought not so vnreuenthe of Saint Hierome as you would haue it seeme, but that he reprooued their impudencie, which to mainteine their sacrilegious opinion of their new found sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do draw his wordes, though in them selues som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hard, &amp; vnproper, yet farre beyond his meaning. And certainlie whosoeuer shall reade the place it selfe where Hierome hath these wordes, in Esaie, cap. 3. shal plainly perceiue that he speaketh neither of Baptisme, nor of any other sacrament of penance or repentance, nor of anie exercise of repentance in the Church of Christ, but rather of them that were neuer baptized, thelews which impudently cryed, <hi>Crucifyhim, we haue no King but Caesar,</hi> or those elder Iewes, against whome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saie prophecied. For vpon these wordes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>They haue declared their sinne as Sodoma, &amp;c. Et quomodo Sodomitae in omni libertate peccantes, &amp; nec pudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem quidem vllum habentes in scelere, dixerunt ad Loth, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducforas viros, vt concubamus cum eis, sic &amp; isti publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cè proclamantes, suum praedicauerunt peccatum, nec vllam in blasphemando habuere vereeundiam: secunda enim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And as the Sodomites sinning with all licentiousnes, and hauing not so much as anie shame in their wickednes, said vnto Lot, bring forth those men that we maie lie with them, euen so these men haue declared their owne sinne, openlle proclaiming it, and in blaspheming had no

For the second borde after shipwrack is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and a comfort of miseries to hide their owne vngodlines.</hi> The sense is manifest, that they which are not ashamed of their sinnes, are farre from repentance and in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate state. For they that haue made shipwrack of honestie and Godlines, haue no recouerie but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.

                        <p>That <hi>Nouatus reserued to him selfe anie power of giuing pardon after mans fall, which he denied to the Church,</hi> I know not where you finde it. But Socrates must testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that he ioyned fullie with vs: yea though in some other point, he did ouerprick his children, yet herein they fully meete in one. Why sir? do we refuse to admit anie man to the sacramentes, which haue sacrificed to Deuilles? yea though they haue beene excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from the Church fot their wickednes, do not we vpon repentance graunt them absolution, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them of remission of their sinnes? This is too intollerable impudencie to charge vs with <hi>Nouatus</hi> heresie, especiallie in that point, in which we are as directlie repugnant vnto him, as contradictoric say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and contrarie doings may be.

of his heresie with our doctrine, concerning the power of remitting of sinnes. You saie <hi>that he lacked all the solemnitie of baptisme and confirmation, and consequentlie the spirit of God, which by them he should haue receiued</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius indeed out of the Epistle of Cornelius writeth, that <hi>after he was helped by exorcistes, he fell into dangerous sicknes, and being at the point of death, and not considering, he receiued baptisme in his bed, if it may be said that such a one receiued. For after he escaped his sicknes he obtained not therest, whereof he should haue bin partaker according to the canon of the Church, that is, to be sealed or confirmed of the Bishope, and hauing not obtained this, how obtained he the holie Ghost?</hi> By which wordes Cornelius meant, that he which was baptized in extreamitie, when he knew not what was done vnto him, and afterward when he was whole, had no care to approoue his baptisme by the Bishoppes iudgement, vpon his owne confession &amp; acknowledging of Christian Religion, could not be taken for a right Christian, much lesse, according to the discipline of those daies, might be admitted vnto the ministerie. But being admitted by a singular, and if you will, a sinister dispensation, in time of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was so fearefull, that he denied himselfe to be a Priest, when he was desired to come vnto them, and onelie by wordes to confirme them that were stricken with the terrour of the tyrant, as Therdoret writeth. The oathe that he exacted of such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Sacrament of the Lordes supper at his handes, was more like the oath that the pope exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of all Bishopes at their consecration, then anie ministred in the Queenes Maiesties visitation. That <hi>Wickliffe, the Waldenses, Luther or Caluine, do denie repentance, or reconciliation of them, that are fallen after Baptisme,</hi> it is a meere slaunder, although they denie the Popish sacrament of penance, whereof there was no mention in the Chuch, manie hundred yeares after Nouatus. <hi>That the Nouatians did not anoint those

that were by them Baptized,</hi> it seemeth they take it of their Master Nouatus, who because he had contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: he ceremonie, vsed in that time of the Church, him-selfe taught his schollers to doe the same, left it should hawe beene reputed a want in him. Although not the omission of the ceremonie, but the contempt of the vsage of the Church, being not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, in it selfe, was chiefelie condemned in him.

The Fathers oflater time (as Theodoret writeth) decreed, that such as came from his heresie, and would be incorporated into the Church, should by receiuing that cerimonie, which in time of their heresie they despised, declare that they were truelie conuerted from it, and willinghe. submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Catholike Church and her Doctrine. But of late daies when that ceremonie of anointing hath beene accounted a Sacrament, yea and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sacrament then Baptisme, and thought necessary to eternall saluation, whereas yet it hath no institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ set forth in the holie Scriptures: the reformed Churches haue iustlie abrogated that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, according to that libertie, which the Church hath in all ceremonies, not commaunded by God, &amp; according to the example of the Church in former ages, which hath abrogated manie ceremonies vsed of auncient times, aswell as that of anointing with oile them that are Baptized.</p>

                        <p>Nothing that is proper or peculiar to God, can be communicated to man, but it ceaseth to be proper to God. For it is against the nature of properties, to be made common to any other subiect, then to that whereof they are proper adiuncts. And yet I denie not but that which is proper to God, he doth exercise of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times, by the seruice or ministery of men, in which they are but instrumental causes, &amp; he him selfe is the principal efficient: otherwise man maie not occupie, or execute secondly, or thirdly, or last of all, by waie of participation, that which is proper or peculiar to God. So that it remaneth still an vndoubted truth, that God onelie doth forgiue sinnes properlie, and man doth not forgiue sinnes properlie, but is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of God to vtter, and declare the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God in forgiuing sinnes to all and euerie one that repent, and beleeue the Gospe ll. Your general negatiue, <hi>that there is no function, power, nor dignitie be it neuer so peculiar to God, by naturall excellencie, but it maie be occupied of man secondly, as by the waie of seruice, ministery, or participation,</hi> if it were vrged against you, would breed horrible absurdities. To omit all other,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:12222:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the power of creating thinges of nothing, by what meanes maie man be partaker thereof, occupie it, or exercise it? But let vs consider your induction, <hi>All Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous workes worught by Christ in his humanitie, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or Apostles, were no lesse proper to God, then the power to remit sinnes.</hi> Yes verilie: for manie miraculous workes, that God did by Moses, the inchaunters of Egipt did the like, by the power of the deuill: whereby it appeareth, that although ail power be deriued from God, as from the first cause thereof, euen that power which the deuill hath, yet it is otherwise commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to creatures, then the power of remission of sinnes is. For that remaineth onelie in the hande of God, and is not properlie executed by any other man, but onelie by our sauiour Christ, the mediarour of god and man. In which power he hath ordained man, but as a seruant, to doe nothing after his owne will, but onlie to declare and pronounce the will of God therof. In working of miracles it is otherwise, in which ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so exerciseth that power, either receiued of god, or of the deuil, that often times he causeth effects accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne wil, &amp; contrarie to the wil of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in his word, though nothing can be contrarie to his absolute will. But the power of remitting sins no man can execute, contrarie to the reuealed wil of God: For Peter could not forgiue the sinnes of Iudes Iscariot, Smon Magus, Alexander the copper smith, or anie other that sinned against the holy Ghost, or that was not truly penitent for his sinnes, or that beleeued not the promise of God. Neither could Peter, or can anie man retaine the sins of him that repenteth, and taketh holde of Gods mercie by faith, but he shall haue remission of sinnes, though all the men in the world would saie the contrarie: so that man hath no power in reteining or remitting of sins, but by declaring the will of God, wherof he hath no warrant but out of his worde. For I aske this question of you,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:12222:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if two priests hauing heard one mans confession at the same time be in contrarie opinions, so that the one doth forgiue sinnes, the other doth reteine them, Whether of these sentences shal take place? No doubt but you will saie, that which is agreeable to the will of God. Then doth it follow of necessitie, that man doth onelie declare Gods will, and hath no absolute or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per power, to exercise this authoritie according to his owne will. But as Peter saide to the lame man, <hi>that which I haue, I giue to thee,</hi> and yet he had it not of his owne right of might, but from God: euen so saie you, <hi>The power of pardoning sinnes, is truelie and properlie in the priests, as the power of working mitacles is properlie in Peters hands.</hi> Idenie your consequence. For although the pow er of working miracles were properly in Peters hands, yet it followeth not, that the power of pardoning sins was properlie in him. For, as I haue shewed, there is great diuersitie betweene the one power, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The power of miracles is graunted to Peter, to be exercised according to the direction of Gods holie spirit, agreeablie vnto the secret and absolute will of God: But the power of pardoning sinnes is not graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Peter, or any man, but as to a messenger, and declarer of Gods will as it is reuealed in his worde; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side which, if any presume to remit. he doth but spend his breath in vaine. But a wicked man hauing the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of miracles, maie sometimes abuse it, contrarie to Gods law, as to mainteine false doctrine, and Idolatry, to hurt or to murther innocents thereby: and yet wee may saie in some respect, that the power of working miracles is not properlie in Peters handes, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not in him, to heale whome and when he will, but after as he hath a secret instinct of him that is the author of his gift, and also because he is but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of God, whoe onelie doth great maruells properlie, Psal. 136. as he confessed in the healing of <hi>AEneas,</hi> Acts 9. saying, <hi>Christ</hi> Ie <hi>sus heale thee.</hi> So Acts. 3:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12222:268"/>
                           <hi>His name hath made him strong, and the faith which is by him hath giuen him his perfect health.</hi> Where you conclude that the priests may saie likewise to the sicke soull, <hi>That which I haue, I giue thee, In the name of Iesus Thy sinnes, my sonne, be forgiuen thee.</hi> Although the sorme of speach be somewhat insolent and strange, yet you confesse that the priest hath nothing to giue him, but a declaration of Gods will, when he saieth, thy sins are forgiuen thee in the name of Iesus. Yea if he shall saie, in the name of lesus I forgiue thee thy sins, the sense were no more, but this, Iesus doth assure thee by me, his seruant and messenger, that he hath, satisfied for thy sinnes, and therefore they shall no more be imputed vnto thee, for God hath forgiuen them.</p>

                           <hi>And this worke of remitting sinnes is much more certain then the miraculous healing of the bodie, beeing ioyned by Gods promise to a sacrament that shall neuer cease in the Church, where miracles for most part ceased long since: yea the name and maiestie of God is a thousand parts more honoured, not onelie that God, in his owne person, but in the frailtie of hu ministers, is able to accomplish such mightie miracles, both in the cure of bodie and soull. But the fondnes of this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie is so great, that it maketh those things to tend to Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing, which he hath appointed properlie and onelie in a manner, for the purpose, to set forth the name of his sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. For if both sinnes of mans soull, and sores of his bodie could not visiblie by externall meanes be healed in the glorious inuocation of Gods name, it would surelie be forgotten in the Church of Christ, that such power is giuen by God the father to his onelie sonne, &amp; mans minde would not reach to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, whereof he had no proofe nor assurance outwardelie. I beseech you, Sir, the working of strange miracles giuen to some, as well of the Prophets, as of the Apostles of Christ, were they any whit preiudicial to Gods honour, or were they giuento man aboue his naturall power, for the setting forth of God, honour, that the Prophets should see long before thinges that afterwarde did fall, which is the proprietie of God alone, and

If they will not let pristes remit sinnes for feare of offending God, and dishonouring his name, then let them not baptize, not preach, not teach, not doe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, not giue the holie ghost, not correct faultes, not giue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor doe any other functions.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12222:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is any other sacrament, whereby men are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the forgiuenes of their sinnes, by any externall ceremonie, except the sacraments of Baptisme, and of the Lordes supper, which is the cheife matter in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, you goe not once about to prooue If Christs Church were like your Popish Church, wherein all thinges are taught by Images, &amp; dumme ceremonies, and the worde of God neuerpreached, it might come to passe as you say, that it would be forgotten, that such power is giuen by God to Christ.

make no assurance outwardelie.

Is it the receiuing of the outward elements in the Lordes supper, that assureth me of my spirituall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment to eternall life, or faith graunted vpon the worde, which comming to the elements, maketh them the seales of assurance of gods promises? The question you aske, <hi>of the Prophets foreseeing of things so long before things that afterwarde did fall, whether it was graunted with dishonour of God, or to his glorie?</hi> I answere that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of God alone, to whome all things are present, was not, ne could not be communicated to men. But God to his glorie, by the instrument of their mouth did foreshew those things, which he had reuealed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his spirit, in prophetical vision, or dreame. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could <hi>Elizeus</hi> see the heart &amp; inward thoughts, of <hi>Gihezei</hi> his seruant, which is gods onelie propertie, but God did reueale, and declare vnto him, what hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie was hid in the heart of <hi>Gihezei:</hi> so that <hi>Elizeus</hi> knew no more properlie what was in the heart of <hi>Gihezei</hi> then any other man, to whome <hi>Gihezei</hi> him-selfe might open his thoughtes, sauing that <hi>Elizeus</hi> knew more certenlie, and by 2 more wonderfull meane. For to man <hi>Gihezei</hi> might ly, but god who onely searcheth the heart &amp; the reines, reuealed the truth to <hi>Elizeus.</hi> Neither was <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest hable by laying on of handes to giue the holy ghost, that is the visible gists of the holv ghost, but according to gods good pleasure &amp; will. For Acts. 8. Peter and Iohn sent by the Apostles into Samaria, <hi>praied for them that were baptized, that they might receiue the holie Ghost,</hi> and after laide their hands vpon them, and they receiued from god the sensible graces of the holie ghost, as speaking with tongues, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of tongues, healing of sicknes, casting out of deuills, and such like. Therefore in such wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effects as followed laying on of hands, nothing

that is most proper to god passed to men. But it pleased God, who is the onelie author of such graces and gifts, to bestow the same by his faithfull stewards, at their praier, whereunto they were mooued, and assisted by him, and with that visible sacrament or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.

Vtrum qui mandat is attemperat, an qui resistit? Ecclesia in vtroque seruat obedientiam, vt pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catism &amp; alliget, &amp; laxat. That is to saie: These</hi> Noua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians <hi>saie that they denie penance or power to remit sinnes in earth, in respect of the maintenance of such honour as is due to God, to whome onely they will reserue the pardoning of mans sinnes. But in deede none doe so much iniury to Gods glory, as those which breake his commaundements, and make a diuision of that charge and commission, which he giueth. For seeing our Lord Iesus by his owne mouth spake these words:</hi> Receiue ye the holy ghost, whose sinnes you doe forgiue, they be forgiuen, and whose sinnes you holde, they behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>who in this case more honoureth God? He that obeieth his commaundement, or he that resisteth the same? The Church obeieth in both, as well in binding as in loosing. Thus there. And a litle after: Looke to whome this charge was giuen, and that person may lawfullie and with Gods good leaue vse the same. Au l therefore the Church may lawfullie both binde and loose: heresie and her attendants can rightlie doe neither. This right is onelie committed to priests, and therefore the Church rightlie challengeth that authoritie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee hath lawfull priests: and so heresie cannot doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee hath not the priests of God in her cursed congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

of this, that it neuer dishonoureth God, that man should doe that which God giueth him either commaundement or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to doe in his behalfe, he taketh it for a knowne trueth, that, as the Church of God hath true and lawfull priests, so shee may by them, vpon Christes warrant, bath loose and binde: and contrariwise, that heresie may well enough giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that right of remission of sinnes, because shee hath light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie no lawfull priests, by whome shee may practize the same.</hi>

                        <p>First, you make a vaine exclamation or outcrie, as though heresie hath spoiled the Church of her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures vnder pretence of Gods glorie: but such rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall vamties all wise men will deride. The Church is not spoiled of her treasures, when neither Christ, nor his grace is conteined in the sacraments: but when Christ, her onelie treasure, is spoiled of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, of sole redemption and fatisfaction for our sinnes, or of any other parte of the office that belongeth to the mediator. Therefore it is her greatest honour that Christ may haue his true honour, in whome &amp; with whome she hath al things, not to the glory of flesh &amp; bloode, but to the glorie of God, to whome all glorie of right belongeth: what Saint Ambrose did write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Nouatians,</hi> pertaineth not to vs, who denie neither the power of remitting nor of reteining of sinnes, but graunt both. But that Saint Ambrose did not meane of such a power as the Papists doe claime, I haue shewed before out of his owne wordes in the same place, where he saieth, that <hi>our Lord hath chosen such Disciples, as should be interpreters of their Lordes will.</hi> This power is graunted to all true ministers of the Church, that they are the Legates or embassadors of god, to declare his wil &amp; pleasure vnto men, aswel for remitting, as for reteining of sins. And therefore <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatus,</hi> or <hi>Nouatianus,</hi> did very absurdlie by Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose his iudgement, that did arrogate vnto himselfe power to reteine sinnes, while he pronounced that they which fell into Idolatrie after Baptisme, might
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:12222:272"/>
not be receiued into the Church vpon any trial of their repentance: and would not yeald that the ministers of the Church by the same authoritie might pronounce, that they which were truelie penitent of their former wicked behauiour, were forgiuen in the iudgement of God, which was to remit their sins vpon earth, with faith in Gods promise, that they shall be forgiuen in heauen. Thus the answere of Saint Ambrose vnto the Nouatians, doth nothing in the world make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, which denie no power that Christ hath graunted to his Church, vnder collour of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Gods honour.</p>

                        <p>Whethersoeuer the force of trueth, or prouidence of God driue heretikes, we haue no purpose to follow them. The gifts which god bestoweth on his Church, and the ministers thereof, with all humilitie and thankefulnes, we acknowledge, receiue, and exercise to his glorie, and the benefit of his Church: although we arrogate nothing vnto our selues, either in them, or in any other thing that is proper to God. And therefore it is both a vaine and a false complaint, that the Church adorned with Gods blessinges is forsaken, and a congregation barren of all Gods giftes, imbraced.

                           <hi>FVrthermore, we must here consider, that what worke soeuer God appointeth man to exercise in his Church, either in remission of sinnes, or giuing grace of Gods spirit, or what other holie action soeuer may in his name be done, for the benefite of the people, by the ministerie and seruice of man, either by the meanes and mediation of any other instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cause, we must learne, that in these workes so wrought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by man, or through other creatures, God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe his right to the waies and workers thereof, and giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the wholl title that is due to himselfe in the saide diuine acts. For then in deede mans practize should dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from Gods power, and he should as it were succeed God in the right of his proper power, and euerlasting inheritance: which onelie to surmise, as heretikes do, were meere follie.</hi>

                           <hi>Christ is by euerlasting right made the head of the Church, and he resigneth not this office to anie mortall man. For if he did, then the partie that should by his graunt occupie for a season the same dignitie, were his fuccessour, and should holde in like right the same office as he did before. But that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:12222:273"/>
he hath made his substitute and vicegerent, by whom in his corporall absence he ruleth now the Church, as he did before in his owne person, not giuing ouer his preheminence &amp; supreame power therein, but now practizing that by another, which afore he exercised him selfe in his owne person. It had beene a great derogation to Christ that Peter should haue bin Christes heir and successour: for then Christ had lost the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peiuitie, an other man gouerning after him in like right and preheminence as he had before. But, for Peter to rule the Church vnder him, in his steade, &amp; as by his euerlasting right, with commission from him that holdeth that soueraigntie for euer, by whomesoeuer the Church shall be ruled till the worlds end in earth, this (I saie) is no derogation to God, nor his sonne Christ at all, but it much prooueth that Christ according to his manhood is the head of the Church for euer, because by man in earth he ruleth the same til his comming again, the whichman, <note place="margin">Psal. 44.</note> though he be his vicar &amp; vicegerent, yet he is not his successour.</hi>

                           <hi>Saint Augustine did trimlie allude to the vse of the olde law, comparing the ministers of Gods Church to the yonger bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who were charged to marrie the elder brothers wife, when he died without issue, in whose name they did practize the worke of mariage, and therefore could not call their children by their owne names, but by the name of their elder breethren. For as they raised seede to their brother, and for their brothers honour, so the Priests that haue taken vpon them (as it were in mariage) to gouerne Christes Church, and to bring forth children, not in their owne names, but in the name of their elder brother, and her departed Husband. As when they bring foorth children in Baptisme, as through the wombe of the Church, they bring them not forth as for them-selues, and in their owne names, but in the name of Iesus Christ, beeing their elder brother: euen so it is in remission of sinnes also, in which case Christ resigneth not his authoritie, as though he lacked that power him-selfe, but practzeth that mightie worke by the ministerie of man, which before he exercised in his owne person. And as the baptzing not in the name of Peter, nor Paull, nor Apolle, but in the name of Christ the

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:12222:274"/>
vnto the end of the world. Neither hath he neede of anie substitute or vicegerent, to exercise anie point of that office, which is proper to the vniuersall head of the vniuersall Church: neither can anie mortal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exercise the office of the head of the whol Churh, because it is a meere diuine power, by euerlasting right, as you confes, proper to our sauiour Christ, that from him, as from the head, life and all powers of life should flowe into his wholl Church, and euerie true <note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> member thereof. And therefore whatsoeuer from the beginning he hath exercised in his owne person, he doth not now practize by anie other, but still by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and in his owne person. But the office of teaching which in his humanity he exercised and before his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation was exercised, by the Prophets and Priests, he hath committed to his Apostles, Euangelistes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Pastours, and Teachers, vnto the end of the world: but that one man should rule his whol Church, either by doctrine, or discipline, whereunto it is not possible for him to haue an eye, and ouerseeing, Christ hath neuer appointed: but as he hath appointed seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall teachers, so also hath he ordained seuerall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. And no more possible it is, that one man should rule and gouerne al the Church, then it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that one man should teach al the Church desper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as it is now, and hath been of olde, ouer al the face of the earth. But that Peter or anie other man should rule the Church in Christes steade, you saie it proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth much, that Christ is head of the Church accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his manhood.

It is one thing to saie that Iesus Christ, or the man Iesus Christ is head of his Church, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to saie, that Christ is head of his Church, according to his manhood. Beside, I know not what humane head ship you ascribe vnto Christ, that make him head in respect of such externall regiment as may be exercised by man, and yet by no one man alone, but by manie men, at once, in this dispersion of the Church: all which acknowledge Christ to be their onelie head, because they must gouerne the Church by his word onelie, and by lawes framed agreeable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same. <hi>That the Protestantes bring foorth children to Caluin or Luther,</hi> it is nothing but tailing without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For the Protestantes are willing to departe with anie pretence of right or honout, so that God maie haue his whol glory by such meanes as he hath appoin ted. Therefore according to Saint Augustines allusion, they beget children by preaching of the Gospell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, and not to them selues. <hi>The function of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</hi> you saie, <hi>is Christes still.</hi> If you meane, that he is the author of the doctrine preached, and so the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie master and teacher of his Church, it is true but this function the Protestantes claime not; but to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters appointed to declare this doctrine in the world.

Of <hi>the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of penance,</hi> we must first be resolued, before we can acknowledge any office of man to remitte mortal crimes therein. If Christ had instituted a sacrament of penance, as he hath of baptisme, we wold acknowledge the like effectes in the one, that we doe in the other. Concerning <hi>the anointing with oile,</hi> spoken of in Saint Iames, whereunto besides bodelie health, remission of sins was promised, it was a sacrament, while that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial gift of healing continued, but no institurio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall continuance.

                           <hi>There be some that affirme, this annoiling to haue beene a miraculous practise to take awaie the diseases of the sicke, and therefore that it did decaie with the working of other the like miracles, which after the spring of our religion were not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual. But that is a fond glosse. For I aske of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then Christianed, were instructed, or rather commaunded, to call for the Apostles or others, to heale them miraculously of their diseases, or whether all Priestes had the gift of working miracles in the Primitiue Church? If they saie, yea, touching the first piont, then as well were they charged to send for them to reuiue them, after they were dead, because the Apostles so could doe when they same occasion, and so did by some. But that is plaine absurde and false, that euer Apostle gaue in charge to anie man, much lesse to make a generall precept (as S. Iames here doth) to seeke after miracles: for that were to tempt God. And for the second, they are not so vnreasonable to answere me, that all Priestes could worke miracles, which is a seuerall gift of the holie Ghost, from the power of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, and therefore Saint Iames would not haue charged the sicke persons to haue called indifferentlie for Priestes, to heale them miraculouslie, the gift of miracles being not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all, nor perpetuallie promised to anie of them all. Againe I would knowe of them, whether there was anie mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous healing that had the remission of sinnes ioyned vnto it, or to the externall creature, by which they healed any person? If they saie yea: then it followeth, that the Priestes might by the office of that creature, heale a man of his sinnes, which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:12222:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they affirme to be blaspemie, and dishonour to God. But to what absurditie so euer you bring them, they will not confesse mortall men in externall Sacraments to remit sinnes.</hi>

But now let vs see how you will prooue, his interpretation to be a fond glosse. First you aske, <hi>whether the people then chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianed, were instructed, or rather commaunded, to call for the Apostles or others to heale the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miraculouslie of their diseases?</hi> I answere, they were admonished by the Apostles, that they might vse the benefit of that speciall gift of healing, and that is manifest by the wordes of Saint Iames. Secondlie you aske, <hi>whether all Priests had the gift of working miracles in the primitiue Church?</hi> I answere, I cannot tell of euerie one: but that in euerie Church some had the gift of healing, it is most probable, in the Apostles time. And therefore Saint lames willeth not one Priest, but all the Priests or Elders of the Church, to be called for. But against my first answer, you obiect that <hi>by like reason they were charged to send for them to reuine the dead, &amp; that to seeke after miracles were to tempt God.</hi> I replie, the gift of raising the dead, was verie rare, insomuch as we read but of two that were raised by the Apostles them selues, <hi>Tabytha</hi> by Peter, and <hi>Eutycus</hi> by Paul. And Saint Iames willeth not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, which were not in al places hand, but the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, which were in euery Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to be sent for. Neither is it a tempting of God to seeke after miracles of healing, at their hands, to whome God hath giuen that gift.

the remitting of the sacrament of baptisme, if the party were in case of actuall deadly sinne, but also goeth alwaie, as a neccssary preparatiue, before sacramentali confession, and is called in our tongue properlie,</hi> repentance: <hi>this Doctor therefore speaketh not of this kinde of penitence, but of a publike act of the Church, touching the reconciliation or repayring of mans state defiled after his baptisme by greeuous crimes, in which by Priestes iudgement the sinnes committed be either pardoned, or punished. And this must be called</hi> repentance <hi>onely, or the</hi> amendement of life, <hi>as Heretiques do tearme it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Doctrine of Gods trueth &amp; Sacraments: but it is an externall and visible act-on appointed by Christ in the 20. of Saint Iohn, to reconcile sinners by that forme of absoluing, which the Church vseth in the name and inuocation of God for that purpose. And therefore, hauing the grace of God and remission of sinnes ioyned vnto it by Christes promise, it must needes be a sacrament, as baptisme is: which all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe insinuate, when they make penance to be one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed ordinance of Christ, to forgiue sinnes no lesse then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is.

To holde <hi>that the children of Christian Parentss, in whome is no contempt or neglect of baptisme, cannot be saued, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into heauen without it,</hi> is to abridge the power of God, as though he could not giue saluation without sacraments: neither hath he declared anie necessitie of his will to the contrarie.

But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in his wordes, you would haue the good reader to marke, that <hi>poenitentia doth not signifie repentance, but your popish sacrament of penance,</hi> I will desire the good reader to marke the contrarie.

of sinnes: which whether it be in the solemne act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling those which are open penitents, or in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: and declaring remission of sinnes to al trulie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant sinners, it commeth all to one end. For there is not in that repentance <hi>mysterium gratiae,</hi> that is, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, adioyned to an outward sacrament, which spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie worketh that, which externallie it representeth.

Here such syllogismes, as you make at the end of euerie Chapter, were necessarie to demonstrate this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. For we can see no external or visible action inthese words, <hi>whose sins you retaine they are retained, &amp; whose sins you remit, they are remitted,</hi> therefore no sacrament. <hi>But all the fathers,</hi> you saie, <hi>doe insinuat the same, when they make penance one prescribed ordinance of Christ, to forgiue sinnes by, no lesse, then baptisme.</hi> I denie this argument, for euerie ordinance of Christ whereby sinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, is not a sacrament. <hi>But it was not the preaching of the Gospell, or repentance</hi> (saie you) <hi>that</hi> Nouatus <hi>did condemne, but the sacrament of penance, &amp; act of absolution, by the Priestes ministerie.</hi> Epiphanius and others doe writ, that he denied remission of sins, to thé that had fallen into idolatrie, after baptisme, although they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant. Other more fauourablie write of him, that he denied onely the outward reconciling vnto the Church, or act of absolution by the priests ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for them that had so fallen. But of the sacrament of penance, there is no mention in any auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of those, or much later times.

And it is manifest that Saint Iames speaketh not of extreame vnction, which you minister to none, but such as are ready to die, when he promiseth restitution of health to the diseased that were anointed in those daies. Againe his vnction was onelie with oyle, yours is with I cannot tell what slib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersauce co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated by the Bishop. That anointing was not extreame, when it might be repeated, as sickenes might often take holde of men.

Iames speaketh of Of the sayings of Epiphanius, and Lactantius, we haue spoken before, which it were needeles here to repeate. That there

                           <hi>modis: primùm, Baptisme, deinde, Poenitenita. When the priestes remit sinnes, or reteine them, the holie ghost which which dwelleth in them doth remit or retein by them. Which is done two manner of waies: first in Baptisme, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in penance. Saint Cyprian also said, that the holie ghost worketh remission of sinnes, whether it be in baptisme, or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sacraments. Whereby he cleerelie vttereth his meaning, that there should be moe sacraments then one, instituted by Christ for that purpose. In all which congruitie of Gods holie working, by diuerse sacraments, the remission of sinnes, we conclude against heresie, that the priesis power herein, deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no more to god nor our sauiour, in the sacrament of penance, then is doth before by baptisme, or after by extreame vnction: in none of al which, as I haue prooued before, Christ doth resigne his power and proper iurisdiction to the priestes, but continuing euerlastinglie in like preheminence and power as before, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his grace and remission of sinnes, in all these Sacraments, by the priests seruice and ministerie, that it maybe yet as truelie, as in his life time said, and so shall be to the worlds ende, Christ baptizeth, Christ shriueth, assoileth, and anointeth sinners, for remission of their offences: Although Iesus doth none of these now, nor much did in his life time, but his disciples then, and his disciples now, doe the same holie actions in his name.</hi>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:12222:281"/>
but that the holie ghost doth remit or reteine by his ministers by two waies, namelie by baptisme, &amp; by repentance after baptisme. For if you will restraine the worde <hi>poenitentia,</hi> to your pretended sacrament, then this absurditie will follow, that seeing there are but two waies by which the spirit remitteth sinnes, they are not remitted without that sacrament, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by true contrition of heart without any sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not by receiuing the Lordes supper, nor by your extreame vnction. Therefore <hi>poenitentia</hi> in Saint Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill signifieth repentance, and is necessarilie required in them, that shall obteine remission of sinnes by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Lordes supper, or by faith without any sacrament. That Cyprian maketh moe sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then one, instituted by Christ, to assure vs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, it is true. For by the sacrament of the bodie and bloode of Christ worthelie receiued, we haue this assurance also, as well as by the sacrament of baptisme. To conclude, the power of Christ or of his ministers, graunted by him, we denie not, but the institution of the sacrament of penance we require, to be shewed out of the holie scriptures, if you will haue vs to beleeue it.</p>

                           <hi>To conclude this matter, I argue thus.

And further I ioyne with them thus: The word of God is much more plaine and expresse for the priests warrant to remit sinnes in penance, then in Baptisme: but they may lawfullie doe it in Baptisme,</hi> Ergo <hi>they may doe it no lesse lawfullie in penance. Compare the wordes of institution of them both, and iudge your selues of your indifferencie and sinceritie, by what right you remooue the one, and reteine the other. I praie God, you seeke not

But truelie, I thinke you be in the case that Saint Ambrose tooke</hi> Nouatus <hi>your forefather to haue bene in, not onelie for that, that he saieth, Nouatus where he listed would admit power to priests of remission: But <note place="margin">Vbi supra</note> where he listed not, there the grace giuen to them must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured to God.

When sinnes are forgiuen to him that is truelie turned to God, they are forgiuen by them, to whome he him selfe by true conuersion is ioyned. The holie ghost forgiueth them, which is giuen to all the Saints, which are knit together in charitie, whether they know one another corporallie or not. Likewise when any mans sinnes are reteined, they are reteined by them, from whome, he is disioyned by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of heart, whether they be corporally knowne or vnknowne. For all euill men are spirituallie separated from good men. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde here he saieth, that sinnes are forgiuen or reteined by the Saints or holiemen: Ana'yet he saieth, that the holy ghost doth forgiue them, and that which is worthie of greater conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the same Doctor also saith: that God by himselfe or by his Saints onelie remittesh sinnes.

Beholde how diuerse thinges are deliuered by the Doctors, concerning these matters, and in this so great variety what is to be holden? This truelie, we may saie and thinke, that onely God forgiueth sinnes and reteineth, and yet he hath giuen power to the Church of binding and loosing, but otherwise doth he him selfe bind and loose, otherwise the Church. For he him selfe by him selfe onelie forgiueth sinne, because both he clensith the soul from the inward spot, and looseeh from the debt of eternall death. But this he hath not graunted to the priests, to whome notwihstanding, he hath giuen power of binding and loosing, that is to saie, of declaring men to be bound or loosed, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Lord did first by him seifere store the Leper to health, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards sent him to the priests, by whose iudgement he might be declared to be clensed.</hi> Thus writeth the Master of the sentences, with more to this effect.</p>
                        <p>In your second argument brought to prooue, that penance is a sacrament, I denie the Antecedent, that there is any wordes of institution, to prooue your sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of penance. Where you feare vainlie, <hi>least we will shortly seeke to baptize by preaching, as we wil absolue you onelie by the same,</hi> you declare nothing, but your harde conceit of vs. For we are olde enough to know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the ministerie of the worde, and the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a sunder.

We are readie to receiue the publike peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, that with plentie of teares and other outward signes, doe testifie the inward sorowe of their hearts, conceiued for their greeuous and notorious sinnes.

knowne, doe neuertheles secretlie bewaile their sinnes. And therefore that you saie of pampering mans will, and pleasure, where Gods worde and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting should be onely followed, seeke among your owne sect, where it may take place. For sinnes openlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or knowne to be committed, we holde that they ought with open confession to be chastised, for satisfying the Church, that is offended by them: As for sinnes committed in secret, whereby our neighbour is neither hurt nor offended, it is sufficient that they be acknowledged, with hartie repentance before god, if the offendours conscience be not troubled with fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubtfulnes about them. In which case we holde that it is conuenient, that he should consult with the learned minister, for his further comfort and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, out of the worde of God, concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his sinnes.</p>

For how should this truelie be spoken: the temple of God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the which temple you are, if God gaue not answers by mans temple? This is one great respect surelie, especialle since the second person in Trinitie tooke vpon him our nature. by whome the woorthines of mankinde is much increased, and more fit then euer before to serue ech other, as in the workes that be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and properlie by nature belonging to God himselfe. An other respect why we should by externall sacraments and mans ministerie receiue grace and remission of sinnes, is the singular respect had by God of our infirmitie, as well of minde, as bodie. For the minde requireth in her assured deseruing of damnation some externall token, by which she maie haue good cause to hope of mercie and grace. For where I know and assure myselfe that originall sinne is remitted by baptisme, when I haue once receiued the same, then I am in no further doubt of my selfe nor anie damnation for that sinne, which by the promis of God I haue learned, shall be washed awaie thereby, as by an externall instrument in which he conueigheth that benefit to my soule, if my soule by indisposition and unaptnes do not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the assured fruit thereof: So where after Baptisme mans life is often defiled by greeuons sinnes, and God highlie displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therefore, what an infinite treaskre it is, and how great a comfort to haue an assured helpe therof, wrought so by mans ministery in a visible action. that I maie know (sauing for mine owne lack of connenient disposition) my sinnes to be forgiuen, and Gods mercie and fauour to be obteined againe.

men, of his grace and mercie, to the forgiuenes of their sinnes, by outward signes, and sacraments, and that for diuerse good causes, we are allwaies readie to acknowledge. But <hi>that it pleaseth his wisdome,</hi> (as you saie) <hi>to forgiue sinnes no otherwise in his Church, but by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall orders ioyned to mans ministery, in sundry sacraments,</hi> we do vtterlie denie. For that were to tie the grace of God to the outward sacraments, which is most free to worke, either with them or without them. The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent publicane, an example of persons, that seeke <note place="margin">Luk. 18.</note> iustification, had his sinnes forgiuen him, by the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie grace and mercie of God, taken holde of by faith, without al external orders, ioyned to mans ministerie in any sacrament. For <hi>if we acknowledge our sins, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and iust to forgiue vs our sinnes, and to clense vs from all vnrighteousnes.</hi> And Iesus Christ is our aduocate <note place="margin">1.

And <hi>if anie man shal see his brother sinne a sinne not to death, he shall ask, &amp; he will giue life vnto him that sinneth not vnto death.</hi> By all which testimonies, and an hundreth more, that are euery where to be found in the scripture, it is most cleere, that God forgiueth our sinnes otherwise, then by externall orders or sacramets. Againe the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptisme is a seale and assurance vnto vs of the forgiuenes of our sinnes, not onely such as are com mitted before baptisme receiued, but euen vnto our liues end, whensoeuer we are truelie penitent for the same. Also the sacrament of the Lords supper in which we are spirituallie fed with the bodie of Christ, which was giuen for vs, and with his blood, which was shed for the remission of our sinnes, is a sure pledge, token, and seale of the remission of our sinnes committed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter baptisme, that we neede not the Popish sacrament of pennance for the same.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:12222:287" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then is Christ in full power of pardoning, saying the wordes of absolution ouer me, me think truelie I heare the sweete voice of Christ saying with authoritie:</hi> thy sinnes be forgiuen thee. <hi>Whereof no mortallman shall euer forbid me to take hope and singular trust of remission of sinnes with the passing comfort that thereon ensueth.

Some signes and remnantes of vertue be continued in the world. For when they be spent, and our yonkers that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of the Churches discipline, but haue had their full swinge in sinne, with the instruction of a most wanton doctrine, shall be the principall of the people, if this diuision so long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue (which God forbid) into what terms shal trueth and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue be then brought?

But for the sacrament of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or the Priest to be Christ vnto vs, in fullpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of pardoning, or to haue anie wordes of absolution said ouer vs, because we haue no ground in Gods word, whatsoeuer imaginarie pleasure you haue therein, we finde nothing that is of force to staie a weake consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to comfort a troubled spirit, or to heale a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart. To confesse our sinnes to Christ, who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie knoweth whether our repentance be vnfained, God forbid, that we should refuse. But to confesse them to a Popish Priest, or anie lawfull minister, if they be secret, there is no law or commaundement of God to require vs. If our conscience be not satisfied, about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie offence that we haue committed, how we should declare our vnfained conuersion, or repentance, we maie vse the aduise of the Godlie and learned pastor, who is able out of the word of god toresolue our doubts and quiet our conscience. <hi>That the want of</hi> Popish <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance will driue all men, either to desperation, or securitie and presumption,</hi> it is affirmed, without anie proofe.

But rather the doctrine of poperie concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensed sacrament of penance, is manifest occasion of securitie, in them that are carnallie minded; of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, in them that haue a tender conscience. For the one thinketh he hath an easy remedy for his sinnes to discharge them into a priestes eare: the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the impossibilitie of confession, and vnsuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the satisfaction, that be parts of this counterfet sacrament, can finde smal comfort in the priests absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Where you terme your popish <hi>penance to be the onely ordinance of god, for remission of our mortall sinnes,</hi> you vtter not onelie a grosse contradiction of the trueth taught in the holie scriptures, but also directlie contrarie to the doctrine of all Papists, and euen of your selfe.

What did circumcision instituted by God in the law of nature, commaunded to Abraham and his seede, and continued so many ages, euen till Christes law tooke place? Did it not after a sorte remit sinnes? Was it anie other thing, but an externall worke in the face of the world? Was it ministred by man? Did it derogate anie thing to the honour of God, which by himselfe for his owne glorie and namesake was ordeined?

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:12222:289"/>
in these wordes: Omnia penè in sanguine mundari, ac sine sanguinis effusione non esse remissionem.</hi> That all things <note place="margin">Cap. 9.</note> were in a manner clensed by blood, and that no remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion could be had without blood. <hi>For so in the 17. of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticus, they were charged to absteine from drinking of blood:</hi>

For neither circumcision nor sacrifice of old had anie face of power iudiciarie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not exactlie represent our Priests power giuen them by Christ, for the iudgement of our sinne. But the authority giuen them by the law to discerne, shut vp, and seperat the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous and vncleane persons, from other the cleane of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, did plainly represent our sacrament of penance: whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Doctors it is often resembled, wherein order is taken the 13. and 14. of</hi> Leuiticus, <hi>the authoritie and practize</hi>

                           <hi>And that this power pronouncing the leapers to be sound or sore, to be seperated or admitted to the company of the faithful; did represent the power of priesthood, concerning the leprosie of our soules, not onely S Bede, but S. Chryso also doth declare. For he talking of confession of sins to the Priest, writeth thus: Quamuis leprae immunditiam iuxtalegem sacerdoti panda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, atque ad eius arbitrium qualiter &amp; quanto tempore ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serit, purificari curemus. The vncleannes of the more grieuous leprosie (he meaneth deadlie sinne) let vs open to the Priest, and according to his arbitrement, howsoeùer he commaundeth vs, let vs seeke to purifie our selues. And. S Ierome: Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo ergo ibi leprosum sacerdos mundum vel immundum fecit, sic &amp; hîc alligat, vel soluit Episcopus &amp; presbyter, non eos qui insontes sunt velnoxy, sed pro officio suo cùm peccate rum audierit varietates, scit qui ligandus sit, quine soluen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus. Looke therefore (saith he) how the Priest maketh there in the olde lawe a person cleane or vncleane, so here doth the Bishopor Priest binde or loose, not binding the innocent, nor loosing the guiltie: but when he hath heard the varietie and diuersitie of our sinnes, then he knoweth, whome to loose, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:12222:291"/>
whome to binde. This place is verie plaine for confession and distinct rekening of euery of our mortall sinnes. The which the holie Doctor prooueth to be necessarie, because else the Priest of God could not doe iustice in punishing and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning, but should of ignorance either bind the good, or loose the wicked. In which case almightie God that knoweth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actlie the worthines and vnworshines of all persons, will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the Priestes sentence that did proceed of ignorance, but will himselfe giue iudgement according to the partics deseru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For the Priest is but a minister of his sacrament, and not the Lord and instituter thereof he must therefore conforme himselfe to Gods will, whose place he there occupieth. For as the Priest in the olde lawe could not make the cleane person to be vncleane, no more can the Priest of the new lawe bind the innocent, or absolue the person that continueth in sinne. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles the Priest worketh more properly vnder god, touching the remission of sinnes, because he is appointed the minister of grace and reconciliation, then the Priest in the olde lawe. For there in the making of any man whole of the leprosie, or other vncleanes, the Priest had not to do at all, but onelie when one was made whole by god, it was the priestes office to discerne the same, to shewe it vnto the people, and to admit him againe into the fellowspip of theresidue, after oblation made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For to them it was not said, whome-soeuer you punish with leprosie, or make vncleane, or whome-soeuer you heale &amp; make cleane, he shalbe whole: no such promise was made vnto them. For it was enough, that it might represent and haue resembling of our sacrament of penance, and of the maruelouse authoritte giuen in the new law to our Priestes, concerning the remission of sinnes. For to ours it was not saide, you shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne whome I haue loosed alreadie in heauen, and shewe to the world whom I haue retained bound, or not forgiuen in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: but, as Hilarie saith, the Priests sentence is made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to God in heauen, not the Priestes forgiuing is first, and then Gods afterward, as two distinct actions in time, but because the Priestes, is</hi> prius quoad nos, <hi>as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers doe tearme such thinges, and by the Priestes worke,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:12222:292"/>
which is plaine to vs, we streight come to the knowledge of Gods like worke of remission in heauen, which is</hi> prius natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, <hi>because Gods action is the principall, and mans must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily depend theron. But eis both Gods worke and mans runne ioyntly together in remission of sins, as al infirmental &amp; secondarie causes neuer make a seuerall action from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, but they concur ioyntly to euery effect, as it is most plaine in all sacraments, whereby god worketh grace, the which grace as it proceedeth from god, so it commeth by mans seruice, not by distinct operation of the principall, and the seruing and secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie causes, but in one worke &amp; vndeuided operation of them both. For in baptisme God worketh the remission of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or actuall sinnes first, and then sendeth the partie to the fount afterward, that the Priest therein may declare what god hath wrought before, or to worke the same againe, that so the partie might haue a double grace of remission, first by Ggd, and then by the Priest: for that were foolish to surmise. But god by the Priests ministerie and the sacrament doth rewit sinnes so, that the action hereof, at once sitly may fall vpon them both.</hi>

For though other men by the instruction of the law, might descerne a leaper from a clean person, yet no man had authority to put him out, or to receiue him into the congregation but the Priest.

Therefore if the sick be in sinnes, and shal confesse them to the elders or priests of the Church, and with perfect heart shall indeuour to forsake and amend them, they shall be forgiuen to them. For without the confession of amendment, sinnes can not be forgiuen wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is rightlie added, Confesse therefore your sins one to an other, that ye maie be saued.

Also that it is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:12222:293"/>
confession, acknowledging, or purposing of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Saint Bede counteth necessarie for them, that shall obteine remission of their sinnes, and not a particular declaration of all sinnes counted in a priests eare.

                        <p>In translating the place ofIerome, you render for <hi>peccatorum, sinnes,</hi> where you should rather translate it sinners, that <hi>peccatorum</hi> may be the antecedent to the relatiue that followeth: but as for auricular confession, or distinct reckoning of euerie of our particuler mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sinnes, this place maketh nothing in the worlde, as verie plaine as you say it is. The reason you adde of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iustice in punishing or pardoning, is of your owne imagination. For Ierome saith, that <hi>by hearing the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of sinners</hi> (speaking of them that haue openly offé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) <hi>and finding some to be penitent, some to be obstinate, or dissemblers, he may know who is to be bound, and who to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> which he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not do by hearing the diuersity of their sins. For if their sins be as red as scarlet, if they be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie penitent, they are to be loosed and if they seeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so small, if they be not repentant, nor humblie contrite in heart for them, they are to be bound. While you seeke to make <hi>a difference betweene the authoritie of the minister in the Ghospell of pardoning sinnes more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, then the priest clensed the Leper,</hi> you declare that you are not content with the sentence of Saint Ierome, nor of so many of the auncient fathers as made the case all alike. And where you saie, <hi>it was not said vnto them, as vnto ours, whomsoeuer you punish with Leprosie, or make vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, he shal haue a Leprosie,</hi> you speake beside the booke. For this authoritie was giuen to them, that they should make cleane or vncleane, and whomesoeuer they made cleane, he was admitted into the congregation, and whomesoeuer they made vncleane, he was so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:12222:293" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of all men. Yet properlie they made neither cleane, nor vncleane, but declared them so to be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the institution which they had of Gods law, in exercise whereof although they erred, and so the partie might be receiued or refused, according to their error, yet was he neither cleane nor vncleane in deede by their sentence, but by the work of God, and so be sinners. The blasphemie, that you ascribe to Saint Hilarie, I haue confuted before. Your distinction of <hi>prius natura,</hi> and <hi>quoad nos,</hi> is foolish sophistrie in this case.

And therefore, sauing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the</hi> Master of the sentences, <hi>he had not good consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration when he did holde (as some other did after him) that first mans sinnes be remitted by God in his contrition and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to come to the sacrament, and afterwarde, the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to be declared by the priests, and as it were confirmed by his approbation in confession: being therein partlie deceiued by the saying of Saint Hierome before alledged, whome he tooke, perchaunce, to haue compared in all respects, the office of the olde Priest, for the viewe of the vncleane, and ours of the new law, in the iudgement vsed vpon mans sinnes: and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as I take it, by a sentence of Saint Augustine, which
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:12222:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
compared together the receiuing of Lazarus by Christ, and the Disciples loosing his bandes, to Christes pardoning of sinnes first, and then the priests loosing the same afterward in the face of the Church. This, to be shorte, is a peece of Saint Augustines sentence: Quid ergo facit Ecclesia, cui dictum est:</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">De verbis Domini. fed. 8.</note>

What doth the Church then, to whome it was said: vhatsoeuer you loose, it shall be loosed? Marie, she doth that which our Lorde saied, loose him and let him goe. Wherein Saint Augustine meaneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but that Christ is the principall agent, and that he properlie doth giue life to the soull, the Priest for all that, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his seruant and minister therein, and therefore by nature is a latter agent in the same worke, which els, as I haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ioynilie perteineth to them both, for that the effect of a Sacrament commeth not to any man till it be receiued, except it be in certaine cases of necessitie, where the parties can not obteine the externall rse of the appointed element, though they earnestlie desire the same.</hi>

                           <hi>by God himselfe. Thus he saith: Corporis lepram purgare, seu veriùs dicam, haud purgare quidem, sed purgatos proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, Iudaeorum sacerdotibus solis liccbat: at verò nostris sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotibus, non corporis lepram, verùm animae sordes, non dico purgatas probare, sed purgare prorsus concessum cst: Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obrem mco iudicio, qui istos despiciunt contemnuntque, multò sceleratiores ac maiori supplicio digni fuerint, quàm fuerit Dathan vnà cum suis omnibus. That is to saie: To purge the Leprosie of the bodie, or ells to saie as it was in deede, not to purge, but to discerne who were cleane, was graunted onelie to

the Priests of the olde law: but it is fullie graunted to our Priests, not to purge the bodilie lcprosie, nor to snew who are cleaner purged, but vtterlie to purge the verie filth of mans soull. Therefore by my iudgement, whosoeuer doe contemne or despise them, they are much more worthie punishment, then the disobedient Dathan with all his companie. Thus saith this holie Father, with many wordes moe, which were worthie all consideration, and rememberance in this case, if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were not so abundant, that it may not suffer ouer long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in one place, lest iniurie be done to other braunches of the cause, no lesse necessarie to be knowne for full vpholding the truth thereof.</hi>

                        <p>Your argument taken of Christs speaking in the present tense is vaine, and of no force to prooue, that the forgiuenes or reteining of God and man concurre in one instant.

                           </gap> in the former sentence, which is of the present tence proouing Gods forgiuenes to goe before mans declaration thereof. The Master of the sentences is litle behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to you, that doc so flatlie condemne him of error, whereas he did write nothing in this point, which was not commonly receiued in the Church of Rome in his time, and long after. For among the articles <hi>in quibus Magister non tenetur,</hi> there is no fault found with his sentence, of the Priestes power in bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and loosing. <hi>Gratian</hi> also declareth, that learned and religious men in his time, were in diuerse opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about that point and other, concerning this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish sacrament of penance. whereby it appeareth that the sentence which you holde, was not accounted Catholike nor vniuersallie receiued in their times. If <hi>Peter Lumbard</hi> the Master of the sentences was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the sayings of Saint Ierome and S.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:12222:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no reasonable man can conclude. And it is but one onelie saying of S. Augustine that he citeth, not diuers: and not onely out of Augustine and Hierome but out of other writers also, as Ambrose, and Cassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus, and Gratian citeth maniemore: all which you must answere, if you wil take part against the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall posts of poperie, Gratiane, and Lumbard, with all them that take their part. But you thinke one say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chrysostome inough to wipe awaie all their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and reasons, and to prooue <hi>that the priestes of the new lawe doe purge the fitlh of the soull, and not onely declare it to be purged, as the Priestes of the olde lawe did of the leprosie of the body.</hi> The meaning of Chrysostome is, that the Ministers of the Gospell haue power, not onelie to pronounce &amp; declare the penitent sinner to be deliuered from the vncleanes of his soule, vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, that he may be accepted into the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he haue bene excluded: but to assure the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents conscience in Gods name, of the remission of their sinnes, wherein he doth much more for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his soule, then the priest of the olde law, who onelie declared vnto other men how the partie was to be taken, who knew in himselfe whether he were sicke or healed, before he came to the priest. Therefore where Chrysostome saith, <hi>It is graunted vnto the priests of the new testament, not onelie to trie &amp; approoue the soule to be deliuered of the filihines thereof, but altogether to deliuer it,</hi> he meaneth of deliuering by assuring the conscience of the penitent sinner of Gods mercie and forgiuenes, whereby he is throughly, or altogether deliuered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from: whereas otherwise it were blasphemous, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rrarie to Chrysostomes iudgement in many other places, if the wholl act of purging or deliuering the soull from filthines were ascribed to man, as the words seeme to sounde.</p>

he hath vsed in all times, both by preaching his worde, and by administring his sacraments, to dispense his misteries vnto the rest of his Church vpon earth: But that <hi>God doth not ordinarilie remit sinnes but by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of the priest, nor any way ells for the moste parte, but by externall acts,</hi> we maruel how you are able to prooue it, seeing God often times vseth many other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then the priests ministerie, to bring men to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and without all waies of externall acts or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, to assure men of the remission of their sinnes by faith.

And so surelie, doe Gods ministers holde this power and preheminence, that no power or dignitie of man could euer be so well warranted and approoued by Gods owne worde, and practize of all ages and nations christened, as this is. All the Princes in earth, though they reigne full righteouslie, can not yet shew the tenth part of the euidence, that Gods priests can doe, for their title of remission of sinnes: and it booteth not mee in this my base state to admonish them, though I hartelie wish they would consider it, that the contempt of spirituall iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and the dignitie of priesthoode, salleth at length to the difobedience of all temporal power, and wicked contempt of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil gouernement also: as in these disordered daies, we may to our great griefe beholde, when, vnder pretence of religion and Gods worde, whereof they haue no more respect surelie then the Deuil him selfe hath they haue disobeied not onelie Peters keies, but also Cesars sworde: Neither let any man thinke, that, where the bands of conscience, the awe of gods maiestie, the feare of hell and damnation, the hope of heauen and saluation is remooued that there can be any ciuil obedience long. Feare of man is much, flatterie of man is more, but bond of conscience passeth them both.

Which, as it is, for other causes manie, much abhorred of the wantons latelie departed out of the Church, and of some worldlie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes to, that be not so zelouse in following trueth, as they be desirous to know trueth: so it is most lothed and feared, for that in it, there is required a distinct, simple, sincere and plaine confesfion to be made of euerie sinne that is knowne or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected to be mortall, vnto a Priest, which is the lawfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the same Sacrament, with such diligent and exact ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of our consciences, as a matter of such importance doth of reason require. This is the great offence and staie, that the weaklings of Christes Church do so earnestlie respect: and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:12222:298" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so long they shall be vexed and molested in minde with the sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er remembrance thereof, as they do not prooue the sweete, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and incomparable effect ensueing most assuredlie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so long shall they stumble at so small a straw, as they do not feele the burden of sinne, feare the paines of hell, follow the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of conscience, foresee the dreadfull daie of iudgement: so long shall they be bashfull to submit them selues, to one mans most close, secret, meeke and merciful iudgement, as they feare not the infinite shame, open horrible confusion, and euerlasting rebuke before God, Angell, man, and Deuill, at the seat and sentence that shall be pronounced in the face of all creatures, which must fall to them, that close vp vnder couer and compas of their conscience, such a number of manifold sinnes, whereof in that daie both account and confession must be made, to their vttermost confusion. Finally, so long shal mans will and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted nature disobey Gods ordinance heerein, as he earnestlie and humbly seeketh not by praier at Christes handes the grace and gift of obedience and repentance. Fot as the fulfilling of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of Gods commaundements cannot otherwise be had, but by his speciall fauour, so saith Saint Augustine, or, as some thinke rather, Fulgentius: Firmissime tene, &amp; nullatenus du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi>

But now you are as drie as a kixe, and as barren of proofe as a pumisse stone of water. There be many other causes then you alledge, why popish shrift is so burthenous. And the principall cause is, because it is a tradition of man, to clogge the conscience with intollerable seruitude. And in stead of al the causes of the contempt thereof, that you alledge, so long shall euerie Christian man despise your auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar confession, as any thing necessary required of him, vntill you be able out of the holie scriptures, inspired of God, to prooue that it is such an ordinance of God, as you in many wordes to no purpose doe bragge of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you bring forth the worde of God to prooue it.

For I dare be bolde to saie, that, as since the time that our Sauiours wordes tooke place: Nisi quis renatus fuerit,</hi> Except a man be borne againe of water and the holie Ghost, he can not enter into the kingdome of heauen, <hi>that as since these words no man can be saued without baptisme: so likewise since Christ spake these wordes,</hi> Whose sinnes you do forgiue, they be forgiuen, <hi>I dare saie neuer man was saued, nor can be saued, that either contemneth or neglecteth confession, or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie seeketh not for it, if he fall in relapse of deadlie crimes
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:12222:300" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after his baptisme. I will speake it plainlie, because I would haue it thought on earnestlie. As no man ordinarilie can be saued without baptisme, so can no man that euer after baptisme committeth deadlie sinne, be saued without sacramentall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, or the earnest desire and seeking for the same.

For whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer God worketh his giftes and grace among men, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ordinarie meanes appointed for the purpose, it is great sinne to seeke for the same eitherwithout it, or to presume to haue it at Gods handes, otherwise then he hath prescribed: But the sacrament of penance, and confession made to the priest, is the appointed meanes that God vseth in his Church for remission of mortall sinnes: therefore whosoeuer thinketh to haue remission immediatly at Gods hand, he shall first be voide of his purpose, and then further be charged of high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and contempt of his will and ordinance. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of originall sinner as properly pertaineth to God, as of mortall sinner: yet because Christ hath instituted a sacrament, as an instrument &amp; meanes to conuey that singular benefit to man, he that would now claime the same immediatly at Gods owne hand, and therefore neglecteth the sacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, or would minister it to him selfe, without the Priests of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he should neuer obtaine remission of his originall sinne, but adde to that high persumption and disobedience of gods commaundement, which of it selfe without originall sinne were damnable.</hi>

And yet we derogat nothing from Christes ordinances, and sacraments, by which he worketh effectuall assurance of the same. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ministerie of the Apostles, and their lawful successours, for the remission and retaining of sinnes, both by preaching, and by ministering of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, instituted by our sauiour Christ. But we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and dare stand to the deniall, with all the papists that hath beene, are, or shalbe, that popish penance, and confession, is anie sacrament, of our sauiour Christes institution: for he that said, <hi>whose sinnes you forgiue, forgiuen be they,</hi> hath not said, whosoeuer will haue his sinnes forgiuen by you, must haue some penance by you inioyned, for satisfaction of Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: yea there is nothing more contrarie to forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes then satisfaction made by the partie to whome sinnes should be forgiuen. And he that said, <hi>confesse your offences one to another, and praie one for an other, that you maie be healed,</hi> saith no where, confesse all your sinnes vnto a Priest, that you may be saued: but willeth a mutuall acknoledgeing, and reconciliation of one Christian man to another, where there hath bin anie trespasse of such offences, as one man hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against another, and a mutuall acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our sinfullnes one to another, that we may be sturred vp to mutuall praier. By which textre the Priest is asmuch bounde to shriue himselfe to his parishioner, as the parishioner to the Priest. But <hi>Origen and Bede</hi> are alledged, to prooue that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle meaneth not onlie of such acknowledgeing, nor so

But yet let vs examine what your authorities doe containe. First Origen in the place by you cited, speaketh not a word of this text, confesse your offences one to another, but only of the two verses going before. For, making <hi>seauen meanes of remitting of sinnes,</hi> after his corrupt, &amp; vnpure manner of teaching, <hi>By baptisme, by martyrdome, by almes, by forgiueing one another, by conuerting of sinners, by aboundance of charitie,</hi> he addeth the seauenth in these wordes; <hi>Est adhuc &amp; septima, licet dura, &amp; labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosa, perpaenitentiam, remissio peccatorum, cum lauat pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator in lachrimis stratum suum, &amp; fiunt ei lachrima suae pánes die &amp; nocte.

There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth yet the seauenth, kinde of remission of sins, although it be verie harde, and painfull by repentance, When the sinner washeth his bed in teares, and his teares are made vnto him breade daie and night, and when he is not ashamed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his sinne to the Priest of the Lorde, and to seeke medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine acording to him which saith, I haue said, I will pronounce against my selfe my owne vnrighteousnes vnto the Lord, and thou hast forgiuen me the vngodlines of my heart. In which also that is fullfilled which the Apostle saith, if anie man be diseasedl, et him call the Elders of the Church, &amp; let them lay
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:12222:303"/>
hands vpon him, anoynting him with oile, in the name of the Lord, and the praier of faith shall saue the diseased, and if he shalbe in sinnes, they shalbe forgiuen vnto him.</hi> Thus much writeth Origen. Now it is to be vnderstood, that after his manner, he alligorizeth vpon the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the lawe, comparing these meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to them. And lest you should thinke that by declaring of sinne to the Priest of the Lord, he doth meane confession to a popish priest, he himselfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth before, whom he meaneth by this Priest. <hi>In morali loco potest pontisex isse esse sensus pietatis &amp; religionis videri, qui in nobis per orationem &amp; obsecrationes, quas Deo fundimus, velut quodam sacerdotio fungitur. In morall place, this high Priest may seeme to be the sense of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; religion, which within vs by praiers and supplications, which we powre forth to God, exerciseth, as it were a certaine priesthood.</hi> And so likewise he taketh the place of Saint Iames alligoricallie, as his application of the seauenth waie of remission vnto the Iudaicall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, doth declare. <hi>Si autem in amaritudine fletus fueris, luctu, lachrimis, &amp; lamentatione confect us, si carnem tuam maceraueris, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But if thou hast bene in the bitternes of weeping, consumed with sorowe, teares and lamentation, if thou hast afflicted thy slesh and made it drie with fasting, and much abstinence, and said, my bones are fried, as a frying pane, or a fire thing, then knowe that thou hast offered in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice flower, of the frying panne, or of the gredeyorn.</hi> Origen therefore giueth a colour in words, but no substance in matter, vnto this popish confession. Concerning the opinion, and authoritie of Bede touching this matter, I haue spoken before, but by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the letter, you saie it <hi>may well appeere, that the Apostle speaketh of sacramentall confession to be made to gods priests.</hi> How so, I praie you? forsooth, <hi>Because he had there
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:12222:304"/>
willed them to send for the Priestes of the Church, to anoynt them, and streight after addeth this text of confession, and praying ouer the sicke.</hi> A simple reason god wot, because priests were spoken of in an other matter, therefore none but priests may be vnderstoode in that which followeth: nay rather the circumstances make against auricular confession, and popish anointing also. For what needes more priests then one to be sent for, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of those popish purposes, or what papist send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for more, although there be neuer so manie priests in the Church. But the companie of elders in the primitiue Church, being chosen of the moste repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with heauenly graces, that were in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both for the gift of healing, &amp; for praier to be made ouer the sick man, were most conuenient to be sent for. But it is in vaine by couller of anie circumstances, to restraine the confession to priestes, when the verie wordes of the letter (as you call the text) doe make it generall, and mutual: and therefore here was no cause for Luther to denie the authoritie of the epistle, or for anie other to corrupt the text. But where you count it a corruption, <hi>to writ in stead of, send for the priestes of the Church, this, call for the Elders of the congregation,</hi> you doe either abuse the ignorant of willfull malice, to make them thinke the sounde of words being changed, the sense is anie thing altered, or else you ignorantlie quarell about the translation, which is word for word out of the originall greeke into English, as no man meanelie learned in that tongue can doubt. It is not the sounde of the wordes you rehearse that troubleth vs, for we both like, and vse them in their right sense our selues, but it sufficeth you to haue an accidentall sounde, when you cannot sinde a substantiall reason of your popish ceremonies, and sacraments, in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie scriptures.</p>

In this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the other two that follow, it is intreated as well of that part of penance that is called confession of the mouth and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the worke, as of other partes. And therefore it is to be seene, when confession of the mouth was instituted: whether<pb n="228" facs="tcp:12222:306"/>
it be necessarie, or onelie voluntarie. How it is to be made, and to whome &amp; when: Some say it was instituted in paradise imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after sin committed, when the Lord saide vnto Adam, Adam, where are thou? for therefore he enquired, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing his sinne, a forme of confessing should be giuen to others afterwarde. But because in that confession the Lord secmed not so expresselie to haue warned him to confession, therefore he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired afterward of Cain, the murtherer of his brother, more expresselie, where is Abel thy brother? Other say, it was first instituted vnder the law, where Iosua commaunded Achar to confesse his fault, and he was stoned, 45. di. sed &amp; illud. Other saie, that it was instituted in the new Testament by Saint Iames saying, confesse your sinnes, &amp;c. But it is better to saie, that it was institutad by a certaine vniuersal tradition of the Church, rather then by authoritie, out of the new or olde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. And the tradition of the Church is of authoritie to binde, as it is commaunded (ar. 11. di.) in these things. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confession in mortal sinnes is necessarie with vs, but not with the Greekes, because such tradition hath not flowed vnto them. Like as they make not the sacrament, in vnlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened bread, but in leauened, 5. di. 1. cap. si. Therefore that saying of Iames, confesse your sinnes one to an other, was at the first but of counsel, or els is should binde the Greekes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the custome.</hi> That which followeth, in the glosse, <hi>that confession in some case may be made to a laie man,</hi> which also both Gratian &amp; Lumbard doe holde, &amp; that which Bede writeth <hi>of confession of sins to euery man,</hi> doth prooue that confessio to a priest is not of Christs institution by their iudgement. For if it were, it ought to be of all, &amp; euery sin, as wel as of those you cal mortall, to a priest onelie. For if Christ instituted a sacrament in these words, <hi>whose sins you forgiue,</hi> &amp;c. and ordeined a priest mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister thereof, by no other meanes, but by hearing a sin ners particular confession, as you seeme to holde, what reason is there, that a laie man should be a hearer of confession, or an absoluer, or that any sin, be it neuer so small, should not be confessed?</p>

                           <hi>And that is yet more euident by the second parte of Christes sentence, where he saith:</hi> whose sins you do reteine, they be <note place="margin">Hilar. super hunclocu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> reteined. <hi>The which worde retinere, by Saint Hilarie signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, non soluere, or non remittere: to reteinis as much as not to loose, or not to forgiue. Whercupon, by Christes expresse wordes, it ensueth, that whose sinnes the priest doth not forgiue, they be not forgiuen, and therfore, that euerie man beeing guiltie of deadelie sinne in his conscience, is subiect to the priests iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the plaine tearmes of Christs owne wordes. Mary we must well note, that the priest hath in other sacraments, and namelie in Baptisme, a right in remitting sinnes both originall and actuall, but there, in the graund pardon of all that is past, he is not made a iudge, or a corrector: because the Church can not practize iudgement or exercise discipline vpon the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, for any things done before they came iinto the householde, and therfore can appoint the party no penance nor punishment, nor binde him according to the diuersitie and number of his faultes, nor can make search exactlie of all his secres sinnes by him committed, that the sentence may proceede according to the parties desertes, but onelie vpon his seeking that sacrament</hi>

And therefore, mens sinnes must in this case be knowne, with diuersitie of their kindes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, by diuersitie of place, time, person, number, and intent. For withoout this particular intelligence, can neither the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed iudges of our soules doe iustice, nor the penitent receiue iustice for his offences. Therefore it is euident, that seeing this
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:12222:307"/>
holie order is authorized not onelie to remit sinnes generallie, as in Baptisme, but also placed with all power ouer vs as the iudges of our sinnes, we must needes by force of Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be driuen to acknowledge and confesse all our sinnes to the Priest, so sitting in iudgement vpon the examination of our conscience.

                        <p>Although to reteine is somewhat more then not to loose, or not to forgiue, yet the conclusion is true, that whose sinnes the minister of the Gospell doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue, of them that heare the Gospell, they are not forgiuen. But herofit doth not follow, that euerie man is bound to shriue himselfe to the priest.

lesse, whensoeuer you dare goe about it. As touching <hi>the difference</hi> you shew <hi>betwixt the priests office, in remitting sins by Baptisme and penance,</hi> it standeth altogether vpon your owne surmise, without any authoritie of the holie scriptures: For the minister of the ghospelis made as much a iudge, whome to admit and whome to refuse from the sacraments, as he is to pronounce, whose sins be forgiuen, and whose reteined.

And this court of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, we acknowledge to be the seat, and court of Christ, where no priest or other mortal man hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to sit and iudge.

                           <hi>Moreouer the sacrifices of the olde law were in manie cases done by the Priestes, as well for priuate sinnes as open; which could not be without the confession of the penitent:</hi> ergo, <hi>much more the secrets of our soules be subiect to our Priestes, to whom Christ hath giuen all iudgement. Yet all this notwithstanding there be some that keepe them-selues by vaine excuse of sinne, from the verie principall point and pith of this sacrament, which is the particuler examination of a mans sinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thought, word, or worke, and will yet draw back, and holde, that a generall confession is enough with tearmes vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall, acknowledgeing a mans selfe to haue sinnes by minde, word, and deede, though he expresse not the seuerall pointes thereof. But this opinion is confuted, both by all the fore said reasons, and other, as a moste absord and wilfull mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of sinne. For by this rule, he that killed and murdered thousandes, should confesse no more after his wicked actes then before, nor no more then the innocentest man that liueth. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids weeping and confession should haue beene one after his double deadlie sinne committed, as before in his innocencie. Peter should not haue more bitterlie went after his for saking of his master, then before. Neither should our confession then pertaine more to our selues then to other, who by like generall clauses maie truelie make the like and the same confession, as it is now in the Church of England. But the holie King Dauid confessed not sinnes common to him selfe and other men, but</hi> my sinne, my wickednes, my impietie, <hi>saith he, and this in confessing to God that know alreadie his sinnes: How much more now, where Gods iudgement is exercised by man, that can not discerne our faultes him selfe, must we confesse our sinnes, that he maie rightlie iudge thereof?</hi>

                           <hi>Penance must be donne for euery of our sinnes. So Peter prescribed</hi> Simon <hi>the sorcerer, when he attempted to haue bought the gift of Goddes Spirit, that he should doo penance for that especiall greeuous crime: Poenitentiam age,</hi> saith he, <hi>ab hac nequitia tua,</hi> Doe penance for this thy wicked <note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> attempte, if perchaunce God will forgiue thee this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable intent. <hi>The man was baptised not long before, and then no such Penance was prescribed for his most gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and blasphemous practises of Nicromancie and witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafte long exercised before. Wherein this naughty pack</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>is a thousand partes more religious then our newe maisters. For he desired the Apostles to pray to God for him, that this sinne might be forgiuen him: where these care no more for the priest or Apostle, concerning their sinnes, then they doo for dogges Againe, Saint Paule did not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse his sinnes by a generall clause, but acknowledged his owne sinnes, wherein he in his owne person had offended, he confessed

he was of al sinners the greatest, that he had obteined commission to attache them that beleeued in Christes name, and so forth.</hi>

Peter prescribed Simon Magus, that he should do penance for that greeuous crime: Therfore penance must be done for eucrie of our sinnes.</hi> Although the antecedent were true, yet the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is naught penance must be done for one open and hainous sinne, <hi>ergo,</hi> for all secret sinnes. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that anie such penance as you meane, was enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto him by Peter.

We know that in the next world God will haue an account of al our misdeeds, euen to our idle words &amp; thoughts, &amp; therfore our wholl life ought to be a continuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and profession of repentance, &amp; yet we know by his word and assurance ofhis spirit, that the same infinit multitude &amp; heape of our sinnes shal not be laid to our charge, because out sauiour Christ is the lambe of God that hath taken them awaie, and satisfied the iustice of God for them.</p>

For to attempt to receiue the holie bodie of Christ before we haue in contrite manner confessed our selues, and purged our consciences, by the iudgement of Christes Church, of the guilt of deadlie sinne, is exceeding damnable to vs, and much dishonour to Christes owne person. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and iudging of mans selfe, to be meant by the diligent dif cussing of our consciences, sinnes, and misdeedes, by contrition and confession of them to our ghostlie Father, the practise of the Church doth most plainlie prooue, which neuer suffered any greeuous sinner to communicat, before he had called him selfe to a reckning of his sinnes, before the minister of God, and so iudged him selfe, that he receiue not to his damnation that, which to euery worthy person is his life and saluation.

For in that place, Chrysostome sheweth how much more difficult the office of a spirituall shepard is, then the charge of a bodely herdman, by this, that the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perd of vnresonable sheepe may both see the diseases of his cattell, and also compell them to take his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines and diet: but the spirituall shepheard cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies see with what diseases his flocke are infected, neither can he compell them, but must exhort them, willinglie to submit them selues to his cure, whereby he meaneth his doctrine of admonition, reprehension, and such like. But because you make mention of a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and doe not expresse it, and yet excuse Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome thereby in any thing that he hath written, soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding against the necessitie of confessing before men, of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:12222:316"/>
sinnes committed in secret: as though he durst not fullie set downe his iudgement thereof before the peo ple. I will set forth the storie as it is reported, by the Ecclesiasticall writers, <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomenus. Socrates, L. 5. C. 19.</hi> writeth thus. <hi>About the same time it was thought good, to take awaie those elders or priests of the Churches, which were appointed ouer publike repentance, vpon such cause. Since the time that the Nouatians were deuided from the Church, for that they would not communicate with them, that had fallen in the persecution, that was vnder Decius, the Bishops of the Church added vnto the Ecclesiastical canon or rule, a certeine priest or elder which should be ouer them that repented, that they which were fallen after baptisme, should confesse their sinnes before this appointed priest. And this rule holdeth still vnto this time in other sects. Onelie they that holde Christ to be of the same substance with his father, and the Nouatians which agree with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this faith, haue reiected this priest appointed ouer them that repent. The Nouatians in deede at the first, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued not this additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But they which now hold the Churches, hauing obserued it for a long time vnder Nectarius, haue changed it, by occasion of this matter that happened in the Church. A certeine noble woman came to the priest appointed for repentance, and made particular confession of those sinnes she had committed after baptisme: the priest charged this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to fast and praie cominuallie, that with her confession she might shew forth the worke that was meete for repentance. But the woman proceeding accused her selfe of another offence, for she declared that a certaine Deacon of the Church had line with her. This being declared, caused the Deacon to be cast out of the Church, but a tumult was raised among the priests: for they were sore greeued, not onelie with that which was done, but also because this fact tended greatlie to the slaunder and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melie of the Church. So while cleargie men were in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch for these thinges, a certaine blessed elder of the Church borne at Alexandria gaue in councell to the Bishop Nectarius, to take awaie this priest, that was appointed ouer repentance and to permit euerie man according to his owne conscience to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:12222:316"/>
be partaker of the mysteries. For by that meanes onelie, he should haue the Church voide of slaunder. These thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I heard my selfe of that blessed man, I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vnto this writing. For as I haue often said, I haue giuen all diligence to learne of euerie man that knew these matters, and exactlie to search them out, that I might write nothing beside the truth. But I saied vnto Eudemon or that blessed man: your counsell, Sir, hath, brought into the Church God knoweth what or no. But I see that you haue giuen occasion, that one should not reprehend an others sinnes, nor to obserue that precept of the Apostle, which saieth: Communicate not with the vnfruitfull workes of darkenes, but rather reprooue them.</hi> But of these matters sufficient. <hi>Sozomenus, Lib. 7. Cap. 16.</hi> reporteth the matter after this manner. <hi>About this time Nectarius, which gouerned the Church of Constantinople, was the first that would no longer permit that priest, which was appointed for them that repented. And him followed al most al other Bishops. Now, this matter what it is, or whence it began, or for what cause it ceased, diuerse men report diuerselie. I will declare what I thinke. For seeing not to sinne at all, it is a matter more diuine, then agreeable to mans nature, and that God hath commaunded to graunt pardon to them that repent, although they offend often times, and in refusing to confesse sinnes, the debt groweth more burthenous, as it is like, it was thought good among the priestes of olde time, that as it were in an open thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vnder the witnesse of the multitude of the Church, men should declare their sinnes. And for this purpose they appointed a priest or elder of the best conuersation, continent of speach, &amp; wise, to whome they came which had sinned, and confessed such things as they had committed in their life. And he according to euerie mans sin, after he had appointed a mulct what he ought to doe, or to abide, absolued them, when they had performed their penaltie by themselues. But as for the Nouatians, which made no account of repentance, needed not this matter. But in other sects of heretikes, it is obserued euen vntill this time. And it is diligintlie obserued in the westerne Churches, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie in the Church of the Romans. For there is a certein open
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:12222:317"/>
place appointed, for them that are in exercise of repentance For they stand with heauie cheere and as it were sorowing. And when the seruice of God is ended, being not made partakers of those things, that are lawfull for the holie ones, with weeping &amp; lamentation, they cast themselues downe flat vpon the earth: the Bishop beholding them, runneth to them weeping and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise falling vpon the earth, the wholl multitude of the Church is then filled with mourning and weeping. Then first the Bishop riseth vp, and lifteth vp the sinners that lie on the ground, &amp; after he hath praied as it is meetes for the penitents that haue sinned, he dismisseth them. Then euerie one of them willinglie afflicting himselfe, either with fastings, or abstine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or certein meats, or with other things that are enioyned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth a seaso, so long as the Bishop hath appointed vnto him. And at the time appointed, after he hath payed, as it were a certaine debt, he is released of the punishment of fin, and com meth into the congregation with the rest of the people. These things the priests of Rome obserue euen vntill our daies. But in the Church of Constantinople, the priest or elder that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ouer the penitent, did exercise that office, vntill a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein noble woman, being appointed by the priests to fast, and pray to God for those sinnes which she had declared, while she continued in the Church, for this purpose, confessed that shee had committed fornication with a Deacon, whereof the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude hauiug vnderstanding, was sore greeued, for defiling the Church, and it was an exceeding great slaunder vnto the whol cleargie. Nectarius beeing in doubt how to handle this matter, that had happened, first depriueth the fornicator of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie. And beeing counselled by certein men, to permit euerie man, as his conscience serued him, and as he might be bolde, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate the mysteries, he caused the priest to giue ouer that was appointed for repentance, and from that time this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome taking holde, hath hetherto continued. Now I thinke the auncient grauitie and precisenes, hauing begon by litle and litle to fall awaie, into a diuerse and negligent custome, seeing before, as I suppose, the offences were lesse, both through shame of them which declared their owne trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:12222:317"/>
&amp; through the precisenes of them that were appointed iudges in this case. And for the same cause I gather that the Emperour Theodosius prouiding for the good name &amp; grauitie of the Churches, made a law that women should not be admmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ministerie of god, except they had children, and were aboue threescore yeares old, according to the expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Apostle, and to expell out of the Churches, those women that were shorne in the head, &amp; to depriue such Bishops from their Bishoppricke, which did admit any such women.</hi> The storie beeing as I haue set it forth, out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte of the Ecclesiasticall writers, now let vs see how sincerely you handle the matter, and report thereof at your pleasure. First you say, that <hi>Nectarius made the state of penance more free, then before:</hi> where as by the storie it is plaine, that he toke awaie altogether that publique forme, and triall of repentance, leauing euerie man to his conscience. Secondlie, you saie, <hi>the people tooke such occasion of libertie, that they were loth to confesse, or doe iust penance for their sinnes at all.</hi> It is not vnlike that the wicked sort, as they abuse all Christian libertie, so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left to the examination of their owne conscience, whereunto the scripture leaueth them, would be more dissolute: But the godly being deliuered from such a burthenous &amp; vnnecessarie ceremonie and custome, would neuerthelesse confesse their sinnes before God, and be truelie penitent, and hartelie sorie for the same. Thirdlie you saie, <hi>Nectarius, neuer meant to take awaie that whole order, wherein he had no authoritie.</hi> But that he toke it wholie awaie, the storie is plaine, and that he had authoritie in an order, and decree of the Church, first made against the Nouatians, which was subiect to mutation, Socrates doth declare. And So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomene reporteth the consent, &amp; imitation, of all the Catholike Bishoppes of the East, which they, it is not like, would haue yealded vnto, if it had beene as you say, an institutio of shrist. <hi>That it was not alowed of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the storie Sozomenus,</hi> it is a small matter, seing it was
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:12222:318" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alowed of so many hundred bishops for so manyyeares before him, that were better deuines then he, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you saie vntruly, <hi>that it was but one mans doubtfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, &amp; but one bishops compelled act,</hi> which was alowed of all the Bishops of the East, &amp; followed. <hi>But if it were good,</hi> you saie, <hi>it maketh nothing against priuat shrift,</hi> yes verily. for a thousand times greater inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience hath come by auricular confession, then the abusing of one gentlewoman. To omit all other, the storie is famous and fresh in memorie, within these few yeares, when the Inquisitors in Spaine, charged al honest women &amp; matrons that had beene sollicited by their ghostlie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnto adulterie, to confesse the same before them, how the holie house was pestred with accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and how full the streates were of women repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the holie house, to declare the abuse of confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against their ghostlie fathers. Wherfore if one such a fact, as the old storie reporteth, were thought a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause vnto all the godlie and learned Bishops of the East, to abolish that vnnecessarie order &amp; custome, of confessing and doeing open penance in the Church for secret faults, how much more so many &amp; so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full abuses as haue ensued of this eare shrift, ought to haue mooued the Church of God in these dates, to put awaie the necessitie thereof: that I speake nothing of the vngodlie opinions that are helde therof, to the snare of mens consciences, which make it alltogether intollerable. Last of all, where you alledge <hi>the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize of all Churches christianed</hi> to the contrarie, how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true it is, the verie storie is plaine, and the custome of the Greeke Churches confessed by Gratian not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this kinde of confession, as beeing onelie a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue decree of men, no necessarie institution of God.</p>

For how could be know, that they did not make confession to man, as we now know that no heretike maketh, confession, neither lamenteth, neither doth penance for his sinnes, because they haue remooued the way of Gods Church, wherebie such things had wont to be done.

                        <p>Whosoeuer list to read that booke, shall finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the worlde, to prooue his iudgement, for the necessitie of auricular confession, but rather who so list to see Chrysostomes iudgement of the necessitie of shrift, let him consider what we haue cited out of his writings in the last section. For in this place by you ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he speaketh not of confession, but of the difficulty of a Priests office, as I haue shewed before, to exact more knowledge, and diligence of them, because it is harder to be a shepheard of men, then of beastes. For the diseases of beastes maie moste commonlie be seene, and they compelled to take the remedie: the diseases of men are harde, and sometimes impossible to be knowne, and no waie either to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell men to discouer them, or to receiue medicine for
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:12222:321" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them. Whereas, if confession were a necessarie institu tion of God, he might haue aptlie brought it forth in this place, to shew what waie the spirituall shephearde hath, to vnderstand the diseases of his sheepe. His wordes are these, after he hath spoken of the bodelie shephearde and his sheepe. <hi>But the diseases of man first it is not easie for a man to see. For no man knoweth those things that perteine to man, but the spirit of man which is within him. How wherefore should a man vse a medicine for that disease, the manner whereof he knoweth not: yea manie times he cannot know whether a man be sicke. But when that is made manifest, he hath more dissicultie about him. For he can not heale all men, with so great power, as the shephearde doth his sheepe. For there he may binde him, restraine him of meate, burne him, cut him. But here the power to receiue health, lieth not in him that offereth the medicine, but in the sicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For this that wonderfull man saw, when he saide to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, not that we are Lordes of your faith, but we are hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of your ioye. And moste of all it is not required in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians by force to reforme the transgressions of them that sinne. But the forreine iudges when they take malefactors vnder the lawes, doe shew great power ouer them, and restreine them, against their will, to vse the same manners. But here not by compulsion, but by perswasion, we must make such a one better: for there is no such power giuen vs by the laws to restreine sinnes, neither if the lawes gaue such power, haue we where to vse it, seeing God crowneth not them which of necessitie ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from wickednes, but them that voluntaryly refraine from it. Therfore there is neede of great cunning, that they which are sicke may be perswaded willingly to submit themselues vnto the healing of the Priestes.</hi> Thus much Chrysostome, nothing fauouring the necessitie of auricular confession, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denying any means, wherby the inward disease of a man may be knowne, except it be by voluntarie &amp; not extorted co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession.

Augustine, vntil he did acknowledge his fault, and shew him selfe penitent. Therefore his saying can not be drawne to the necessitie of auricular shrift. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Chrisostome, vpon the 20. of Iohn, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare anie iudgement or opinion, that he thought it necessarie, for a man to shriue himselfe to a Priest. And where you vrge his wordes, <hi>that the Priest doth lend his voice and his hands,</hi> it is to farre of to prooue, that it is necessarie for euery man to confesse al his secret faults to a Priest. But I will set downe all that he saith, in that place, least anie man which hath not, or can not vnderstand the booke, may suspect there is further matter contained thererein, toward this purpose then in deed there is. <hi>Magna enim dignit as sacerdotum, Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumoun<expan>

Wherefore Paule saide, Obey your gouernours, and be subiect to them, that you maie doe them the greatest honour. For thou lookest to thine owne matter, which if thou hast well ordered, there is none other charge laide vpon the.

Of what excuse are these thinges worthie, when we se not a beame in our owne eye, and iudge so seuerelse, a mote in our neighbours eye? Doest thou not know, that thou prescribest to thy selfe a more heauie iudgement, when thou so iudgest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? This I saie, not that I allowe vnworthie persons to be taken into the priestes office, but hauing compassion and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: For they are not therefore to be iudged by their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, although they liue euillie, and vitiouslie. But if thou looke well to thy selfe: thou shalt not affend end in anie'thing that is committed to them. For if he made an Asse to speake, and gaue spirituall blessinges by a southsayer, and wrought in a dumbe mouth, and the vncleane tongue of Balaam, for the stumbling Iewes: much more for you that be faithfull, although the priests be naught, God shall persorme all thinges by them, and send his holie spirite: for a pure minde doeth not therefore loose his purenes, but grace worketh all things. for all are yours, saith he, whether it be Paule or Apollo, or Cephas. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the priest goeth about, it is the gift of God alone, and when he exerciseth mans wisdome, his grace appeereth lesse.

But the father, the sonne, and the holie ghost, doeth all things. The priest giueth his tongue, and his handes, for it is not iust, that for malice of an other man, they that come to our saluation should be offended. All which thinges considered, let vs both seare God, and greatlie reuerence his priestes, that honour being giuen both to our workes, and to them, we maie receiue great reward of God, by the grace and goodnes of our Lorde Iesus Christ, to whome with the father and the holie ghost be glorie for euer, and euer.

And he alledgeth more, that penance was vsed, &amp; speciall sorowfulnes for sinnes with some kinde of confession of sinnes in baptisme, how much more then must we now vse the same, where it is more required, &amp; where Christ hath instituted a Sacrament to that end, to remit suines committed by relapse after Baptisme.</hi>

                           </gap>. <hi>He that is willing to confesse his sinnes, whether ought be to confesse them to all men, whatsoeuer they be, or to certain men.</hi> By which question it is manifest that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession was not necessary but voluntarie. But <hi>if anie man will make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> S. Basill saith, <hi>he ought to do it to them, to whome the dispensation of Gods mysteries is committed. For so they which repented of olde time, are found to haue done, vnto the holie men: for it is written in the Gospell, that they confessea' their sins to Iohn the Baptist: &amp; in the Actes of the Apostles, all men confessed to them, by whome they were baptized.</hi> And we acknowledge as much, that if any man will confesse his secret sinnes, to be partaker of spirituall counsell, and comfort, for quieting of his conscience, he may &amp; ought to confesse the same to them to whome the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of Gods mysteries are committed. But what is this for the necessitie of enumeration of all
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:12222:325"/>
sinnes vnto a priest. The same Basill in the <hi>Hom.</hi> 21. vpon Psal. 37. acknowledgeth in the person of Dauid, confession to God alone to be sufficient, yea the secret groning of the heart, without moouing of lippes, or vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering anie wordes, to suffice. In the 110. question, for which you haue placed question the 100. as there is somewhat to prooue that confession was vsed to the priest or Elder, so there is nothing to prooue, that it was counted necessarie in his daies. The question is this, <hi>whether as at such time a sister maketh confession to an Elder, the Elder women must be present.</hi> This question de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that priestes had not such familiar and secret shriuing of virgines in those daies, as they haue now among the papists. S. Basils answer is this. <hi>The confession shal be made more decentlie, and more reuerentlie, by the Elder woman vnto the Elder man, which is able wiselie to set downe the forme of repentance &amp; reformation.</hi> This answer decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that Saint Basell would not haue yong women to shriue them selues at all, vnto the Priest, but that if anie thing troubled their conscience, which they were disirous to vtter, they should first expresse it to an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient woman, and she should make report thereof to the Priest, as in the colledges of virgines he prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it moste conuenient, to be done by the matrone or Elder woman, that had the ouersight of the yonge sisters: and in the next question he affirmeth, <hi>that the said Elder woman, or gouernesse hath iust cause to be angrie with the Priest, if he appoint anie thing to be done by the sisters, that are vnder her charge, without her knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> Whereby he declareth plainelie that he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that priestes should heare the secret confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such yonge women, or appoint them anie pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, without the knowledge of their gouernesse. <hi>That men ought to make good choise of them to whome they wil confesse their secret offences,</hi> it prooueth not that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is necessarie, whereupon we stand, or that it was accounted necessarie in Saint Basills daies. <hi>That

Iohn Baptist made a preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to shrift,</hi> it is a fond dreame, when you your selfe acknowledge, that your sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath no place in them that are not babtized. <hi>That the institution of Christ doth include an exact confession of euerie sinne to the Priest,</hi> you can neuer be able to prooue.

                        <p>This Nicephorus is too late a Greeke writer, that we should approoue his iudgement, for the necessitie or perpetuall practise of auricular confession. Againe there is nothing but a fragment of an Epistle remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by which we cannot thoroughlie gather what his iudgement was. But this is manifest in him, that men ought no more to confesse them selues to an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned man, then in sicknes to take counsell of one that is ignorant in phisike. Againe he saith not (as you report,) that once al men came, &amp; confessed their sinnes to Bishopes. But he gathered vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission graunted to Bishoppes, by those wordes, which were spoken to Peter, <hi>whatsoeuer thou shalt binde, shalbe bound, and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose, shalbe loosed:</hi> that <hi>olim omnes oportehat ad ipsos pontifices accedere, suaque illis occulta prodere, &amp; sic vel reconciliationem, vel repudium fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.

                           <hi>These therfore and manie other do testifie for their Church, in what solemne vse sacramentall confession hath euer beene. Wherein we haue the lesse need to stand long, seeing the same Historie that our aduersaries doe sometime alledge, plainlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, not onelie in the Church of Constantinople, but also in the West Churches, and namelie at Rome, alwaies since</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatus <hi>the Heretikes false opinion touching penance rose, a vertuous Priest, sadde, secret, and wise, was appointed to heare the sinnes of all men, and was called the</hi> Pnitentiarie <hi>then, as he and the like of that office he called yet. We call them</hi> Confessours, <hi>and of olde in Greeke, they were named</hi> Spirituall Masters <hi>or Fathers, as we now terme them in our Mother tongue,</hi> Ghostlie Fathers <hi>also, Quisecundùm vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uscuiusque culpam indicebant &amp; mulctans. Who (saith</hi> Sozomenus) <hi>according to euerie mans fault, prescribed due penance. Which penance though it were often openlie done by the confessours appointment: yet the sinnes were not knowne,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:12222:326"/>
for which the penance was preseribed. For the confession was secret or auricular, as we call it now, as is plaine by the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie (else the Priest of that office should not haue beene char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with secrecie and silence) though the confession sometimes was also open, where the penitents deuotion or desire so requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as it maie be yet. For it is no matter for the substance of the sacrament, whether it be publike or priuate. And it is the condiscending to the peoples weakenesse, that, that should be so secret generallie, which often in olde time hath beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. And yet I think no man was euer compelled by anie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Church, to confesse in the publike face of the Church his sinnes that were committed secretlie. Though in Leo the greathis daies, there was a custome not allowable, that men</hi>

                           <hi>were forced to giue vp a libell openlie of all their sinnes. Which rigorous custome, the said holie father afterward abrogated. Neuerthelesse the penance was of olde often publike, the forme whereof appeareth in Saint Ambrose, in Tertullian, who both</hi>

And long after their daies there were called</hi> Poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, <hi>Penitents, which were barred from the holie communion, &amp; the secrets &amp; soueraigne holie of the blessed mysteries of the Masse, so long as their prescribed penance indured, besides fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, almes, and other like penalties inioyed And especially in Lent time, there were of these deuout publike penitentes, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth by diuerse orders of the seruice in the Church, appointed &amp; agreeing to them, who lightly were separated till the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Lords supper &amp; passion, in the holie daies next before Easter. Whereof yet in most Churches there remaineth a small signe, by discipline giuen to the people with roddes on the same daies. But now these manie yeares, the peoples feablenes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, there is no publike penance giuen nor receiued in the Sacrament, much lesse open confession made of anie secret crimes, the Church being well assured, that this auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession sullie answereth Christes institution, and agreeth also with the often practise of the Primitiue Church herein, though the heretikes, and some of their faulters, as</hi> Beatus Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus,

                        <p>There hath hitherto no ancient writer bin brought, to testifie the necessitie of confession of secret sinnes, nor that there is anie sacrament, whereof such confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion should be part. The storie before remembred te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth of the abolishing of such confession in the Church of Constantinople, but that there was anie such Priest, or confession vsed in the Church of Rome, it maketh no mention, but onelie sheweth that they which did open penance, which was for open offences, for which they were excommunicated, were enioyned an exercise or triall, after the performance whereof they were receiued into the Church againe. As you thinke, <hi>that no man for his sinnes committed secretlie, was compelled to make confession in the publike face of the Church,</hi> so doe I thinke, that no man in those auncient and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times was euer compelled to make anie confession open, or secret, of all his secret faultes committed in thought, word, and deede. <hi>The publike penance</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>Tertullian, Ambrose, Augustine,</hi> was for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like offences. The ridiculous discipline giuen with rodds in the popish Church, by the verie name therof declareth, that it is a mockery of the old discipline, &amp; no signe of anie sacrament of confession. And therfore as yet, nothing is brought to prooue auricular confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of secret sinnes, to be a necessary institution of Christ, or agreeable with the practise of the Primitiue Church, or to disprooue <hi>Beatus Rhenanus,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the same, accusing both the noueltie, and and the tyranie thereof, and the danger that mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences haue beene in through it, beside manie other knowne inconueniences.</p>

In the late Councel of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:12222:328"/>
Florence, I remember nothing decreed of this matter, neither doe you note, where we should finde it. In the Lateran Councell, that was kept litle more then 300. yeares since, the Protestantes doe trulie affirme, that the necessitie of auricular confession was first imposed vpon men, of the Romish Church. For in the councell of Wormes, which you saie was 400 yeares elder, there is neuer a word of confession, or confessor, but of wife consideration to be had of them that did penance, by which are ment open offenders, that did open pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: neither are you able to prooue the contrarie. <hi>Paenitentibue</hi> (saith the Canon) <hi>serundum differentiam peccatorum, &amp;c.

Therefore in giuing penance the Priest ought seuerallie to consider the causer of euerie one, the beginning also &amp; manner of the faulies, and diligentlie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and manifestlie to know the affection and sighings of the offenders, also to consider the qualities of the times, &amp; persons, of the places, &amp; ages: that according to the consideration of the places, ages, or times, or according to the qualitie of the offences, &amp; the groning of euery offendor, he turne not his eies from the holie rules.</hi> Thus sarre the Canon, after which follow the rules of penance to be apointed for diuers kindes of offences: as for him that hath killed a Priest, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane, his parents, or brother or for him that hath slain a man in his madnes, or against his will, and such like, whereby it appeereth that the Canon was made for penance to be enioyned to publike offenders, and not to compell men to confesse their secret sinnes.</p>

By which Councell kept in Constantinople, you maie easelie gather, that neither confession was euer omitted by the lawe, nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Penitentiarie long abrogated out of Constaninople Church.

                        <p>The decree of the Constantinopolitan councell in sense is the same with the former, but not word for word, nay, almoste it hath neuer a word alike. But it is to be vnderstood of publike penitentes, to be bounde, or loosed according to their qualitie of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence &amp; the greatnes of their repentance. The words are these. <hi>It behoueth that they which haue receiued of god the power of loosing and binding, consider the qualitie of the sinne, and the readines of the sinner vnto returning, that so they maie vse a medicine fit for the disease, lest if they should determine of sinne without difference, they should erre from the health of the sick person. For the disease of sinne is not simple, but diuerse and of manie formes, and budding vp with manie hurtfull branches, by which the euill is spred farre and wide, and creepeth so farre, vntill at length it withstandeth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that which healeth. Therefore he that will shew what skill he hath in the spirituall art of healing, must diligentlie search out, how he that hath sinned is affected, whether he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline vnto health, or contrariwise, by those manners to which he is familiarlie accustomed, prouoke the diseased to looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and whether he by him-selfe obeyeth his Master or whether the sore of the minde doth encrease by medicins that are laid to it: and so mercie is to be bestowed by equall measure. For there is great regarde both with God, and with the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this pastorall care, to bring home the wandring sheepe, and to heale it being wounded by the serpent, and neither to thrust it downe by the hedlonges of desperation, nor to loose the raines vnto dissolution of life, and contempt, but by all meanes as well by sharp medicines as by gentle, to withstand and striue, that the sore maie be healed, that he which knoweth the fruites of repentance, maie wiselie gouerne the man, being called vnto that heauenlie glorie. Therefore he ought to know both kindes of medicines, as well them that be of rigor, as them that be of pittie, and not to follow them, which haue taken in hand onelie the vpper face of figures that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:12222:329" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as Saint Basill hath taught vs.</hi> In this Canon there is no worde of confession, or whereby the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of confession maie be inferred vpon all men for their secret offences. Neither can it be prooued that the penitentiarie priest once abrogated by Necta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius was euer restored. The schoolmes opinion we are no more bound to follow in this, then in other pointes of poperie. Saint Bernard alloweth in deede confession made vnto the Priests, and ministers of God, but the necessitie thereof he doth not laie as a clogge on mens consciences. The like I saie of S. Bede, who in the booke and Chapter by you quoted, speaketh of one Adamanus a scot, who hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted some great wickednes in his youth, when he considered the greeuosnes of his fact, was in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust of minde: and <hi>comming to a priest, of whome he hoped that the waie of saluation might be shewed vnto him, he confessed his guiltines, and desired him to giue him counsell how he might auoid the wrath of God that was to come.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner to come to confession, we denie not, but it is most expedient for them that are not quiered in conscience but that al men are bound by this or any other example, to make a perticuler rehersall of their sinnes to a priest, before they can haue remission, Beda neither here, nor els where teacheth.</p>

Tunc enim demum piures ad poenitentiam potuerunt prouocari si populi auribus non publicetur conscientia confitentis. It is enough, that the guilt &amp; offences of mans conscience be opened to the Priests alone in secret confession. For though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of faith be verie laudable, which is content for Gods sake to be ashamed before men, yet because the sinnes of euerie man be not such, that the penitent would gladlie vtter openlie, let so raprobale custome be abolished, lest manie be holden from the remedies of pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whiles either they are ashamed, or feare to open their deedes to their enimes, by whom they might by order of law be punished. For that confession is sufficient, which is made first to God, and then to the Priest also, who will be an intercessour for the sinnes of them that confesse. For then might moe be prouoked to penance, if the secret conscience of the confessed be not published to the eares of the people. Thus saith Saint Leo, a man of that time and credit, as our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would wish. Let them saie now, that priuat confession began in the Lateran Councell, because that thing which euer was counted and vsed as necessarie, was there decreed for the amending of the peoples sloth, to be done euerie yeare once at the lest, before they receiued the blessed sacrament. As tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maie they saie, that the Euchariste and receiuing thereof, was begune in the same Councell, &amp; by the verie same Canon. For as there is charge, that euerie man should be confessed, so there is commaundement giuen, that euerie man shall receiue once a yeare the blessed Sacrament. So litle care they haue, what they saie, so that they saie enough to beguile them, that can skil of nothing.</hi>

                        <p>Yf Saint Gregorie in his pastorall or els where, had written any thing that might but make a face of the necessitie of auricular confession, you would haue set downe some parte of his wordes, or at least quoted the booke, and Chapter: where we might finde them: but in trueth there is no such matter in all that worke conteining three partes and many Chapters, but he teacheth the behauiour of a pastour and preacher to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes alkindes of persons, both in his life, and in his doctrine: of auricular confession neuer a worde. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you fly to Gratians decres, where Gregory in deed is cited for such a matter, but which Gregorie, it doth not appeare, therefore it is more like to be one of the later Gregories, then Gregorie the first: in whose workes long enough you can not shew that sentence: and where you saie, <hi>the priest may not in any case vtter the penitents confession,</hi> the glosse vpon the text is against you, who holdeth <hi>that he may lawfullie reueal it, to auoide excommunication, if the Bishop shall excommunicate all them that are priuie of such a fact.</hi> But Leo in deede speaketh of auricular confession, or at the least of confession made onelie to the priests, not vrging it as necessarie to saluation, nor requiring an exact numbering of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mortall sinne, as the Papists doe, which be the matters we stand vpon, and not whether it be lawfull for men to confesse their offences to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour, which we thinke to be moste expedient for them that are troubled in minde, about them, but not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for all men, nor for all sinnes. The time and credit of Leo, although it be of better account then of his successours, yet it is not such, as wee would wish. For the time had manie corruptions and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions: the person was ouer careful to mainteine the dignitie of his sea, which by litle and litle after him was turned into the seat of Antichrist, and therefore his ambition was controlled by the generall councell of Chalcedon, which made the Bishop of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople

his equall in all primacie of honour and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, although he by his Legates would haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode it: but in vaine: for all the Bishops allowed it, except Lucentius and Pascasius his deputies.

This saieth Paulinus of Saint Ambrose, whereby at once we see the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them both for our matter.</hi>

                        <p>The iudgement of Saint Ambrose concerning the necessitie of popish thrift, or auricular confession, we haue heard before out of his owne writinges. Neither doth Paulinus testifie anie other thing of him: nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing then might be said of Luther and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin, whoe were no friendes of Papisticall confession. For if anie man did confesse vnto them his offences, that he might shew himselfe truelie penitent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue comfort, and counsell for his amendment, no
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:12222:334"/>
doubt but those holie men were greatlie grieued at his fall, which mooued the offendour to greater sorow for his sinne: and yet those faultes, as were discouered to them, being such as might with duetie to God, and the state be concealed, they would neuer vtter to anie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodie. What would this make to prooue, that they saie on confessions like popish Priestes, and required all men vnder paine of damnation to confesse vnto them their secret deadlie sinnes, as pop sh Priests doe. But popish prelates disdaine to doe that which they faine Saint Ambrose to haue done. Manie of them being such for their knoweledge, as you might rather seeke water out of a pumise stone, then the doctrine of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort out of their mouthes, and for their liues and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersations, such as deserue, if there were anie hope of amendment in them, to stand in the Church among open penitents, rather than to sit in the chaires of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and iudgement ouer other men. Wherefore by this citation we neither see the iudgement of Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus nor of saint Ambrose, for your matter of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of auricular confession. For that secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession maie be made in some case we denie not: but that it is necessarie to be made of all deadlie sinnes, that man can remember, you haue not yet prooued.</p>

But they which do not yet offèr themselues to God with so great constancie, nor with so great affection, neither are readie when they come to the seruice of God, to prepare themselues vnto temptation, are saide to be forsaken of God, that is, not to be taught, because they are not prepared to be taught, the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or healing of them without doubt being deferred vnto the time to come: who trulie knowe not what they shall obteine of God, except they come first by desire vnto the obteining of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.

Which thing also we muste thinke of the deuill, which at the first did beleeue that his honours which he had, when he was vndefiled were his owne, and not giuen by God, and that sentence was fulfilled in him which saith, euerie one that exalteth himselfe shalbe be brought lowe.</hi> What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable man out of this discourse woulde gather the necessitie of shrift to a priest, where it is certaine the writer speaketh of the acknowledgeing of our sinnes before God, without which we can obteine no pardon,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:12222:337"/>
or remission of them at his handes, and not of confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to a Priest, as he woulde haue the ignorant reader to surmise. But let vs examine the second place, and see if that be not more plaine, for the necessitie of auricular confession. Origen in that place in Leuit. Hom. 2. allegorizeth vpon the seauen kindes of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices prescribed by the Lord for remission of sinnes, &amp; saieth <hi>there are seauen kindes of remission of sinnes in the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, namelie. 1. In baptisme. 2. In martyrdome. 3. In al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes giuing. 4. Inforgiuing to other men. 5. In conuerting a sinner. 6. In abundance of charitie. the seauenth he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth in these wordes, which you rehearse verie vnperfectlie, and translate falselie. Est adhuc &amp; septima, licet dura &amp; laboriosa, per poanitentiam remissio peccatorum, cùm lauat peccator in lachrimis stratum suum, &amp; fiunt ei lachrimae suae panes die ac nocte, &amp; cùm nou erubescit sacerdoti domini indicare peccatum suum. &amp; quaerere medecinam, secundùm cum qui ait: dixi, pronunciabo aduersum me iniustitiam me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am domino, &amp; turemisisti impietatem cordis mei. In quo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletur &amp; illud quod Apostolus dicit: Si quis autem infirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, vocet presbyteros Ecclesiae &amp; imponant ei manus, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genteseum oleo, in nomine domini, &amp; oratio fidei saluabit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmum, &amp; si in peccatis fuerit, remittentur ei. There is yet a seauenth kinde of remission of sinnes, though hard and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by repentance, when the sinner washeth his bed with teares, and his teares are made to him his foode daie and night, and when he is not ashamed to declare his sinne to the priest of the Lorde, and to seeke medecine, according to him which saith: I haue saide, I will pronounce against my selfe mine owne vnrighteousnes vnto the Lorde: and thou hast remitted the vngodlines of my heart: wherein that also is fulfilled which the Apostle saith: if anie man be sick, let him call the elders of the Church, and let them laie their handes vpon him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing him with oyle, in the name of the Lord, and the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of faith shall saue the sicke person, and if he haue bene in sins theyshal be remitted to him.</hi> These are the words of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen, but you in your latine after <hi>indicare,</hi> leaue out <hi>pee
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:12222:337" rendition="simple:additions"/>
catum suum,</hi> and translate it, <hi>and is not ashamed to vtter all his sinnes,</hi> to make the place seeme more pregnant for auricular confession. I passe ouer that you alter the wordes folowing, which are <hi>secundùm cum qui ait initio, sicut scriptum est,</hi> by which it appareth that you borow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this place out of some other mans allegation, or note-booke negligentlie gathered, and doe not cite it of your owne reading. But to the matter, I answere, that Origen is not plaine for anie necessitie of shrifte to obteine remission of sinnes, when he sheweth fiue other meanes to obtaine it after baptisme, beside this. Secondlie it is euident, that he speaketh of open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to be made in the exercise of publique repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is not necessarie for all men. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there is no remission of sinnes after baptisme, but vnto them that be penitent before God, althouh they suffer martirdome, giue almes, forgiue other men, conuert sinnes, abound in charitie, if they be not sory and repent for their owne sinnes, they shall not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine forgiuenes at the hands of God. He speaketh therefore of open repentance where there is open confession, which also maie be gathered by his allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the texte of Saint Iames, where not one priest for auricular confession, but the Elders of the Church are called for. The priest of the Lord also. that he nameth, by the text following of Dauides confession before God, maie be vnderstood of Christ, of whome the Leuiticall Priest, to whome Origen alludeth, was a figure, as I haue declared before: so that here is no plaine testimony, nor any certeine warrant for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of eare confession: For that confession maie be made for quieting of a mans conscience we denie not: but that it is necessarie to be made by all men of all their mortall sinnes, and that without such confession there can be no remission of sinnes, that (I saie) we vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie, and alwaies denie.</p>

For as though you had fought vnder truthes ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, you boast of the victorie against heresie, whereas you haue serued heresie, &amp; done your indeuor against the trueth, striuing for nothing so much, as that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie might change names with trueth. But they which will you voutchsafe to consider, with how litle labour you haue bin encountred, and chased out of the field, will be able to discerne trueth from here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and to giue trueth her true name of trueth, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie her right name of heresie. But let vs see what
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:12222:340"/>
great matters this Champion of trueth hath brought to passe. First, <hi>that by Christ, power was giuen to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and their successours to remit sinnes,</hi> this victorie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is soone archiued, against them, which neuer withstood this tlitle. But what manner of power this is, and how to be executed, by sentence definitiue or declaratiue, according to the will of God, or man, and by what meanes it is exercised, by preaching the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, or by murmering of words, wherein trueth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulleth heresie, you haue broughtnothing to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your errors. Secondlie you saie, <hi>that confession was in. stituted by Christ,</hi> and yet haue no word in the scripture to prooue that popish confession to a priest, after your position, was either instituted, or allowed by him. The like I saie of the commendation of shrift to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Neither haue you prooued the necessitie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, by the example of anie faithfull nation, that vsed it, and allowed it, nor by anie Christian ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councel, before the Lateran councell gathered in the name of Antichrist, to maintaine his pride, and abominable heresies, neither hath anie one learned Doctor, for 500. or 600. yeares after Christ, liked, or allowed of confession, according to your popish defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition thereof, much lesse that by all Christian people, it was reuerently frequented, &amp; lest of al that confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is the onelie refuge, I meane confession alwaies to a priest, for Christians after their relapse, which most absurd proposition, I thinke few learned papistes will maintaine, sure I am manie of the Elder papists haue denied, holding that by contrition of heart men might obtaine remission of sinnes, without confession of the mouth to a priest. Wherfore he that seeth such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent brag, set vpon so false a matter, wherein he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neither Christs institution by his word, nor the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of antiquitie by anie credible report, nor pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of any Christian people, by any necessary ground, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

What comforte can be more, then to haue such a friende, who, for that I ioyne with him, yea euen mine owne soule to his, after the dearest manner and moste secret sorte, must needes be to me a full staie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, a witnesse of my sorowfull heart, an intercessour for my sinnes, a suretie before God for my amending, a minister in my reconciliation, and one that vnder Christ (as Saint Clement</hi>

Therefore, good reader, call vpon Christ for encrease of faith, and beleeue onelie this ordinance of God was of infinite wisedome and high prouidence prouided for thy sake, and it can not be burdenous vnto thee. Christ shal giue thee courage and heart to withstand the contrary temptations, and to serue him, though thou forsake thy selfe.

                        <p>You doe well to confesse, <hi>that shame is but small ales,</hi> where a man is brought into a fooles paradise, of so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie remission of his sinnes, <hi>for</hi> so light a <hi>confession, before one man,</hi> as sinfull, and perhaps more sinfull then he, <hi>and bounde</hi> (as you saie) <hi>by office to secrecie.</hi> But <hi>the comforte</hi> you speake of is vaine and miserable, though all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors were learned, and able to giue good counsel, as not one among an hundereth of your hedge Priests &amp; fryers are. For how can he be a suretie before God for an other mans amending, when he cannot be surety for his owne reformation? He may well beare other mens sinnes vpon himselfe, and take charge of other mens saluation, to his owne damnation, when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not Christ the onely propitiation for our sinnes, but will so be a minister of reconciliation, that he will robbe Christ of his glorie, and the people of their saluation. In which case in deede you set men in a maruelous, and mischeuous securitie, <hi>and almoste dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them euen of themselues,</hi> as youre owne wordes are, and of their owne custodie, while you make them giue ouer their owne aduise and iudgement, and wholly to hang in earth vpon you, &amp; not vpon Christ, whome God hath appointed to be the Pastour and gouernour of their soules, euen ypon earth, though he be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and they vpon the earth. Therefore good reader, marke how blaspemoussie these Popish dogges would haue thee to hang thy selfe whollie vpon them in earth, as the onelie Pastours and gouernours of their soules, by which they exclude Christ altogether, from any feeding or gouerning of our soules vpon earth, and debar all Christians, not onelie from depending whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon Christ, as they might, and doe, but from hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing at all vpon him in earth, seeing they will haue men to hang wholly vpon their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessor on earth, as though god had made any such pastors &amp; gouernours of mens soules, as should put Christ out of office, &amp; challenge the whole trust of mens saluation vnto
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:12222:343"/>
themselues. These be the right lims of Antichrist, that chalenge the chiefe honour of God vnto themselues which is faith and hope of saluation, to be reposed on them: for what other thing is it, that a man should qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et him selfe by, be discharged of himselfe &amp; his owne custodie, and wholy hang vpon his gostlie Father, but to beleeue in him, to put his whole faith, hope, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of saluation onelie vpon him, while he is vpon earth. And for this matter he is content to accept one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie faith, because he hath no other argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade thee, but remember that faith commeth by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the worde of God, which abhorreth and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth al confidence reposed in man. And therfore confusion of face be to al blasphemous papists, not onelie for their sinnefull life, but also for their abhominable heresies: and to god be al glorie, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and dominion in Christ Iesus our Lord, for euer &amp; euer.</p>

(gentle reader) because here all the lamentable tragedie and toile of this time first did begin, and here haue al those that perished in the late contradiction of Core principallie fallen.

Likewise, when you shall haue read ouer the whol treatise to the ende, you shall perceiue though you read no confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he hath not any warrant either out of the holie scriptures, or out of the auncient fathers, for any Popes pardons, such as he should take vpon him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende. For that the Church of God and pastours ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, haue power to release them that are bounde, and vpon perswasion of their repentance, to remit or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don some part of the triall appointed for them, it is no question betweene vs: but of the popes pardons, graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnder his <hi>Leaden Bulls</hi> for remission of sinnes, but <hi>a poena &amp; culpa,</hi> from the paine and from the fault, some plenarie of al their sinnes, some partial of part of their sins, some for a number of daies, some for many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of yeares, which euery one that paieth mony for them, shall haue the benefit of them, or which he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to such an hospitall, gylde, or brotherhoode, or to him which saith such a praier, or goeth on such a pilgri mage, &amp; such like, wherunto may be added his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, absolutiós, exemptions, lycenses, these are the popes pardons of which the controuersy is between vs, &amp; of which he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not prooue, that there was either vse, or approbation, no not in the Church of Rome for a

                           <hi>And to be plaine in the matter, where sinceritie is moste re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, two causes mooued me to beleeue, like, and allow of the power of pardons and indulgencies, long before I either knew the commodities of them, or had sought out the ground and meaning of them. The first was the Churches authoritie, which I credited in all other articles before I knew any of them, or could by reason or scripture mainteine them. Whose iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to follow by my Christian profession in all other pointes, and to forsake in this one of Popes pardons, had beene meere follie, and a signe of phantasticall choise of things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, which is the proper passion of heresie. Neither did I then know, that the Church of Christ had allowed such thinges, because I had read the determination of any generall Councells, or decrees of some chiefe gouernours of the saide Church, touching such pardons, or because I had by hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:12222:345"/>
and note of diuerse ages seene the practize of the faithfull people herein, by which waies her meaning of doubtfull things is most assuredlie knowne, but onelie I deemed that the Church allowed them, and misliked the contrarie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such as bare the name of Christian folke and Catholike did approoue them, and sometimes lamented the lacke of them. And surelie for an vnlearned man, I count it the brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest rule in the worlde, to keepe him selfe both in faith and conuersation euer with that companie, which by the generall and common calling of the people, be named Catholikes. For that name kept Saint Augustine himselfe in the trueth and</hi>

                           <hi>true Church, much more it may doe the simple sorte, who is not hable to stande with an heretike, that will challenge the Church to himselfe, by Sophisticall reasons, from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that for lacke of learning can not answere him. Well, this companie of Catholikes brought me to know the Church, and my creede caused me to beleeue the Church no lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Popes Pardons, then any other article of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian profession, which though it were not of like weight, yet it was to me of like trueth, and all in like vnknowne at that time.</hi>

                        <p>Your pretence of plainnes, &amp; sinceritie, is but craft and sub tiltie, to deceiue the simple and ignorant, that they might please themselues in their blindenes, and by your example thinke themselues at ease in their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. For what reasonable man will be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that you could beleeue, like, and allow that thing, whereof you know no vse, nor whence it came, or what it meaned. But here you shew what faith is accounted among the Papists, a fond perswasion of any thing that is tolde them by their teachers, although they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowe what commoditie it bringeth, nor what ground of trueth it hath, nor finallie what it meaneth. But howsoeuer it was, two causes mooued you, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you professe that hearing of the worde of God was neither. The first was <hi>the Churches authoritie, which you credited in all other articles, before you knew any of them, or
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:12222:345"/>
could by reason, or scripture, mainteine them.</hi> So by your owne confession you did as many papists doe, beleeue you knew not what, which faith would neuer bring you to eternall life, which consisteth in knowledge of God and Iesus Christ according to that which is writen, <hi>that</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ioh. 17. &amp; 20.</note> 
                           <hi>wee might beleeue and be saued.</hi> But seeing you could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reason, nor by scripture, mainteine those ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles to be true, which you beleeued, how could you be perswaded that this companie was the Church of Christ, the piller of trueth, rather then the Church of Antichrist, the mother of heresies and errors? For all swarmes of heretikes challenge vnto themselues the name of the Church, and require credit to be giuen vnto them: and the more heretikes the lesse care they haue to make any triall of their doctrine to be trueth: what had you more to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade your conscience, that you were in the right waie, then a lew or a Turke hath, which credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the companie amongst whome he is bred and borne, without examining by reason, or the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether those thinges which they teach them be the trueth or no? <hi>But it had beene a signe of phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall choyce of thinges indifferent</hi> (you saie) <hi>which is the proper passion of heresie, to follow the Churches iudgement in all other points, and to forsake it in this one of Popes Pardons.</hi> Where you saie the phantasticall choice of things indifferent is the proper passion of heresie, I know not what you meane, except you thinke that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes are deceiued onelie in the choise of thinges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, or that whosoeuer maketh some phantastical choise of thinges indifferent, is an heretike: neither of which opinions, I trowe, you are able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine. For though some heretikes make a phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall choise of thinges indifferent, I suppose it is not proper onelie to heretikes: for some schismatikes that be not heretikes, make such a phantasticall choise; and the phantastical choise of heretikes is most
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:12222:346"/>
occupied about principall groundes, and articles of faith, not about thinges indifferent onelie. Moreouer I would know, whether you account the Popes pardons to be things indifferent, or necessarie for the Church: for if they be but thinges indifferent, you doe not wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to be contentious about them. Finallie, seeing a companie of heretikes maie erre in one article, and teach soundlie in all other, as the Arians, Donatists, Nouatians, and such like, a man maie followe the iudgement of such a companie, in all other points, and without follie or signe of fantasticall choise, departe from them in that one wherein they erre. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your faith was as good, as his, that beleeueth there is a man in the moone, because he heareth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie men saie so, whome he dare credit in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and is loth to forsake them in this' one. But <hi>your Christian profession, mooued you to follow the Churches iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all things.</hi> And what heretike will not saie as much, without triall or proofe, which is the Church, or what is Christian profession? Therefore what ground had you that your profession was Christian, or your felowship the Church of Christ? You confesse you had neither the determination of generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, nor the decrees of the chife gouernours of your Church, nor the practise of the people in diuers ages, by which waies you saie the Churches mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of doubtfull thinges, is moste assuredlie knowne: but onelie you deeme the Church allowed them. So that you, because such as bare the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian folke and Catholike men did approoue them, had nothing but the bare name of Christian folke, and Catholike men to ground your deeme vpon. And is the bare and onelie name of Christian and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like men, so sure a ground to build faith vpon, without either the authoritie of the scriptures, reason, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of general councels, or decrees of the chief gouernours of the same, or the practise of the faithful
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:12222:346"/>
in auncient times? then surelie Iet all heretikes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselues, where they are, and dwell togither: for there they shall haue the name of Christian folke and Catholike men: which you account to be the bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest rule in the worlde for an vnlearned man, to keepe himselfe both in faith, and conuersation, with that companie, which, by the generall and common cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the people, be named Catholikes. The rule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is verie briefe, and you saie in the margent also, <hi>that it is good.</hi> But who I praie you prescribeth this rule, doth God the author of trueth? where finde you it in his worde? shall the generall and common calling of the people be the vnlearned mans rule to direct him to the Church, which is the piller and staie of truth? then surelie the vnlearned Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Aethiopians, Armenians, and other that dissent from the Church of Rome, and from the truth it selfe, haue a good and briefe rule to holde them where they are, for by the generall and common cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the people in those partes of the world, they be named Christians, and Catholikes. Yea the rule ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them ten times better then you Papists, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of it, for they haue the more generall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calling of the people, to be Catholikes in those places, then you haue here in Europe, by a hundred parts. For there no man calleth them otherwise then Christians and Catholikes, here you haue (God be praised) many hundreth thousandes of the people, that commonlie call you Papists, heretikes, antichristians, Cacolikes and such other names, agreeing to your heresies. If you will cauill that by the generall and common calling of the people, they be not named Catholikes, because you Papistes doe neither so call them, nor count them, they maie answere you by the same reason, that you are not by generall &amp; common calling of the people named Catholikes, because nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor we doe so call you, or account you. But it
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:12222:347"/>
is fufficient belike that you call your selues, so and the rule is to be restrained to people of these partes of the world, and among them to Papists onelie; and so it is as good a rule, as that, aske my fellow if I be a theefe. A good rule indeed for vnlearned Papists, because draffe is good enough for swine, which had rather sleepe in the myre, and puddle of ignorance, then come to the knowledge of the truth by searching the scriptures, in which Christ the waie, the truth, and the life, is to be <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 6. Ioh 5. 39. 1. Pet. 3. 15.</note> found, and out of which all Christians ought to gather knowledge, that they maie be able to giue account of that hope that is in them.</p>
                        <p>But Saint Augustine (I wene) should be author of this rule, for vnlearned men, although he himselfe were not vnlearned, <hi>Contra epistolam Manichaei quam vocant fundamenti, Cap 4.</hi> This is great impietie to faine so absurd a rule, and then to slaunder so godly a father, to be either the author or approouer therof. For Saint Augustine indeed, against the Maniches, which were a particuler sect of heretikes, confesseth that among manie other thinges, the name of the Catholike Church did holde him in the bosome thereof: but not that the onelie name of Catholikes was a good rule for vnlearned men to know the Church by. But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing to reason the matter with them, without anie preiudice, and to trie the trueth without anie rashnes, as one willing to yeald vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they can perswade him with trueth, so that they shall not require him to yeald, before they can giue him a cleere reason with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie darkenes, of allthinges pertaining to the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his soule, thus he beginneth; <hi>In Catholica e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim Ecclesia, vt omitta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. For in the Catholike Church, that I maie omitte that moste sincere wisdome, vnto the knowledge where of a fewe spirituall men doe come in this life, that they maie knowe it, but of the lest part, because they are men, but yet without doubt: for the rest of the multitude not the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of vnderstanding, but the simplicitie of beleeuing doeth,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:12222:347"/>
make moste false: Therefore that I maie omitte this wisdome, which you beleeue not to be in the Catholike Church, there are manie other thinges which maie moste iustlie holde me in her lappe. The consent of people and nations holdeth me, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie begunne with miracles, nourished with hope, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with charitie, confirmed with antiquitie, holdeth me: The succession of Priests from the verie seate of Peter the Apostle, to whome our Lorde after his resurrection commended his sheeepe to be fedde, vnto this present bishoprike doeth holde me: last of all the verie name of Catholike Church doth holde me, which not without cause among so manie heresies, this Church alone hath so obtained, that whereas all heretikes would haue themselues to be called Catholikes, yet to a straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that asketh, where men meet at the Catholike Church, none of the heretikes dare shewe either their owne Church or house. Therfore these so manie &amp; so great most deare bondes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian name, doe rightlie holde a man that beleeueth in the Catholike Church: although for the dulnes of our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or the desert of our life, the tructh doth not yet shewe it selfe moste openlie. But among you, where none of these things is that maie inuite or holde me, there soundeth nothing but the promise of truth, which indeed if it be shewed so manifest, that it cannot come in doubt, it is to be preferred before all those things, by which I am holden in the Catholike Church.

by it: but acknowledgeth that all these motiues of vniuersalitie, consent, miracles, succession, name of Catholike, must giue place to the trueth, when it is plainlie shewed out of the canonicall scriptures, as in the chapter following he vrgeth them to shew <hi>out of the gospells of Christ, wher it is writen, that Manicheus was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle of Christ,</hi> as his sect affirmed, and his epistle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. As for the reason you alledge, <hi>that vnlearned men are not able to stand with heretikes in disputation, which wil challenge the Church to themselues,</hi> is of no force. for the vnlearned man ought to know the Church by the true notes thereof, conteined in the scriptures, which is sufficient for to satisfie his conscience, although he can not cunninglie auoide all the Sophisticall arguments that the aduersarie bringeth: whereas theonelie name of Catholikes can breede no true faith, or quietnes of minde, which is not obteined by the peoples iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by authoritie of the worde of God. And seing the people are commonlie deceiued in many matters of difficultie, and moste of all in misnaming of things, what assurance shall the vnlearned haue, that they be not deceiued in this so weightie a matter, and wherein their speach may so easilie be abused. But howsoeuer it was, <hi>the common calling of the people, brought you to know Catholikes, Catholikes to know the Church, and the creede taught you to beleeue the Church rules in Popes pardons, then in other articles.</hi> Thus is your faith builded altogether vpon humane presumptions, the ladder whereof is this. you beleeue Popes pardons, because the Church of Rome alloweth them, you beleeue the Church of Rome, because it is the Catholike Church. you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that it is the Catholike Church, because the people commonlie call it so.

knowne to be moste true in Saxonie where Luther first found fault with pardons. When Pope Leo. 10. had sent abroad his pardons, which were preached by <hi>Terelius</hi> a Dominike frier in such impudent manner, that they seemed to serue for no end, but the Popes couetousnes, and the licentiousnes of the people: Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at that time hauing a zeale of God, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge, did mildelie and modestlie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish the people of the deceites and abuses of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and pardoners, which long before his time were reprooued, in the Councells of Latrean, and Vienna, he complained to the Archbishoppe of Ments, to the Bishop of Branderburg, to the prouinciall of the Augustine friers, and to the Pope him selfe: in all thinges submitting him selfe to the Pope, and Church of Rome, so it were not against the holie scriptures. When he could finde no equity, nor redresse of these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses, <note place="margin">In suppl.

Now whereas you charge him with contention, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, the world your iudge before, maie gather whether Luther, if against his conscience he would haue set forth the Popes pardons, especiallie at such time as the Pope had great neede of monie for warre against the Turkes, might not haue made a more easie waie, for him selfe, to honour and ri hes, then by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himselfe against them. But howsoeuer it was your fault, faith was thus confirmed, and that to such blasphemous boldnes, that without authoritie of the holie scriptures, the matter of pardons, seemed to you, as true, as the spirit of God is true, and hauing none other arguments to perswade you, but that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes

If then the pith ofthe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test matters of poperie doe stand in Popes pardons, and this pith hath no ground either in the scriptures, or the fathers of the Church, for a thousand yeares after Christ, we maie the more easily see, that the plant of poperie, whereof pardons is the pith, is not of Gods owne planting, and therefore shalbe plucked vp by the rootes.</p>

The secrets of the next world not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled in the scriptures, they leaue vntil the time of the general reuelation of al secrets, and therfore they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume not to allow purgatorie paines, for the clensing of those sinnes, which the scripture teacheth to be purged, by the bloode of Christ, in whome all our sinnes are thorowlie punished, to the full satisfaction of the iustice and wisedome of God.

all vertue and power of life from Christ the head, and euery member to exercise that office, which by his grace is assigned vnto it, therefore they haue done no iniurie to Christ, his Church, his saints, sacraments, or his holy Religion, but their dutie in purging the doctrine ofChrist, his Church, his saints, sacraments, and Religion, from error, falsehood, heresie, and blasphemie. You tell the reader <hi>that you doe not riot in wordes to ouerrunne your aduersarie:</hi> but if he be wise, he will reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that a crafty orator, doth sonest deceiue, when he pretendeth moste plainenes.

For there can no power in earth be so great, nor any mans iurisdiction so simple, that he maie forgiue mortall offences, since the institution of the sacrament of penance, except he vse the confession of the partie with his contrition and sure intent neuer to commit the like againe, yea and with purpose to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the iustice of God, by Christes grace, as he maie, according to the enioyning of his iudge therein. For God him-selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is righteous and true, can not forgiue anie man his sinnes, either by this sacrament of penance, or otherwise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of yeares and time of discretion, except he be penitent for the same: that is to saie, except he be both contrite, and at the least willing to confesse his offences, if it be after relapse, and to suffer due correction therefore. And seeing God can not pardon anie man of his deadlie sinnes, except he be thus qualified, much lesse maie a mortall man, be he neuer so great in dignitie or calling in the Church, take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

him to forgiue or pardon him that is guiltie of deadlie sinne and damnation, without the confession and submission of the penitent, as is premised. All this trueth hangeth orderlie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the necessitie of the sacrament of Penance, and Christs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance therein, whereby he hath made deadly sinnes onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missible in that sacrament, by the confession of the partie to a Priest, who hath in his order receiued power to remit them, as is sufficientlie prooued in the former parte of this treatise, and it is onely a Priest, whether he be of base state, or high dignitie, that can lawfullie loose mens sinnes, as by the key of his order, as they terme it, with sufficient iurisdiction ouer the penitent, for the secret discussing of his conscience in this sacrament of Confession.</hi>

                        <p>This wholl Chapter conteineth nothing but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, without any ground of authoritie of scripture, or testimonte of Doctours, as though it were sufficient onely to affirme them: which if they be not graunted, all that followeth of Pardons is nothing worth. The first is, <hi>That Pardons do not properly importe the remission of any deadly crime, or the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t due for the same.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that followe serue to prooue, that pardons for deadlie sinnes, and the paine due for them, are vnprofitable, but they prooue not, that they doe not import such remission, either by the Popes intende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by the pardoners preaching of them, or in the opinion of the purchasers, and receiuers of them. The glosse vpon the Clementine. <hi>l. 5. de poenitentiis, &amp; re missionibus. c.</hi> 2. yealding a reason why the Pope repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the pardoners which toke vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to graunt ple nary remission of sins, &amp; to absolue men <hi>à poena &amp; culpa,</hi> hath these wordes: <hi>à poena &amp; culpa ista est plenissima pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum remissio, quae conceditur cruce signatis pro subsidio vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramarino, &amp;c. quam solus papa concedit. From the paine and the fault, this is a moste full remission of sinnes, which is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them that are marked with the crosse, for aide beyond the sea, which the Pope alone doth graunt:</hi> by which it appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the Pope taketh vpon him iustlie, to graunt
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:12222:354"/>
pardon of all sinnes, mortall and veniall, which the pardoners vniustlie presumed to do, without suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warrant. So doth Pope Boneface the 8, the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Iubilie pardons, graunt, <hi>Non solùm plenam &amp; largi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem, immo plenissimam omnium suorum veniam peccatorum, not onelie a full and large pardon, but a most full pardon of all their sinnes.</hi> If the pope speake vnproperlie, when he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth such emphatical and superlatiue speeches, how shal plaine men vnderst and what he meaneth. I know that some of the Canonistes, who haue more care that his decrees should hang together, then the Pope him self, when he graunteth pardons for aduantage, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the word <hi>peccatorum</hi> to signify <hi>paines due for sins,</hi> &amp; yet by this cursed glosse, that corrupteth the text, release of eternal paine due for deadly sinne is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. The author of the glosse confesseth, that this epistle was verie grosly made. <hi>Haecepistola satis gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sè fuit composita,</hi> and therefore it must be healped by glosses, for their sakes that can dispute against it, but for the common people it is good enough in the literal sense. In so much that the glosse saith vpon the word <hi>plenissimam. Sed quomodo ista compatiuntur plena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, largiorem, &amp; plenissima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Dico Papam interpretatum fuisse in consistorio me presense, hane indulgentiam adeo plenam, prout clauium po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas se extendet, quod intelligo prout verba patiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur. But how do these words hang together, &amp; the one abide the other, a ful, a more large, &amp; a most ful pardon? I say that the pope in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story in my presense, did interpret this pardon, to be so ful as the power of the keies doth extend it selfe, which I do vnderstand as the words doe suffer.</hi> Whereby it is manifest that the Pope restraining the fullnesse of his open pardon, sent into all the world by his priuie interpretations in his consistorie, doth nothing els but delude the world by his pardons, as it shal more plainly appeare by the rea sons that are afterward brought forth to defend them from the pretended slaunders of their impugners. But further to prooue, that the Pope hath taken

Againe, what should neede so large pardon for veniall sinnes, which may so easilie be remitted without pardon, except the pope meaneth to release the paines, due for deadlie sinnes? Doe ventall sinnes, which may be washed away with holie water, deserue so many hundred thousand yeares of penance or punishment, as are conteined in these pardons? Finallie what shal we saie to those pardons that are graunted for saying of certeine praiers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of diuerse printed bookes are full, in which is expresse mention of pardon, for mortall sinnes. As for example, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt, graunteth to him that saieth a certeine praier deuoutlie in the worship of Saint Anne, and the Virgin Marie, and her sonne Iesus, ten thousand yeares of pardon, for deadlie sinnes, and twentie yeares for veniall sinnes, <hi>tottes, quoties.</hi> The praier with the indulgence, is to be found in a booke printed at Paris, no longer agoe, then <hi>in anno.</hi> 1534. fol. 85. <hi>in horis sanctae virginis.</hi> What face then hath this proctor for the Popes pardons to affirme, <hi>that the Pope neuer tooke vpon him by pardon to remit deadlie sinne?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But now let vs consider his reasons, how he proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that the Popes pardons doe not properlie import remission of any deadlie crime, &amp;c.<hi>Since the institution of the sacrament of penance, no man can forgiue deadlie sinne without confession of the partie, and purpose to satisfie the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God.</hi> Here are three positions assumed, without proofe, alwaies denied of vs, namelie the institution of the sacrament of penance, the necessitie of Popish confession, or of the purpose of satisfying the iustice of God, which no man can satisfie in any part, but
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:12222:356"/>
onelie Christ hath fullie satisfied the same for vs: and therefore it is open blasphemie to saie that God can not forgiue a man his sinnes, except he be willinglie to suffer due correction therefore. For <hi>Christ hath once suffered for vs and found eternall redemption:</hi> That God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. Heb. 9. 10.</note> repentance in them that receiue forgiuenes of sinnes, beeing of discretion, that is such as heare the worde and beleeue it, is not so to be vnderstood, as though God were restrained of his power, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie of man, but that God giueth repentance to all such as whose sinnes he forgiueth: For except he conuert vs we cannot repent. Therefore it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous saying to affirme, that god cannot, because he is righteous, forgiue a man without he be penitent. For his righteousnes is thoroughlie satisfied in Christ, before we were borne. And if it be his pleasure to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue a man his sinnes, he will also giue him repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and faith to apprehend Christ, to his iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the Pope, who is not able to giue repentance, is no more able to forgiue sinnes. If this matter hang (as you saie) vpon the necessitie of the sacrament of penance and confession to a Priest, neither of both those necessities beeing prooued, it hangeth in the aire, and is concluded without proofe. Now if God onelie by the ministerie of euerie priest, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions by you required, doe forgiue sinnes, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Popes pardons are nothing, but mere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, to promise that which he cannot performe, or which euerie hedge Priest of his Church, is able to performe to his subiects, as largelie as the Pope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the remission of deadlie sinnes.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Vpon which ground you may well perceiue, that the Popes remission and pardon, beeing a publike act of the key of his iurisdiction and rule ouer the flocke of Christ, and not an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his power of order, which onelie is occupied in ministring the sacraments, and such like, you may well perceiue (I saie) that his Pardon or assoyling out of the Sacrament, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:12222:356"/>
extend in any case so farre, as to forgiue sinnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confession of the penitent, yea although he be otherwise sorowfull for the same: much lesse may he release any offences without all repentance of the partie. And therefore it is a great slaunder, to say as manie doe that for mony ye maie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine of the Pope a free Pardon before hand, of any gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouse sinnes that you commit afterward, as of robberies, murders, misbehauiours in bodie, or such like, which were no pardon of sinnes, but a wicked protection and license to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sinnes. There was neuer Bishop of Rome, or of other place, that euer gaue or could giue any such pardon. Naie, not onelie they take vpon them no such thing, but they neuer gaue pardon to this intent to remit mortali sinnes at all, by force of the Pardon onelie, and without the confession of the partie, were they of neuer so large or liberall graunt. For euerie Indulgence hath this clause in it, either expresselie, or necessarilie, and by course to be supplied: Confessis, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritis, to the confessed and contrite: and sometimes this clause of like importance, to all as be</hi> in state of grace. <hi>Whereby it is euident, that the giuer meaneth not, to make any man partaker of the Indulgence, grace, or pardon, and that the partie cannot haue any benefit thereby, if he be not released of his sinnes before, and by the sacrament of penance, set in state of saluation. Whereby also you see, that the Pope taketh not vpon him to forgiue anie their sinnes (I meane alwaies deadlie sinnes in this case) by his pardon. For the Priest before hand, that heareth his confession, doth forgiue him in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so needeth not of any Pardon for those offences them selues, which belong to the Priests office to remit, and therefore be alwaie in the said sacramentall manner forgiuen. And if he be vnworthie of forgiuenes and loosing by the iust iudgement of his ghostlie father, then cannot the pope or any other power in earth forgiue him by any grace or Indulgence, which taketh onelie place from such as be alreadie loosed from their mortall crimes.</hi>

                        <p>The second position is, <hi>that the Popes pardon cannot extend to forgiue sins without the confession of the partie, much
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:12222:357"/>
lesse release sinnes without all repentance of the partie.</hi> We do easilie graunt, that the popes pardons, is of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie at al, and therfore you maie pinch it and straine it in, at your pleasure. But where you saie, <hi>it is a great slaunder to saie as manie do, that for monie men maie obteine pardon afore hand, &amp;c.</hi> You should haue done well, to haue set downe, who saith so, or what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugner of pardons so slaundereth them or the Pope. And yet it is manifest, that although no such pardon go forth in such forme of wordes, the Popes pardons dispensations and absolutions, tend to that effect: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are openlie prostrate for all men that will giue monie for them. For what skilleth it, If a man can not haue a lycense to commit murther, periurie, adulterie, &amp;c? If he be sure before hand to haue a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, dispensation, or absolution for the same, he will not be greatlie affraid to commit anie of them. And seeing the Pope taketh vpon him to dispense against the commaundement of God, in manie cases, and to graunt absolution for anie crime neuer so great, the Pope is not greatlie slaundered, if he be called a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of sinne, and a graunter of license to committe the same. Neither can he be excused by requiring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, confession, and satisfaction in the parties, seeing he graunteth pardon for the defaults of euerie one of them, and that which is the chiefest, of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which according to your learning, must be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or lesser, as the contrition is more or lesse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the priestes simple discretion. For the glosse vpon the Bull of Pope Boneface the 8. saith, <hi>that the contrition of him that confesseth may be so great, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the fault, but also the paine, maie be cleane taken awaie without penance: but because men can not iudge of that, some satisfactorie penance must be enioyned, by the Priest or Pope, &amp;c.</hi> Now if the Pope by his pardons, as you saie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth no sinnes, but such as be forgiuen before by the priest, in the sacrament of penance, then doth he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:12222:357"/>
but plaie mockholiedaie with his moste full par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, <hi>à poena &amp; culpa,</hi> with the pardons of the third part or of the seuenth part of mens sinnes, and so is he no better then a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus while you go about to excuse the popes pardons of presumption, you condemne them of cosening, and declare them to be meerelie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, which promis pardons of deadlie sinnes, yet take place onely vpon such as be alreadie loosed from their mortal sinnes.</p>

knew no such distinction. The keies of power or auctoritie &amp; the keie of knowledge the Scripture spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, and so doe the auncient doctors. How be it euen as your fathers the Scribes &amp; Pharises &amp; lawier <hi>did take away the keies of knowledge, and shut vp the kingdom of heauen from men, neither entring in them selues nor suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Math. 23. 5. Luk. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>other that would:</hi> so do you: for you haue taken away the key of knowledge of the Scriptures, by which as Chrysostome saith, <hi>in opere imperfecto</hi> the kingdom of <note place="margin">Hom 44. in c. Matt. 23.</note> heauen is opened, &amp; in steed thereof forged a key of straunge and tyrannicall iurisdiction, which neither Christ nor Peter, nor any of his godly successors did know or exercise. This ancient writers words are these. <hi>Regnum coelorum est beatitudo coelestis, ianua autem etus est Scriptura, per quam introitur ad eam. Clauicularij autem sunt Sacerdotes, quibus creditum est verbum dicendi, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretandi Scripturas. Clauis autem est verbum scientiae Scripturarum, per quam aperitur hominibus ianua veritatis. Adapertio autem est interpretatio vera. The kingdome of heauen is the heauenly blessednes, the gate thereof is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which men goe into it: the key-keepers are the priests, to whome is committed the word of preaching and interpreting the Scriptures. And the key is the word of the knowledg of the Scriptures by which the gate of truth is opened vnto men. The opening is the true interpretation of the scriptures.</hi> These two keies of authoritie and knowledge, will make a sufficient minister of the Gospell, that is able to open, and shut, binde and loose, forgiue and retaine sinnes, and where these want, or either of them, there can be no good minister of Christ to open the kingdome of heauen, that men maie enter therein. But now let vs see the reason you giue, why you attribute more power to a simple priest in remitting of mortal sinnes in shrift, then to the Popes high iurisdiction by pardons. <hi>The cause is</hi> (saie you) <hi>that the effect of remission of sinnes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from Christ, more abundantlie in the grace of sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then by the high iurisdiction without the sacraments.</hi>
                           <pb n="363" facs="tcp:12222:358"/>
This is nakedlie affirmed, without anie proofe in the world, as other positions before and after. But in deed there is no reason that the effect of remission of sinnes, shoud proceede more large from the sacrament of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as you call it, then from the iurisdiction of the Pope, if it had the same foundation which you would beare men in hand it hath. For if Peters and the Popes iurisdiction be builded vpon <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> and <hi>to thee I will giue the keies, and what soeuer thou bindest or loosest, shall be bound in heauen, &amp;c.</hi> Why should not all mortall sinnes be subiect to his iurisdiction, as well as to the priestes power in penance. The wordes be as ample to Peter, Math. 16. as to the Apostles. Ioh. 20. If Peters key of iurisdiction papall be not grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this text, as you aduouched <hi>lib. 1. cap. 4. Sect. 7.</hi> tell vs where he hath it anie where els committed vnto him. If it be committed by this text, certainlie the key of iurisdiction is as large as the key of orders. Therfore either he forgiueth mortall sinnes by his iurisdiction, or els his iurisdiction is no greater then anie other mans, that hath anie key committed vnto him.</p>

                           <hi>There is another key of Regiment and rule of the Church or some principall portion thereof, which is called the key or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of iurisdiction. Now by this power of regiment and rule, as no man can take vpon him to consecrate, so no man out of the sacrament of penance, can take vpon him to absolue anie man of deadlie sinnes and damnation due therefore. For though some do thinke, that Saint Paull did absolue the incestuous Corinthian both of his sinne and damnation, with all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall punishment due therefore, after assured repentance of the partie, out of the sacrament of penance: yet I cannot agree in anie case thereunto, because the sacrament of confession hath euer beene of necessitie since Christes institution thereof, and because the remission of sinnes is so proper a worke vnto God, that no creature could euer worke the same absolutelie without sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, sauing only the humanitie of Christ, to which the acts, of diuinity, as being vnited to the godhead, were communicated,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:12222:359"/>
vpon which it is certaine, that Christ our sauiour might remit sinnes absolutelie out of all externall sacraments, by his word and will onelie, which beeing the power of excellencie, was, as Diuines do thinke, communicated to no other creature, in what iurisdiction or preheminence soeuer he should be placed: and in the act of absolution &amp; remission of sinnes proceedeth ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from that one excellent person, beeing both God and man. Neither is it to be thought that Saint Paull did pardon the foresaid Penitent anie other waies, then by the handes of the ministers and Priestes of the Corinthian Church. For though the confession and penance of the partie were publike, as the sinne it selfe was open, yet the vsage of the Apostie, and open practize of the Corinthian Church towards him, was no lesse a sacrament then, then it is now beeing secret. Therefore I doubt not, but Saint Paull spake especiallie to the Priestes of the Corinthians, when he willed them to confirme their charitie towards the sinner, and to forgiue him by their ministerie, whome he thought in absence worthie to receiue the grace and pardon at their handes, whereof we shall speake more hereafter in place conuenient. We do not then exalte the Pope or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in this case anie thing so farre as heresie seemeth, or the simplicity of manie men conceiueth, whereas they maie wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that we giue more authoritie to the most simple Priest aliue, in respect of his order, and because of the sacrament, by which he worketh, then to the Pope or highest Potentate in the world, considering but onelie his iurisdiction. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint Peter him self, who receiued both the keies, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so other Apostles and Bishops, hauing as well the keie or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Orders, as the keie of iurisdiction, and regiment of their subiects, maie do the actes of both the keies, that is to saie, maie as well lawfullie minister sacraments of all sortes, as also exercise iurisdiction vpon their subiects in such thinges, as we hereafter shall declare. But out of the sacraments onelie by the vertue of their iurisdiction, to absolue men of mortall sinnes, though they be subiect vnto them, they can not, nor, as I think, euer Pope or Prelace tooke vpon him anie such prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence. And therefore let this be the first point of our consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:12222:359"/>
that the Popes</hi> Pardons or Indulgences, <hi>which he giueth in respect of his iurisdiction, which also, as moste men do thinke, he might giue when he were once elected, before he were a priest or anie other bishop in like case, according to the compasse of this regiment: let it be first noted, I saie, that such pardons, howsoeuer they be giuen out of the sacraments, do not forgiue sinnes that be deadlie. And if anie man thought before, that the Pope might or did vse to giue such liberall graunts or pardons, wherby without the sacrament of penance or consession anie man might claime full remission of all his deadlie sinnes, let him correct the misconstruing the matter in him-selfe, and assuredlie know, that it is not sothought of gods Church, nor so meant by the giuer, nor so expressed in any pardon.</hi>

You returne againe to Saint Pauls absolution, which although the text, and the doctors interpretation vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the text, be most manifest, that Saint Paull as a principall partie in his excommunication, doth also as principall minister restore him, yet you will haue him to be, <hi>but onelie an exhorter or counseller of other men, what they should do.</hi> But the text is plaine, he did not onelie

iudge him worthie, to receiue pardon at the hands of priestes or Church of Corinth; but he also did for his parte, and according to that interest he had ouer the Churchof Corinth, himselfe pardon him &amp; that in the person or presens of Christ.

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:12222:361"/>
but by reseruation of cases it appeareth, that the Pope challengeth this prerogatiue, that he onelie may giue absolution and pardon in these greeuous crimes, that be called cases papall, and the Bishop in cases episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall. Now let vs see how this geare hangeth together. <hi>The Pope hath this prerogatiue in respect of his high iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> for in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of penance euery priest, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as we heard before, hath as much authority as he. Then if these cases be reserued to the Popes iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this reseruation doth prooue, that the Pope tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon him to pardon the most greeuous sinnes, by his iurisdiction onelie, or els he deceaueth them that seeke for absolution of them at his hands. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you would cloake the matter by saying, <hi>the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence doth graunt, that the priest in confession maie assoile a man from such sinnes, as be reserued to the supreame power of the Church,</hi> it is to no purpose: For the Priest in this case, is but the popes deputie, to exercise the Popes iurisdiction (as you saie) as well vpon persons as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, not properlie pertaining to him, but by the Popes license; whereupon it followeth, that the Pope may do in his owne person, that which he doth by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie, but by his deputie he taketh vpon him to remit most deadlie sinnes: therefore the Pope taketh vpon him to remit deadlie sinnes, by his iurisdiction onelie. If you saie, the absolution commeth from the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not from his iurisdiction, then shew vs out of the scriptures, how the Pope hath authoritie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine the grace of sacraments in respect of the person that ministreth them, or els your reseruation of cases and exemption of persons, will prooue no better then an Antichristian tyrannie. For if Christ haue giuen power to euerie Priest to remitte all sinnes, as you haue often affirmed, vpon the text Ioh. 20. <hi>whose sinnes you remit, &amp;c.</hi> what is he but Antichrist, exalting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe aboue all that is called God, which controlleth the liberall graunt of Christ, exempting both persons,

Wheresoeuer the Priest consecrateth, it is effectuall: whomesoeuer he baptizeth, he is lawfullie Christianed: whomesoeuer the Bishop ordereth, he standeth trulie ordered, and so forth, though they should not herein meddle in other mens cures, without speciall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, sufferance, or necessitie. But no man can assoile anie person at all, that is not subiect vnto him, either ordinarilie or otherwise, because it is an act of iurisdiction, and therefore though his power of orders be in it selfe sufficient, yet by that onelie he can not absolue anie man, but in necessitie, except he haue withall authoritie ouer the person, and in that case, wherein the penitent requireth his sentence, which iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction he maie haue, either ordinarilie, as vpon all those that be of his charge, or els extraordinarilie, by some special graunt of the superiour, as Bishop, or Pope, as we maie see in the formes and course of Indulgencies diuers times.

In truth Christ hath giuen ful power to al his ministers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the measure of euerie one of their charges. the Apostles ouer al the world, their successors the bishops pastors, &amp; teachers within the compasse of their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cures: and therefore you saie well, <hi>that God hath so ordered the case, that no man maie intermedle in an others cure, without licence, sufferance, or necessitie:</hi> the Pope then doth wickedlie to exempt anie man from his lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pastor, to whome the charge of his soule is by Christ committed The reason you giue, wherfore this power can not be practized, vpon all, is friuolous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>this sacrament, and none other is iudiciall.</hi> For who will graunt you that the power of remitting sinnes in repentance is more iudiciall then in baptisme, or in the Lordes supper? For the minister ought to haue a iudgement whome he baptizeth and whome he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth vnto the Lords table. If the children of Turks, or Iews, be offered to baptisme, without the conuersion or consent of their parentes, by what warrant shall he receiue them? If Turkes, Iewes, or Gentiles that be of yeares of discretion, offer them selues to baptisme, before they be instructed in Christian beliefe, shal they be baptized? If children, naturall fooles, and such as can not examine themselues, notorious offenders, that haue giuen no signes of repentance, men knowen to be in malice, &amp;c. shal present the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to the Lords table, must they without al iudgement, or discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:12222:363"/>
accepted or repulsed? By this therefore it appeereth that there is nothing more iudiciall in receiuing of sinners to repentance, if that were a sacrament, then in the only true sacraments of baptisme and the Lords supper. Wherefore, there is no reason that the Pope should restraine anie man of that power, which you confesse he hath by Christes graunt, ouer all persons of his charge, by exempting anie of them, or giuing them libertie to chuse their gostlie Father, according to their owne appetite, and much lesse, that he should reserue vnto him selfe, the absolution from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test sinnes, the power whereof was graunted by Christ to euerie Priest, as you confesse, ouer his owne pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioners, for which reseruation you bring not so much as the shadow of anie reason to shroud him from the the note of Antichristian tiranie.</p>

Therefore to him that is free from greeuous sinnes, or pardoned of the same, all these thinges shalbe commodious towards the remission of his lesser infirmities: but if he be in state of damnation, and out of Gods fauour, which grace must be procured onelie by the Sacraments of Baptisme or penance, he can not obtaine anie Pardon at the popes hands neither aliue nor dead, nor none was euer meant vnto him.</hi>

For his purpose is to shewe, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be purged from his greeuose sinnes by almes, except he be heartelie penitent and carefull, neuer to commit them againe: but of smaller sinnes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which a man can not lead his life, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine that he will forsake them, but must continuallie craue Pardon for them, and auoide them, as much as he can. His wordes are these. <hi>Sanè cauendum, ne quisquam existimet infanda illa crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, qualia qui agunt, regnum Dei non possidebunt, quotidiè perpetranda, &amp; eleemosynis quotidiè redimenda.

Suerlie we must take heede lest anie man thinke those wicked crimer, which they that committe them, shall not possesse the kingdome of God, are dailie to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and dailie to be redeemed by almes. For the life must be changed into better, and God is to be intreated through al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mese, for sinnes past, he is not to be bought after asort, for this end, that it maie be lawfull to commit them alwais with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out punishment. For he hath giuen to no man licence of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, although by his mercie he doe wipe awaie sinnes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie committed, if meet satisfaction be not neglected. But for daily, short, and light sins, without which this life is not ledde, the daily praier of the faithfull doth make satisfaction. For it pertaineth to them to saie, Our Father which art in heauen, which are alreadie regenerat to such a father by water and the holie Ghost. For this praier doth altogether wipe awaie these least and dailie sinnes. It wipeth awaie also those, from which the life of the faithfull, hauing beene wickedlie passed, but by repentance being changed into better, doth depart: if, as it is trulie saied, forgiue vs our debtes, because there want not dets to be forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen so it may be truly said, as we also do forgiue our debters, that is to saie, if that be done which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

In which if he delude men, he is so much the more wicked to promise pardon of all sinnes, and yet is not able to remit so much by his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as a Parish Priest may doe without his pardons. Wherefore your impudencie is the greater, to affirme so often, <hi>they challenge nothing ells, nor meane nothing ells, but the release of penance, or punishment due.</hi> I haue before prooued both by the glosse of their law, and by the verie wordes of their pardons, that they challenge this authority to release not onelie the paine, but also the saultes. If they meane otherwise, then they write and speake, then are they detestable dissemblers. But howsoeuer some Canonists to salue their matter of shrift, haue expounded them to perteine onelie to the punishment due for sinnes, remitted in the sacrament of penance, yet their exposition can by no meanes stand, with the wordes of many pardons. But seeing you will needes haue it so, let vs see what you saie to prooue it. First you aske, <hi>what lesse, they beeing appointed pastours of our soules, and gouernours of the Church, can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, then to forgiue the punishment, which the law, whereof they were makers or executors, doth prouide?</hi> To this we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that we neither acknowledge them to be pastors, or gouernours of gods church, nor if they were, to haue authoritie, to make lawes to intangle mens consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and then to streine them or loose them at their pleasures. Christ gaue power to remit or retaine, to binde or loosethe penitent or vnpenitent, but not to binde the penitent to punishment, whose sins are loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:12222:366"/>
and remitted. The example of temporall Princes pardoning or releasing the punishment of transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, will not serue. For the pastours of the Church must doe that which Christ hath commaunded, and no more, which are so gouernours of the Church, that they be not Lordes and Princes thereof, but seruants of the Church and of Christ. But lest of all can any Pastour of our soules, or gouernour of the Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease any punishment due to sinne it selfe by Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, which none but God of his mercie can doe, his iustice, beeing before answered in Christ our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>

                        <p>This first reason is verie feeble, some pardons haue this clause, <hi>de poenitentys iniunctis, of penance inioyned,</hi> therfore in al other pardons in which is expresse men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not onelie of penance inioyned, but also of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of sins, either al, or some part of them, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishment onely is meant to be pardoned. The second reason is as good. <hi>Sinne is vndiuisible, and so is the punishment for sinne and eternall, therefore it is onelie tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall punishment, which is released by daies and yeares.</hi> But what saie you then to moste full pardons of all sinne and all punishments, where there is no limitation of daies nor yeares? what saie you to the release of the third part or the seuenth part of all sinnes, beside ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand yeares of punishment remitted, as I haue shewed before in the Pardons of Alexander the fourth confirmed by Pope Leo the tenth within these eightie yeares?</p>
                        <p>The third argument is, <hi>that the magistrates of the Church, remit not so much as one daie of punishment due to Gods iustice for sinne, but by recompensing the want of mans satisfaction, with some portion of Christs abundant desertes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the vse of the keies, &amp;c.</hi> But what intollerable blasphemie is this to applie the merites of Christ but onelie in defaulte of mans satisfaction, whose bloode is the onelie purgation of our sinnes, whose righteousnes is the wholl propitiation for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whose redemption by his death purchased is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall for all them that are sanctified?

horrible blasphemie is it, to make a marchandise of the merites of Christ our sauiour, as the Pope doth in the saile of his pardons?

                           <hi>Perchaunce some Protestant will here call vs back, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire proofe, that there should be anie paine or tempor all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection remaining for those persons, which hauetheir sinnes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen by God in the sacrament of Penance, or otherwise by the onelie faith of the partie penitent, as he maie perhaps sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. If he list to be satisfied in this case, let him turne backe and make a short view of the works of God since the beginning, and there consider well, whether God him-selfe hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie visited his children receiued to mercie, with some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection answerable in respect of his iustice to the greeuousnes of the crime forgiuen. Who is so froward or so rude, but he may well discerne betwixt the sault of our first Father, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of euerlasting damnation deserued thereby? His sinne was one thing, his deserued punishment an other thing, his sinne was disobedience, his punishment correspondent to that, was euerlasting death. Yet whensoeuer one of these two is forgiuen, the other must needes be forgiuen also, because he can neither be subiect to damnation, whose sinne, for which damnation was ordeined, is forgiuen, neither his fault be forgotten, whose euerlasting punishing is pardoned, which is the rewarde of sinne. But now, both these being once, through Christ remitted to Adam, as we read in the booke of wisedome, who perceiueth not, that he was for all that long afterward</hi>

require proofe, not onely that after sinnes and eternal paines remitted, there are temporall paines remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to satisfie Gods iustice, but also if there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie such remaining, by what authoritie you should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease them. I know that often times, after sinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, God sendeth or suffereth a temporal paine to remaine, but that is not for satisfaction of his iustice; but for a mercifull chastisement, of his fatherlie disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.

                        <p>We see that god did chastise the Prophet Dauid and his posterititie with a rodde of man, and with a fatherlie correction, but his mercie and louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he neuer tooke from them.

Nay, they decreed, that whereas <hi>Geminius Victor,</hi> who had made <hi>Geminius Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus</hi> a clergie man his executor, contrarie to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of their synods, there should be no oblation made for his falling a sleepe, nor anie praier frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Church in his name.

toward so notorius offenders. Your conclusion follow eth not vpon this example, <hi>Cyprian and his fellow Bishope did vpon necessary cause release the time of pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce enioyned to certaine greeuous offenders, and receiued them to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion vpon certaine perswasion of their répentance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope and his popelings maie giue pardon of paine due for sinnes remitted,</hi> where hone is due, <hi>and in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of penance,</hi> when no such sacrament can be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of the scripture: neither doe you rightlie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Christes wordes, as those holie Fathers did: for they alledged them for the discipline of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and absoluing, which is necessarie to be vsed in the Church, but you to maintaine a tirannical iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, to loose that which other men haue bound, without good cause, as they did, but for manie often times, as they did neuer.

But in the doing of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:12222:381"/>
where such a crime is committed, that he which hath committed it, is also to be separated from the bodie of Christ, the measure of time is not so much to be considered, as of the sorrowe for God dispiseth not a contrite and an humbled heart. But because often times the sorrow of one mans heart is hidden to an other and commeth not into the knowledge of other men by wordes, or other signes whatsoeuer, although it be knowne before him, to whome it is said, my groning is not hid from thee, there be rightlie appointed by them that gouerne the Church, times of repentance, that the Church also maie be satisfied, in which those sinnes are remitted: for whithout they are not remitted. For she hath properlie receaued the pledge of the holie Ghost, without whome no sinnes are remitted, so that they to whome they are remitted doe obtaine eternall life.</hi> In these wordes Saint Augustine sheweth plainely that times of penance or repentance were enioyned, not to recompence Gods iustice, but to make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Church; which is not to graunt remission in those cases, but vpon good hope of the parties true conuersion and inwarde and vnfained repentance. But as Augustine speaketh here of open satisfaction not to Gods iustice, but to the Churches iudgement, so you haue his authority or as good, for secret satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is now more vsed, lest any man should feare that were not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to satisfy for the remnant of the debt, due for mortall sinnes forgiuen. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to impute it to ignorance, or impudencie, but most intollerable presumption it is, to make that author, whatsoeuer he was, a faulter of your popish secret satis faction, now vsed to be prescribed in your secret shrifts. For this writer, as I haue before declared, aloweth no secret satisfaction for the loosing of mortal crimes, but vpon a verie hard condition, namely, <hi>sed mutato priùs sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culari habitu, &amp;c. but so that the secular habit be first chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the studie of religion be confessed by correction of life, and continuall and perpetuall sorow, thorough the mercie of God, but so onelie that he doe contrarie things to them, for

                           <hi>Now to this ende haue we saied al this, that the faithful may vnderstand perfectlie, what the</hi> Pope <hi>may by right remit thorugh his Pardon and Indulgence. For looke what the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Gods Church may binde, that without all doubt may they vpon good consideration release againe. Therefore if they may enioyne penance for yeares and daies, both openlie out of the sacrament, and also in priuate satisfaction after Confession, then may they release certaine daies and yeares of the same pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which was prescribed before. For loosing and binding pertaine by reason, law, &amp; Christs owne graunt, as to one act of iurisdiction, that the one beeing lawfull, the other must needes so be also. If the Church be of right power and authoritie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe penance of seuen yeares, she hath the like right to remit vpon iust respect, either all those yeares, or some part of the same, especiallie hauing meanes otherwise, to supplie the lacke of fatisfaction of Gods iustice in the partie penitent.</hi>

                        <p>There is no faithfull man can perceiue by any thing that you haue saide, what right the Pope hath to remit by his pardon, and indulgence, that which is
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:12222:382" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enioyned by an other. It is out of doubt that the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church vpon good consideration, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease that which they binde, except for in emissibie sins they binde with insoluble bandes. And therefore they may release daies or yeares appointed for triall of the repentance, if the Church can be satisfied, in shorter time. But for priuate satisfaction of Gods iustice, or any satisfaction of his iustice, they can neither binde nor loose, enioyne, nor release. Therefore if the Church be of power to enioyne and prescribe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for seauen yeares, shee is of power also to release seuen yeares, or part of the same: but shee hath no meanes to supplie the satisfaction of Gods iustice, which is fullie satisfied in Christ, whose satisfaction is not to be disposed according to the iudgement of men, but is applied to all the elect of God, according to his will and pleasure. Now whereas you speake <hi>of seauen yeares penance,</hi> and the streightest <hi>Canons of Ancyre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe but 25. yeares for the greatest crime,</hi> whereto serue so many thousand yeares of Pardon? If therefore all that you haue saide tende to this ende, that men may vnderstand that the Pope hath power to release times of penance enioyned, seeing no councell euer enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a thousand yeares penance nor any penance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde the time of a mans life, in so much that the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice decreed that they which departe out of the world, should be receiued into the communion, although their time were not expired,</hi> why doth the Pope take vpon him to graunt <hi>an hundred thousand yeares of pardon</hi> at a clap, as I haue shewed before out of a pardon imprinted and confirmed by Leo 10? But if the Pope haue authoritie to graunt pardon for so many thousand yeares of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, enioyned by the right of binding and loosing, which you saie by reason, law, and graunt of Christ pertaine to one act of iurisdiction, that the one beeing lawfull, the other must needs be so also, Then may eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie priest enioyne an hundred, 50. 40. 10. or 7. thousand
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:12222:382"/>
yeares of penance to them that come to shrift, as wel as the Pope giue pardon for so many thousand yeares: for hundreds be but beggerly things to talke of, where thousand be so rife. If you answere, that the Pope doth pardon not onelie yeares of penance enioyned, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of yeares due to be enioyned; the difficultie is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auoided: for if thousands of yeares be due, the priest may enioyne thousands of yeares. But then he shal exceede al the Canons penitential, that euer were made in any councel, and yet be forced to graunt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at the houre of death.</p>

                           <hi>And therefore I ioyne in argument and open reason with our aduersaries thus: To giue pardon in moste common and Catholike sense of that worde, is to release some part, or all the enioyned penance for sinnes remitted: But the Pope, because he is the principall gouernour of Gods Church, may release any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance enioyned, vpon iust considerations:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Pope may lawfullie giue Pardons. The</hi> Minor, <hi>wherein the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries may perchance giue backe, I prooue thus: That which was bound by the Churches or Popes authoritie, may be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie loosed by the same authoritie againe, because Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ioyned in his graunt both these acts togetber, and they are prooued to be proper to one iurisdiction: But the Church by the Decrees of Bishops and Councells hath appointed such penance, and so many yeares of correction for sundrie faults: therefore the same Bishops, or such as be of the like authoritie, when they see occasion, may remit the penance of the saied yeares or some part of it, by limitation of daies or seasons, as the state of the penitent requireth, or the time it selfe doth mooue them.</hi>

                        <p>These arguments I like well, for they bewraie your infirmitie moste of al. And now for answere, I saie, that your <hi>Maior</hi> is false, as weil as your <hi>Minor:</hi> for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Popish sense of pardons is as the wordes of them pretend, that is, to giue pardon not onelie of penance enioyned, but also of sinnes. Againe the gouernours of the Church (as your <hi>Maior</hi> should haue beene framed, but that you dare not come within the compasse of a
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:12222:383"/>
lawfull, syllogisme) haue no power either to enioyne penance for sinnes remitted, or to remit penance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned for sins remitted, but of time of penance enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for satisfaction of the Church, as we heard latelie out of Saint Augustine, when the Church may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in shorter time. Your <hi>Minor,</hi> which you knew would not be admitted, you take vpon you to prooue, but you come nothing neere the matter: for this is the point of your <hi>Minor,</hi> which we denie, <hi>that the Pope is the principall gouernour of Gods Church,</hi> yea, that he is any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Gods Church. But if he were a Bishop of Rome, as many were, whose successour he claimeth to be, he might be allowed in his Church of Rome to binde and loose, enioyne and remit, so farre as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an discipline will beare, but not to claime tiranie ouer all Churches, as he doth. Now you in your mishapen syllogisme, in which you fumble diuerse matters toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to deceiue the ignorant, prooue that the Church and gouernours thereof haue power to release that which they haue power to enioyne, which is not the matter in controuersie. But whether they haue power to enioyne penance for sinnes remitted, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere Gods iustice, or whether the Pope be a lawfull gouernour of the Church, these and such like be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of controuersie, which you are neuer able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in any lawfull and true syllogisme.</p>

                        <p>In the first Chapter of this booke you charged the reader to abide the orderlie methode and compasse of this cause. but the methode you follow is such, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth your cause, namelie the methode of deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, which is that you call the compasse of your cause. For true methode requireth to proceede from things more &amp; better knowne, to things lesse knowne, as it were to build vpon a good foundation, but your manner is to assume that which is the chiefe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in controuersie, and thereupon to builde as it were vpon an imaginarie fundation, &amp; afterwarde to make a florish in wordes, and a vaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> of confirming your foundation. As in this cause it had beene moste necessarie, if the compasse of your cause could haue borne it, to haue first prooued substantiallie that there remaineth temporall punishment after sinne remitted to satisfie the iustice of God. Then that the iustice of God not satisfied by the act of Christs sacrifice, on the crosse, may be satisfied afterward. Thirdlie the meane wherby it may be satisfied, which you cal the treasure of the Church. fourthly that dispensation therof belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the pope: &amp; these things once prooued, the way had beene plainner to bring in the Popes pardons, for proofe of which to be good, you haue plaide the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour all this while. But these matters must be dainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie touched, the compasse of your cause can not abide to haue them thoroughlie handled. And therefore it is sufficient to affirme them, for other proofe you haue none of them. And yet as though you brought with you noe worsse then mathematicall demonstrations, you blow the trumpe afore hand to giue more light to the matter, the greater ouerthrow to falsehood, to driue the cause forward, and weigh the wholl state of things. And what saie you to the purpose? forsooth, you tell vs, <hi>that there be three kindes of punishment of mans sinnes after they be remitted.</hi> But sir, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue you not, where is your demonstration? Why?
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:12222:385" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Is it not sufficient that M. Allen saith so? what an vnrea sonable man are you, that will not learne to abide the orderlie methode, and compasse of the cause? well, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we muste haue none other proofe of your sayings let vs see what you say: first, <hi>the fruites of repentance, which man chargeth himselfe with all, are none.</hi> What those be I know not, except it be some superstitious vowes, and such like matters: but the fruites of repentance, which God chargeth a man withal, be so necessarie to be brought forth, that otherwise the repentance is fained, and thereof followeth no remission. Againe ciuill pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is none, and yet nothing is more like to prooue that purpose. what is it then? <hi>The first &amp; easiest is that penance which is enioyned in secret confession.</hi> In deed that is easie, and such as may encourage men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sinnes, for which they make so easie satisfaction, <hi>toties, quoties.</hi> But what is the effect of this satisfactió? <hi>It standeth for a full satisfaction before God, when it is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</hi> What alwaie? <hi>Nay often times if it be any thing correspondent to the crimes.</hi> Then is there no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie in this matter, but in steede of a quietnes of conscience, a torment followeth vpon it, if the sinner be not assured that his penance enioyned will goe for paiement or satisfaction. Well when this easie pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is a full satisfaction, whence taketh it so great force? you answere, <hi>small workes by force of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are verie effectuall.</hi> But to prooue this patch of Poperie to be a sacrament, what daie wil you take? for that which is the grounde of al your disputation is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied of vs as you know.

                           <hi>The second way of punishment is appointed by the Canons generallie, for such faultes as be committed after Baptisme, that is to saie, by the lawes of the Church, or Decrees of Bishops and chiefe Magistrates thereof, and is called</hi> Canonicall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. <hi>Which is much more sparpe and greeuous then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in priuate penance is commonlie giuen, and a great
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:12222:385"/>
deale more answerable to Gods iustice and the greeuousnes of the crimes committed. And so the Canons were not onelie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, as some iudge not right of them, for open offences, to satisfie the Church and the offence of the people, but also euen for secret sinnes, as we may perceiue by Saint Augustine, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, and other that haue written of penance. And this waie prescribed satisfaction by the auncient decrees of Councells, which lightlie appointed seuen yeares of penance for euerie deadelie sinne, was almost a rule for such as heard secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions to moderate their penance by, which they lightlie gaue to the penitents euen after the limitation of the saide decrees &amp; auncient Canons. Now to giue so many yeares or daies of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, signifieth the iniunction or prescriptions of fasts by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine weekelie thoroughout the said prefixed times, or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alfasting from moste meates euerie daie in all those yeares of penance, other then would suffice for susteining of nature, as bread and water, and such shinne diet, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And this great penance was in the Primitiye Church prescribed by the Canons, not onelie for cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell and prouision for the like sinnes afterward to be committed (then when the Church had her punishment for sinnes, seuerall from the paines appointed by the ciuill lawes for the same) but also for the satisfiyng of gods iustice for the penitents sinnes, the burden whereof, then was counted (as indeede it is) so intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, that neither the Church spared to enioyne great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, nor the offenders refused to receiue and accomplish the same with humilitie. This therefore is the second waie of puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shment or prescription of penance for mortall sinnes remitted, or in waie to be remitted, by the penance of the partie. In which kinde, you may account also the seuere punishments which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the soull moste, although sometimes they are ioyned vnto some corporall afflictions, as excommunication, suspension, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation, &amp; such like: for al these were vsual in the beginning

                           <hi>Canonical punishment,</hi> as we heard latelie in the next Chapter before, was, <hi>vt satis fait Ecclesiae, to make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Church,</hi> and not to the iustice of God, who accepteth a contrite and an humble heart thorough the vertue of Christs death and passion, as a full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his instice.

Austine, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, and others that haue written of penance. If it be as you saie, why be not their sayings set downe, and we with them that iudge not rightlie conuinced by them? At lest why be not the places quoted, where we may perceiue such a matter? belike the compasse of the cause cannot abide it, as also you sate, <hi>this fal of our strength and manners could scarse beare such streight penance, as by the Canons is prescribed.</hi> You ioyne two things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of diuerse natutes. If the strength of mans bodie be so greatly fallen as they are not able to endure such hard punishment, the Church should of dutie initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the rigor of those Canons, and not send men to secke pardons for them. Whereas many a man that hath needc, lacketh either monie or other occasions, to purchase pardons: but if the manners of men be so dissolute as they like not streight penance, they are more dissolute vnto sinne, and so had need of the bitte of streighter penance to keepe them in, then the raine of pardons, and easie penance to let them runne. You repeat againe that this penance Canonicall was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, not onelie for cautele and prouision against the like sinnes, but also for satisfying of Gods iustice. But hereof no proofe at all, but a bare affirmation.</p>

Surelie if you would become su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his holines, for a large pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie the whole paine of bodelie sicknes, you might

doe an acceptable deede, and be well paied for your paines. But if the Popes pardon be not able to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie the paine of one scabbe or flebiting, you wil hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perswade vs, that it can take awaie all the paine of purgatorie, if it were prooued that anie such paine or place were after this life. But <hi>if the pardon</hi> (saie you) <hi>determine the number of daies, or yeares, then it releaseth but part of the pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce onlie,</hi> as you bring exampls of 20. daies pardon: but if the pardon determine the number of yeares, to an hundred thousand yeares, then this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is insufficient: yet you haue an other quirke to helpe it afterward, by stretching it into purgatorie, your imaginarie prison. But the auncient canons neuer inioyned so manie yeares penance, nor neuer did anie Catholike Bithoppe graunt pardon of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie yeares. Saint Cyprian, as we heard before, with his colleagues determined to release some parte of the appointed time vpon good hope of the amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the parties, and great signes shewed of their heartie repentance, and for daunger of present perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution at hand. <hi>Saint Paull</hi> receiued the incestuous person vnto the fellowship of the Church, vpon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <hi>The Councel of Nice also willed the Bishops in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fruits of repentance ripebefore the time, assigned by the Canons, to deale more gently with the lapsed persons.</hi> But all these haue no resemblance with the Antichristian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of the Pope, which are not graunted vpon like cause, nor by a person of like authoritie, nor to persons of like qualites, nor to the like end, nor onelie of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance enioyned, but of such as no man would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne, beside remission <hi>à culpa &amp; pana,</hi> or if not for all sinnes, yet for some third or seauenth parteof sinnes, or else full remission of all sinnes, beside 8000. yeares, and 8000.

Penance that maie concerne our persons. Therefore the gouernours of the Church often, to mooue the people to such necessarie denotion giueth them a release of all paine due for their sinnes, or at least, of the bonde of their enioyned penance onelie vpon respect of some smal furtherance in such a good and Godlie purpose.</hi>

                        <p>We acknowledge that pardoning of ecclesiastical pu nishment, commonly called penance, is very auncient. And being graunted by them that had authoritie, vpon good consideration is very necessary. But it is very yong and new, that the Pope should take vpon him, though he proceeded no further then pardon of penance enioy nedto release the penance enioyned by the gouernours of other Churches, to persons whose repentance he knoweth not, &amp; for other causes, then of auncient were allowed, and especiallie for money. But now vpon this auncient, and accustomed practize of Gods Church, let vs see what Antichrist can claime: and that is set forth in an assured argument. <hi>Saint Paull did remit;</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian, with the Bishops of Afrike, and the Nicene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell doth allow remitting of penance prescribed; therefore the Pope by their example maie remit enioyned penance, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie giue a pardon.</hi> Call you this an assured argument for pardons, where there wanteth one leg, and that the better leg of the argument to stand vpon? Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doth well admonish that in an Enthimeme lightlie the weaker part is hidden, and not expressed. For this argument euerie man maie lawfullie denie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you adde the <hi>Maior,</hi> that whatsoeuer Saint Paull, Saint Cyprian with his fellowes, and the Nicene coun cell lawfullie did, and allowed, the Pope doing as they did, maie lawfullie do. But then this <hi>Maior</hi> will be denied, and so the conclusion will not holde. For the Pope is neither anie gouernour, nor yet any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church of Christ. But if he were a lawfull Bishop he might do within his owne charge, as Saint Paul, Saint Cyprian, and the rest with the Nicen coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:12222:389"/>
did and allowed to be done. And yet if he were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be a Bishop, and would graunt such pardons, as he doth, to men of other Churches, and vpon such occasions as he doth, this argument would not defend him, because the <hi>Minor</hi> would not follow him: for neither Saint Paull, Saint Cyprian, nor the councell of Nice graunted such pardons, to such persons, and for such causes, as he doth: therefore he followeth not their example, but his owne presumption. Yet let vs see how this argument is fortified. First the paine prescribed by law he maie release, because he is the principall executor of the law. But who will allow him anie such principalitie in the Church, that is no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the same? Secondlie he maie remit the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance enioyned by the Priest, because he is superiour to all piestes, which is nothing but a miserable beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of that which is in controuersie. The like is to be said of his <hi>changing of penance,</hi> whereby he challengeth the like authority. Although his changing of sharpe pe nance into easie paiment, doth bewray what is the end of such permutation: money is intended, whatsoeuer is pretended. <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the 2. in the councell of Clare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounte, exhorting men of al nations to the warre of Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rusalem, began that release of penance, for seruing in that cause, which his successours afterward haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as a gaie and gainfull pretense, when they were disposed to enrich their coffers, and mantaine their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate quarrels.</p>

                           <hi>The like they do also often, to set forward other workes of charitie, to the benefit of Gods people, as for the relieuing of Hospitals, of Churches, of high waies, and such like. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againe, they extende their power, which Christ gaue them, to edifie his Church. and increase religion and deuotion in the people, as when thy giue pardon for so manie daies to such as shall receiue the blessed Sacrament, faste and praie, that heresie maie cease in the Church, that the enemies of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie maie not preuaile, that infidels, Iewes, and heretikes

maie be conuerted, and Schismatikes knit them-selues obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie to the fellowship of Chistes folde.

they giue anie iudgement thereof, That the gouernours of the Church, should remit Canonicall correction, and priuse sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, with the bonde of penance, either enioyned, or els which by the lawes spirituall might be enioyned, manie will confesse. But that their power should reach to the remitting of that paine, which Gods hand hath laied vpon the offender of temporall correction, that they vnderstand not. Truely, for this they must be instructed, first, that the temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God taketh on sinners that be penitent, though it standeth by the law of nature, aud was practized of the laws of nature, and was practized of God himselfe before anie mans lawes were made for puuishment of sinnes, yet now it riseth prin cipallie, vpon lack of punishing of our selues, or the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing of such penance, as the Church of God prescribeth.

For first the ground of al your disputation is vtterlie false; that God
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:12222:391"/>
punisheth for sinnes remitted, to satisfie his iustice. And therefore though I graunt your first consideration (which is, that God punisheth vs for sinne the more, because we punish not our selues) yet I may not graunt your conclusion, the argument whereof is nothing, but your asseueration: <hi>if the Church punish her childrens faults by sharpe discipline, doubtles it satisfieth Gods righteousnes.</hi> For no punishing, or suffering of punishment can satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Gods iustice, or anie part thereof, but the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment suffered by Christ, who was beaten for our faults and striken for our offences: and therefore his suffering is a full satisfaction for our vnrighteousnes. Neither doth Saint Paull speak of anie discipline in the life to come, when he exhorteth vs to iudge ourselues: but sheweth that the punishment, or iudgement, which God executeth in this world vpon his children, is a cha stisment, that we be not condemned with the world, as they that neither by doctrine, nor by punishment are brought to repentance. your next conclusion is, that the bond of anie temporall punishment to be inflicted by God him selfe, doth not binde man, but for lack of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie discipline, to be taken in this life. But this conclusion you your selfe do afterward denie, when you affirme, <hi>that bodelie punishment commeth vpon men for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other causes, then for correction for sinne onelie, or a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of a mans life past.</hi> Finallie, if purgatorie do binde no man, but in respect of satisfying gods iustice, so long as it is certaine, that Gods iustice is satisfied toward al his elect, in the death and obedience of Christ, it is out of doubt that purgacorie hath nothing to do with anie of Gods elect, to whome <hi>Christ is giuen of his father to be wisdome, righteousnes, holines, and redemption, that as it is written, he that reioyceth, maie reioyce in the Lord.</hi>

Seeing the afflictions of this life were brought to prooue that <hi>there be three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse waies of temporal punishment remaining after sinnes be remitted, euerie of which waies maie in some cases be released in parte, or in wholl, by the Popes pardons,</hi> how happeneth it, that we can haue no experience of the Popes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donsin releasing any man of the temporall afflictions of this life, as sicknes, imprisonment, &amp;c, You answer that these bodilie afflictions maie be for other causes, &amp; so flie quite from your holde; yet that you may stand in a corner, &amp; pelt your enemies, you turne again &amp; say. <hi>that you dare be bold to say, if any man were sick by gods appoint ment, for that cause onely, &amp;c. that he should straight waie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer vpon the discharging of that debt which he did owe to gods iustice:</hi> but a pardon wil discharge that debt: therfore a pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil make him recouer. This I confes, is boldly said of you, But where is the experience: shew one man that euer recouered by the Popes pardon among so many 1000. sick persons, as haue receaued the Popes pardon: was neuer none sick by gods appointment, for satisfying
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:12222:393" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his iustice onelie? But admit he were sick for other causes, as welll as for that, should not the popes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at the least take away some parte of his sicknes, namelie so much as was laid vpon him for that cause onelie? Let the Pope, if he will make triall of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the confusion of his abuersaries, graunt a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pardon to all Papistes, as he maie easilie do, and then let it be tryed whether anie one shall straight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer of his bodelie sicknes, or other affliction, or how manie shall be eased in their bodilie or wordly afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Prouided alwaies that we haue no counter fait crankes, that shall step vp sodenlie recouered of that disease, whereof they were neuer sick. But if you dare be bolde to saie, <hi>that the Popes pardon can cause anie man to recouer straight vpon the recept of it,</hi> you must also be bolde to say that the popes pardon can worke miracles: for no man can sodainlie recouer of any disease which is not come to the period, without miracle, if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cause thereof be not first taken awaie. But alas who doth not see your miserable startinghole, <hi>if that infirmitie were for none other cause, but that onelie, as it may be for manie mo, wherof no man can easilie iudge.</hi> A wretched clout to hide your infirmitie, where no one example a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so manie thousand as are sick in the world, can be shewed.

For Canonicall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance &amp; satisfaction, you haue changed to arbitrary penance &amp; satisfaction, which you confes to be but a signe of the Canonicall, &amp; nothing agreeable to the faultes committed. And of the same arbitrarie satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, with all the desertes thereof, you haue set the release to sale, in your popes Pardons; which in effect is nothing else, but to sel a lisentiousnes of sinne, when you haue taken awaie all feare of punishment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froe: eternall by shrift, and temporall by pardons, and pelting commutations, without exacting true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:12222:397" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the true fruites thereof, which appeere in amendment of life. But to follow your vaine, you say <hi>the penance enioyned in the primitiue Church, was so large, that it might seeme very answerable to the nature of the fault.</hi> It is true, that as the faultes were greater, so the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was harder for satisfying of the Churches iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in accepting the offenders repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to the Church. But there was no meaning to satisfie the iustice of god, vnsatisfied in the sacrifice of Christes death, howsoeuer you make it a doubtles case, as also you vse to doe euerie thing, by bolde and stout asseueration, which you are not able to prooue by anie sound or probable argument. Well, if it were, as you saie, there was no vse of pardons in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, nor feare of purgatory paines, which is a true conclusion, although it be brought in vpon false principles. <hi>But now,</hi> you saie, <hi>the Church by instigation of Gods spirit, graunteth manie great Pardons, because the people in respect of their great sinnes, and small or no penance and satisfaction for them, had neuer so much need to hang on pardon.</hi> In deed the greater mens sinnes be, the more need they haue that grace and mercie should abound for the release of them: but then they must haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the fountaine of mercie and onelie ground, where grace groweth, euen the God of all consolation reconciled in Iesus Christ, vnto all them that trulie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their sins, &amp; purpose vnfeinedlie to lead a new life agreeable to his lawes, and commandements. But whereas the popish Church taking awaie in a manner all sorrow for sione, and feare of punishment, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering satisfaction of pardons, openeth a wide field vnto all wickednes, and beside teacheth men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the pardon of a man, who commonlie sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the same for aduauntage, and disposeth it at his pleasure, it is out of doubt she doth this by the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Deuill, and not by the spirit of God. For the spirit of God is the spirit of trueth, of purenes &amp; of

holines, giuing no licence, encouragement, or consent to continue in sin, as the doctrine of pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s doth most manifestly; the blasphemie of which is more to be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, then the follie to be laughed at, of al them, that be zelous of Christes glorie, &amp; saluation of his people.</p>

But whereas <hi>these yeares be expressed in pardons, in titles of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or vse of certaine creatures,</hi> the last of these are said to be <hi>sanctified, and made holie by Gods worde and praier.</hi> Why Sir? <hi>All the creatures of God are sanctified,</hi> in the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vse of them, <hi>by the worde of God and by praiers,</hi> as the Apostle teacheth vs, to which no such pardon is annexed. Who is he then that despising the holines giuen by God to all his creatures, in the ordinarie vse of them, taketh vpon him to adde agreater holines to certeine creatures, to applie them to another vse, and ioyne not onelie holines vnto them; but also remission of sinnes, and of paine due for sinnes to the vse of them, for which he hath no word of God to warrant him, and therefore can haue no praier to helpe him? surelie this can be none other, then he that exalteth himselfe aboue God, which can make Gods creatures more holie then God hath made them. But now for this number of yeares, wherof you make your Audit at your pleasure, valuing me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s offences in a heauy balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to make your popes pardons seeme more probable, &amp; saleable, your account neuertheles will fall short of many thousand yeares, by your former reckoning. You confessed in the beginning of this Chapter, <hi>that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction limited by the Canons was agreeable in all points to
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:12222:399"/>
the debt of sinnes forgiuen, which God required for answer of his iustice.</hi> Further you must remember, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons did limit times of penance, not onelie for an act of sinne, but also for customable continuance in such sinnes, as you may see in the decrees of <hi>Iuo</hi> quoted by you before, and in the <hi>Ancyran Councell.</hi> Now if you will faine a man to be such a monster, as that he haue committed all these sinnes, for which the Canons doe limit times, and haue continued in them also accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mablie, yet by those Canons he could not deserue so many thousand yeares of penance as the Pope graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of pardon. Nay if you make your Audit of the times limited sor all offences, adding all the daies, yeares, and Lents prescribed in the Canons together, you shall not finde the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of one thousand yeares of penance due to be inioyned, if a man had commited al those sinnes. Whereof it followeth, that so many 1000 yeares as haue bin ordinarily graunted by the Popes pardons, can haue no such meaning, as your dreame of Audit and account surmiseth, and so it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, that these numbers of yeares were multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onelie to set a greater price of the pardons, &amp; so to robbe both the purses of the people, and deceiue their soules. For the old Canons neuer appointed anie time of penance for anie time, exceeding the time of a mans life: but 7. yeares 14. yeares, 24. yeares, &amp;c, or to the end of a mans life at the most, and alwaies the partie to be receiued at his end, though he had not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished his time perfixed. It is not the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the old canons therefore, that can excuse so manie thousand yeares of pardon for paine to be suffered in purgatorie, seeing you acknowledge the time by them limited, to be limited by the spirit of god, as agreeable in all points to the debt of sinnes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, which God requirerth for answer of his iustice. But blessed be god, who hath taken sufficient satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to answer his iustice in the obedience &amp; suffering of

For the might, the force,, the hougenes, the excesse, and the nature of the paine in the next world, is so fearefull and so great, as Saint Augustine often noteth, that a great deale lesse time sufferance of the same, is answerable to much more in the world and this</hi>

For what comparation is there berwixt a daies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting here, &amp; a daies punishment in purgatorie? better it were surely to suffer a hundred yeares such penance as the Church prescribeth in this mortall life, that hath in it much worldlie ease, and comfort for the release of the inioyned paine, then to abide one daie or wecke in so greeuous a torment, as the holie Doctours and all the Church holdeth</hi> Purgatorie <hi>to be. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to forgiue such a greeuous sinner in the latter end of his life receiued to mercie, as we haue now spoken of, a thousand or two thousand yeares of penance, is as much in effect and nature of the termes, as to remit and release him of so much punishment, or the debt and bond of so much punishment in</hi> purgatorie, <hi>as is proportionall and correspondent to so manie daies or years</hi>

To be short then &amp; plaine, to giue a pardon of a 10001. or 2000. yeares or moe, if the graunt goeth so, is as much to saie, as to forgiue so much punishment as might be answerable for so great penance, not fullfilled in this life. As if I were behinde with the Church and indebted to God

hard before my death of a hundreth daies fasting, in which case, I cannot recompence, if my Bishoppe then, or the chiefe head of all the Eccle siasticall Hierachie doe forgiue me twenty of the said daies, then my punishment shalbe so much lesse in</hi> Purgatorie, <hi>not by twenty daies, I saie, of</hi> Purgatorie <hi>paines, but by as much as in force of satisfaction there, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to twentie daies fast here.

                           <hi>Some may here maruel perchance, that such power should be giuen to mortall men, as to remit such great portion of penance, as by iustice ought to be enioyned, or such a number of yeares, as are appointed for satisfaction &amp; correction of former misdeeds, thereby to remooue from the partie the heauy hand of god prepared for iudgement, who would not wonder much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, if they considered that the debt of hell paines and eternity of punishment, which incomparablie exceedeth manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares, might by the Priestes office, and alwaies is in the due execution of the sacrament of penance, fully remooued from the partie penitent. And where mercy putteth away deserued damnation, there may much lesse force of grace turne awaie the punishment of</hi> Purgatorie, <hi>being not transitorie, and equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent onelie to the penance of a number of yeares prescribed. In which case, if the Church of God should haue no preheminence now after the incarnation of Christ, since which time the waiet of mercie towardes mankinde must needs be much enlarged, our state &amp; gouernment should be much inferiour to the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and to the priesthood of the old law, which trulie did in al things, but as a shadow and figure, resemble the Maiesty of our Churches prcheminence, especiallie there, where mercy &amp; grace were to be shewed, which came by Christ Iesus.</hi>

                           <hi>Behold then some sleppe of this most excellent power giuen to our chiefe Priestes, in the persons of Moses and Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, whoe are noted in the booke of</hi> Exodus <hi>and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers meruelouslie to haue procured Gods mercie, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:12222:402"/>
by force of sacrifice, praier, and singular zeale, to hauere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased some great portion of the paines and punishment which God himselfe by his owne mouth and determination had laied vpon the people. With what meruelous confidence of his office, and pitie of the afflicted sort, did one of them crie out vnto god to holde his hand, and pardon the people, after they had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued se great punishment for worspiping the golden Idoll of the Calfe in the wildernes?</hi> Lord (<hi>saith Moses</hi>) this people hath committed an horrible sinne, and they haue erected golden Gods. Forgiue them this sinne, Lord, or ells if thou wilt not, dash me out of thy booke to, which thou hast written. <hi>This gouernour and this priest, praied not after a common sort for pardon of the peoples punishment, but he claimeth it wish confidence, and in a manner requireth it as by his iurisdiction and office. Such was the force of praier and priesthood, before Christs spirituall souer aignitie was honoured in the worlde, otherwise then in a figure. And yet, god in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was at that point with them then, that he would pardon &amp; punish at their pleasures. For when the sinne was exceeding greeuous, he maketh as it were meanes to Moses, that he should not stay him, nor his anger, from punishing of the offendors,</hi> Let me alone Moses (<hi>saith our Lord</hi>) &amp; suffer me to be angrie. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

                        <p>Men may iustly maruell, that you professing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, doe set the Cart before the horse, and frame of your building, the roofe, before the foundation: but if they consider that this way you take is of more force to confounde a simple witte, then to teach a matter plainlie, they maie cease to maruell; and acknowledge that the compasse of your cause, whereof you speake in the beginning, will abide none other order. But to the matter and argument of this Chapter it hath bin answered before, that in the discipline of the Church, the gouernours thereof haue power vpon good consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and triall of the offenders repentance, and not otherwise, at their pleasure to release enioyned time of repentance, which was enioyned for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end so much, as to bring the party to repentanes
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:12222:402" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and thereof to assure, or satisfie the Church. But as the discipline of the Church militant, serueth for the onelie time of her warfare in this life, so the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church haue no authoritie either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne, or to release, out of the compas of this life. And therefore this power of binding &amp; loosing vpon earth, cannot be extended to anie purgatorie paines, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pickpurse, after this life, and consequentlie it can be no shadowe to couer the filthie and blasohemous nundination and chaffering of the Popes pardons, for thousands and hundreth thousands of yeares. What authority the ministers of the Church haue in remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sinnes, hath beene handled sufficientlie before. They are Gods messengers, to declare his forgiuenes to them that trulie repent, and so they are to release the bande of discipline in open offenders, where the fruites of repentance doe appeare. Your argument, <hi>that the priesthood in the new law is of more power to purchase mercie, then in the olde lawe,</hi> to prooue that the Popes pardons extend vnto purgatorie, is verie farre fett. For the priest hood of our sauiour Christ, hath succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the priesthood of the lawe, as the bodie to the figure or shadow thereof. But purchasing of mercie perteineth not to the ministers of the Church, but preaching and declaring of Gods mercie: wherein they excell the preaching office of the priests of the lawe, in more large, plaine, and cleare demonstration thereof, in Christ exhibited, borne, suffered, raised from deade, and ascended into heauen, not in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mercie, or the onelie meane meritorius to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, which is Iesus Christ. As for the discipline of the Church now, is not vnlike to the discipline then, neither is there anie cause in respect of Christ exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it should be anie Iooser now, then it was then. For <hi>the grace of God which bringeth saluation to all men hath appeered, instructing vs that we should vtterly denie vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and worldlie lustes, and liue soberlie, iustlie, and godly in this <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11. &amp;c.</note>

world waiting for the blessed hope, and glorious appearing, of the great god, and our sauiour Iesus Chist, which hath giuen himselfe for vs, that he might redeeme vs from all iniouity, and purge vs a peculiar people vnto himselfe, zelous of good works.</hi> Thus the holy Ghost describeth the end and effect of the mercie of God in Christ exhibited, chargeing Titus to speake and exhort to these thinges, to reprehend with alear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnes, and suffer no man to contemne him. There is no cause therefore why the sinnews of discipline in the Church of Christ, should be loosened, or rather cutte in sunder by the Podes pardons, which taketh vpon him to release all time of repentance appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the gouernours of the Church, vnder pretense of greater mercie showed by Christ, then was shewed in the olde law. <hi>But Maises and Aaron,</hi> you saie, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured mercie and pardon for the people,</hi> and then you bring in the example of paid no breined for worshipping the golden Image of a calse, where Aaron him selse was so deepe in, that he was no meete person to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for others. But in the example you prooue not anie power or iurisdiction of priesthood, which doth ser forth onelie the effect of the praier of the faithfull, as Saint Iames suth of <hi>Helias,</hi> that he <hi>was a man and yet obteined great thinges by his praier.</hi> Neither doth Moses pray with confidence of his priest lie office, which he had not: for Aaron was priest, both by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the elder, and afterward by Gods especiall appointment, but Moses praieth vpon confidence of Gods promises, which were these, that the people shoulde be brought into the lande of Chanaon, and that Christ should come of the tribe of Iuda, which could not haue had their effect, if all the people had beene destroied, though a great nation had beene made of Moses. He strengthneth his faith also, by two other reasons in his praier, the one of the glorie of God, which should be blasphemed by the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, if the people were destroyed in the wildernes,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:12222:403"/>
the other of the benefites of God alreadie bestowed vpon the people, which should be in vaine, if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shoulde thus sodenlie be consumed. But of clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it with confidence of his priesthood, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, as by his iurisdiction and office, there is no mention. For what iurisdiction or office could he haue to controll God in his iudgements? And therefore it is a horrible blasphemous saying, that <hi>God in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was at that point with them, that he would pardon and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish at their pleasures.</hi> Where your meaning is yet more biasphemous, that God should much rather he at that point now, to pardon and punish, at the Popes pleasure, which is nothing els, but to exalte Antichrist aboue God, when his iustice and mercie should depend vpon that deuill incarnates pleasure. Yet for reason to excuse this blasphemie, you saie, <hi>that God maketh as it were meanes to Moses, that he shoulde not staie him, nor his anger from punishing of the offenders: Let me alone Moses</hi> (saith our Lord) <hi>and suffer me to be angrie.</hi> But who is so meanlie exercised in the scriptures, that he doth not acknowledge, that this speech of God, as a thousand more in the scriptures, is vttered after the affection and infirmitie of man, whereof God is moste free, yet condescending to the weakenes of mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, often vseth so to speake? Of which phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of speech, who so shall conclude as you doe, maie inferre an hundred horrible heresies, and more. The true sense therefore of those wordes is, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple indeede had deserued to be destroied, but that he had otherwise determined at the praier of Moses, and for those causes, which his spirit instructed Moses to vtter, whome by this speech he prouoketh and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp to pretie for the people, he was purposed to pardon and spare them, not that he euer was of minde to submitt his iustice and mercie to mens pleasure, in such sorte as he shoulde be driuen to make meanes to men, that he might execute his iudgementes, and
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:12222:404"/>

But whereas God enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Marie seuen daies separation, you should haue made your argument somewhat more probable, if you could haue shewed out of the scripture, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by his pontificall iurisdiction, released those daies, or anie part of them. The example of Aarons inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, as he was the high priest, shewed the effect of

Christes priesthood, of whome he was a figure, whose perfect sacrifice represented in the incense, was a sweete sauour of reconciliation vnto God, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation not onelie of the Israelites, but of all Gods elect both from temporall and eternall destruction.

For he was the Lord, and we are his seruantes, yet he so terrifyed, that we all ought to feare. For which of vs is without sinne? which when he had said to them, by whome the sinner was offered to be punished, that he which knew him-selfe to be without sinne should first cast a stone at her, their crueltie fell downe by trembling of their conscience. For then they slipping awaie out of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, left the poore wretch alone to him that is mercifull. Let the pietie of Christians giue place to this sentence, to which the impietie of the Iewes gaue place: let the humilitie of them that are obedient giue place to that, to which the pride of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors gaue place: let the confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the faithful yeld to that, whereto yeelded the dissembling of the tempter.</hi> What haue we here for this strange iurisdiction? or for the Popes pardons in this example, or in the example of Saint Augustine excommunicating or suspending of Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius for violating the priuiledge of the Church in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king awaie a man worthie to die, that fled thether for succour, when he did not execute, as you saie, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored him vnhurt to life, as appearerh by his answere. The pronnesse of Ecclesiasticall persons vnto mercie and pitie, may be gathered by this example, but no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prooue the Popes pardons to be good, that I saie not, it may be doubted whether such clemencie standeth with Gods iustice, that commaundeth the murtherer to be drawen euen from his aultar &amp; to be executed. And Augustine himselfe in his Epistle of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession commendeth the punishing mercie, and con demneth <note place="margin">Exod. 21. 14.</note> the pardoning crueltie: beside that, we muste liue according to laws, and not according to examples. <note place="margin">Macedo. 54.</note>

                           <hi>Againe Christ deliuered in the fift of Saint Iohn, one that had beene feeble eight and thirtie yeares long for a punishment of his sinnes: and that he might vnderstand, that, that sicknes came vnto him for correction of his former offences, he said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him after in the temple:</hi> Lo, thou art made wholl, looke thou sinne no more, least a worse thing happen vnto thee. <hi>Neither is it vnlike, but the partie had his sinnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted long before Christ healed him of his corporall infirmity, by the sacrifices of the law, and by ordinarie meanes of that time, through the faith in Christ Iesus. Whereby you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that our high Bishop Christ hath giuen pardon to many, not onelie of their sinnes and euer lasting damnation, but also of the temporall paine and punishment, either prescribed by the law, or enioyned by Gods owne appointment. Then we neede not wonder, that the Churches officer, holding by his right both the title to pardon and to punish, should be by his example so prone to mercie, which of the two is alwaies moste commended in spirituall regiment.</hi>

                        <p>Christ healed many that suffered punishment of bodelie diseases for their sinnes, to shew that he was appointed of god to be the heauenly phisitian to heale the diseases of our soules by pardoning our sinnes. But that <hi>the partie whereof</hi> you speake, <hi>had his sinnes remitted long before Christ healed him of his corprall infirmitie by sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the law, and ordinarie meanes of that time, through the faith in Christ Iesus,</hi> though you saie, <hi>it is like,</hi> yet it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnlike. For he had laien eight and thirtie yeares in the portch of Siloam, waighting for the miraculous manner of healing, that God shewed at certain times vppon them that first entred aster the water of the poole was mooued. All which time it is not like, that he could be partaker of the sacrifices, or ordinarie meanes, by which remission of sinnes thorough faith in Iesus Christ was testified to the participants of those meanes. But rather, as his owne wordes sound, it is like he was onelie attentiue to the vsuall meane which God shewed to attein health of bodie thereby,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:12222:407"/>
not caring for true repentance, and conuersion to god, yet it appeareth he had small taste of spirituall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, when he knew not of whome he receiued the benefit of health, and so was vnthankesull vnto him for it. But what is concluded out of this example? that the officers of the Church in spirituall regiment, ought to be prone to mercie. Many examples prooue that more directlie: but that the officers of the Church haue power to punish and pardon as Christ had, this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple prooueth not.</p>

                           <hi>Neuerthelesse we meane not, that the priest hath alwaies such power as Christ had in remoouing of bodelie sickenes, not onelie because they know not when it is the deserued paine for sinne, as he did, but also because, as Saint Augustine saith, Remissio in Ecclesia magis fit propter futurum iudicium: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning in the Church hath more respect to the iudgement of the next worlde: he meaneth by the temporall iudgement, and for that he alledgeth out of Saint Paull, that the iudgement, which he willeth vs to preuent by punishing our selues, is the correction of such as God loueth, lest, they be damned with the worlde, which cannot signifie the euerlasting iudgement. Wee meane not then, that the</hi> Pardons <hi>of the Ecclesiasticall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates should perteine to the releasing of bodelie paines duely deserued for sinne, or for other causes appointed, because Christ so did not vnto all, but vnto some, as it pleased his wisedome: but this we saie, that as he of his mercie tooke away and released the sinners of certaine temporall afflictions, as well appointed by the law of Moses, as enioyned by Gods owne hand, and so gaue a</hi> Pardon <hi>of that which both Moses and his owne Father appointed: euen so maie the Apostles and their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, pardon anie man, that is worthie of that benefite, of some parte or all such penance, as their owne lawe prescribed, or the iustice of God, vpon the bonde of their decrees, and the debt of the sinners, hath in the next life prepared. Although, as I haue once noted before, not onelie the Apostles miraculouslie, but also Gods Priests dailie doe heale in the sacrament of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame vnction and praiers, not onelie sinnes, but the penitent
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:12222:407" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of their sickenes and infirmity, where the disease especially came of sin, as I suppose, or otherwise, when it is expedient to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and glorious to Gods name.</hi>

                        <p>You were bolde to saie before, that if any man were sicke by Gods appointment, for that cause onelie to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for his sinnes remitted, that he should streight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer by the Popes pardon, which is to graunt him such power as Christ had in remoouing ofbodelie sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes suffered for the cause aboue specified. <hi>That the priest wanteth this power, because he knoweth not when bode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie sickenes is the deserued paine for sinne</hi> (as though there were any paine that were not deserued for sinne) it is no reason. For an empirike healeth by vertue of his medicines oftentimes, though he know not the cause of the sickenes, and so should the priest by laying to his plaister, if he had any such: but none euer reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered sodainlie by the Popes pardon, or the priests power, therefore it is a fained for gerie that they haue any such power of healing bodelie diseases. It is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reason that you alledge out of Saint Augustine, <hi>that remission of sinnes in the Church respecteth the iudgement to come,</hi> but that he speaketh there of any temporal iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after this life, you are not able to prooue. Neither doth the citing of the text of Saint Paull. I. Cor. II. helpe you, which he citeth to prooue. that temporall paines are laide vpon men, in this life, to them whose sinnes are done awaie, that they should not be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to the ende, as his wordes are plaine in that wholl Chapter. <hi>Magis enim propter futurum iudicium fit remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio peccatorum. In hac autem vita, &amp;c. For remission of sins ie made rather for the iudgement to come. For in this life it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth so much which is written: a heauie yoke vpon the sons of Adam, from the daie of their comming forth of their mothers wombe, vnto the day of their buriall into the mother of all: thus we see euen litle children after the lauer of regeneration, to be tormented with the affliction of diuerse euills: that we may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that all which is doue by the healthfull sacraments.
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:12222:408"/>
doth pertaine rather to the hope of good thinges to come, then to reteining or obteining things present. Manie euills also seeme to forgiuen heere, and to be reuenged with no punishments, but the paines of them are reseruea vntill afterwarde. For not in vaine is that called properlie the daie of iudgement, when the iudge of the quicke and the deade shall come. As on the contrarie side, some things are reuenged heere, and yet if they be remitted, verilie in the worlde to come they shall not hurt. Wherfore of certaine temporall paines, which are laid vppon sinners in this life, in them whose sinnes are done awaie, that they should not be reserued vnto the ende, the Apostle saieth: for if we iudged our selues, we should not be iudged of the Lord, but when we are iudged of the Lord, we are chastened, that we should not be damned with this worlde.</hi> Thus it is plaine by Saint Augustines iudgement, that Saint Paull speaketh of temporall paines, laied vppon sinners in this life, to bring them to repentance, not of temporal iudgement to be exercised after this life. But you meane not that Popes, or Bishops pardons, should alwaies take away bodelie sicknes, because Christ did not so vnto ai. Nay rather because they are not able to heale a sore finger in any one man. For Christ healed as many as he would: if the Pope haue Christs power, why should he not as well heale whome he will? Your similitude, <hi>that as Christ tooke away temporall paines, so may Popes and priests,</hi> holdeth not: for there is great odds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ, and his seruants. he did what he would, they may doe no more then he hath giuen chem pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and charge. And for releasing of times of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, appointed to satisfie the Church, they may by power giuen from him: but for the releasing of debt to be paied in the world to come, he gaue them neither authority, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. <hi>That the priest doth dailie heale in your sacrament of aneling,</hi> it is an impudent lie. For first, they anoint none in their dailie practize, but such as are in dispaire of life: of whom if any recouer by the wilof God, it is sacriledge to impure it to the power of
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:12222:408"/>
the priests anointing, who hauenot the gift of healing, as the elders of the Apostles Church had, whome S. Iames willeth to be sent for, to heale the diseased.</p>

                           <hi>But in Saint Paull we haue inuincible proofe of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and iurisdiction of Bishops and princivali pastcurs, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well the power of enioyned pename and satisfaction for sinnes committed, as the lawfull power of pardoning the same which before was enioyned, and so in one fact of the Apostle a cleare practize of binding and loosing. He first bound him by excommunication that had so greeuouslie offended, and to shew what a terrible torment this kinde of panishment is, and how much it is to be dred, he maketh it euident by a slraunge corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vexation, that all Chrillian men might conceiue the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of those persons which be excommunicated hereafter, when the externall signe and miraculous torment should ceasse in the Church.

But see with what a maiestie and might of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, with what force of wordes, and authoritie of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, with what a kinde of punishment Christes officer here cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth the offender. Thus runneth his determinate sentence, on the offender, that all the worlde may take heede and wonder at the Churches authoritie, and condemne the vaine voices of them that doe restraine the power of Gods ministers onelie to the preaching of the Gospell.</hi> I beeing absent in bodie, but present in spirit, haue alreadie giuen iudgement, as well as if I were present, that the person, that hath thus wickedlie wrought, should be deliuered vpto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, in the vertue of our Lorde Christ Iesus, you there being gathered with my spirit in the name of our said Lord Christ Iesus, and all for the vexation of his flesh,

that his soull may be safe in the daie of our Lord Iesus Christ. <hi>This in effect, is the Apostles sentence on that ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous person, wherby he was temporallie tormented by the force of Saint Pauls power of binding sinners, giuen by Christ, and exercised no otherwise, as you may see, but in Christs vertue &amp; holie name.

For what did the Apostle? but that by destruction of the flesh, he might prouide for his spirituall health: that whether by some temporall paine or death, as Ananias and his wife fell downe before the Apostle Peters seet, or whether by repentance, because he was deliuered to Sathan, he might kill in himselfe the wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence of the flesh. For he saieth also, Mortifie your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which are vpon earth, among which he rehearseth forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And againe, for if ye shall liue according to the flesh, yee shall die.</hi> By this you may see, the opinion of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral torment in this discipline of S.

sounde and right iudgement. For the matter is not left to euerie man: thinking, more then to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but to a Godlie and necessarie consideration. And therefore it stood not in Paulles pleasure to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the man, sooner then he sawe in him the fruites of repentance, nor later, then he had certaine intelligence thereof. Neither might he haue tied him for twentie yeares, but vpon condition to release him immediatlie vpon his true repentance, neither haue loosed him within an hower, except within the space of that hower he had sufficient arguments of his repentance, and satisfaction of the Churches offence and iudgement. The reasons that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, why he iudged him now to be pardoned. doe shewe no lesse, <hi>lest he be swallowed vp by too much sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, lest we be intercepted by Sathan.</hi> It was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Apostle, to suffer the penitent to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with too much sorrowe, not the Church to be circumuented by Satan. Therefore it was not lawfull for him to haue differred his loosing anie longer. As for <hi>the recompencing by Christs satisfaction &amp; the communion of Saints,</hi> which is the blasphemous dispensation of the imaginarie treasure of the popish Church, is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this text, nor in anie text of the bible, nor in anie auncient Father, but was lathe deuised, to set a glosse vpon the popes pardons, and practizes in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie. In the end you saie well, <hi>both, that the Apostle had great respect of the offenders case, and care of the Churches edifying,</hi> which prooueth, that without neglecting that consideration and care, he might not sooner or later haue loosed him, nor tied him, otherwise then he did. And the saying of Augustine doth prooue wel, that the prescript times of penance, limited before his age, were not so conuenient, as the liberty of time, where in the parties repentance might be iudged best, as it was in the Apostles.</p>

But by your determination, the matter is altogether mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Your first reason to prooue that pardons are not alwayes beneficiall to the receiuers, is, <hi>that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes haue not alwaies their effect, thorough the vnworthines of the receiuers.</hi> But if the receiuer be disposed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conditions expressed in the pardon, he is capable of it by the iudgement of the canonists. Your second reason, is <hi>the sinister respect, or error that may be in the giuer.</hi> But it is not right, that the receiuer being a capable person, especiallie hauing paied for his ware, should leese his benefit thorough the default of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, if he be such a one as hath autority to giue. <hi>That slouthfulnes or delicatnes should exclude a man from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his pardon, that is in state of grace,</hi> as they terme it, I suppose you are not able to prooue by any groundes of popery. The glosse vppon the Bull of Iubileie first graunted by Pope Boniface 8. saith, that the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared consistorially, that penances inioyned before, are also taken away by commutation of the satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic worke in this pardon prescribed, and that vowes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,

except the vow of Ierusalem, are taken away by this paidon, not onely those vowes which were inioyned for commutation of penance, as for satisfaction of sins, but also those vowes that haue no such respect, as if a man being in daunger of the sea, or in siknes, doe vow to goe to <hi>S.</hi> Ieames. So that if a man wil performe such penance or vowes it is but a worke of supererogation. But if the Pope may so easily erre in occupying of his key of iurisdiction as here you pretende, no man can haue confidence in any pardon, or dispensation of the Pope, because he can not be assured, whether the keie did erre in that pardon or iurisdiction: likewise seeing the key of order may so easilie goe awrie, what trust may a poore Papist haue, that his sinnes be forgiuen him, that must hang vppon the hitting or missing of tow so vncertaine keyes?</p>

For the Canons graunte a pardon of course at the houre of <note place="margin">Conc. Nicen.

As for cases of necessitie, are dispensed with all by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, without the Popes or anie mortall mans par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. For no inioyned penance can be of greater band, then the rest of the sabbath, which yet for necessitie maie be broken, as our Sauiour sheweth, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Dauid, eating the shewe bread, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> then in the case of necessitie, had beene sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for him to doe.

differ from the iudgement of the Popish Charch, and of the Pope himselfe. But whereas you affirme, <hi>that Christ gaue the Pharistes in charge, to purge their sinnes by almes, and that almespurgeth ventall sinnes,</hi> you speake more then the text alloweth. For Christ teacheth not the Pharisies to purge anie sinnes with almes, but after he hath rebuked their hypoctisie, that were carefull to make cleane the outside of the cuppe or platter, when the inward parte of their heart was full of rauine and wickednes, he prescribeth them the contrarie practise, to purge the inward man by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to testifie the same by almes, which is contrarie to rapine, &amp; spoyling, and then all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God should be cleane vnto them, although they vsed no such superstitious washing with water. And if it be as you saie, <hi>that not onely veniall sinnes, but also the temporall debt that remaineth for deadly crimes, after they be remitted, be forgiuen, by saying the Pater noster:</hi> who is so foolish to paie anie monie for a pardon, or what meaneth the Pope to make such a bragge of his pardons, which can remiit no more, then euerie man maie obteine at home, by saying his <hi>Pater noster?</hi> As for hearing of Masse, &amp; taking their rightes, if it be no more worth, but to make men fit to receiue fruitfullie the Popes pardon, they be litle worth, sceing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it selfe, as in all this chapter you labour to prooue, is but of small profite, and the <hi>Pater nosier</hi> saying, is as good as anie pardon. Finallie where Saint Hilarie, &amp; Saint Cyrill saie, <hi>that Christ caused Peter to wipe away the blot of his treble denying, with a treble confession:</hi> neither of them both saie, that Christ made him his substitute on earth, &amp; chiefe pastor of all his flock, otherwise then he made euerie one of the other Apostles.</p>

                        <p>The qualification that you now prescribe, differeth not a litle from that seueritie of your former exacting of penance, or at the least a counterpoise thereof, to make pardons beneficiall. <hi>That the decale of deuotion should make pardons more common in these latter times,</hi> there is no reason, but rather that pardons should cause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion to decaie. For the nature of men is, to be best affected to that, which is moste easilie obteined, and where there is hope of impunitie, to be lesse carefull in offending. But you would haue pardons seeme to be as olde as Gregorie the first, by authoritie of Pantale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Lutheran: who could not know what Gregorie did, but by relation of other stories: why doe you not therefore cite some auncient credible storie, that iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth as much of Gregory? For Pantaleon doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch what Gregorie did, but what the late popish writers ascribe vnto him. <hi>But though it be not auncient to graunt such pardons,</hi> yet you saie, <hi>it is cleare, that the thing itselfe is lawfull,</hi> although of this clearenes you haue as yet made no demonstration. You saie further, <hi>that no Protestant is able to shewe you the first vser thereof.</hi> If that were true, yet thereby pardons are neither prooued auncient, nor lawfull. But what if Gregorie were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, (For I will not name Boneface the eight, seing you make challenge of Gregorie) whome can you shewe, that vsed to graunt such pardons, before him. Although in trueth you are not able to prooue that Gregorie graunted such pardons, oranie Pope after him, for 400. yeares. Your third assertion, <hi>that these
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:12222:418"/>
manner of pardons were neuer controlled by any man that euer was accounted Catholike,</hi> is a sophisticall caption, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the principle. For manie are true Catholikes, that are not so accounted, and the Pope with his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists challenge to be accounted the onely Catholikes, which of all other are the greatest heretikes.</p>

auncient time be alledged against this that I saie, nor the prescriptions of the auncient Canons, which were made and practized of publike penance openlie inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in which the inferior priestes were prohibited to reconcile or remit without the knowledge of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe. But as there was no penance priuatlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned by Priestes, so there was no prohibition that it should not priuatlie be remitted of them, by whome it was appointed.

                           <hi>And not onely that, but also the nature of the act of pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, doth wholie chalenge this function of the higher Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of Christes common wealth. For it standeth not onelie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the remission of debt, but also vpon recompence of reparing againe the band thereof, by the common treasure of the whole housholde of the faithfull, which can not be by reason despen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and bestowed vpon anie man that lacked, by any, but such as are principall stewardes and rulers of some whole portion of the said familie, as Bishoppes lawfullie succeeding the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles are known in this case to haue receiued the keies of Christs kingdome, and the dispensing of his holy mysteries, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maie instly dispose the treasure of Christ and his Saintes satisfactions to the benefit of the faithfull, in whose lardge cures, it can no otherwise be thought, but there be the merits of diuers holy and blessed men laied vp in store before God, for

the releefe of their brethren, which maie be disposed at the Bl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes wisdome, to such namelie as be of his owne charge and regiment. But of particular parishes, it cannot be certaine, that there should alwaies be some sufficiencie of aboundant sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, to remaine without decaie, for the continuall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing vpon some of the said small circuit, and that is it, which the schoole diuines saie, In particulari Ecolesta merita non sunt indeficientia:</hi> merites of Sainctes be not vnspenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in particular Churches.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But the communion of Saintes being the generall benefit of the wholl common wealth of Christes Church, continueth for euer by the aboundance of manie holy workes, which may satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for other mens sinnes, according to the disposition of such as be the gouernours and guiders of our soules, that the ouerplus and aboundance of one sort, maie euer releeue the lackes of an other sort, as S.

                        <p>The next argument to prooue that priestes cannot pardon, is, <hi>because the disposition of the treasure, out of which the paiment goeth, by reason pertaineth to none, but to such as are principall stewardes, and rulers of some wholl portion of the familie, as bishoppes, &amp;c.</hi> But are not priestes also stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and rulers of their owne parishes, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so wholl portions of the familie, and consist of many partes? Whie maie they not then be dispensers of that vnknowne treasure you speake of? You answer <hi>that in the large cures of bishoppes, it cannot otherwise be thought but there be the merites of diuerse holy and blessed men laid vp in store to be bestowed by the Bishop, to such as be of his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment: but merites of Saints be not vnspendable in particular Churches.</hi> Marke this reason well: for hereof it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the super abundance of Christes satisfaction, which you make to be the ground of this imaginarie treasure, is not of force of it selfe, without the helpe of the merites of saints. Secondlie the communion of Saints, whereupon you would ground another parte of this treasure of satisfaction, being limited by diocesses, and not by parishes, leeseth the nature of a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:12222:422"/>
which extendeth it selfe vnto al, vnto whome it is common. For if the merit of Christ were sufficient to ground a pardon vpon, the priest in his parish, beeing a steward of Christes satisfaction, might graunt a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: but because he lacketh perhapes the merites of Saints, he maie not presume so much vppon Christes satisfaction alone. Againe, if the merites of Saints were founded vpon the communion of saints, why should not the merits of the saints of the wholl diocesse, yea of the whole world, be auaileable, and appliable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man of euerie parish, by the particular gouerner and guider of the soules of that parish? so well hang to gether these blasphemous dreames of Saints merites and Christes satisfaction seperated from the act of his passion, claimed to be at the Popes, and prelates disposition.</p>
                        <p>The aboundance of one releiuing the lacke of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, whereof Saint Paull speaketh, is no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of merites, nor anie thing like vnto it: but a participation of the gifts of God in this life. As for <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Saintes,</hi> what should we speake of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or whence should they haue them, when <hi>mercie is their crowne,</hi> as Saint Ambrose saieth? Finallie, howsoeuer you abase the dignitie and authoritie of inferrior ministers in graunting of pardon, the auncient Church admitted them to reconcile in the absence of the Bishoppe, or in case of necessitie, as diuerse Cannons doe shew. Wherefore if this power of pardoning were anie such a thing as the auncient discipline, the popish Priestes should not be wholie excluded from it.</p>

                        <p>The Pope graunteth to the Bishops as it pleaseth him, a shadow of this power of pardoning, reseruing the rest to himselfe, for his owne aduantage, and pre ferment.

To o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your translation of <hi>Basilica,</hi> for a Chappell, which rather signifieth a Cathedrall or Princelie Church, I will consider what you gather out of this Councell.

For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that moderation the Bishop of Rome did vse, all other Bishops are restreined to that measure. By which it appeereth, that euen in that time which was litle more then three hundreth yeares agoe, the large pardons of so many thousand yeares were neither knowen nor thought needfull. For if they had, it had beene great iniurie to driue men of all partes of the world, to seeke for that at Rome, which they might haue had neere hand of their owne Bishops.

vpon, but such as may stirre vp mans industrie in the moderat search of Gods trueth and mysteries. For the soules departed and being assured to be saued, must needs be of the same body mysticall and felowship of Saints, that the faithfull be of aliue: &amp; therefore, they may according to their aptnes more or lesse be profited by the holy works and satisfaction of their head &amp; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low members, because in euerie lawfull</hi> Pardon <hi>there is made by the keies of iurisdiction &amp; application of Christs holy merits &amp; his Saints, in that respect as they be satisfactorie, to the vse of their inferiour members, that doe lacke that wherein the other doe abound.

                        <p>A question meet to be handled by the popes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor for purgatorie, seeing in purgatorie the Popes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is all his iurisdiction. For it is meet that he should beare rule ouer his owne creature. But in heauen no man hath authoritie but God: because it is the seat of his maiestie, and the reward of his blessed, and beloued in his sonne Christ Iesus, whoe hath opened the same to all faithfull. and shut vp the same from all vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers; of whose will and pleasure he hath commaunded his seruants, the true ministers of his Church to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters vnto the world. The question you assoile, as you doe all other of popery, that whatsoeuer the Pope, and popish Church hath once allowed, must needes be good, although it haue no warrant out of the word of God, nor testimonie of the auncient Church. First you saie therfore, <hi>that the Pope may lawfullie graunt pardons to them that be in Purgatorie, whereof,</hi> you saie, <hi>there canbe no more doubt, then there can be of the other.</hi> In deede they be both of like certaintie, sauing that for this later questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:12222:426"/>
it must first be prooued, whether there be any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, before it be demanded whether the Popes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons extend to purgatorie. Saint Augustine somewhile doubted whether there were any such place, and saith it may be doubted of, and perhapes be found, perhapes neuer be founde: other while he vtterlie denieth any <note place="margin">Ench. ad laur. cap. 69. Cont. pel. hy pognost. l. 5.</note> third place, because he findeth it not in the scriptures, neither shal the pope be able euer to finde such fictions in the scriptures. The like I saie of his power of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the merites of Christ, or his Saints, or that the saints haue any merits for themselues, much lesse for other men. Wherefore it standeth neither vpon reason, nor vpon any meaning of Gods word, whereof there can no wordes be shewed, including or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting anie such meaning, that the Popes pardons should reach to the release of purgatorie paines, if anie such were, which cannot release the lest paine that any man suffereth vpon the earth. That Leo the tenth did excommunicat Luther, it proueth no more the Popes doctrine to be true, then that Caiphas condemned Christ, prooueth Caiphas to haue bin an honest man.</p>

                           <hi>Marie whether the Indulgences take place so often vpon the dead, as vpon the liue, that is not so well knowen, because the persons departed be not in case to make themselues more apt to take benefit thereby, then they were at their departure hence: And therfore if they were not with singular zeale and deuotion so qualified in the end of their life, they cannot now any whit abetter their own case, or otherwise dispose themselues to attaine the fruit of those singular remissions. And more then that, no</hi> Indulgence, <hi>is lightlie graunted, but vpon the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of some appointed worke of pietie, and the departed not hauing alwaies in this life such friends as will accomplish com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently the worke prescribed by the</hi> Pardon, <hi>nor himselfe now in case to doe the same, he often misseth the benefit of the Churches remission which else he might haue had by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the giuer.

                        <p>Two causes you assigne why it is not knowne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indulgences take place, so often vpon the deade as vpon the liuing The first, <hi>because the soules there can take no benefite of pardons, but according to the merites of their life.</hi> But this reason is confuted by authoritie of the glosse, vpon the first bull of Iubilie, which saith that <hi>pardons respect grace, and not merite;</hi> which if it be true, not the merits of the receiuer, but the power and will of the giuer were to be obserued. The second reason is, <hi>that pardons lightlie require some worke to be fulfilled.</hi> But that worke is neuer so laborious, as the paines already by them susteined in purgatorie, if we beleeue you, which if it will not serue for a recompence, or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of penance, you will hardelie perswade men, that saying of such a prayer, giuing of such an almes, visiting such an Idoll, should be sufficient to make the Popes pardon auaileable. But it is a pitifull case that poore soules in purgatórie, which lacke nothing for their release but such a trifling worke to be performed for them and haue no friend in this life, that will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish it for them, should lie still broiling in the fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing panne and be so litle regarded of the Pope, that he will not appoint that his clergie at the least of their charitie should take paines for them, although they haue no penie for their <hi>Pater noster.</hi> That <hi>some among you thinke the profite of pardons, is no surer, then of other suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages and workes to them in purgatorie, which are auaileable,</hi> but you know not how much; first it sheweth the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of your faith, which leaneth vpon such helpes, as you know not whereto they will serue you. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie it sheweth that you are not agreed among your selues of such articles as you thrust vpon other men to
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:12222:427"/>
be credited. And thirdlie, that euerie one among you being not resolued of the Popes keies of iurisdiction, some thinke that the Pope hath arrogan the abused his keies, when he hath taken vpon him to dzale fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in purgatorie, then they are perswaded he hath authoritie. For certaine it is, the Pope hath preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his pardons not onelie to release soules out of purgatory, but also to giue other men power to release three or foure a peece whome they will choose.</p>

                           <hi>And therefore vpon this consiacration, the learned diuines doe teach, that the Pope doth, and lawfullie maie applie vnto the soules departed, by his keies, some parte of the Churches treasure, which consisteth of Christes satisfaction and other his Saints, by which they departed, as they haue neede and be in competent termes to receiue benefite by the merits of their head or fellowes, maie be released from some parte of their paines: but yet they will not charge anie man with necessitie of belce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, that the Pope or Church should vse meere iurisdiction ouer them, that be in an other worlde. To be plaine for the peoples vnderstanding, the meaning is, that in a pardon there are two thinges: the one is a sentence of absolution definitelie pronounced vpon anie person penitent: the second is the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the debt of sinne remitted by the saide absolution through the application of the Churches treasure by the power of the officiers keies. Both these two iointlie can neuer be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised vpon anie person not subiect, though the one maie. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution can not properlie be giuen nor fruitfullie, to anie man not subiect to the giuers regiment, but the application of the treasure may be made by the keies to procure mercie for them that be not vnder their power, but that is not by proper iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction but by aide of request made by iust offers why the partie should be receiued vnto mercie. In this sense then the Pope absolueth no man departed absolutelie. But onelie offereth in the person of Christ for the reliefe of him that is in</hi> Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie <hi>to God his mighti iudge there the abundant price of Christs passion and the satisfaction of Saints: And no doubt for his reuerence and representing Christes, person, he is more often
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:12222:427"/>
heard then anie priuate man offering onelie his owne almes and praier for the soule departed. And for that cause, in this sense the</hi> Popes pardon <hi>worketh onelie per modum suffragij, as by aide of sute, and not by regiment or iurisdiction, which manie suppose doth not extend past the compasse of this worlde, and therefore that he cannot exercise the acte of binding or loosing which be proper to his power and gouernment ouer anie in the next life, though to make sute for them before God he maie applie some portion of Christes copious redemption, and Saints satisfaction, by the vse of his keyes, which there make forcible intercession, though they cannot giue iudiciarie absolution.</hi>

                        <p>If the Pope haue not meere iurisdiction in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, how could Clement graunt the release of soules to be at other mens arbitrement, by his pardon. Againe how could he be able to spoile all purgatorie, which is affirmed to be possible to his absolute power. But for plainer vnderstanding, of this mysterie of iniquitie, and abhominable blasphemie: you consider <hi>two thinges in a pardon, the absolution, and the application:</hi> which later (you saie) maie be made for them, that be not vnder their power: whereof it will follow, that all Bishoppes hauing the dispensation of the treasure committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as well as the Pope, maie graunt pardons to them, that be none of their iurisdiction, which by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation maie be profitable to them, though they be not by absolution. But what is, this application? You an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, <hi>it is not by regiment, but by aide of sute.</hi> A grosse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, to turne a pardon or remission, into a sute or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest for a pardon; when in the pardon, there is no wordes of praier or request, but of concession and graunt. <hi>But by this pardon</hi> (you saie) <hi>the Pope offereth to God the price of Christes passion, and the satisfaction of Saints.</hi> Then haue we a new oblation neuer before heard of, proper to the Pope in graunting of pardons. Or if it be a prerogatiue of the Pope, that he maie be saide to praie, when he doth graunt or commaund, and offer a bargen ofre compence, where he can doe no more
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:12222:428"/>
but entreate the iudge to accept it, (no passe ouer all other blasphemies conteined in this chaffer with god) I demaund why the Popes praier should be heard ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the praier of other Byshops and priests. You answere, no doubt <hi>for his reuerence,</hi> blasphemouslie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to the Pope, that which according to the vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar translation is alledged to be the cause, why Christ was heard of his father, You <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The scripture indeed doth often allow that the minister of Christ doth represent the person of Christ vnto men, because his person is not visible, nor his humanitie present vnto them. But that anie mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man should represent the person of Christ before God, and by the vertue of that representation applie the merites of Christ, otherwise then he applied by his passion, it is straunge and intollerable blasphemie, and such as none but a limme of Antichrist would vtter. As also it is hòrrible to heare, that the Popes keies in por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie should make forcible intercession, where they can not giue iudiciarie absolution. Before we had but two keies, the one of order, the other of iurisdiction. Now commeth in the third keie of suffrage, by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is rather a picklock, then a keie, because it maketh a forcible entrie, where the key hath no lawfull Iurisdiction.</p>

                           <hi>And al this, that the follie os manie men so much wondereth at, is nothing else but to set before God the Father, the death of his owne Sonne, and his grace in all Saintes, for to procure mercie for their poore breethren in miserie in the next life: as the like is done with great pietie in manie other holie actes of religion continuallie practised in the Church for the mutuall helpe one of another. And in deede, the Church hath vsed these manie yeares to put this clause in such</hi> Indulgencies <hi>as did in unie parte concerne the departed (per modum suffragy) as Sixtus the fourth, Innocentius the eight, and now of late
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:12222:428"/>
both Pius the fourth and the fifte, and all other lightlie in the like grauntes. Whereby it is plaine that we are not charged by the Church further to beleeue, then that the Pope maie as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredlie release the departed of some parte of their paines, or all, by the waie of suffrage and sute, as other holie workes of Christianitie applied vnto them by their brethren aliue, maie doe. For it were no reason, that priuate persons should as it were communicate and send vnto them their fastes almes, and praiers for the release of their paine, and he that representeth Christes person, should not in Christes name and the wholl Churches, applie vnto them some part of the common wealthes treasure, to sue for their deliuerie and help to satisfie for them in their lacks. This therefore they call a Pardon, per modum suffragy, as by way of aid of request.

                           <note place="margin">De potestate Eccles. quest. 32.</note> 
                           <hi>iurisdiction, may spotle all purgatorie of all those persons, which are subiect to his iurisdiction:</hi> which are all, except they that lack <hi>merit conditionall,</hi> and such as may do for them those things, for which pardons are ordeined to auaile: and except them that lacke <hi>merit sacramentall,</hi> which are saued immediatelie by the grace of God, which is not bound vnto the sacraments. But <hi>it were no reason</hi> (you saie) <hi>that priuate persons should communicate and send to the soules in purgatorie, there fasts, almes, and praier, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease of their paine, &amp; he that represents Christs person, should not applie some part of the common treasure for their deliuery, &amp;c.</hi> I answere wee acknowledge no such communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sending or lending by priuate persons, for any such purpose or to any such effect into Purgatorie. But if that were graunted, yet were it no reason, that the Pope, where he hath no authoritie, should by any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour doe more then a priuate man, of the same wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines or merit. And when the Pope is a wicked man of life, as you will not denie but many haue beene, what should his sute or suffrage preuaile? whereas, if he were twise as great in office, as you faine him to be, yet where his office extendeth not, he should by sute preuaile no more then priuate men of such behauiour. <hi>That this pardon, per modum suffragij, is agreeable to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize of the Church, and forme of pardons alwaies vsed,</hi> you saie, without proofe, but I haue prooued the contrarie before.

                           <hi>BVt now if you aske me here how it standeth with the iustice of God, thus to forgiue the paine and debt of satisfaction, which either God or the Church inioyneth, for the recompence of the former sinnes especiallie seeing the Catholike Church doth holde that it perteineth to Gods iustice, no lesse to punish sinnes with some temporall scourge after it be forgiuen,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:12222:430"/>
then it doth perteine to his mercy to forgiue the saide sinne and the debt of euerlasting damnation. Now if it stand not with his iustice, to let a sinner escape whollie without correction or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, then it may much more appeere to be against his iustice also, that any power of man should remit &amp; release that bonde of satisfaction, which Gods instice required, and was to the offender inioyned. For the answere and perfect vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this doubt, it is to be knowne and well weighed, that in deede no release could be had of such inioyned penance or deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued paine for sinnes past, if Gods instice were not otherwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed, and the lacke of the parties punishment, supplied againe by the abundance of satisfaction made by Christ vpon the Crosse, eueric drop of whose innocent bloode and stroke laid vpon his blessed bodie, were hable of the infinite &amp; inestimable worth and force thereof, to satisfie for all debt due to all the sin in the worlde, whether it be death and euerlasting damnation or tempor all paine and purgation. By which abundant price of his passion, and copious ransome, the Church for whose sake this precious price, was paied, doth not onelie holde her selfe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from death and damnation, and so saued by Christ her head, for he is the sauiour of his bodie, saith Saint Paull, but shee holdeth the ouerplus (as a man wouldsaie) of so abundant copious, and infinite redemption, to be a treasure in the house of God, to relieue her childrens lackes, to release their paines, to worke with them in satisfying for their sin, and to worke mercie for them also for lack of satisfying for their offences: that want being founde in our penance towardes the recompensing of our euill life paste, may be supplied by the treasure of Christsdeath that remaineth yet of full force and strength, to be applied vnto vs in such our necessities, as shal be thought meet vnto Christs, Vicar generall in earth, &amp; other his holie appointed ministers, with whome (as Saint Paul saith) he left the bestowing of gods mysteries. For although the holie and precious treasure of Christes paine and satisfaction be of it selfe sufficient to relieue the lackes of all men without exception, not onely of those which shall be saued, but also for the damned and for the wholl worlde (saith Saint Iohn) yet no man may be so hardie, to claime the

benefit thereof otherwise, then through such meanes as he hath appointed, and by the ministery of such men as he hath placed ouer his householde and familie, to giue the Children meat and sustenance in due season not as they shall inordinatlie craue it, but as he shall discreetlie finde to be meere for them. Therefore where this wise stewarde of Christs holie householde, to whome he gaue the kcies of the treasure, and sufficient authoritie to fceae and gouerne his wholl flocke, where he shall orderlie iudge the offender meete, and of good congruitie, worthie of grace and mercie, there he may pardon, and recompense the residue that can not be fulfilled of the partie penitent, with some peece of that inestimable treasure of Christs redemption, which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the Church impossible to be wasted, and so shall remaine to the vnspeakeable benefit of the faithfull.</hi>

Neither doth the argument of the coniunction of the humanitie with the diuinitie prooue anie such matter. But if that were graunted, by what scripture is the infinite ouerplus made a treasure of the Church? the glosse thinketh that it should be in vaine, if it should serue vs to no purpose: as though if any such thing were, &amp; might stand with Gods iustice, it might not serue to set forth the glorie and riches of Christes incarnation.

                        <p>That knot of communication of the benefites of Christes death, was as effectuall before his incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as since, although it became effectual by meanes of his incarnation, euen as the effect of his death ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the saluation of his elect before his death. But you doe well to follow your author at the harde heeles, the writer of that glauering glosse vpon Pope Bonefacius Bull, which: immediately aster the words by me last cited addeth. <hi>Nam propter vnionem capitis &amp; membrorum, meritum capitis attribuitur membris: &amp; quia sic per alienum meritun, non per proprium meritum liberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur à poena, ideo quantum ad ipsos talis liberalior dicitur re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missio, seu indulgentia: licet quoad Christum qui hoc nobis meruit vocetur redemptio copiosa. For because of the vnion of the heade and the members, the merit of the head is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and applied vnto the members: and because they are so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from paine by the merit of an other, and not by their owne merit, therefore in respect of themselues such deliuerance is called a remission or pardon, although in respect of Christ which deserued this for vs, it is called a plentifull redemption.</hi>
                           <pb n="513" facs="tcp:12222:433"/>
We know that by meanes of the vnion of the head vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the members, the redemption wrought by the head perteineth to the members: but the application thereof, is by the spirit of God, and not by the Popes pardon, or any ministrie of man in speaking properlie, which extendeth no further then the outwarde senses in speaking the worde of God to the hearing, in wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with water, or deliuering the bodelie foode, in signe of baptizing with the holie ghost, and feeding with the bodie and blood of Christ. But more than that (you saie) <hi>the holie suffrings, and tribulation of Saints doe helpe to supplie our lacke, and increase the huge treasure of the Church.</hi> Your wordes found as though your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were, that the suffring of Saints doth more sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie our lacke, then the infinite treasure of the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ. But that I may not take you at the worst, you meane at the lest, that they ad vnto it, &amp; you say plainly, <hi>they increase the treasure of the Church.</hi> But you forget the infinite valure of Christes, bloodwhich you spake of before, which can no more receiue any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, then it can be diminished: for there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of that which is infinite, tò that which is finit. But if the treasure of the Church which is infinite by Christs merit, may be made greater by the merit, of Saints, which are finit, then the quantitie thereof must be greater by so much, or so manie partes as are added: and so there shall be proportion of finit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, or ells the treasure of Christs merit shall not be infinite. This grosse and impossible absurditie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came in after the first deuise of the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite treasure by Christs merit. For Clemens the fixt which brought the Iubelie yeare, from euerie hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, to euery 50. as he learned of <hi>Aug. de Ancona,</hi> that liued in this time, ioyneth in his bull the merits of all Saints, to increase the infinite treasure of Christs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.

                           <hi>Saint Paull vtter of his trauaile taken for the Churches sake:</hi> Now I doe reioyce in my passions or tribulations, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for your sake, and I fullfill those things that doe want of Christ passions, in mine owne flesh, for his bodie which is the Church. <hi>Thus said Saint Paul. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you see, that not onelie the want of one member may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied of the heade of the bodie, but that ech member may helpe the insufficiencie of an other member. Whereby for all that, we may not conceiue, that there is any lacke or insufficiencie on Christs parte or passion, which was so full and abundant of it owne valure, that by it selfe alone without the helpe of all mans merits or other creatures, it was a sufficient price for the sinnes of all the worlde, and moe if moe might be. But the lacke that this his passion was not in effect so forcible and so fullie in all mens cases, was the want of some paines and passion in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the Church, by which she and euerie of hers were bound to conforme them-selues vnto Christ, by taking paines in their flesh and suffering together with Christ their head. For so long Christes passion wanteth his due effect in vs, (though it were neuer so full and sufficient in it selfe) as we do not conforme our selues to his paine &amp; tribulation taken for vs. Therfore, though Christ in his owne person suffer now no more, yet he doth suffer, and dailie shall suffer till the worlds end in diuers members of his holie bodie: as the heade, saith Saint Augustine suffereth when the finger aketh, and as Christ him selfe charged Saint Paul that he persecuted him, when he onelie molested his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.

By all which holie paines of the head himselfe principallia and of the holie members of his bodie, who wrought not onelie for themselues, but expreslie meant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit other by their workes, as the Apostle confesseth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, we neede not to doubt, but the lacke of many a poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this blessed incorporation, is dulie supplied, and the want of worke satisfactorie in some, recompensed by the abundance of paines and penance of others. For this is the blessed cause of such as be in the Church of God, in the fellowshippe of the faithfull, in the knot of those members, whereof our sauiour is the head, that is to saie, in the holie communion of Saints, in which as some do lack so other some by Christs gift do abound and are able to procure mercie for the needie, and to satisfie God for their poore breethrens sinnes.

Let them tell by what sacrifice they be reconciled: with what blood they be redeemed, who it is (as the Apostle saith) which gaue himselfe for vs an oblation and sacrifice of sweete sauour vnto God? or what sacrifice was euer more holie then that which the true and eucrlasting high Priest laid vpon the altar of the crosse, by the sacrificing of his owne stesh? For although the death of manie Saintes hath beene precious in the sight of the Lord, yet the slaughter of no giltles person was the redemption of the world. The iust men haue receiued, they haue not giuen crownes, and of the vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antnes of the faithful are growne examples of patience, not gifts of righteousnes. For the deathes in euerie one were singular, nei ther did anie man by his end paie the debt of another, seeing among the sonnes of men there was but one alone, our Lord Ie sus Christ, which was truelie the immaculate lambe, in whom all are crucified, all dead, all buried, all also raised againe. Of whome he himseife said, when I shall be exalted from the earth I will draw all things vnto my selfe. For true faith which iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth vngodlie men, and maketh them iust, being drawne to the partaker of his humanitie, obteineth saluation in him, in whome alone man findeth himselfe innocent, hauing libertie by the grace of God to boast of his power, which encountring with the enemie of mankinde in the basenes of our flesh, giueth the victorie to them, in whose bodie he triumphed.</hi> If the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Antichristes that followed Leo the Bishop of Rome in place, had followed, and allowed this his doctrine, they would neuer haue deuised nor mantei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this encrease of their treasure by the merites and sufferings of Saints: whose martirdome profited the Church, by the examples of patience to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of faith, not communicating of Iustice to the en crease of merite. Whose deathes were singular, and proper to them-selues to receaue the crownes of glory which Christ had merited for them: not common by
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:12222:436"/>
waie of desert, to gaine crownes for other, or to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the debt of other, For that was the power efficacie and effect of the onelie sacrifice of our sauiour Iesus Christ, to satisfie for the sinnes of his people, and to purchase the crowne of eternal glory for them.</p>
                        <p>The conformitie therfore of the members vnto the head in suffering, and the suffering of Christ in his members, prooueth no satisfaction necessarie to be wrought by the members to make the passion of the head effectual for them, that are saued; and much lesse the want of workes satisfactorie, in some to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed by the aboundance of paines &amp; penance in other: neither doth Saint Paul confesse anie such thing, whose sufferings did otherwise benefite the Church, then by satisfying for the paine due to other, that wanted workes satisfactorie. Neither doth the communion of Saints, fauour anie such in which all power of spirituall life by ioynts and sinewes is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied from the head to the members, &amp; euerie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber yeldeth to the rest the dutie of loue and seruice which is appointed vnto it. But to satisfie for an others sinnes, is not the office of anie member of the Church, neither hath S. Paul where you quote, or anie where els, either the wordes or meaning of anie such merite or satisfaction of anie man for himselfe, much lesse for other. The ordinarie ministrie of men for such end &amp; purposes as it is ordeined of God, is to be thankefully embraced: but he hath no where appointed men to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, or satisfie his iustice for sinne, albeit he hath committed to men <hi>the worde of reconciliation, the keies of the kingdome of heauen to keepe and exercise, his sheep to feed, his mysteries to bestowe, and full power to binde and loose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his worde,</hi> and not according to their affection will and pleasure.</p>

both in this world and the next, let no man (I saie) maruell, that yet there be waies of Gods mercie, and meanes through the ministerie of man to turne awaie the wrath of our Lord, and by other helpes to satisfie his iustice againe.

<pb n="521" facs="tcp:12222:437"/>
For otherwise the passion of Christ we know is sufficient and effectuall to take awaie all paine, because Gods iustice is throughlie satisfied by him. You graunt it sufficient, and denie it to be effectuall, because Gods iustice requireth temporal paine of the partie that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, as well as satisfaction for the sinne 'and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall paine thereby deserued, which hereticall asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot stand with anie pardon or satisfaction by an other, how soeuer you goe about the bush in words, and shewe of setting forth Gods mercie to reconcile them. Neither doth inioyning of ponance by the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, nor Gods owne temporall scourges in this life prooue anie necessitie of suffering for satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Gods iustice vnsatisfied by the passion of Christ. The temporall scourges after this life, you must first prooue that there be such, before you can conclude any thing by such. Neither hath God a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand waies to seeke, to satisfie him-selfe with his sonnes paines, but the onelie mediation, and propitiation of his sonne, is the waie to satissie his iustice sor sin: Neither requireth he the trauell of any man other <note place="margin">1.

That God hath often giuen mercie and grace at Moses and Aarons request, it prooueth not his iustice to be satisfied by Moses or Aarons workes; but onelie by Christ, in whome all praiers of the saints are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, or to obtaine mercie, either for them selues, or for others. And when he stirreth vp the iust to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the people, when he should punish, he <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note> setteth not mans iustice or merites betweene his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and the offenders, but prouoketh them to seeke

This did god also, &amp; that this is true it is manifest out of the verie wordes. Let me alone (saith he) and I will be angrie. for no man relenteth that will punish: for then we are, angrie. But he saith, let me alone and I will be angrie: that thou maiest know that anger in God is no affection, but punishment toward vs is named by that terme. Therefore when thou hearest Moses saying. If thou doest forgiue this sin, forgiue it, wonder at the Lord in comparison of the seruant, that he him selfe seeketh vnto him selfe occasions of mercie. Neither did he this thing here onelie, but also vnto Ieremie, and Ezechtel he saith the same thing, go round about, and see in the waies of Ierusalem: whether there be anie that doth iudgement and iustice, and I will be mercifull vnto them. Hast thou seene his mercie? manie also vngodlie persons enioy the vertue of one man together. And by the malice of manie although there be but one that doth well in the middest of a great people, he doth not fall. But one man truelie liuing well, maie deliuer a whole people from the wrath of God: but a wholl communaltie that is peruerse, cannot draw into their paine, and punishment him that liueth well, nor cast him downe. And this is manifest of Noe, for when all perished he alone was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. And of Moses it is cleere. For he alone was able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine pardon for so great a people.</hi> In all these wordes, here is no mention or meaning of merit or satisfaction, but onelie of mercie, as appeereth in the example of men requiring their friendes to deliuer their seruants from punishment: where not the worthines of the friendes can be the cause, but the mercie of the Master. Againe he speaketh of the auoiding of temporall plagues in this life, whereof euen the vngodlie, and they that perteine not to the communion of Saints, often times

                        <p>The grace and mercie of God in Iesus Christ, was as largelie to be found for the saluation of his people in the daies of olde, as in these daies. <hi>Iesus Christ was yesterdaie, and to daie is the same, and for euermore.</hi> And the Lambe was slaine, from the beginning of the worlde <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 8.</note> as touching the effect of his death vnto all Gods elect: and the communion of the Saints was as fullie esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, to the receiuing of al vertue of life from Christ their heade, and to the mutuall seruice of loue, and ministring of gods gifts one to another: but not to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite at all, either for themselues, or for other. Such meriting is dishonorable to the heade, <hi>from whome eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie member receaueth life, and all power and offices thereof, ac cording to the measure of euerie member, to the encrease, and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 1. 6</note> 
                           <hi>building vp of the wholl bodie in loue.</hi> The Church of olde had also the ministerie of remission of sinnes, and the keies of the kingdome of heauen, and that not in base figures onelie, but insufficient effect, to the euerlasting saluation of Gods people. And therefore to saie, that all these things were none otherwise wrought, but in base figures, is to denie the saluation of all the fathers that died before the incarnation of Christ. For base figures
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:12222:441"/>
could haue but base effectes: base figures could not worke eternall life. The ministerie figures of the law separated from Christ, are in deede the weake and beg gerlie elements of the worlde: but beeing referred to Christ, and made effectuall by his death through faith in the partakers, they are of the same power and riches vnto euerlasting saluation, that the ministerie and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the new Testament. But admit that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wrought to them but in base figures; yet it followeth not, that after the incarnation and actuall death of Christ, there should be any more meanes to remit the bond of satisfaction, by answering Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, then in that onelie sacrifice obedience, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring of Christ, or that the Church should haue such a store house of mans merites to satisfie Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, or that men by loue, zeale, and deuotion, may deserue Gods mercie: these popish positions can neuer be prooued. Againe whatsoeuer God remitted at the praier of Moses and Aaron, and for his couenant made with Dauid, or whatsoeuer he gaue to the memorie of that holie man, he remitted, and gaue for Iesus Christs sake, in whome onelie his iustice was satisfied, and he well pleased. But your high priest with his Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian pardons, and punishments, which are grounded vpon the merites of men, or coloured with the merites of Christ, which yet are rent and rorne from the effect of his death, Christ will destroy with the breath of his mouth, and abolish with his glorious appearing. For the death and passion of his sonne Iesus Christ, God wil be merciful to his seruants that by faith take holde of the power of his death: but neither by masses nor pardons doth he bestow the vertue thereof. The good workes and sufferings of the saintes, be examples of vertue and patience, not merits or gifts of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. The death of Christ answering Gods iustice, and reconciling vs to his fauour, hath made that good workes of his saintes, which are the giftes of his grace

though vnperfect, as they proceede from vs vnpure and vnworthie vessells, yet neuerthelesse to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table before God vnto rewarde, which he giueth of meere mercie, and not of merite or deserte. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no shadow for Popish pardons, to shroude themselues vnder the winges of the good workes of Saintes, which are the fruites of faith, to declare them to be iustified, not anie cause by which in the sight of God they can appeare iust, and much lesse be able to iustifie other.</p>

                  <p>IT is pitie, that the president of the <hi>Quodlibeticall</hi> dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Louane,</hi> had no more discretion, then to propounde in steede of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, of learning, a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion perteining to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and doeings of other people, with whome, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the speaker, nor the hearers had any thing to doe, neither were hable by knowledge of their affaires to discearne the cause, nor by authoritie of their place, to decide the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie. But seeing they are disposed, otherwise then wise men woulde be, to be curious in a foraine common wealth; and <hi>Fowler</hi> hath fantafied, that the same also may apperteine to England, which in <hi>Flaunders</hi> was de claimed against <hi>Fraunce:</hi> Let vs see what <hi>Peter Frarine</hi> bringeth, which may concerne the comon cause of religion, where in they of <hi>France,</hi> against whome he hath shot his bolt, doe agree with vs in England. First he saith, <hi>as moste wicked persons, they haue disturbed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12222:445"/>
and peace.</hi> A grieuous accusation. But where is the proofe? The question of religion, he leaueth to be handled of others, the deciding whereof neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, would purge the persons accused, for the most part of the other crime of disturbance, of peace. Well, the respo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dent is not to be blamed, that standeth vpon that question <hi>which according to the custome of the schoole, was propounded to be the argument of his talke at that time.</hi> And therefore he wil open &amp; declare, first <hi>that there was no cause, or iust occasion why these men should rise, and make insurrection.</hi> Then that <hi>they tooke weapon in hand without authoritie, contrarie to law, and in dispite of all Magistrates and Rulers. Last and finallie, that they vsed themselues to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellie, &amp; handled their sworde to bloodelie, to the greatest dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, hindrance, and losse, that euer was felt in Christendome.</hi> These are the diuisions of the circle, with in which the orator hath inclosed himselfe. But al these points, so farre as they concerne the troubles in <hi>France,</hi> are fullie and directlie confuted, by all the edictes of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, giuen forth to the knowledge of the world, by <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, and <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, Kings of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> in which they haue alwaies acknowledged, that the Protestants vpon iust cause, with sufficient authoritie, and in their seruice, and to their honour, haue put them selues in armes, and done whatsoeuer the necessitie of warre lawfullie taken in hande, hath inforced them to doe. Then iudge, whether against the publike testimonie of two Kings, whome the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moste concerned, and that more then once, or twise repeted, I need to stand in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futation of <hi>Peter Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> petty &amp; priuate declamation. Notwithstanding although I haue with one hatchet hewen a sunder the wholle stoke, of this rayling oration, yet I will not spare to brattell out the bowes, and branches thereof, in answering to euerie particular quarrell, and cauil of the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There was not anie good or reasonable cause</hi> (saith he) <hi>why
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12222:445"/>
the founders, and brokers of this new Gospell, should be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to put them-selues in armes, against the Catholikes.</hi> See how the vaine declaimer, which refused before, to handle the question of religion, now taketh vpon him most arrogantlie to decide the same. For if the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes be founders and brokers of a new Gospell, and the Papistes be good Catholikes, there is no cause, why they should once open their mouthes against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, much lesse arme them-selues, (as he said they did) against the Catholikes. But if this matter pertaine to the question of religion, the debating whereof is not presentlie intended, let vs pardon him these preiudiciall tearmes, as well now, as hereafter, and consider onelie, what reasons he bringeth, to prooue his purpose. <hi>No lawes ought to be chaunged, with out great cause, least of all the lawes of religion.</hi> So farre we both agree: but there is great cause to change lawes ofreligion; when Antichristes decrees haue displaced the lawes of God, the onelie rule of true religion. Yet (saith he) <hi>there can neuer be anie reason, or sufficient cause alledged, that innouation of religion, should be attempted by force of armes, by warre, and rebellion, by fier, and sword, by murder, and blood shed, of good and faithfull subiectes,</hi> Let this also be graunted: for this nothing toucheth the cause of them, which, to mantaine a law made for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to defend them-selues from the crueltie of priuate persons, are required by the gouernours of the realme to arme themselues, for defence of the King his lawes, and their owne liues.</p>
                  <p>The lawe of the <hi>Locrensians</hi> pleaseth him well: <hi>that the procurer of anie alteration, should preach with a rope about his necke, wherewith he should be strangled, if the audience misliked his deuise.</hi> The rope had neede to be in wise mens handes, where that lawe should be practised; or els the Apostles, and first preachers of religion in the world, might haue bene hardlie handled, before they had halfe vttered their message. And therefore the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12222:446"/>
Princes, and rulers of the word in this our time, are wiser then <hi>Peter Frarine,</hi> or <hi>Iohn Fowler,</hi> in not establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and practising of this Iawe, as these men would wish they had. But <hi>the default thereof</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath caused so lamentable an estate of all thinges, warres, tumults, slaughters, ruines, Churches, and townes ouerturned, &amp;c.</hi> Admit these were the effectes (as they are nothing lesse) of the Protestants preaching; what woulde the lawe of the <hi>Locrensians</hi> haue staied in this case; when with the good liking both of the Prince, and of the people, these preachers haue bene heard, and their doctrine receiued? <hi>It greeueth him, that it was free for these preachers, without anie feare of the rope frankelie and boldelie to perswade with the people.</hi> And thinketh he that feare of the <hi>Locrensians</hi> rope woulde haue restrained them, whome the terror of Antichristes fire, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall torments, neuer discouraged to publish the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Christ their master? Naie <hi>they went further, from wordes to woundes, and blowes, they attempted refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, by ciuill warre and rebellion. There was a companie of desperate persons that ranne about the strcetes of Parris, with naked swordes in their hands, and cried out, the gospell, the gospell, (as Claudius de sanctes,</hi> an vtter enemie of the gospell, <hi>beareth witnes</hi>) But I praie you M. <hi>Frarine</hi> were these preachers that so ranne and cried, that beside <hi>varnished wordes disbursed woundes and blowes?</hi> If they were not preachers, (as your author <hi>Claudius</hi> cannot saie they were) how hangeth your talke togither? Must the preachers be charged with euerie disorder of their hearers. Then let the Popish preachers answere, for all thefts, murders, treasons, incests, rebellions, and other offenses, of papists; but if anie such desperate persons ranne about, as you saie, how prooue you, that they were disciples, of the protestant Preachers, and not rather futious firebrands, of the popish friers, and <hi>Sorbonicall</hi> teachers, by whose seditious sermons, they were incensed to murder the Protestants, and true
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12222:446"/>
professors of the Gospell; for how like is it, that so smal a number of the Protestants, as was neuer able to afford but an handfull of fighting men in Parris, would attempt to arme themselues, against such an infinite multitude of zealous, &amp; mutinous Papists, as were in that Citie? Where the verie Croisters and common porters, (that I speake nothing of so manie thousand artificers) had bene able, not onlie to haue withstood their attempt, but also to haue chased them out of the citie. Notwithstanding, if you willneedes vrge your Authors reporte, that they were Protestantes, why doe you not tell vs how manie they slewe with those glistering swordes? At least wise name one whome they wounded with those weopons in their handes, when they cried out, <hi>The gospell, the gospell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Contrariwise how thirstie of bloode the Papistes &amp; their preachers haue beene, it is an easie matter to make manifest proofe. For that I speake nothing of the horrible massacre most cruellie executed not onelie in <hi>Paris;</hi> but throughout al the realme of <hi>France:</hi> the crueltie whereof would ouer whelme at once, and swallow vp whatsoeuer can be fained of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes seueritie. There be manie hundreth witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses aliue, which can reporte, that in the latter end of the reigne of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, the Popish prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers perceiuing how greatly he fauoured their cause, stirred vp the people in their dailie sermons vnto sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, affirming that it was a thing acceptable vnto God, and meritorious, if anie man should kill a <hi>Luthe rane:</hi> whereupon insued manie horrible murders, of which some are perticularlie recorded in historie. In the Church yeard of <hi>Saint Innocents</hi> immediatlie after a sermon, when two were brawling as the people came <note place="margin">Comment. de statu lib. 1.</note> forth of the Church, and the one more of spite, then of anie cause, called the other <hi>Lutherane,</hi> the people streight waie ranne vpon him, and pursued him into the Church, whether he fled for sanctuary. A certaine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12222:447"/>
gentleman passing that waie, with his brother, which was a Popish Priest, hearing that a man should be slaine of the people, in deuoureth to pacifie their mindes with faire words, to deliuer the pore man from their hands. A hedge Priest by and by crieth out, that this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was the man whome they sought for, which durst defend a <hi>Lutherane.</hi> The people immediately set vppon the gentleman. The priest his brother began to speake for him: but thereby they were more inraged. To be short, after they were both drawne out of the Church, the gentleman hardlie escaped into the Curats house: The poore priest with manie woundes was cruellie murdered, saying his <hi>Confiteor,</hi> by which it did suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie appeare he was no <hi>Lutherane.</hi> Not manie daies before that, a certaine <hi>Sorbonist</hi> (whom they called the <hi>Picardes soule,</hi> a common trumpet of sedition in those daies) to inflame the people against the <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed often to beate vpon this point, <hi>that it was an holie thing to shed the Lutheranes blood.</hi> The slaughter of whome, as of the Cananites of olde time, was verie acceptable to God, and that the handes of the godlie Catholikes should so be consecrated. Acertaine stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which came to heare one of his sermons, chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to smile vpon his fellow which sat by him: an olde woman that espying, cried out, that there was a <hi>Lutherane</hi> which mocked the preacher. The brutish people no sooner heard that voice but without further enquirie, they drue that student out of the Church, and most cruellie digged out his eies, and dinged out his braines.</p>

You are greatlie deceiued: the minde maie be induced by reason, it can not be compelled by stripes.</hi> No sir: they neuer had purpose to perswade faith by blowes and battell, neither did they euer put on armour for such purpose; but constrained by injury, and allowed by authoritie to defend themselues.

                     </hi> But I praie you <hi>Master Frarine,</hi> saith <hi>Luther</hi> so much of all that professed the Gospell, which he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: or of some hypocrits, whose wickednes was grea ter after knowledge receiued, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was in ignorance?

And this</hi> (he saith) <hi>that all the world knoweth.</hi> If you aske him, by what testimonie? he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a slaunderous libellintituled <hi>passauant Parisien</hi> printed at <hi>Paris</hi> 1559.

                  <p>From <hi>Caluine</hi> our <hi>Frarine</hi> passeth to <hi>Beza,</hi> whome with like impudencie he burdeneth with two hainous crimes: and yet so confidentlie, that he doubteth not to speake vnto him in these wordes. <hi>Denie if thou dare Theodore Beza, denie if thou canst for shame:</hi> Would you not thinke, he had manifest proofes of the crimes in such sorte obiected? Let vs heare then, what they are. First he chargeth <hi>Beza, to haue sold his eccleslasticall liuinges (which he had in Fraunce) before his departure to two diuers men for readie monié. For which double dealing he was denounced excommunicate, and so proclaimed in all the market places of Parris.</hi> To prooue this crime, he quoteth in the margent, <hi>the preface of Bezaes confession.</hi> But in that preface <hi>Beza</hi> indeed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth, that the reuenewes of those Church liuinges (which his friendes had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for him) were a great let to him for a long sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to make open confession of his faith, from the sweetnes of which gaine, as a filthie dogg from greasie

leather, he could hardlie be driuen awaie, vntill al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God by an extreame sicknes, so waked him out of that securitie, that immediatlie after his first recouerie, he left at once his countrie, Parents, and friendes, and departed with his wife vnto <hi>Geneua.</hi> But of selling his benefices in such an vnhonest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, there is no mention: but contrariwise in the same preface, he defieth all the world, for any other crime of dishonestie, then the setting forth of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wanton verses, which were made when he was a child, and printed while he was vnder the age of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares. The second crime obiected is: <hi>that he mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an other mans wife, who was a tailor, dwelling in Harpe street at Paris:</hi> whome <hi>Master Charkes</hi> Censurer out of <hi>Bolsec,</hi> affirmeth to haue dwelt in the <hi>Calender street</hi> (that you maie know how wel the witnesses agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither) with further slaunderrs: as <hi>that shee was called of Beza Mistres Candidae or mistres Bewtie in his bawdie verses.</hi> Whereas it is well knowne, that <hi>Beza</hi> in that poeticall fiction, deuised after the imitation of auncient Poets, meant no special person; and least of all could meane his wife: for that in those verses he commendeth <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didae,</hi> being great with childe to the Gods, Whereas his wife neuer had anie childe by him. Further he saith <hi>that shee fled to the stewes, because her husband hauing taken her in adultery had giuen her a gash with a knife in the hippe.</hi> A pretie inuention, if the gash had bene in her face, or in anie other part of her bodie, that might haue bene seene with honestie; some or other should haue beene witnes of the scarre: and therefore it is placed, where none for shame, might demaund the sight for triall. An other cause of her flight vnto the stewes was (as he saith) <hi>because she had bene put in prison, for that she fetched a friscoll when she was dawnsing in a tauerne with her customers, &amp; said. Hoigh one leape more for all Christian soules.</hi> A sorie cause why she should flie to the comme stewes, because shee had beene imprisoned. Is it not more like if any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12222:450" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such thing had beene, or if shee had beene willing to depart from her husband, that shee hauing so many customers, as this tale pretendeth, and specially <hi>Beza,</hi> who could spend seuen hundred crownes by the yeare, (as he confesseth) would not haue sought aid of him, or them, rather then to haue cast her selfe into a place of such publike infamie. But all this fable is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie denied of <hi>Beza,</hi> as containing no sparke of trueth: for his wife (whom he maried priuilie in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the presence of one or two onelie of his friendes) was of so godlie and honest behauionr, that she would not consent to the match, but vpon expresse promise and condition, that assone as he could conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, al impediments set asside, he should carie her into the Church of God, and openlie confirme the matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie betweene them, and also that in the meane time he should enter into none of the Popish orders: both which conditions he faithfullie performed. Here isnothing therefore brought against <hi>Beza,</hi> or his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous wife, but accusations without witnes, slaunders without proofe, lies without colour or shew of trueth. The like I saie of that generall railing which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, both against <hi>the schollers of this gospellish congregation</hi> (as he scornefullie termeth them) <hi>and the Mistres of the same: whose wickednes in all kinde of horrible sinnes</hi> he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be <hi>so great that if the lot had bin betweene the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes and the papists (which order of iustice he wisheth had bin obserued) that whether haue most wickedly tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgressed gods and mans laws, should haue gone first to the gallowes, there had not beene one Protestant left aliue to holde warre against the Papists.</hi> I am ashamed to vse any wordes in confutation of such a monstrous a lie, which no eninmie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes being in his right wittes, doth thinke in his conscience to bere any credit, or similitude of trueth. Many called Protestantes haue beene wicked liuers: but that all should be condemned in capitall crimes, beyond the moste wicked of the Papists, it is too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

And although they failed not of proofe, if they had beene heard before indifferent iudges, yet haue they beene cruellie tormented, and put to death, for the testimonie of the trueth: whereas if <hi>Frarine</hi> should haue beene bounde to the ordinance of the law, which he prescribeth to others, if he had as many liues, as <hi>Hydra</hi> is fained to haue heades, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die would not haue sufficed, to the execution which he hath deserued, both for his particular slaunders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some men, and for his last generall accusation of all Protestantes. <hi>But yet more impudentlie you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued your selues, and more contrarie to all order and forme of lawfull proceeding: for in this your monstrous iudgement of reformation, you were accusers, witnesses, Iudges, and hang men yourselues.</hi> Howe much more rightlie, might he haue vttered this against the Pope, who beeing accused of heresie and blasphemie, would be his owne iudge, and tried by no witnes, butof his owne allowing: wheras the Protestantes neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the arbitriment of a free, and lawful councel, the auncient remedie to decide the controuersies of the Church, where the word of God should be the highest Iudge, against which no conuocation of men haue power to define any thing.</p>

But as for vowes made to god, except they be of things vnlawfull, or which are not in our power to performe, who doubteth but they are inuiolablie to be obserued. The vow of chastitie in such as are not able to conteine, is not kept, by not marrying; But rather dailie broken in burning. The remedie whereof, by the iudgement of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Saint Hierom,</hi> and the Catholike Church of their times, is mariage: and not the common stewes, and brothell houses, light women, maried and vnmaried, and Nuns fallen from their profession; which <hi>Frarine</hi> doth leaue vnto them, as a lesse euell then mariage. But where are those common stewes, and brothel howses, which (he saith) <hi>are open at all times, and euerie where at mens pleasures?</hi> Are there any to be shewed vnder such Christian Princes &amp; Magistrates, as manteine the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospell? no verilie: but where poperie reigneth, &amp; where the Pope setreth himselfe at Rome.

And if the satisfying of lust, without regard of conscience had beene the marke they shot at, they needed not so to haue bound themselues to one woman in mariage, which bringeth manie cares, and troubles with it, when they might without controllement haue had their change and choice (as you confesse) by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon stewes euerie where, euen to the cloying of carnall lust, if they had continued still in Poperie.</p>

There resistance therefore, was not treason, rebellion, crueltie, (as this declaimer raueth) buto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, iustice, and authoritie, to withstand treason, crueltie, and rebellion. Yet againe he repeateth, that <hi>lack of libertie, was no iust cause of these warres, seing euerie where they might fill their paunches, carrie a sister wife, about with them, toule Nuns out of cloysters, &amp; filthilie abuse them,</hi> still he speaketh as though none were Authors, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines or Souldiers of these warres, but such licentious ministers, or as though so manie princes, noble men, gentlemen, and valiant souldiers, as serued in those warres, had no other quarrell, but to maintaine the gluttonie and lecherie of a fewe lewde ministers; of which sort yet he is not able to name one: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he saith that <hi>moste commonlie euerie Apostate Monke, had his Nun at his toile: and holie Kate hir holie mate:</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the worlde knoweth that this might better be verefied of Clauster all Monkes and Nunnes, of limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting friers, and their holie sisters.

                  <p>To conclude this first part, he saith, <hi>it was neither religion, nor gospell, nor Gods quarrell, they meant to further, but malice against the pope. as Luther</hi> in an epistle <hi>ad argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin:</hi> confesseth.

Sergius, of whome all Popes since, saue one, haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the custome to chaunge there names: which thing if <hi>Luther</hi> had done, he had done, no worse, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pope had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him example, to do. It is a folish quarrel, that is picked against a mans name which he hath receiued of his elders, although the name of <hi>Luther,</hi> being of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <note place="margin">Luther in duch signifi eth pure or cleare.

And whoe should be the authors of such a report? But such impudent wretches, as shewed more malice then wit, in deuising such a monstrous lie, as neuer was, nor euer could be. And yet what papist is there, of any acount, which fauoreth not this foolish fable: which although in their conscience they know, it neither was, nor can be true, yet are not onelie content that it runne among fooles, as a currant argument: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so offer it in their writinges to the ignorant, as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sufficient to discredit <hi>Luther,</hi> and all his teaching. But to proceed, <hi>that he studied the ciuill law, when he was yong: that he was mooued to become an Augustine frier, by terror of his companione slaine with thunder or lightning:</hi> if it were neuer so true, what needed it to be rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: seeing it maketh nothing to the lawfullnes of his calling, or to the discredit of his doctrine. But <hi>at last</hi> (saith he) <hi>he was made Doctor with shame enough, for he came to that degree, with the monie that was bequethed vnto an other man, whom with the helpe of his prior he be guiled.</hi> If <hi>Luther</hi> were not sufficientlie knowne to the world, to haue beene excellentlie well learned, he would insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, thathe were like <hi>a doctor Bullatus</hi> which bought his

doctorshippe of the Pope for mony. But seeing for the solemnitie of that degree in schooles, their is vsuall some expences, he chargeth <hi>Luther at the least, to haue come by that monie wrongfullie, and as it were by theft.</hi> They that write the storie of his life affirme, that the Prince his soueraigne, did beare the charges of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this slaunder of <hi>Frarine,</hi> as it is void of profe, so hath it not so much as anie likelie hood of truth. For <hi>Luther</hi> being at that time a frier, could possesse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in proper, no more could anie other frier pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse anie monie, that was bequeathed vnto them. Now if the prior of the house did defraie the charges of <hi>Luthers</hi> commencement, with the legacie that was giuen to anie other of his bretheren, it was all one, as if he had done it out of there common boxe: for friers possesse nothing in proper, but in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, the dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof pertaineth to the head of the house. But if he will saie, this other man was no frier, then he must shewe what he was, whoe was the testator, what fraude <hi>Luther</hi> and his <hi>Prior</hi> vsed to deceiue him, and bring good proofe thereof, or els who is bound to beleeue him?</p>
                  <p>But to goe forward: <hi>other estate, or degree, or Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe he knoweth not, that Luther had anie.</hi> what then? was not this sufficient calling for him that was a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Popish Church, to preach against the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uses and errors thereof? and when his doctrine and conclusions were vndoubtedly agreeable to the holie scriptures, might he not iustlie affirme that they were from heauen? And that he was sent from heauen to teach the <hi>Germanes</hi> the trueth of the Gospell, which of long time had beene hidden from them. For <hi>that he was their first Apostle or that before his daies, they neuer had any true religion or Christian doctrine,</hi> he neuer said. Neither did he make more account of himselfe, then of <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi> and all other Fathers of the Church, although in the booke quoted, by <hi>Frarine</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:12222:456" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he preferreth that doctrine, which is agreeable to the holie scriptures, before the iudgement of <hi>Augustine,</hi> and all men that euer were. As for the <hi>familiar confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and talke with the Deuill,</hi> which <hi>Frarine</hi> affirmeth <hi>that he reporieth of himselfe.</hi> And that <hi>Cocleus</hi> and al his enemies doe gnaw so much vpon, to prooue, that <hi>he was set on by the Deuil, to gainesaie the masse:</hi> Is nothing but a ridiculous cauill. For <hi>Luther</hi> speaketh of a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conflict that he had with <hi>Sathan,</hi> for saying masse so long, which at length he acknowledged to be blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous against the death of Christ.

As for miracles they are not to be required, where the same doctrine is taught, which so long agoe hath beene confirmed by the miracles of Christ and his Apostles, and those fables of raising vp dead men by <hi>Caluine</hi> and others, are like the tales of <hi>Robin Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow,</hi> which are reported to be done in so many places, that no wise man thinketh them to be done in any. Next this followeth a wholl floode of tedious rhetoricall railing, in generall accusations of <hi>schisme, heresie, tumulis, sedition, rebellion, contempt of Princes and lawes, order, and honestie.</hi> At length he desireth to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of his bitternes, in respect of the cursed mouthes of them which raile against Princes and Prelates.</hi> Yet bringeth no example, but of <hi>Luthers penne,</hi> whome many men wish in deede to haue vsed a more temperate stile, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, especiallie against Princes, &amp; temporall estates, and he himselfe did openlie acknowledge his faulte therein, especiallie his immoderate inuection against King <hi>Henrie</hi> the 8.

That <hi>Luther diswaded al men to obey the vngodlie decree of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, proclaimed at Wormes:</hi> who can iustlie be offended, which knoweth, that the obedience to Princes may not be yealded with manifest disobedience vnto God? But here a great matter. <hi>Luther saied in hearing of the Emperour at Wormes, vpon those wordes of our Sauiour Christ in the Gospell (I came not to send peace, but the sword.) That it ought to be a thing wished for, as moste acceptable to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men, and especiallie vnto him that strife and contention should rise and grow about the worde of God.</hi> The witnes of this report is <hi>Lindane,</hi> who farseth his Dialogues of <hi>dubitantius,</hi> with al manner of fables that he can heare, sounding to the discredit of <hi>Luther,</hi> and the <hi>Protestants.</hi> Although I see not what great harme should be in these words, being vnderstood according to the saying of our sauiour Christ: that seeing all men will neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to imbrace the word of God; it were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that many men would contend against the impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for it; then that al men should agree to withstand it. But <hi>Luther</hi> is charged, to haue <hi>set out to the view of the wholl worlde, seditious, and heresicall bookes, wherein he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to abolish all due obedience, and to perswade the people torebellion, robbing, murth er, sacking and burning of Citties, and Churches.</hi> I hope there is no man so farre caried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all iudgement of reason, that he will beleeue this slaunder to be true, seeing it is not possible, that such a monster (as he faineth him to be) should haue beene so much fauoured and cherished by Princes and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, as <hi>Luther</hi> was. Neuerthelesse you shall heare his proofes. First, <hi>Wicelius, Luthers</hi> enemie reporteth, that he saied, that <hi>men should wash their handes in the bloode of the Romish cleargie.</hi> If this reporte were true, it prooueth not the former accusation. For allbeit the Popish

cleargie were all slaine, by lawfull authoritie, in dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of there blasphemie and idolatry. The gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of the Church and common wealth, should neuer the more decay: but how are we bound to beleue <hi>Wicelius</hi> without proofe in this, or in any other matter. Then saith <hi>Frarine, he affirmed in his writinges, that it was the verie nature of the Gospell to mooue and stirre vp warre &amp; sedition, that there ought to be no Magistrate, no superiour at all among Christian men.</hi> For which he quoteth <hi>Epist. ad frat. infer. Ger.</hi> which is an impudent fiction. For he neuer writte anie such epistle, or taught anie such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; but the cleane contrarie, of the necessitie of Magistrates in al Christian common wealths. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he chargeth him to haue written, <hi>lib. de Potest, secula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, that men ought to pray to God, that the vplandish men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey not their Princes, nor goe to warre against the Turke,</hi> the title of which booke finde not in his workes. And sure I am, no such matter is conteined in anie booke, of what title soeuer, but contrariwise he writeth, many treatises against the rebellious <hi>Bowres,</hi> verie earnestlie condemning their disobedience and sedition. Thirdlie he quoteth <hi>lib. contr. duo edict. Caesaris,</hi> that <hi>men shoulde contribute nothing towardes the charges of the warres against the Turke:</hi> which is malitiouslie construed, as though he denied tribute to the Emperour, whereas he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the iudgemét of the slates of <hi>Germany</hi> (which when the Emperour would yelde nothing to their requestes for the libertie of religion) denied to graunt him a subsidie or contribution. which he required vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence to resist the <hi>Turke,</hi> when his purpose seemes rather to be bent against the French King, and perhaps euen against them, whose monie he defireth to be giuen him. He warneth them also that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt not rashly to warre vpon the <hi>Turke,</hi> who in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and moderation doth farre excell these Princes, and liuing as they did might hope of no victory.

But <hi>Frarine</hi> saith more craftelie that by <hi>occasion of debate about the Lutherane Gospell, and so through Luthers meanes the Turke conceaued hope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all Germanie, when he came to the Citie of Vienna beeing the key of Christ endome, with such a huge great host.</hi> What if this be graunted, is Luther (which preached the Gospel of Christ) the cause of the Turkes inuasion, or they that will not embrace the trueth of God by him reueiled?</p>

And this if you denie</hi> (saith he) <hi>your names are to be seene yet in the recordes of the high court of Parliament at Paris: where manie of you were accused for it, by the rulers and estates of Burgondie.</hi> A sufficient proofe no doubt, that the names of them that were accused are extant in recorde. It is sufficient proofe among the Papists that men be accused, and that by their malitious aduersaries, yea the verie accusation is a condemnation. But it seemeth the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> had more regard of lawe and iustice, then to giue sentence against them vpon a bare accusation: for if it be sufficient to accuse, no man shall be innocent. If the court had condemned them, he would haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the sentence and lawfull processe remaining in record against them. But almightie God knoweth that the Protestantes haue not onelie bene free, but haue alwaies abhorred such <hi>Anabaptisticall</hi> conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

and laboured by al meanes to establish the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and obedience due vnto Princes, which the Pope by his pretended supremacie, shamefullie vsurpeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; as though the charge of feeding &amp; spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gouernment were graunted onelie to the Pope by those wordes of Christ to <hi>Peter,</hi> Or if it were, that vnder colour of feeding and spirituall gouernment, <note place="margin">Iohn. 21.</note> he had authoritie to commaund Princes at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, yea to commaund their crownes of their heades, and their scepters out of their handes as euen at this present, that vile <hi>Antichrist</hi> ceaseth not to practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the moste lawfull and Christian <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>

                     <hi>The articles of which diuers were these. That nothing should be done against the King, the Princes of his blood, and the state of the realme.

But <hi>Frarine being at Orleans in the time of that warre, did see with his eies a seditious sibell, printed in the name of all Hugonites, wherein was nothing but impudent bouldnes, threatning, and weason.</hi> Neuerthelesse he confesseth that this libell was not allowed of the Prince, and states, when he saieth, <hi>the printer was kept and feasted a few daies with the officers of that towne, within their houser instead of a prison.</hi> Belike the libell was not so harnous (<hi>as Frarire</hi> affirmeth) else it is not to be thought, but that the printer should haue had greater punishment.

But a greater accusation is behinde. <hi>When the Emperour Charles was entangled at Oenipont, the great Turk was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to make warre in defence of there Gospell, and the Bassa of Bude to set vpon his brother Ferdinande in Hungarie.</hi> Who affirmeth this? <hi>Staphilus</hi> the runnegate which neuer, lied, or rather which seldome spake the truth. <hi>tush</hi> saith <hi>Frarine, the letters of that conspiracie were taken, their treason by no coloure can be cloked.</hi> Whose letters <hi>Frarine?</hi> by whome were they taken, by whom were they sent? to whome were they directed? If you answere nothing, we saie, it is as easie for you or <hi>Staphilus,</hi> to faine the taking of letters, as the conspiracie with the <hi>Turk.</hi> The next complaint is of <hi>abolishing the laws of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial chamber, that all things may be decided with fire &amp; sword, (as Brunus saith)</hi> which is an impudent slaunder.

Vnto the last place he reserued the weightiest matter of all, and that is: <hi>their contempt of the councell of Trent, in railing at all the Prelates &amp; Princes, &amp; in refusing to come thether vnder sufficient safe conduct.</hi> As for Princes, which are no part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, it is false that they contemned them: but <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and his rable of Idolatrous Priestes and prelates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue a worse thing then contempt. that they refuse to come to the Chapter of <hi>Trent</hi> among manie reasons they haue two most euident to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

When all was Poperie, and no appearance of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention in religion, the <hi>Turke</hi> neuerthelesse gained and Christendome went to wracke. Therefore moste vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonablelie is the <hi>Turkes</hi> gaine and our losse, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Protestants warres, whoe mooue none, but such as are necessarie, for defence of religion, and the common wealth, when they are lawfullie called thereunto. Likewise the <hi>shutting vp of the schoole dores, and the solitarines of diuerse vniuersities in Fraunce,</hi> which is an vsuall effect of warre, must be laied to the charge of them, whose oppression, crueltie and tyrannie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced those warres. That <hi>Luther despised the vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Louaine, and called it a stable of Asset, stewes, and schoole of the diuell,</hi> it was not for hatred of good learning; but in contempt of those Barbarous doltes, which in those daies opposed them selues against the light of the truth.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12222:465" rendition="simple:additions"/>
building, able to receiue the multitude of that vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, should haue beene erected. In the meane time the exercises of learning ceased not in euery colledge, no nor yet the ordinary disputations inlogick and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie were left of, but remooued to a more publike place, namelie to <hi>Saint Maries</hi> Church, where Master <hi>Warde,</hi> the great professor of philosophie, in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of manie yet a liue, did exercise the same: by meanes of which, good learning was as much promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in King <hi>Edwardes</hi> time, as euer it was before or since. Naie saith <hi>Frarine, they haue set their heades toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fullie agreed among them selues, to banish the greeke, and latine tongues quite and cleane out of the country.</hi> O monster of impudencie: who hath more deserued, of the Greeke, Latine, Hebrew, Caldy, Syrian, and Arabique tongues, then such as haue bene professours of the Gospell? Who are found in all places better learned in the tongues then they? who haue more care to instruct youth in the knowledge of the tonges, then they? I knew the vniuersitie of Cambridge in <hi>Queene Maries</hi> time; and this I dare be bolde to saie, there are more good Grecians in one of the litle col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges now; then was in those daies in the wholl vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie. But it is a great confirmation of <hi>Frarines</hi> or <hi>Fowlers</hi> senslesse slaunder, that a <hi>preacher in the diocesse of Sarum, beeing ignorant in the Latine tongue, thanked God, that he had neuer learned that Romish, and Papisticall tongue.</hi> If any such thing were, it shewed the folly of one man, which might be requited with an hundred mery tales, of Sir Ihon Lacklatines in poperie, if a man were disposed to blot paper with such bables. <hi>But their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of schooles and vniuersities</hi> (saith he) <hi>they excuse, by bringing all knowledge into the mother tongue, and by inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, a compendious order of teaching, wherby children in short time may profit more, then auncient men in many yeares of olde time.</hi> True it is that much knowledge is brought into the vulgare tongue, for the benefit of them, which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12222:466" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue not studied the learned languages; and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode of teaching, hath found an easie waie in shorte time to great knowledge &amp; learning: but it is vtterlie false, that any such excuse is made, for the ouerthrow of schooles and vniuersities, which the professours of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion desire by al meanes to be mainteined and increased, as there is manifest experience in all places where our religion is imbraced by publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. When <hi>Luther burnt certeine bookes of the Canon law,</hi> he meant no decay of good learning, but protested <note place="margin">Epit hal. Pont. aeg.</note> against the heresie &amp; blasphemie of the Pope, of which those bookes were full. who neuerthelesse most iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouslie condemned <hi>Luther</hi> vnhard, &amp; burnt his bookes vnconfuted. Whatsoeuer <hi>Corolostadius</hi> did against good learning, seeing <hi>Frarine</hi> confesieth <hi>it was misliked by Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> what should the blame therof extend any further then the offendour? But <hi>Frarine wisheth they had beene satisfied with burning of bookes, and had not proceeded to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of men, cutting of throtes, tearing, &amp; chopping in peèces,</hi> with much foolish amplification of their crueltie in generall tearmes. All which might be exemplified more truelie of Popish tyrannie in time of peace, then it can be verified of any outrage committed in time of warre, &amp; allowed by the Princes and captaines of the fielde, or by the preachers and teachers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. But at length he descendeth to some particulars, &amp; calleth forth <hi>Beza</hi> to tell him, <hi>why he went vp to the pulpit in Orlians with his sword by his side, and a pistolate in his hand, and exhorted the people to shew their manhood, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in killing the papists, then in breaking of images, al which was reported to him at Orlians.</hi> Although in time of warre it were not much to be wondered, if the peacher espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie in such places where be manie traiterous eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (as were that time in <hi>Orlians</hi>) should be armed as well as other men: yet it hath bene reported vnto me, by them which heard dailie <hi>Beza</hi> preaching at <hi>Orlianes,</hi> that there was no such matter. But if he exhorted sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12222:466" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to exercise their manhoode against their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, rather then vpon stokes and stones, seing the warre was lawfull and necessarie, I see not whie he should be reprehended. The rest which followeth, wherein he is charged <hi>with murther of Magistrates, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of townes, spoiling the countrie, pulling downe of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, giuing the spoill to straungers, prophaning of Churches with his whores, and laying vp of armour, and lodging of soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, robbing of all Churches in which he came,</hi> is nothing but generall slaundering vnworthie of any wise mans answer, other then a flat &amp; general denial of al. In like manner, <hi>that he saith was reported vnto him, by Caluines schoolefellowes in lawe, that he stole the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Also <hi>that Beza in Champanie tooke many Priestes prisoners, sat in iudgement vppon them, condemned some to dongeons, some to be hanged, some to be burned, other to be beheaded, so that his mouth was sprinkeled with the bloode and braines of those that were murdered at his feete:</hi> Is any man so madde, that he will beleeue it? That many priestes were slaine in time of that warre, it is not altogether vnlike. For the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies spared not to murder the preachers of the gospel moste cruellie, wheresoeuer they found them: yet of certaine and true reporte we heare not of many, beside those two which were hanged at <hi>Orleans,</hi> of which <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Guisent</hi> beeing a cruell in quisitor, had cast the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of <hi>Orleanes</hi> in prison, and they both had beene extreame persecutors of the Gospell in time of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish tyrannie. Yet had not this example of seueritie beene shewed vpon them, if the Papists by hanging vp of <hi>Augustine Marlorate,</hi> and other learned and Godlie
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12222:467" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preachers at <hi>Rone,</hi> after they were taken prisoners, contrarie to the law of armes, had not inforced the Prince and estates vnto this warlike kind of reuenge, vpon two which had well deserued it, to teach them to vse more clemencie toward such of the religion, as might afterward happe to fal into their handes.</p>
                  <p>What outrage soeuer was committed by the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, without commaundement and consent of the Princes and Captaines, no wise man will impute to the wholl state of Protestantes, as <hi>Frarine</hi> doth: and yet he bringeth nothing but flying tales, such as in time of warre are blowne abroad on both sides. I haue giuen some diligence to enquire of them which liued in Fraunce at that time, and they can saie nothing, that they heard of anie such examples of barbarous cruelty committed by the Soldiers of the Protestants campe, as <hi>Frarine</hi> hath heaped together: except the reporte of one, which made him a chaine of Priestes cares, who for his crueltie (when he required to be of the Church of Geneua) was not receiued &amp; yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that he killed all those Priestes whose eares he cut of. Neuertheles they confesse, that although the discipline of warre was as well looked vnto, as in that state of thinges it could be, yet manie things were done by vnrulie Soldiers: which neither the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, nor the Preachers could thinke well of. If anie that fled out of <hi>Orleans</hi> to carrie newes to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, were hardlie dealt with all, it is the lesse mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, seing within the citie keeping them-selues qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etlie, they might haue continued without anie man hurting them, as a great number of the Popish priests liued there euen to the end of the warre. whereby it appeareth that those reportes of crueltie deserue lesse credit. <hi>that Priestes were dragged with ropes about their neckes in the streete, bound to trees, and shot at with gunnes for exercise: that their guttes were wound about a staffe, and drawne out of their bellies, and cast about the house, that they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12222:467" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were hanged vpon the roode in the Church, that their eies were put out, their noses cut of, the toppes of their fingers cut of, the skinne of their crownes pared, their priuie members cut of, rosted, &amp; they compelled to eate them, &amp; afterwards their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ripped to see how they could digest such meate,</hi> and such like monstrous inuentions, which if they had bin true, should haue found some Papist of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> that would haue committed them to writing, &amp; set them forth with all the circumstances, that they should not stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the onelie light report of an Orator of <hi>Louane,</hi> who bringeth no testimonie, but report of one prebendarie of the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Orleans,</hi> whose name he hath forgotten <hi>which laie hidde in a bench hole, and through the chinkes of the bench saw, while the butchers cut of a priests members, pulled out his guttes, and cast his entralles all about the house.</hi> But what if the poore prebendarie was so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with feare, that he imagined he saw through the narrowe creuisses that which was neuer done, nor intended? For what similitude of truth hath it, that the souldiers would so beraie that house with blood and bowells, wherein they themselues lodged? peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a hogge or some other beast was killed &amp; dressed for the Souldiers supper, which he in the bench hole thought to be the Curate of the towne. <hi>The cutting of litle children in peeces at one stroake with a sword, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of children in a Church at Patte, not farre from Orleans,</hi> who will thinke they were like to be true, when <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine</hi> in his inuectiue against <hi>Beza,</hi> could finde no such matter to obiect vnto him, although he obiected a great manie thinges more then were true? But these and such matters, if they had beene committed (as they are impudentlie fained) by barbaous and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious souldiers, why shoulde the reformers of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beare the blame of them? you will saie perhaps, they should reteine no soldiours, of so cruell and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a disposition; and certaine it is, that willinglie and wittinglie they did not: but such is the necessitie of
<pb facs="tcp:12222:468" rendition="simple:additions"/>
warre, that souldiors be not alwaies saints. Dauid for his necessarie defense, was faine to reteine such as came vnto him, which as the scripture describeth them, were scarse honest men, but a sight of male con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, which for debt and desertes could not abide to ta rie in their countrie.

Marcell,</hi> in the place appointed by the King for that purpose, the priests of <hi>S. Medardes</hi> Church thereby, kept such a tangling with their bells, that the preacher could not be heard; whereupon two of the companie went and gentlie desired the Priests to staie their bells, but they being garded with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, fel vpon those two, and the one they slewe in the Church, the other escaped by flight. The priests then went vp into the steeple, and rang the bells back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which they call <hi>Tocksaine,</hi> whereupon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the suburbs flocked rogither, and disturoed the audience with stones. I he seruant of the Magistrate was sent in his masters name, to commaund them to cease their tumult, and keepe peace: But with stones and arrowes he was compelied to returne, whereupon the sermon being broke of, the multitude of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants hasting to the Church, brake open the dores; where finding the dead bodie of him that was slaine, maruell not if they were mooued with indignation: and therefore some of the armed Priests with their complices they apprehended, the rest fled into the stecple, from whence with staues, logges, arrowes, and such like matter, which they had prouided for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; not sparing to throw downe their Idolls, which they had caried vp least they should haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied by the Protestants, they defended themselues a great space, stil ringing the <hi>Tocksaine,</hi> till at the last being threatned that the steeple should be fired, they ceased, about fourtie of them being wounded, and 15.

The next daie the furious people hauing other priests to their captaines, came into the house appointed for the assemblie of the faithfull, brake downe the pulpit and the stooles, and fired the house in manie places, vntil by the saide cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the watch they were put to flight. This is of trueth the some of that sedition. The cause whereof was yet so handled by the Popish iudges, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists were acquitted, and certaine of the Protestantes committed to prison for it. The moste hainous fact of al, except one perhaps, is yet behinde, and that is, <hi>the prophaning of the precious bodie of Christ him selfe, which with furious and outragious impietie, was cast on the ground, trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder feete, hurled into the fire, and into the water, and so despert elie all to be pricked with their swordes, and carried vpon the toppes of their speares.</hi> This he meaneth of their Idol of the altar, called of the french men <hi>Jean blanke,</hi> which of old time (if we beleeue the fables of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, still auouched by great plentie of miraculous hostes and blood to be shewed in diuers places) was so moodie, that if he had bene prickt but with kniues of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Miscreantes,</hi> he yelded forth not onely great streames of blood, but also was auenged by fire or other meanes, of those that so abused him. But where are now those miracles? where is one droppe of blood? where be the examples of his vengeance, aginst so manifest and spitefull contemners? I suppose it was no more but a thing forgotten. For otherwise he might haue fained miracles, blood and vengeance, as wel as all the rest, wherein he hath impudentlie lied and counterfaited.

For therin <hi>Poltrote</hi> is made to confesse, that <hi>Beza</hi> shoulde counsaile him to commit that fact, as a worke verie meritorious, whereas the wiser sorte of Papists know full well, that <hi>Beza</hi> woulde neuer vse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie such persuasion.
