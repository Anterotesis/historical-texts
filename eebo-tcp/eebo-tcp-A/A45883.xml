            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER to a Gentleman of the <hi>Inſurance Office,</hi> Concerning the CITIES Inſuring Houſes.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving read your Paper Entituled, <hi>An Enquiry whether it be the Intereſt of the City to Inſure Houſes from Fire.</hi> I am convinc'd by the ſtrength of your Arguments, and do think you deſerve as great Commendations for ſo well defending your Deſign as for Inventing it. And to ſhew, that I do not flatter, but that you have made me a real Convert, I will come to the Office and Inſure ſeveral Houſes in the Liberties, which I intended before to Inſure with the City: Though I muſt confeſs, this may be no infallible ſigne of my Converſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your undeniable Reaſons (not to mention the juſtice of your Cauſe): <hi>That the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity is better in private hands than in publick: That the Profit of the Deſign muſt be uncertain; And that it may be inconvenient for the City, becauſe of the great Truſts they are ingaged in,</hi> may have the ſame Effects on moſt Perſons, as on Me, and ſo Diſappoint the Cities Undertaking, and then my Inſuring at your Office may be thought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Force, and not Choice; Yet that you may not queſtion my Reallity, I have ſent you a Reaſon, which I do not find amongſt yours, though I thought of it by reading your Paper, that is: If the City ſhould Inſure Houſes from Fire, it may prove inconvenient to the Publick Safety, and prejudicial to the Reputation of the Governours.</p>
            <p>For the Magiſtrates of the City are intruſted with the preſervation of it, and by the Common Law of the Land, when they judge it neceſſary, may Blow up, or pull down any Houſe to ſtop the Fire, as well as dig Trenches in any mans Ground in time of War, to defend the City.</p>
            <p>Now, if the City Inſure Houſes from Fire, this great Power will be Intereſted, and conſequently may be byaſſed; And ſo the Magiſtrates no proper Judges when to make uſe of it. For when a Fire happens, the Magiſtrates may command ſome Houſes not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the City, to be Blown up, only to preſerve thoſe that are Inſured. And ſo on the contrary, may omit the Blowing up ſome Houſes by them Inſured, to prevent Charge to the City, which they ought to have done, to ſtop the Fire. By this means, that Power which ſhould be uſed to prevent Fires, will be the Occaſion of their Increaſe.</p>
            <p>This is an Argument, why thoſe who have Houſes in the City, may not Inſure with it; becauſe they would not prejudice that Power which is intruſted for their Safety: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, by Inſuring at your Office, they have a Double Security; they have the Aſſiſtance of the Magiſtrates, and Care and Induſtry of the Office for their Protection.</p>
            <p>Next, were this great Power (that may deſtroy any Mans Free-hold for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Publick) uſed with the ſame Juſtice, as if the City were Unconcerned, which the Wiſdom of our Law-makers thought, never could be; and therefore, <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uffer no Man to be Judge in his own Cauſe. Yet it will be impoſſible to make <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoſe that loſe their Houſes, believe it: For Loſers will alwayes Complain; and will <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e apt to ſay, That either the City's Care to Preſerve their Inſured Houſes, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to theirs not being Inſured, was the occaſion of their Loſs.</p>
            <p>So that if the City Inſure Houſes, it will cauſe reflections on the Reputation of the Governours, and render their Power for the Publick Safety uſeleſs; becauſe it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be imployed without Clamour and Suſpicion of Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> If you judge theſe Thoughts uſeful, you may Publiſh them; I ſhall be Required <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
