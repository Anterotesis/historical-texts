         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

if you doe discerne any alteration or coldnesse from the former demonstration, not
onely of a sincere meaning, but of a very great desire to give us satisfaction; you
may then forbeare to make use of your Commission (which we must referre to your

Lady of a different Religion from Us; It becommeth Us to be tender, as on the one
part to give them all satisfaction convenient,</hi> so on the other, to admit nothing that
may blemish our Conscience, or detract from the Religion here established. And
although We cannot for the present give you precise and particular direction and
warrant for all points that will come in question in this subject of Religion, yet in
generall, we have thought good thus farre to authorize you: that whereas while you
were in <hi>Spaine, certaine Articles for matter of Religion, after a Consultation had by
some of their Divines were delivered to you, as poynts they were like to insist upon;
which seeming to you unworthy to be by Us hearkned unto, you did utterly reject and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99895:5"/>
yet afterward upon a private conference between you and some others, to whom
that cause had been committed, there was between you a qualification conceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
though never delivered as a matter approved there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have perused those Articles, and added something to them by way of explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for Our clearer satisfaction; and have signed them with our owne hand in a
Schedule hereunto annexed: <hi>And doe let you know, that if they shall be admitted there
as we have signed them, and no further matter in poynt of Religion urged, We can be
content you proceed and expresse your liking, and that you hope it will give Us satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi>
And that you will speedily advertise Us; but you shall not so farre consent or
conclude at to bind <hi>Us,</hi> untill you have advertised Us, and received Our expresse
pleasure and assent.</p>
                  <p>But if you find any haesitation or doubt made upon them, or any new matter added
to any of those poynts, which you shall find to varie from the true sense of them, you
shall suspend your proceeding to the approving of any such Alteration, and advertise
Vs thereof, and attend Our further direction and pleasure, &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>KIng Iames</hi> being so farre wrought upon by the Popish Faction, as thus publikely
to engage himselfe in this <hi>Marriage Treaty</hi> with one of the Romish Religion,
wherein the <hi>Popes owne Dispensation</hi> must necessarily be first procured, ere the Match
could finally be accomplished; they then begin to play their game to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and by tedious delayes and new demands, gaine more and more ground upon the
King in favour of the <hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi> and their Antichristian Religion.</p>
            <p>First, the Commissioners designed for this Treaty, multiply and enlarge the former
Articles touching Religion, in reference to the Infanta and her Family; which after
two yeers debate, were fully concluded on by the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> and both Kings: But
their agreements were to little purpose; the consent of the <hi>Roman Pontife</hi> (the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contriver
and Directer of this Plot for the best advantage of the Catholique Cause) must
be likewise procured and super-added to compleat the Articles; without which they
were but Nullities, and no Dispensation could be expected from him; which is first of
all provided for in the Conditions.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Articles were sent to <hi>Rome, to Pope</hi> Gregory <hi>the</hi> xv. who then held
that Chair <hi>of Pestilence;</hi> who after many tedious consultations, alters and enlargeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Articles (by the advice of his Conclave) for the furtherance of the Roman
Catholique Religion; and unlesse our King and Prince would condescend to those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations,
there was no possibility of any Match or Dispensation.</p>
            <p>The answers and alterations of the Pope to each particular Article, you may read at
large in the<note n="e" place="margin">Tom. 9. Anno 1623. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>WEE Your Majesties most humble and loyall Subjects, the Knights, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
and Burgesses, now assembled in Parliament, who represent the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of your Realm; full of hearty sorrow to be deprived of the Comfort
of Your royall presence; the rather for that it proceeds from want of your
health, wherein we all unfainedly doe suffer: In all humble manner calling to mind
your gratious Answer to our former Petition concerning Religion; which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
your Majesties pious and princely Intentions, hath not produced that good effect
which the danger of these times doth seem to us to require. And finding how ill your
Majesties goodnesse hath been requited by Princes of different Religion, who even in
time of Treaty have taken opportunity to advance their own ends, tending to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Religion, and disadvantage of your affaires, and the estate of your Children:
By reason whereof your ill affected Subjects at home, the Popish Recusants, have taken
too much encouragement, and are dangerously encreased in their number, and in their
insolencies; we cannot but be sensible thereof: and therefore humbly represent what
we conceive to be the causes of so great and growing mischiefs; and what may be the
remedies.</p>
                        <p>1 The vigilancy and ambition of the Pope of Rome and his dearest Sonne,<note place="margin">The Causes.</note> the one
aiming at as large a temporall Monarchy, as the other at a spirituall Suptemacy.</p>
                        <p>2 The devillish positions and doctrines whereon Popery is built and taught without
authority to their followers, for advancement of their temporall ends.</p>
                        <p>3, The distressed and miserable estate of the Professours of true Religion in forreign
parts.</p>
                        <p>4. The disastrous accidents to your Majesties Children abroad, expressed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
and even with contempt to their Persons.</p>
                        <p>5. The strange confederacy of the Princes of the Popish Religion, aiming mainly at
the advancement of theirs and subverting ours, and taking the advantages conducing
to that end, upon all occasions.</p>
                        <p>6. The great and many Armies raised and maintained at the charge of the King of
<hi>Spayne,</hi> the chiefe of that league.</p>
                        <p>7. The expectation of the Popish Recusants of the Match with <hi>Spayne,</hi> and feeding
themselves with great hopes of the consequences thereof.</p>
                        <p>8. The interposing of forreigne Princes and their agents, in the behalfe of Popish
Recusants, for connivence and favour unto them.</p>
                        <p>9. Their open and usuall resort to the Houses, and which is worse, to the Chappels of
forreigne Ambassadours.</p>
                        <p>10. Their more then usuall concourse to the Citty, and their frequent Conventicles
and Conferences there.</p>
                        <p>11. The education of their Children in many severall Seminaries and houses of their
Religion in forreigne parts, appropriated onely to the English Fugitives.</p>
                        <p>12. The grants of their just forfeitures intended by your Majesty, as a reward of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the Grantees, but beyond your Majesties intention, transferred or compounded
for, at such meane rates as will amount to little lesse then a toleration.</p>
                        <p>13. The licentious printing and dispersing of Popish and seditious Books, even in
the time of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>14. The swarme of Priests and Jesuits, the common Incendiaries of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
dispersed in all parts of your Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>And from these causes as bitter roots,<note place="margin">The Effects.</note> We humbly offer to your Majesty, that we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99895:9"/>
foresee and feare there will necessarily follow very dangerous effects both to Church
and State: For,</p>
                        <p>1. The Popish Religion is incompatible with ours in respect of their positions.<note place="margin">The Effects.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. It draweth with it an unavoydable Dependency on forreigne Princes.</p>
                        <p>3. It openeth too wide a gap for popularity, to any who shall draw to great a party.</p>
                        <p>4. It hath a restlesse spirit, and will strive by these gradations: If it once get but a connivence, it will presse for a toleration; if that should be obtained, they must have
an equality; from thence they will aspire to superiority; and will never rest till they get
a subversion of the true Religion.</p>
                        <p>The remedies against these growing evils, which in all humblenesse we offer to your
most Excellent Majesty, are these:</p>
                        <p>1. That seeing this inevitable necessity is fallen upon your Majesty,<note place="margin">The Remedies.</note> which no wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or providence of a pious and peaceable King can avoyd, your Majesty would not
omit this just occasion speedily and effectually to take your sword into your hand.</p>
                        <p>2. That once undertaken upon so honourable and just grounds, your Majesty would
resolve to pursue, and more publikely to avow the aiding of those of our Religion in
forreigne parts, which doubtlesse would re-unite the Princes and States of the Union,
by these disasters disheartned and disbanded.</p>
                        <p>3. That your Majesty would propose to your selfe to mannage this Warre with the
best advantage, by a diversion or otherwise, as in your d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ep judgment shall be found
fittest, and not to rest upon a Warre in these parts onely, which will consume your
treasure and discourage your people.</p>
                        <p>4. That the bent of this Warre, and poynt of your sword, may be against that
Prince (what soeuer opinion of potency he hath) whose Armies and treasure have first
diverted, and since maintained the Warre in the Palatinate.</p>
                        <p>5. That for the securing of our peace at home, your Majesty will be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
the parts of our humble Petition, formerly delivered unto your Majesty, and
hereunto annexed, and to put in execution by the care of choyce Commissioners to be
thereunto especially appointed, the lawes already and hereafter to be made for the
preventing of da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gers by Popish Recusants, and their wonted evasions.</p>
                        <p>6. That to frustrate their hopes for a future age, our most Noble Prince may be
timely and happily married to one of our owne Religion.</p>
                        <p>7. That the Children of the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdome, aud of others
ill affected, and suspected in their Religion, now beyond the Seas, may be forthwith
called home by your meanes, and at the charge of their Parents or Governours.</p>
                        <p>8. That the Children of Popish Recusants, or such whose Wives are Popish Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants,
be brought up during their minority with Protestant Schoolmasters and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
who may sowe in their tender yeers the seed of true Religion.</p>
                        <p>9. That your Majesty will be pleased speedily to revoke all former licences for such
Children and Youth to travaile beyond the Seas, and not grant any such licence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                        <p>10. That your Majesties learned Councell may receive commandement from your
Highnesse, carefully to look into former grants of Recusants lands, and to avoyd them
if by law they can; and that your Majesty will stay your hand from passing any such
grants hereafter.</p>
                        <p>This is the sum and effect of our humble Declaration, which We (no wayes inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to presse upon your Majesties undoubted and regall Prerogative) doe with the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our duty and obedience, humbly submit to your most Princely consideration.
The glory of God, whose Cause it is, the Zeale of our true Keligion, in which we have
been borne, and wherein by Gods grace we are resolved to dye; the safety of your
Majesties person, who is the very life of your people, the happinesse of your Children
and Posterity, the honour and good of the Church and State, dearer unto us then our
owne lives, having kindled these affections truly devoted to your Majesty: And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of our duty to your Majesty, We have already resolved to give at the end of
this Session, one entire Subsidie for the present reliefe of <hi>Palatmate</hi> onely, to be paid
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99895:10"/>
in the end of <hi>February</hi> next, which cannot well be effected, but by passing a Bill in a
Parliamentary course before Christmas; We most humbly beseech your Majesty (as
our assured hope is) that you will then also vouchsafe to give life by your royall assent
to such Bils as before that time shall be prepared for your Majesties honour and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
good of your people; and that such Bils may be also accompanied (as hath been

assuring him; <hi>That the miserable estate of those of the Religion abroad obliged them
in part of duty, not onely to turne their eyes on a Warre abroad, but also to take care for

rest secure, he would never be weary to doe all he could for the propagation of our Religion,
and repressing of Popery in the generall: But the manner and forme of doing it they must
remit to his Care and Providence, who could best consider of times and seasons: And that
his care of Religion must be such, that he must not by the persecution of Recusants here at

feeding <hi>King Iames</hi> onely with good words and promises, protracted the Match and

                        <p>TO the second Article. We mervaile that there hath been so necessary a poynt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
when the Articles were sent to <hi>Rome</hi> by the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to procure
the Dispensation, that the forme agreed upon for the celebration of the Marriage, and
the Oath of fidelity for the Infanta's Servants were not also sent thither with the rest,
being (as they were) agreed on, and so essentiall to the businesse. We have now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
Copies of them both to <hi>Gage,</hi> to make such use thereof as shall be requisite for
the furtherance of the businesse of himselfe, since he is a person trusted by the Court of

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99895:11"/>
it being more then either We Our Selfe have or the Prince Our Sonne. And if
there be no other reason for the demand of such a Church, then that the World may
take notice of the Religion shee professeth in a publike manner, that may be aswell in
the Chappell assigned for her and her Family, to which shee and they may publiquely
and openly resort in the sight of all whosoever shall desire to behold it, it being in
effect a Church with a Church-yard belonging unto it, and not simply a private O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory.</p>
                        <p>To the sixt Article, where it is said that her Servants, &amp;c. ought in any case to be

                        <p>To the twelfth Article, where it is required, that the superior Minister having eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
authority over her Family, should be <hi>in ordine Episcopali.</hi> VVe are well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to leave that to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to allow of it if he think fit.</p>

exemption seems strange, and as we verely beleeve is not allowed them in all States
and Countries that are Roman Catholiques; VVe hope that the Clergy-men, who
shall come hither to attend the <hi>Infanta,</hi> will give no cause for the Civill Magistrate to
proceed against them in that manner, except it be for great and heynous causes and that

it. And therefore further then you have already assented unto in that Article in the
generall, which leaves the Children under the tuition and care of the Mother, longer
or shorter, according to their constitutions and healths (which may possibly reach unto
the time required by the Pope) we can by no meanes condescend, unlesse the King of
<hi>Spaine</hi> think fit to limit the time to a certainty for the Mother to have the eare of the
Children, so as it exceed not seven yeers old which We can be contented to yeeld unto.</p>
                        <p>Thus farre concerning the demands made by the Pope particularly unto severall
Articles.</p>
                        <p>For the close of all, wherein it seems he expects some offer to be made by Us for the
general good of the Roman Church; the same is explicated more plainly in a discourse
held by the Cardinall <hi>Bandino</hi> with <hi>George Gage;</hi> whereof a Copy is sent with these
Articles.<note place="margin">King <hi>James</hi> his Agent at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </note> But for that matter, you are to put the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in remembrance, that
we treat with him, and not with the Pope: That the Articles concerning Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon betwixt his Father and Us, were such and so full to the satisfaction of that
Church, in the opinions of the learnedst and greatest Clergy of <hi>Spain,</hi> as we have bin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
told, that they have been ever of opinion, the Pope could not upon those Articles,
nor ought to refuse the Dispensation. The Cardinall acknowledgeth as it seems in that
discourse, that the Pope is satisfied with the reasons given both by the <hi>Padre Maestro</hi>
and <hi>Gage,</hi> that We of Our own authority cannot give a generall &amp; free liberty of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
the Roman Religion. What is it then they would have? Setting that aside, We
have in a manner already done that which is desired,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> as all the Roman Catholikes have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99895:12"/>
found, out of Our gracious clemency towards them, especially of late, and will no
doubt acknowledge. Which if the Pope had knowne when these answers were given
by him to the Articles, it is to be presumed, he would not so much have insisted upon
that poynt. But for whatsoever may concerne that businesse, We have so fully declared
Our Selfe unto the late King of <hi>Spain</hi> by Our Letter of the 27. of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1620. under
Our hand and Seale, as We hope the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> rests satisfied, both with the extent
of Our promise in that behalfe, and with the assurance of performance; which is as
much as in honour can be required at Our hands, or as We can grant, considering the

                        <p>We desire to know whether the King of <hi>Spain</hi> wil resolve to conclude the Match up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those termes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or not, that there may be no time lost for us to provide some other
Match for Our Son, if that shall not succeed; and so to presse a present resolution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sending too and fro, betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which spends time, and may serve still
for a colour, to draw the Treaty <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Neverthelesse, if you find that it is a
thing impossible for them to resolve without a reply to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they doe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desire it, We are contented that you shall yeeld them two moneths time after
your audience, and no longer, so as before Christmas at the furthest, We may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised

manifest Our desire and intention to continue for ever on Our part, the strict amity
betwixt Us and <hi>Spaine;</hi> as also to take away all just exception that may hinder the
speedy conclusion of the Match, as We have been contented now to inlarge Our Selfe
further in divers particulars, then was before agreed on or desired; as namely in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
that the superior Minister may be <hi>in ordine Episcopali,</hi> that the limitation
of the time for the education of the Children be for six or seven yeers, and in other
poynts as you will find in this answer. Of all which we require you to give speciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to that King, that he may thereupon take into his Consideration the sincerity of
of Our affection, who have so roundly and really proceeded in this businesse, so as in all
reason We may and doe justly expect the like dealing from him, which cannot better
appeare, then in the speedy dispatch thereof.</p>

and our Ministers in the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> We find that neither the Dispensation is granted
for the march, nor the treaty of Cessation so neer a Conclusion as we conceived it
would have been, now that the Auxiliaries and all other Obstacles are removed: But
on the contrary side, that new delayes and excuses are invented, our Garrisons in the
<hi>Palatinate</hi> in the meane time blocked up, and <hi>Heidelberg</hi> it selfe actually besieged.
Which proceeding though our Ambassadour hath expostulated with the Infanta and
the Commissioners as injurious to Vs, and ill-beseeming their professions hitherto, yet is
there not that readinesse shewed to give Us such contentment therein as we might
justly expect, but answers still protracted and put off for advantage, whilest our Forces
there remaine in great distresse, and the Towne and Castle of <hi>Heidelberg</hi> likely in a few
dayes to be lost, for it cannot hold out longer as we are informed. This dealing seems
the more strange unto Vs, for that the late dispatch of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> was (before

taken by the Emperour for calling the diet at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> contrary to his owne promise,

All which and many more which your owne judgement in the perusall of the dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
will suggest unto you, doe minister unto Vs cause sufficient of jealousie on the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours

that you may presently know Their finall resolution and what VVe may expect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
But if any respit of time be earnestly demanded, and that you perceive it not
possible for them to resolve untill an answer come from <hi>Rome,</hi> VVe then thinke it fit
that you give them two moneths time after your audience, that VVe may understand

of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the 3. of <hi>October</hi> 1622. truly translated out of the Spanish Copy.</p>
            <p>SIR, the Baron <hi>Digby</hi> Ambassadour Extraordinary of the King of great <hi>Brittaine</hi>
saith, that it is neere six moneths since they had treated to make a Marriage between
the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Infanta <hi>Donna Maria</hi> sister to your Majesty.</p>
            <p>That it is five moneths since they setled in <hi>Spaine</hi> the Articles in matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
His Majesty (now in glory) having first asked the opinions of many learned men,
which were joyned to consult upon this businesse.</p>
            <p>That the King of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> dealt clearly in all the Articles, and therein
hath complyed in all things, and hath promised by his word and in a letter written the
sixth of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1620. particularly declared, <hi>what he would doe in favour of the
Catholiques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it appeared the businesse was then well founded to aske the <hi>Popes Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and thereupon they dispatched Father <hi>Diego de Fuente.</hi> for to <hi>solicit it in Rome;</hi>
but now at the end very neere of two yeeres, his <hi>Holinesse</hi> (without reply hither) hath
sent directly for <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
               <hi>propounding to the King, not onely many alterations in the said
Capitulations, but something new, which the King would by no meanes yeeld unto.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>That this to the King his Master seemed much different from that which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>First, for that having Capitul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted the Dispensation should onely move from this
place, and the King having not treated at all with the <hi>Pope,</hi> therefore he expected what
the <hi>Pope</hi> would reply, should be sent unto your Majesty, from whence came the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Dispensation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for that he thought, that with the Agreement and the rest perused, all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99895:13"/>
things concerning Religion had beene setled and that the learned men did think, <hi>that
upon these conditions they might, and that his Holinesse ought to consent to the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and now they demand new things and impossible,</hi> which seemes very strange.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the King his Master desiring that in this businesse he make short expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(for that it imports Him and His Kingdom very much that they marry the Prince
His onely Sonne presently, going upon 23. yeeres, having fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>borne to marry for six
yeeres past onely in respect of this Treaty.) He is commanded to declare plainly to
your Majesty, how farre he may condiscend in matter of Religion, and if with this your
Majesty be content, to proceed to a conclusion of the Marriage, without more delayes;
and if this be not enough to give satisfaction to your Majesty, as he hopes it will see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he hath yeelded to much more then what was capitulated in the time of the King.
Father to your Majesty, now in glory, your Majesty also would be pleased to declare
on the part of your Majesty, that without losse of more time his Majesty may dispose
of the <hi>Prince</hi> his sonne, and your Majesty of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> as you best please.</p>

notwithstanding all opposition to the contrary, to merit well of Our good Brother
the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the whole house of <hi>Austria,</hi> by a long and lingring patience,
grounded still upon his friendship and promises, that Care should be had of Our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and of Our Childrens Patrimony and Inheritance. We have acquainted you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
from time to time since the beginning of the Treaty at <hi>Bruxelles</hi> how crosly all
things have there proceeded, notwithstanding all the faire professions made unto Us,
both by the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Infanta and all his Ministers, and the Letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

by force, Our Garrison put to the sword, <hi>Manheim</hi> besieged, and all the hostility used
that is within the power of an enemy, as you will see by the Relation which VVe
have commanded Our Secretary to send you. Our pleasure therefore is that you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
as soone as you can get audience, let that King understand how sensible We
are of these proceedings of the Emperours towards Vs, and withall are not a little
troubled to see, that the Infanta having an absolute Commission to conclude a Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and suspension of Armes, should now at last when all Objections were answered,
and the former (solely) pretended Obstacles removed, not onely delay the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Treaty, but refuse to lay her command upon the Emperours Generals,
for abstaining from the siege of Our Garrisons during the Treaty, upon a pretext of
want of authority: So as for avoyding of further dishonour, We have been forced to
recall both Our Ambassadours, as well the Chancelour of our Exchequer, who is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
returned to Our presence, as also the Lord <hi>Chichester,</hi> whom We intended to have
sent unto the Emperour to the Diet at <hi>Ratisbone.</hi> Seeing therefore that meerly out
of Our extraordinary respect to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the firme confidence We ever
put in the hopes and promises which he did give Vs (desiring nothing more then for
his cause principally to avoyd all occasions that might put Vs into ill understanding
with any of the house of <hi>Austria)</hi> We have hitherto proceeded with a stedfast patience
trusting to the Treaties, and neglecting all other Meanes which probably might have
secured the remainder of Our Childrens Inheritance (those Garrisons which We
maintained in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> being rather for honours sake to keepe a footing untill

good Offices which He hath used towards the Emperour in this businesse, on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of Our Sonne-in-law (upon confidence whereof that security of Ours depended,
which he continually by his Letters and Ministers here laboured to beget and confirme
in Vs) have not sorted to any other issue, then to a plaine abuse both of His trust and
Ours, whereby VVe are both of Vs highly injured in Our Honour, though in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
degree. VVe hope and desire that out of a true sense of this wrong offered unto
Vs, he will as Our deere and loving Brother, faithfully promise and undertake upon
his Honour, confirming the same also under his hand and seale, either that the Towne
and Castle of <hi>Heidelberg</hi> shall within threescore and ten dayes after your audience and

            <p>After this about the 25. of <hi>October, King Iames</hi> writ a private Letter with his
own hand to the <hi>Earl of Bristoll,</hi> which Secretary <hi>Calvert</hi> sent away with all speed and
secrecy by <hi>Master Gage, to limit the Spaniard unto two moneths to gaine the Popes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution

to the <hi>Earle</hi> from St. <hi>Martens-lane,</hi> Octob. 26. 1622.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hereupon deludes <hi>King Iames</hi> with faire dilatory promises, as
if he intended the hastening of the Marriage; but how farre he was from any such
reall intention, is evident by this Letter of his to his grand favourite, <hi>Conde of Olivares,</hi>
dated the fifth of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1622. found among the Lord <hi>Cottingtons</hi> papers.</p>
            <p>THe King my Father declared at his death, that his intent never was to marry my
Sister the Infanta <hi>Donna Maria</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi>
               <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> which your Uncle <hi>Don
Baltazar</hi> understood, and so treated this March ever with intention to delay it; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
it is now so farre advanced, that considering all the aversnesse unto it of
the Infanta, it is time to seeke some meanes to divert the Treaty, which I would have
you find out, and I will make it good whatsoever it be: but in all other things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the satisfaction of the King of <hi>Great Brittaine</hi> (who hath deserved much) and it
shall content me, so that it be not in the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:99895:15"/>
To colour the matter the better, he pretended no Dispensation would be granted at
<hi>Rome,</hi> unlesse the Pope received further satisfaction in the time of the Childrens edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by the Mother, and point of Ecclesiasticall persons exemption from all secular ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction;
to remove with obstructions, King <hi>Iames</hi> was content to comply in these
particulars further then he had done before, as His ensuing Letter to the Earl of <hi>Bristoll</hi>
clearly demonstrates; which Letter was drawne and written for his Majesties signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

We perceive what professions the King and his Ministers have againe made unto you,

of Our Sonne-in-law) not to admit any further delay.</p>
                  <p>And as touching the two points in the Treaty of the Marriage, wherein you desire

to be contented with nine, We will not sticks at it.</hi> And for the other point which <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes

            <p>The Articles of Religion being thus accommodated betweene the two Kings, <hi>King
Iames</hi> who had formerly by his Agent <hi>Gage</hi> sent Letters to <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Pope</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

Dispensation, with private instructions not to deliver them, unlesse <hi>he saw a present
likelihood of granting the Dispensation,</hi> sends now two expresse Letters to <hi>Gage</hi> unto
<hi>Rome</hi> (the one from himselfe, the other from <hi>Calvert</hi> his principall Secretary, dated
the 5. of <hi>Ian.</hi> 1622.) to present t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

right worthy Cousen and Councellour the Earle of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> VVe understand how
dutifully and discreetly you have carried your selfe in the furthering Our service,
whilest you remained in the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for which VVe returne you Our gracious
thanks. He hath also acquainted Us with the directions which he gave you, touching
the delivery of the Letters you carried from hence; that if you saw a likelihood of
present granting the Dispensation upon the Articles now agreed on, you should deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, unlesse you received order from Us to the contrary. We would therefore
now have you understand, that there is no cause why you should forbeare the delivery
of any of them, if you find the Dispensation will certainly be granted: And thereof
We hope there shall be now no doubt, considering that We have condescended unto,
approved and ratified all and every the Articles concerning Religion, without change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or altering any one word, as they are agreed upon and concluded betweene the King
of <hi>Spaines</hi> Commissioners and Our Ambassadour at <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>December</hi> last: which
being transmitted unto Vs, both Our Selfe and Our Sonne the Prince have subscribed

the same, and so have sent them backe againe unto Our said Abassadour for a finall
conclusion of all things concerning matter of Religion or conscience, although the
formality needed not, Our Ambassadours having obliged Vs before sufficiently accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the large power given them by their Commission. And thus much We have
thought sit to let you know that if any further scruple should remaine there touching
Our absolute consent, you may be able to remove it.</p>

by which if your Majesty receive not that entire satisfaction which we, who have
laboured therein, have most earnestly desired. I shall most humbly beseech your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to beleeve; first, that we have left no diligence undone by which we could hope to
remove impediments; and secondly, that such difficulties as are either spent or yet to
be admitted have been laid hold by the Cardinals, neither to frustrate or prolong this
Treaty, but out of an opinion that they could not otherwise secure their Conscience,
proceed upon a just and valuable ground, and satisfie the judgement of such discreet
persons as may in times ensuing understand the passages of this great businesse. And
this point I am the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have risen from others but the graces then given from your Selfe; and they are
confident that your Majesty, now that so potent intercessions have been used with you
and all grounds of civill jealousies removed, will not onely command a reall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of what you are pleased to promise in their favour, but sutably to your owne

and give way to their owne good dispositions of respect and affection towards your

very effectually unto the Emperour about these affaires of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> VVe doe
much desire to know what the particulars of that Letter were, and to what effect, and
what other endeavours that King intends to use for procuring Vs satisfaction therein,
whereof VVe require you to informe Vs as particularly as you may, because you know
it concernes Vs much to have that businesse at a point. There are some other matters
concerning Our service which VVe have commanded Our Secretary to impart unto

Spanish Ambassadour mediated for them by an earnest Letter which he writ unto his

satisfaction, howsoever I shall doe my best; and so kissing your Lordships hands I

his late Majesty at the instance of the <hi>Conde Gondomar,</hi> to write a Letter to the Pope,

he shovld leave it to him to take his owne time; and thereupon few dayes before his

            <p>All these Articles with six others of like nature, the <hi>Earle of Bristoll</hi> preferred to

            <p>The Articles exhibited to the House of Peeres against the Earle through the Dukes

               <note n="b" place="margin">In the Lords Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Journall May 6. 1626. pag. 150, 151, 152, &amp;c.</note> Articles of severall High-treasons &amp; other great and enormious Crimes Offences and

King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memory decreased, and Our Sovereigne Lord the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
which now is, wherewith the said Earle is charged by his Majesties Attourney
generall on his Majesties behalfe, in the most high and honourable Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
before the King and his Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> THat the said Earle from the beginning of his Negotiation, and the whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
thereof by him, during his ambassage into <hi>Spaine,</hi> he the said Earle contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his faith and duty to God, the true Religion professed by the Church of <hi>England</hi>
and the peace of this Church and State, did intend and resolve, that if the said marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
so treated of as aforesaid, should by his ministry be effected, that thereby the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Religion and the professors thereof should be advanced within this Realme,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> and
other his Majesties Realmes and Dominions, and the true Religion and the professors
thereof discouraged and discountenanced: And to that end and purpose the said Earle,
during the time aforesaid by Letters unto his late Majesty and otherwise, often coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled
and perswaded the said late Kings Majesty, to set at liberty the Jesuits, and
Priests of the Roman Religion, which according to the good, religions and politicke
Lawes of this Realme were imprisoned or restrained, and to grant and allow unto the
Papists and professors of the Romish Religion a free toleration, and silencing of the
lawes made and standing in force against them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> That at the Princes comming into <hi>Spain,</hi> during the time aforesaid, the said Earle of
<hi>Bristoll,</hi> cunningly falsly, and traiterously <hi>moved and perswaded the Prince</hi> (being <hi>then
in the power of a forreigne King of the Romish Religion) to change his Religion;</hi>
               <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> which
was done in this manner: At the Princes first comming to the said Earle, he asked the
Prince, <hi>for what he came thither?</hi> The Prince at first not conceiving the Earles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
answered <hi>you know as well as I:</hi> the Earle replied, Sir, <hi>servants can never serve
their Master industriously, although they may doe it faithfully, unlesse they know their
meanings fully; give me leave therefore to tell you what they say in the Towne is the
cause of your comming,</hi> THAT YOU MEANE TO CHANGE
YOUR RELIGION, AND TO DECLARE IT HERE: and
yet cunningly to disguise it, the Earle added further; <hi>Sir, I doe not speake this that I
will perswade you to doe it, or that I will promise you that I will follow your example,
though you will doe it, but as your faithfull servant, if you will trust me with so great a
secret, I will endeavour to carry it the discreetest way I can.</hi> The Prince being moved
with this unexpected motion, againe said unto him; <hi>I wonder what you have ever
found in me, that you should conceive I would be so base or unworthy, as for a Wife to</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99895:20"/>
change my Religion? The said Earle replying, desired the Prince to pardon him, if
he had offended him, it was but out of his desire to serve him: which perswasion of
the said Earle was the more dangerous, because the more subtill: Whereas it had
beene the duty of a faithfull servant, to God and his Master, if he had found the
Prince staggering in his Religion to have prevented so great an Error, and to have
perswaded against it, so to have avoyded the dangerous consequences thereof, to the
true Religion and to this state, if such a thing should have happened.</p>
            <p>8. That afterward during the Princes being in Spaine, the said Earle having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with the said Prince about the <hi>Romish Religion, he endeavoured falsely and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously
to perswade the Prince to change his Religion as aforesaid, AND BECOME
A ROMISH CATHOLIKE,</hi>
               <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> and to Become <hi>OBEDIENT TO
THE VSVRPED AVTHORITY OF THE POPE OF
ROME:</hi> And to that end and purpose the said Earle traiterously used these words
unto the said Prince; <hi>That the State of England did never any great thing, but when
they were under the obedience of the Pope of Rome, and that it was impossible they could
doe any thing of note otherwise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. That during the time of the Princes being in Spaine as aforesaid, the Prince
consulting, and advising with the said Earle and others, about a new offer made by
the King of Spaine touching the <hi>Palatinate, which was, that the eldest Son of the
Prince Palatine, should marry with the Emperours Daughter, but must be bread up in the
Emperors Court:</hi> The said Earle delivered his opinion, that the Proposition was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable;
whereat when Sir <hi>Walter Ashton</hi> then present falling into some passion said;
<hi>that he durst not for his head consent unto it:</hi> The Earle of Bristoll replyed, that hee saw
no such great inconvenience in it, for that he might be there bred up in the Emperors
Court in our Religion. But when the extreame danger, and in a manner the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
thereof was pressed unto the said Earle, he said againe, <hi>That without some such
great action the peace of Christendome would never be had.</hi> Which was so dangerous
and desperate a councell that one so neare to the Crowne of England should be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
in his Religion, and put into the power of a Foraigne Prince, Enemy to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and an unfreind to our state, that the consequence thereof both for the present
and future times were infinitly dangerous, and yet hereunto did his disaffection to
our Religion, the blindnesse in his judgment, caused by sinister respects, and the too
much regard he had to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> lead him, &amp;c. <hi>Ro. Heath</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Articles were exhibited against the Earle by the Kings owne speciall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and perused, corrected by him before they were put in, as appeares by the
<hi>Lords Iournall,</hi> the Kings Atturny averring it openly in the House of Peers. It seems
therefore a great Wonder to many observing men, that he who was thus impeached
by his Majesties speciall command, as the worst of Councellors, and a strong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swader
of him <hi>to become a professed Roman Catholik, an advancer of Popery and Papists</hi>
then, should become his principle Cabinet Councellor to advise him to side with the
Popish party in <hi>England, Ireland, Scotland,</hi> against his Parliament, and Protestant sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
now.</p>
            <p>But to pretermit his present Councells, which seeme to justifie the former Articles,
the Earle of <hi>Bristoll</hi> himselfe in his answere<note n="*" place="margin">In the Lords Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Iournall P. 249. &amp;c.</note> to the 7th. Article, confesseth, that there
was a generall received opinion in the Spanish Court, <hi>that his Majesties comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was with intention to become a Roman Catholike, and that the Conde Gundimar,</hi> that
very morning pressed the Earle, <hi>not to hinder so pious a worke</hi> (for so he tearmed it)
<hi>of his Majesties conversion, &amp; seemed to be assured of the</hi> Duke of Buckinghams <hi>assistance
therein:</hi> whereupon he told his Majesty; <hi>That the Generall opinion in that Court was, that his Majestyes comming thither was, WITH INTENTION TO BE A
ROMAN CATHOLIKE AND THERE TO DECLARE
IT,</hi> &amp;c. Whereupon he intreated him not to suffer his businesse to be overthrowne
by permitting that conceit of his conversion any longer to remaine with the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
not to do any thing that might give them hope therein; alleaging, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
the Mariage could be without a dispensation. And so long as the Spaniard,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99895:21"/>
who were to procure the dispensation, should have hope of his Majesties conversion,
they would rather clogge the Dispensation then hasten it, for whiles they should have
hope of all by his convertion, they would never content themselves with a part, to
which they were tyed by the Articles agreed upon; At which time his Majesty was
pleased to aprove of his opinion, and said, he would expect the dispensatory, and did
thereupon, <hi>afterward send Master Andrews to Rome to hasten it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all these Articles and passages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is most perspicuous that there was a professed
designe in the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> Secretary <hi>Calvert, Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Porter, Gage,</hi> and other instruments, who contrived the Princes dangerous Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to pervert the Prince in his Religion, to make him and all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
professed Roman Catholikes, and the Prince Palatine too, and by this meanes
to set up Popery in their Dominions, to suppresse the Protestant Religion, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of it in all places, that so the Pope might become Lord <hi>Paramount</hi> over them
and all their Subjects, and they his sworne Vassalls. How far the Archbishop was
privy and assistant to this designe, you may partly read in <hi>the Breviat of his life,</hi> P. 3.
14. and shall heare more heareafter in its proper place.</p>
            <p>What the aymes of the Pope and Spaniard were in contriving the Princes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
into Spaine, appeares, First, by the forementioned common report in the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Court, that it <hi>was to become a professed Roman Catholike, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly by this notable Letter of the Pope to the Bishop of <hi>Conchen</hi> (one Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
whereof I found in the Archbishop of <hi>Canterburies</hi> Study, indorsed with his owne
hand, and another among <hi>Secretary Windebankes</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cottingtons</hi> sequestred
Papers) exhorting him to <hi>take this happy opportunity, to convert, subject and reconcile
the Prince and his Dominious to the Sea of</hi> Rome.</p>

as great <hi>Britaine</hi> hath alwayes beene fruitfull in Vertues, and in men

of her renowne; Shee doth also very often draw the thoughts of the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall
Chaire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the consideration of her praises. And indeed the Church was
but then in her infancy, when the King of Kings did chuse her for his inheritance,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99895:22"/>
and so affectionately, that we beleeve the Romane Eagles have hardly out-pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>d
the Banner of the Crosse. Besides that many of her Kings, instructed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the true salvation, have preferred the <hi>Crosse</hi> before the royall <hi>Scepter,</hi> and
the discipline of Religion before covetousnesse, leaving examples of piety to other
Nations, and to the ages yet to come. So that having merited the Principalities
and first places of blessednesse in heaven, they have obtained on earth the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
ornaments of holinesse. And although now the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ate of the English Church
is altered, we see neverthelesse the Court of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> adorned and furnished
with morall Virtues, which might serve to support the charity that we beate unto
her, and be an or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ment to the name of Christianity, if withall she could have for
her defence and protection the orthodox and catholike truth; Therefore by how
much the more the Glory of your most noble Father, and the apprehension of your
Royall inclination delights us, with so much more zeale we desire that the gates of
the kingdome of Heaven might be opened unto you, and that you might purchase
to your selfe the love of the universall Church. Moreover, it being certain that
<hi>Gregory</hi> the great, of most blessed memory, hath introduced to the English people,
and taught to their Kings the Law of the Gospel, <hi>and the respect of Apostolicall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
We, as inferiour to him in holinesse and virtue, but equall in name and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of dignity, it is very reasonable that we, following his blessed foot-steps,
should endeavour the salvation of those Provinces,<note place="margin">Note.</note> especially at this time, <hi>when
your designe (most noble Prince) elevates us to the hope of an extraordinary advantage:</hi>
Therefore as you have directed your journey to <hi>Spain,</hi> towards the catholike King,
with desire to ally your selfe to the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> we doe commend your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
and indeed doe testifie openly in this present businesse, <hi>that you are he that
takes principall care of our Prelacy.</hi> For seeing that you desire to take in marriage the
daughter of <hi>Spaine,</hi> from thence we may easily conjecture that the ancient seeds of
Christian piety, which have so happily flourished in the hearts of the Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
great <hi>Britaine,</hi> may (God prospering them) revive againe in your soule. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is not to be beleeved, that the same man should love such an alliance, that
hates the Catholike Religion,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and should take delight to oppresse the holy Chaire.
To that purpose we have commanded to make continually most humble prayers to
the Father of lights, that he would be pleased to put you as a faire flower of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
and the onely hope of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> in possession of that most noble he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage,
that your Ancestors have purchased for you, to defend the authority of the
Soveraigne High-Priest, and to fight against the monsters of heresie. Remember
the dayes of old, enquire of your Fathers, and they will tell you the way that leads
to heaven, and what way the temporall Princes have taken to attaine to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Kingdom. Behold the gates of heaven opened, the most holy Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who came from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> accompanied with Angels, did come to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and doe homage to the Lord of Lords, and to the Prince of the Apostles in the
Apostolicall chaire; their actions and their examples being as so many voices of
God, speaking and exhorting you to follow the course of the lives of those to whose
Empire you shall one day attaine.</p>
                  <p>It is possible that you can suffer that the Heretickes should hold them for impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and condemne those whom the Faith of the Church testifies to raign in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
with Iesus Christ, and have command and authority over all Principalities and
Empires of the Earth? Behold how they tender you the hand of this truely happy
inheritance, to conduct you safe and sound to the Court of the Catholique King,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and
<hi>who desire to bring you back again into the lap of the Roman Church:</hi> Beseeching with
unpeakable sighs &amp; groanes the God of all mercy for your Salvation, <hi>and do stretèh
out to you the Armes of the Apostolicall Charity, to imbrace you with all Christian affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
Even you that are her desired Sonne, in shewing you the happie hope of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And indeed you cannot give a greater consolation to all the people
of the Christian Estates, then to put the Prince of the Apostles in possession of your
most Noble Island, whose authority hath beene held so long in the Kingdome of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99895:23"/>
Britain, for the defence of Kingdomes, and for a devine Oracle; <hi>the which will easiely

            <p>Some Months after the Princes arivall in Spaine, the long expected dispensation
for the mariage came from Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 15. to the Spanish Court, before which
time the Prince was not admitted to speake with the Infanta in quality of a Suiter,

<hi>and other his Majesties dominions, the Pope demanded caution from the King and Prince
for performance of them, before the Marriage consummate:</hi> To which the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
<hi>That he could give no other caution but his owne, and the Princes Royall words
and Oaths, confirmed by his Councell of State, and exemplified under the great Seale of

Catholique Prince would ingage himselfe for them. Thereupon all matters
were like to goe off the hinges; and a bruite went abroad, that the Prince intended
to get away covertly: At last <hi>Conde Olivares</hi> propounded three wayes of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
<hi>The first was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Prince</hi> Charles <hi>should become a Papist. The second, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
Infanta <hi>should be delivered to him upon the former security, without further condition.
The third was, to binde him as fast as they could, and not trust him with any thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whiles matters were thus canvasing and gathering ill bloud; the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>
profered to engage himselfe by Oath for the Kings and Princes performance of the
Articles, to satisfie the Pope, provided he must first consult with his Ghostly Fathers,
whether he might doe it with safe Conscience, or no.</p>

abridged. As to the first, <hi>the Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>tooke an Oath to his Majesty to observe

            </p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>GOOD Mr. Secretary <hi>Calvert,</hi> I have not presumed in my present letter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Majesty, to write any thing in answer to his letters of the thirtieth of
<hi>December,</hi> but only in that point which toucheth my obedience to his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for my present returne, for the rest I intreat you to present unto his Majesty
this my humble Answer; Whereas his Majesty is pleased to say, that having seene
the Answer to our third Memoriall, he doth not a little wonder, that I then tooke
his affaires to have been in so good a condition that I would have proceeded to the
disposories of the Prince contrary to his order given; It is true his Majesty hath
just cause to wonder, if he looke upon that Memoriall without the letter that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
it, or if he consider the estate of the affaires as they stood when the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bore Date, which was the sixt of <hi>December;</hi> for then they stood by the infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the capitulation, as they heere do understand it, all disordered and imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
in such sort as I had foreseene and advertized his Majesty. But the estate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
ten or fiveteene dayes before, when I intended to have passed to the disposo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tios,
I confesse I supposed to be such, that I wish I had suffered much that they were
againe upon the same tearme, if his Majesty have a desire to proceed with this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance
and to settle the businesse of the Palatinate, by this Kings helpe and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation.</p>
                  <p>First for the businesse of the Match, against which it hath beene the maine objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that it was never really meant, but only held in Treaty to abuse and entertaine
the King, it was now certainly to have taken effect within three dayes, viz. on the
twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> had not the restraint arryved here on the 26th: and all
things would have beene most exectly and punctually performed according to the
capitulation, and here was no thought of any thing but of providing Presents for the
King and Prince, and settling of the Princesses Family, and preparations for the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
the first day of <hi>March,</hi> and the Princesse had begun to draw the letters which
she intended to have written the day of the desposories to the Prince her Husband,
and the King her Father in law.</p>
                  <p>For the businesse of the Palatinate, as it will appeare by the joynt dispatch which:
Sir <hi>Walter Aston,</hi> and my selfe wrote of the 23. of <hi>November,</hi> that we were assured
not by the Conde of <hi>Olivares</hi> only in this Kings name, but severally by all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,
that a settled resolution was taken in Councell on the 16. of <hi>November</hi>
That this King should procure his Majesties entire satisfaction, and hereof the Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinall
<hi>Capata</hi> and divers other Councellors that professed themselves particularly af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fected
to the King and Princes service, came to give Sir <hi>Walter Ashton</hi> and my selfe
the Parabien.</p>
                  <p>The Conde of <hi>Olivares</hi> intreated us both in this Kings name, to assure his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
thereof upon our honours, and upon our lives if need were and thus much was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99895:32"/>
to have beene delivered unto us in writing before we would have passed to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posorios
as will plainly apeare by this above mentioned dispatch of the 23. of
<hi>November.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides the Princes had now made this businesse her owne, and had therein most
earnestly moved the King her Brother, and written unto the Conde of <hi>Olivares,</hi>
and had set her heart upon the making of her selfe gratefull and welcome to the
King and Kingdome by overcomming this businesse: further, I conceive it hath been
and is the general opinion of wise men, that his Majesty could have no such assurance
of this Kings reall intention of giving his Majesty satisfaction, in the businesse of the
Palatinate as that he proceeded really to the performance of the Match, and that this
was the opinion of his Majesty, and all my Lords, and the ground whereupon I
was to frame all my Negotiation in this particular; I shall procure very authenticall
proofe, and if I had but halfe so cleare a warrant for the hazarding of the Match by
the deferring of the Disposorios as I have for the making of the concluding of the
match, the rule for my proceeding in the businesse of the Palatinate, I should not have
replyed for a further explanation of his Majesties pleasure, nor have beene questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
for an intention of going against my Order.</p>
                  <p>For the point of the Portion, it was agreed that I should have had three hundred
thousand Crownes paid at Twelfe-tide the other 30000. which were formerly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of to have been carryed in Jewells with the Infanta, they were content that
the Princes should have carried 20000. Crownes in ready money, and only 10000.
in Jewells: for the rest, if the maner of payment that was propounded had not liked
his Majesty, they were resolved to have given his Majesty other satisfaction at rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
dayes, as should be agreed of, although I must here crave leave to let his
Majesty know, that having two Months before advertized this offer, I never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of his Majesties dislike or rejection of it by his letters of the thirteenth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
which likewise commanded the putting off of the disposorios.</p>
                  <p>And this was the true estate of his Majesties affaires, as it appeared unto me and
those with whom I was to communicate his Majesties businesse, when I intended
to have proceeded to the disposorios if in the interim I should not receive his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steis
directions to the contrary, which I was most assured of in case his Majesty should
not like of that intention.</p>
                  <p>As for the other point, that I should have intended to have passed the disposorios
contrary to the order given me, certainly I erred not with any malice or intention
of having stolne a Mariage upon my Master against his will, for if I had, supposing
I wanted sufficient warrant to have stayed the Disposorios, I would have concealed
it, and so passed on, and not have, sent with so much diligence to have a cleare u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of his Majesties pleasure, neither would I with so great industry and
great displeasure have prolonged the twentie foure to thirtie dayes, and then so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
and readily obeyed, when I had a cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e understanding of my Masters will: for
the first thing I did, was instantly within few houres to send backe <hi>Peter Killigrew</hi>
to let his Majesty know, that his orders should be most punctually obeyed, and soe
they should have been before, if I had not understood that the nomination of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
day in Christmas (whereof I wonder how his Majesty could want due information
of the expyring of the the Powers) had not overthrowne all his Majesties intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
and desires in his very letter expressed, and hereof by due obedience unto the
Prince his order formerly, upon the scruple of the Infantaes entring into Religion,
may be a sufficient argument.</p>
                  <p>I will not trouble you with any further Apologie, only I shall humbly offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Majesty and my Lords consideration: First, that I understood the Infanta to
be my young Masters Wife, or spouse at least, for such was now her stile, and as
such was I enjoynd to serve her, and as such my Lord Duke and my selfe, and all
the English kissed her hands, as her servants and Vassalls.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the Powers were drawne by the intervention of both parties, The
King of Spaine accepting the substitution, and the Prince delivering of them le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
to the King of Spaine and his Brothers use.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:99895:32"/>
These powers were deposited in my hands upon trust as Embassador of the King
of great Brittain, with publique Declaration, how and when I was to deliver them,
and this drawne into an Instrument by <hi>Iuan de Cirica</hi> as publique Notarie; and this
point is here much pressed, and I conceive many Pens will be imployed about the
case.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly I ever understood, that my Master infinitly desired the Match, and the
Prince in his letters at the very same time expresseth, that he much desireth it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the ingagements that have here passed recyprocally, are publicke to the world.</p>
                  <p>I shall willingly now submit my selfe to any censure, which, whether were the
honester, dutifuller, or more prudent way upon inference and collections to have put
a disgrace and disrespect upon so great and worthy a Princesse that was to be his
Masters wife, to have no way insisted for the makeing good of the publicke trust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in him, by two so great Monarchs, when the powers were deposited in his
hands, but to have put a great scorne upon the King of Spaine by nominating a

                  <p>WEE have read your Letters of the 28. of <hi>October</hi> and the copie of that power
which was left by Our deere Sonne, We have examined and approved your
reasons, and we doe assure you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that if we had seene the power left by our son before
our last Letters, we had not written to you in the forme we did in ours of <hi>October</hi> the
ninth, touching the time of Christmas. For we are so farre from having affection to
deferre the <hi>Desposorios,</hi> or make them fruitlesse, as we desire to hasten them to a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
good conclusion, being of the like affection with our deere brother of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:99895:33"/>
with one act to make a match, and an entire friendship according to the Count, of
<hi>Olivares</hi> his ground formerly delivered to our Sonne and <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in your owne letter, for the reall effecting of which we have thought good to
command our deere Sonne to deferre the present execution of the powers left, and to
renew the power by another herewith sent, that there may bee no fault in us not in
our Son, if that King cannot give us satisfaction in the just things we desire, (which
will containe the maine ground of our friendship) in so short a time in which the
first power should become inualid.</p>
                  <p>And yet we must tell you, we have almost with astonishment observed one acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of so great Checque and contradiction of our hope of the restitution of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi>
as we know not what construction to make of it. The <hi>Berkstrot</hi> in the
<hi>Palatinate</hi> (the prime flower of our sonne in Lawes Revenue which is the maine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
that causeth us thus carefully and speedily to seeke satisfaction, and urge so earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly
till wee may receive it) and which was taken by the Armes and assistance of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and as wee are informed in the possession of the Spanish Garison, or under
their command, the Country or the revenue thereof (which is a fortifying of their
ancient claime) freshly delivered into the hands of the Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> contrary
to the last contract between his Majestie and the <hi>Infanta</hi> at <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
forme of justice, upon an old pretence which must imbroyle it the more, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
being to another person then any of these to whom interest or mediation hath
beene formerly thought of; These being only the Emperor, <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Duke
of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> The consideration of which new difficulties done in the presence,
or without the contradiction either of <hi>Verdugo,</hi> or any other Officer or Minister
of the <hi>Infanta's,</hi> or knowledge given to us, gives us infinitely to thinke, and to finde
it requisite to deale clearely and plainely with you, and to charge and require you to
deale as plainly with our deare Brother, that we are so much bound in honour, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
affection, and interest to see our Sonne-in-Law have restitution of his estate and
honour; without which effect, wee cannot rest satisfied, as you have often heard the
Declaration of our minde in that point: the rather, because it would bee a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to our Son-in-Law (without whom we can doe nothing) and a great
disproportion to receive one daughter in joy and contentment, and leave another in
toares and sighes. And to the end we may bee assured of the effects, we require you
(before you deliver our deere Sonnes power, or move to any contracting of him) that
you procure from that King by act, or answer to you under his hand, or by Letters to
us, that he will helpe us to the restitution of the Palatinate and dignity by meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or other wise assist us, if mediation faile, and within what time the mediation
shall determine, and the assistance of armes begin.</p>
                  <p>The honourable conditions of restitution (we hope) remaine with you. And to
shew you how we desire to comply with our deere Brother of <hi>Spaine:</hi> We shall bee
ready to propound good wayes to satisfie the D. of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> in point of title and
honour, and to continue our negotiation for the match of Our Grand-Child (the
eldest sonne of our Sonne-in-Law) with the Daughter of the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>Our Sonne-in-Laws Letters we send you herewith, and because we know his averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to our Grand-Childs breeding with the Emperor, as we doe the other parts dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection
to have him bred at the <hi>Hagh,</hi> (which we cannot wonder at) our own care
considered for his breeding in Religion, which cannot well bee provided for
there,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> we shall be ready to proceed to the conclusion of that Treaty: And so soone
as the <hi>Infanta</hi> shall be arrived in our Court, to bring our Grand-child to be bred with
our Sonne and her, and in her presence.</p>
                  <p>And for the temporall articles which are so meanely presented in those heads you
sent us, we forheare to tell you what we thinke of the offers.</p>
                  <p>And concerning the portion, we absolutely reject both Jewells or yearely revenue
(as contrary to the first agreement) and expect the totall summe in Specie, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>I Have received Your Majesties Letters of the 8. of <hi>October,</hi> on the 21, of the
same month, some houres within night, and have thought fit to dispath backe un-Your
Majestie with all possible speed, referring the answer to what Your Majestie
hath by Letters commanded mee, to a Post, that I shall purposely dispatch when I
shall have negotiated the particulers with this King and his Ministers, wherein God
willing all possible diligence shall be used.</p>
                  <p>But for as much as I finde both by Your Majesties said Letters, as likewise by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which I have received from the Prince His High<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>esse, that you continue your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of having the match proceeded in, I held it my duty, that Your Majestie should
be informed, that although I am set free in as much as concerneth the doubt of the
<hi>Infantaes</hi> entring into Religion, for the delivering of the powers left with mee by his
Highnesse, yet by this new direction I now receive from your Majestie, that the Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posorios
should be deferred untill Christmasse, the said powers are made thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
uselesse and invalid, it being a clause in the body of the said powers, that they
shall onely remaine in force untill Christmas and no longer; as Your Majestie
will see by the Copie of them, which I send here inclosed: Your Majestie, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
will be of opinion, that the suspending of the execution of the powers, untill
the force and validity of them be expired is a direct and effectuall revoking of them,
which not to doe how fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re his Highnesse is in Honour engaged, Your Majestie will
be best able to judge by viewing the powers themselves.</p>
                  <p>Further if the Date of these Powers do expire (besides the breach of the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations)
although the Match it selfe should not by jealousies and mistrusts be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded,
yet the Princesses comming at the spring into England will be almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible;
for by that time new Commissions and Powers shall be (after Christmas)
granted to the Prince, which must be to the satisfaction of both parties, I conceive
so much of the year will be spent, that it will be impossible for the Fleets and other
preparations to be in a readinesse against the Spring; for it is not to be imagined
that they will here proceed effectually with their preparations, untill they shall be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of the Desposorios, especially when they shall have seen them severall times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
on the Princes part, and that upon pretexts that are not new nor grown since
the granting of the Powers, but were before in being, and often under debate, and
yet were never insisted upon to make stay of the businesse, So that it will seem, that
they might better have hindred the granting of them then, then the execution of them
now, if there were no staggering in former Resolutions: which although really there
is not, yet cannot it but be suspected, and the cleating of it between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
will cost much time, I most humbly crave your Majesties pardon if I write unto
you with the plainesse of a true-hearted and faithfull servant, who ever have co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
honestly unto your Majesties ends, if I knew them. I know your Majesty
hath long been of opinion, that the greatest assurance you could get that the King of
<hi>Spaine</hi> would effectually labour the entire restitution of the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> was,
that he really proceeded to the effecting of the March, and my Instructions under
your Majesties hand were to insist upon the restoring of the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> but
not so to annex it to the treaty of the Match, as that thereby the Match should bee
hazarded, for that your Majesty seemed confident, they here would never grow to a
perfect conclusion of the Match, without a setled resolution to give your Majesty sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in the businesse of the Palatinate; the same course I observed in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of busines by his Highnes, and my L. Duke at their being here, who though they
insisted upon the businesse of the Palatinate, yet they held it fit to treat of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
and that the Marriage should preceed as a good pawne for the other. Since-their
departure my Lord Ambassador, Sir <hi>Walter Aston,</hi> and my selfe have much pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to have this Kings resolution in writing concerning the Palatinate, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
which your Majesty will receive herewith concerning that businesse were
written before the receipt of these your Majesties Letters, and doubtlesse it is now a
great part of their care that that businesse may bee well ended before the Infantaes,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99895:34"/>
comming into <hi>England;</hi> And his Highnesse will well remember that the <hi>Conde de
Olivares</hi> often protested the necessity of having this businesse compounded and setled
before the Marriage, saying; otherwise, they might give a Daughter and have a War
within three moneths after, if this ground and subject of Quarrell should be still
left on foot, The same language he hath ever since held with Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> and my
selfe, and that it was a firm peace and amity, as much as an allyance which they
sought with his Majesty, so that it is not to be doubted, but that this King conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Match, resolveth to employ his utmost power for the satisfaction in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Prince <hi>Palatine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The question now will be, whether the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> having Relation to many
great Princes that are interessed therein (living at a great distance) and being indeed
for the condition and nature of the businesse it selfe impossible to be ended, but by a
formall Treaty (which of necessity will require great length) whether the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Match shall any way depend upon the issue of this businesse, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be lat from your Majesties Intention, for so the Prince might be long kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bestowed,
by any aversnesse of those that might have particular Interest in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
remaining unmarried, or dislike of his Matching with <hi>Spaine:</hi> But that which
I understand to be your Majesties ayme, is only to have the conclusion of this Match
accompanied with as strong engagements as can be procured from this King, for the
joyning with your Majesty, not only in all good offices for the entire Restitution of
the Prince Palatine, but otherwise if need require, of his Majesties assistance. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I have these dayes past laboured with all earnestnesse, and procured this Kings
publike answer, which I am told is resolved of, and I shall within few dayes have it
to send unto Your Majesty, as likewise a private proposition which will bee put into
your hand, and shall not faile further to pursue Your Majesties present directions of
procuring this Kings declaration in what sort your Majesty may rely upon this Kings
assistance in case the Emperour or the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> shall oppose the entire resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Prince <hi>Palatine;</hi> But I conceive it to bee Your Majesties intention,
that I should procure here first this Kings peremptory answer, in the whole businesse,
and how he will be assistant unto your Majesty, in case of the Emperors, or Duke of
<hi>Bavaria's</hi> aversenesse, and that I should send it unto your Majestie, and receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
your answer, before I deliver the powers for the <hi>Desposorios,</hi> the match would
thereby if not be hazarded, yet I conceive the <hi>Infanta's</hi> going at Spring would bee
rendred altogether impossible; for if upon the artivall of the Popes approbation, which
is hourely expected, the Powers be demanded of me, according to the Princes pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Declaration, and the agreement in the Temporall Articles, by which the <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posorios,</hi>
are to be within 10. dayes after the comming of the said approbation, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
refuse them but upon some ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> If I alleage you Majesties desire of having the
<hi>Desposorios</hi> deferred untill Christmas, they know as well as my selfe, that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
Proxie is then out of dare (besides the infringing of the Capitulations) and
they will judge it as a great scorne put upon this King, (who ever since the Princes
granting of his Powers, hath called himselfe the <hi>Infanta's Desposado,</hi> and to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the Prince hath written unto him in some of his Letters:) besides it will be here
held a point of great dishonour unto the <hi>Infanta,</hi> if the powers called for by her friends
they should be deteyned by the Princes part, and whosoever else may have deserved
ill, she certainly hath deserved neither disrespect nor discomforts: Further, upon my
refusall to deliver the powers, all preparations which now goe on cheerefully and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace,
will be stayed, and there will enter in so much distrust and so many jealousies,
that if the maine businesse runne not hazard by them, at least much time will be to
cleere them.</p>
                  <p>I must therefore in discharge of my dutie, tell Your Majestie, that all your busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
here are in a faire way. The match and all that is capitulated therein, they

                  <p>This is now the present estate of your Majesties affaires as it appeareth unto me
and to Sir <hi>Walter Aston,</hi> with whom I have communicated this dispatch, as I doe
all things else concerning your Majesties service: And I must cleerely let your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
understand, that I conceave by reteyning of the powers when their King shall
call for them, and offering to deferre the <hi>Desposorios</hi> untill Christmas, that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
businesses will runne a great hazard, what by the distasts and distrusts that will
be raised here, and what by the art and industry of those which are enemies to the
Match, whereof every Court of Christendome hath plenty; That therefore which I
presume with all humility to offer unto your Majesty is, that you would be pleased to
give mee order with all possible speed, That when the businesse shall come cleered
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the powers for the Marriage shall bee demanded of mee on the
behalfe of this King, that I may deliver them, and no wayes seeke to interrupt or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
the <hi>Desposorios,</hi> but assist and help to a perfect conclusion of the match. And
that for the businesse of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> I continue my earnest and faithfull endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to engage this King as farre as shall be possible, both for the doing of all good
Offices for the Prince <hi>Palatines</hi> entire restitution, as likewise for this Kings Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of assistance in case the Emperor or Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> shall oppose the said resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
Herein I will not faile to use all possible means, and I conceive the dispatch of
the match will be a good pawn in the businesse, and the help and assistance which the
Princes being once betroathed would be able to give in this Court to all Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
businesses, would be of good consideration. So fearing I have already too far
presumed upon Your Majesties patience, I humbly crave Your Majesties pardon, and

readinesse humbly offered our assistance to your Majesty to maintaine the Warre,
which may insue there upon, yet with all sencibly finding what seditious and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
positions those Incendiaries of Rome, and professed Engines of Spaine, the
Priests and Iesuits, infuse into your naturall borne Subjects, what numbers they have
seduced, and doe dayly seduce to make their dependance on the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> contrary to their Allegiance to your Majesty their Leige Lord: what
daily resort of Priests and Jesuites into your Kingdomes, what concourse of Popish
Recusants much more then usuall is now in and about the City of London,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> what
boldnesse, yea what insolency they have discovered, out of the opinion conceived of
their forraigne patronage, what publique resort to Masses and other exercises of the
Popish Religion in the Houses of forraigne Ambassadors, there is daily, to the great
griefe and offence of your good Subjects; what great preparations are made in <hi>Spaine</hi>
fit for an Invasion; the bent whereof is as probable to bee upon some part of Your
Majesties Dominions, as upon any other place; what incouragement that may bee to
your Enemies, and the Enemies of Your Crown to have a party, or but the opinion
of a party within Your Kingdomes, who do daily increase and combine themselves
together for that purpose; What dishartning of your good and loving Subjects,
when they shall see more cause of feare from their false hearted Country-men at
home, then from their professed adversaries abroad, what apparent dangers by Gods
providence and Your Majesties wisdome and goodnesse they have very lately esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
which the longer continuance of those treaties upon such unfitting conditions,
fomented by your owne ill affected Subjects,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> would surely have drawne upon Your
Majesty and Your State; doe in all humblenesse offer to your sacred Majestie these
their humble petitions following.</p>
                  <p>1. That all Jesuites and Semminary Priests, and all others having taken Orders by
any authority derived from the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> may by Your Majesties Proclamation
be commanded forthwith to depart out of this Realme, and all other Your Highnesse
Dominions, and neither they nor any other to returne or come hither againe upon
perrill of the severest penaltie of the Lawes now in force against them; And that
all your Majesties Subjects may hereby also be admonished, not to receive, entertaine
comfort or conceale any of that viperous brood upon the penalties and forfeitures
which by the Lawes may be imposed upon them.</p>
                  <p>2. That your Majesty would be pleased to give streight and speedy charge to the
Justices of Peace in all parts of this Kingdome, that (according to the Lawes in that
behalfe made, and the orders taken by Your Majesties Privie Councell heretofore for
policie of State) they doe take from all Popish Recusants legally convicted, or justly
suspected; All such Armor, Gunpowder, and Munition of any kinde, as any of them
have either in their owne hands, or in the hands of any other for them, and to see the
same safely kept, and disposed according to the Law, leaving for the necessary defence
of their House and persons, so much as by the Law is prescribed.</p>
                  <p>3. That Your Majestie will please to command all popish Recusants, and all others,
who by any Law or Statute are prohibited to come to the Kings Court, forthwith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
paine of your heavie displeasure, and severe execution of your Lawes against them,
to retire themselves, their wives and families from or about <hi>London,</hi> to their severall
dwellings or places, by your Lawes appointed, and there to remaine confined within
five myles of their dwelling places, according to the Lawes of this your Realme, And
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99895:36"/>
for that purpose to discharge all by-past Lycences granted unto them for their repaire
hither. And that they presume not any time hereafter to repaire to <hi>London,</hi> or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
tenne myles of <hi>London,</hi> or to the Kings Court, or to the Princes Court whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>4. That Your Majesty would forbid and restraine the great resort and concourse of
your owne Subjects for the hearing of Masse, or other exercise of the Romish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to the houses of Forreigne Ambassadors, or Agents residing here, for the service
of their severall Princes or States.</p>
                  <p>5. That where of late in severall Counties in this Realme, some have bin trusted in
the places of Lord Leiutenants, deputies Leiutenants, Commissioners of Oyer and
Terminer, Justices of Peace, and Captaines in their Countries, which are either
popish Recusants or <hi>non-Communicants</hi> by the space of a yeare now last past, or
which do not usually resort to the Church to Divine service, and can bring no good
certificat thereof, that your Majesty would be pleased to discharge them from those
places of trust, by which they have that power in the Country where they live, as
is not fit to be put into the hands of persons so affected.</p>
                  <p>6. That your Majesty would be pleased generally to put the Lawes in due execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which are made and stand in force against Popish Recusants, and that all your
Judges, Iustices and Miniisters of Iustice to whose care these things are Committed
may by your Majestyes Proclamation be Commanded to doe their duty therein.</p>
                  <p>7. That seeing we are thus happily delivered from that danger which those Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
now dissolved, and that use which your<note n="ast;" place="margin">NOTE.</note> ill affected Subjects made thereof,
would certainly have drawne upon us, and cannot but foresee and feare, least the
like may heareafter happen, which would unevitably, bring such perill to your
Majesties Kingdomes. We are most humble suiters to your Gracious Majesty to
secure the hearts of your good Subjects by the engagement of your Royall word
unto them, that upon no occasion of Marriage, or Treaty, or other request in that
behalfe from any foraign Prince or state whatsoever, you will take off, or slacken the
execution of your Lawes against the Popish Recusants.</p>

towards your Majesty our care of our Countries good, and our confident

Assembled in Parliament, doe in all humblenesse offer unto your sacred Majesty
these two Petitions following.</p>
                  <p>1. That for the more safety of your Realmes, and better keeping your Subjects in
their due obedience, and other important reasons of state, your Majesty would be
pleased by some such course as your Majesty shall thinke fit, to give present order,
that all the Lawes be put in due execution, which have beene made, and do stand in
force against Iesuits, Semenary Priests, and all others having taken orders by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
derived from the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and generally against all Popish Recusants. And
as for disarming, that it may be according to the Lawes, and according to former
Acts and directions of state in that Case, and yet that it may appeare to all the
world, the favour and clemency your Majesty useth towards all your Subjects of
what condition whatsoever. And to the intent the Jesuits and Priests now in the
Realme may not pretend to be surprised; That a speedy and certaine day may be
perfixed by your Majesties Proclamation, before which day they shall depart out of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99895:36"/>
this Realme, and all other your highnesse Dominions, and neither they nor any other
to returne or come hither againe, upon perill of the severest penalties of the lawes now
in force against them. And that all your Majesties Subjects may thereby also be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished,
not to receive, entertaine, comfort, conceale any of them, upon the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and forfeitures which by the lawes may be imposed on them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, seeing we are thus happily delivered from that danger which those Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
now dissolved, and that use which your ill affected Subjects made thereof, would
certainly have drawne upon us; and yet cannot but foresee and feare, least the like
may hereafter happen, which would inevitably bring such perill upon your Majesties
Kingdomes: We are most humble Sutors to your gracious Majesty, to secure the
hearts of your good Subjects by the engagement of your royall word unto them,
that upon no occasion of marriage or treaty, or other request in that behalfe from any
forreigne Prince or State whatsoever, you will take away or slacken the execution of
your lawes against Jesuits, Priests and popish Recusants.</p>
                  <p>To which our humble Petitions, proceeding from our most loyall and dutifull affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
towards your Majesty, our care of our Countries good, and our owne confident
perswasion, that these will much advance the glory of Almighty God, the everlasting
honour of your Majesty, the safety of your Kingdomes, and the encouragement of all

            <p>Hereupon the Papists (though formerly much daunted by the dissolution of the
Spanish Match) began to lift up their heads, elevated their hopes, and resorted openly
to Masse in great multitudes; Seminary Priests and Jesuits repaired into the Realme
from all forreigne parts without restraint, and grew very numerous and bold: which
the Parliament then sitting, taking into their pious and serious consideration, in the
beginning of <hi>August</hi> 1625. both Houses presented the King at <hi>Oxford</hi> (whither the
Parliament was then adjourned by reason of the plague) with this ensuing Petition
aginst Recusants, Priests and Jesuits; whereunto I have annexed his Majesties An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

parts of the Kingdome, it doth plainly appeare that sundry popish Schollers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
their Religion, have craftily crept in, and obtained the places of teaching in
divers Countries, and therby infected and perverted their Schollers and so fitted them
to be transported to the popish Seminaries beyond the seas: that therefore there be
great care in choyce and admitting Schoole-masters, and that the ordinaries make dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

please your Majesty to advise your Bishops by fatherly entreaty and tender usage, to
reduce to the peaceable and orderly service of the Church, such able Ministers as have
been formerly silenced, that there may be a profitable use of their ministery in these
needfull and dangerous times; and that Non-residency, Pluralities and Commendams,
may be moderated; where we cannot forbeare most humbly to thanke your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty

Dispensutions for pluralities granted, not no man now hath allowed above two Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,

Canon in that case provided shall be duely put in execution; for commendams they
shall be sparingly granted, onely in such case where the exility and smalnesse of the

him shall be well bestowed, and for the better propagating of Religion, his Majesty
recommendeth to the House of Parliament, that care may be taken and provision
made, that every parish shall alow a competent maintenance for an able Minister, and

popish Recusants and Delinquents of that sort: against whom you are to proceed by
Excommunication and other censures of the Church, not omitting any other lawfull
meanes to bring them forth to publike justice. And as Our pleasure is, that due and

            <p>This Parliament dissolving in discontent, on the 15. of <hi>June</hi> 1626. not long after
this <hi>Bull;</hi> the popish Recusants were so farre from being in danger of any open
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
against them within our Realmes, needing such a Cordiall as this from <hi>Rome,</hi>
that on the contrary, this very yeere, even when the Parliament was sitting, they were
upon the point of gaining a publike Toleration of their Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where
they plotted first openly to erect the same (being furthest out of the Parliaments and
peoples view) and then to set it up openly by degrees neerer home.</p>
            <p>This Toleration there, by their powerfull Court-friends and purses, was so farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
on and proceeded in, that the Protestant Bishops of <hi>Ireland</hi> knew of no other
meants to prevent it, but by joyning in a publike Protestation against it; the Copy,
occasion and manner whereof I shall here present you with, as I found them in the
Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterburies Study,</hi> sent (as it seemes) to the then Arch-bishop out

them therefore a Toleration of Religion, or to consent that they may freely exercise
their Religion, and professe their Faith and Doctrine is a grievous sinne, and that in two
respects. First, it is to make our selves accessary not only to their superstitious Idolatries;
Heresies, and in a word, to all the abominations of Popery; but also (which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of the former) to the perdition of the seduced people, which perish in the
deluge of the Catholike Apostacy. Secondly, to grant them a Toleration in respect
of any mony to be given, or contribution to be made by them, is to set <hi>Religion</hi> to
<hi>sale,</hi> and with it tho soules of the peoples, whom Christ our <hi>Saviour hath redeemed</hi>
with his blood. And as it is a great sinne, so it is a matter of most dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
the consideracion whereof we leave to the Wife and Judicious, beseeching
the Zealous God of Truth, to make those who are in authority Zealous of God glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               </gap> tearme 1626. there was a great meeting of all the
chiefest of the whole Kingdome, and the Arch-bishops and Bishops, &amp;c. and it was
likely to be concluded: Doctor <hi>Dowman</hi> Bishop of <hi>London-derrey Aprill</hi> II. preached
at <hi>Dublin</hi> before the Lord Deputy and the whole State; his Text was <hi>Luke</hi> I. at the
79. In the midst of his Sermon he openly read this Protestation above written,
subscribed by the Arch-bishops and Bishops of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and at the end he boldly said,
<hi>and let all the people say, Amen.</hi> And suddenly all the whole Church almost shooke
with the sound, that their <hi>Amen</hi> made, &amp;c. the Lord Deputy called from the Bishop
of <hi>Derry</hi> a copy both of his Sermon and Protestation to send to the King; the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and couragious Bishop gave this answer, that there was nothing he either spake or
read in the Pulpit but he would willingly justifie it before his Majesty, and feared
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99895:46"/>
not who read or saw it. So now by Gods mercy nothing may yet be done, or will be
till the Lord Deputy heare from the King.</p>
            <p>The Bishop hereupon was sent for into <hi>England,</hi> and after some attendance here,
returned back into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he dyed at his Bishoprick.</p>

            <p>How popery and Papists have since increased in that Kingdome, notwithstanding
this Protestation, and what open Toleration of popish Bishops, Priests, Masse, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,
Nunneries, and a Colledge of Jesuits, &amp;c. hath been in that Realme, you
shall heare anon, in the continued seris of this Designe, which transports me into <hi>France</hi>
for a time, from whence it had its second birth.</p>
            <p>Not long after the Kings Match with <hi>France,</hi> there was a designe in that Realme to
extirpate the Protestants, and surprize all their fortified Townes in that Kingdome,
whereof <hi>Rochell</hi> was the principall; which being a maritane Towne, furnished with
a good Fleet of Ships, able to make good their Harbour, and furnish themselves with
provisions and supplies from all their Protestant friends, maugre all the Sea-forces of
the French King; thereupon the French Cardinall <hi>Richelieu</hi> and his confederates taking
the advantage of their new interest in the <hi>King of England,</hi> by reason of this marriage;
importuned him to lend his Brother of <hi>France</hi> the <hi>Vaunt-guard,</hi> one of the Vessels of
his royall Navy, and seven Merchant-men of Warre, to be imployed in his service by
sea: which the King condescending to, sent the said Ships under the command of
<hi>Captaine Pennington</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to be imployed as the French King and his Counsell
should prescribe. Who designing them for service against <hi>Rochell,</hi> to surprize their
Ships, block up their Haven, and intercept their trade and reliefe, contrary to their
expectation; the Captaines, Masters and Marriners of the Ships were so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented,
that they were designed against the <hi>Rochelers,</hi> who were not onely their
friends, but the chiefe professors and mainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iners of the Protestant Religion in those
parts, and that they should be made the instruments of their ruine, and draw the guilt
of their innocent Protestant blood upon their soules, that they all unanimously resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
they would rather dye, sinke, or be hanged up at the Masts of their Ships, then
stirre one jot, or weigh anchor for such an unchristian detestable imployment. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

they could to alter this their heroick and most Christian resolution; but they
continued inflexible, and would neither by allurements, rewards, nor threats be drawne
to such an unworthy action, resolving rather to sinke then stirre therein. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Captaine <hi>Pennington</hi> acquainted his Majesty and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with this their peremptory resolution, and desires their direction herein; the
King (I know not by whose ill advice) returns him this answer both by word of mouth
and this ensuing Warrant (the copy whereof was found among <hi>Windebankes</hi> and the

to quit the Ships and returne into <hi>England;</hi> which all did but two, (who
soone after came to desperate ends, the one being blowne up with Gun-powder, the
the other drowned or slaine.) Upon this, the English Ships were according to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
delivered to the French, manned with French-men and other Forreigners, and
joyning with some more Vessels of the French King, destroyed the <hi>Rochell</hi> Fleet, blocked
up their Haven, &amp; ruined that famous Protestant City, with most of the Protestants in it;
which after a long and sharp siege by sea and land, was through famine surrendred into

who after they had been instruments to destroy their Ships, the principall
meanes of their safety, support, and preservation, by an unfortunate voyage of the
<hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> to the <hi>Isle of</hi> Ree (to what end but to ruine <hi>Rochell</hi> and the
Protestant party in <hi>France,</hi> or to revenge the disappointment of his lust, as many
muttered, is yet unknowne to the world) exhausted their Ammunition, Victuals, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,

Lord <hi>Iermin,</hi> and some others in that unfortunate expedition informed me) and
then making onely a <hi>Bravado</hi> towards the Barracado, as if they meant to force it with
their fireships, and engines made with great stones (brought to <hi>London</hi> to repaire
<hi>Pauls,</hi> &amp; so unlikely to do any good service for <hi>Rochell)</hi> they discharged their Ordnance
very valiantly above a league or two from the Workes they were to force, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
adventuring neerer or attempting to force the Barre, returned presently with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
dishonour for <hi>England,</hi> leaving all their fireships and Engines in them to the French
in a most unwarlike manner: but in their returne homewards many of these Ships
were wrecked drowned in a tempest, who would not adventure sinking in a fight, and
the whole Navy shattered. Soon after which, poor <hi>Rochell</hi> (thus deferred and betraid) was
surrendred into the French Kings &amp; Cardinals possession, and all the Protestant Towns in
<hi>France</hi> surprized, yeeded, pillaged, dismantled; so as they have since no Town or Fort of
strength to retire unto, to preserve themselves from the force or massacres of their
bloody Adversaries to whose mercilesse cruelties they are now wholly exposed upon all
occasions by our means. I pray God this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> against them, and the blood of those

cause why God (by way of retaliation) hath permitted the Papists in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to shed so much Protestant blood in these Realmes as they have done of late, lot
our refusing or neglecting to avenge their blood upon those romanized Conspirators,
who were the occasion of this their irreperable losse and bloodshed.</p>
            <p>But to returne home againe from this deplorable action; the second Parliament in
King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reigne being dissolved sodainly in disgusts, as you have heard,
there was a desperate plot laid to blow up our Religion, Liberties, Properties, all at
once by the Jesui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>call, Arminian and Prelatical Faction.</p>
            <p>To effect this, they set on foot an enforced Loane or Benevolence to the King, to
which every man must be summoned and compelled to lend mony according to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility:
to which end there were Commissions and Instructions, together with speciall

these Sermons to be printed, by the Kings speciall Command, with some additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

of Conscience; and the Judges were likewise enjoyed in their charges and circuits, to
declare the legallity of them (and so inthrall the Subjects to this and all other arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
taxes) in poynt of Law. And that this malevolent enforced <hi>Benevolence</hi> might
passe more currently and plausibly among the people, the aiding of our Protestant
Allies in <hi>Germany, Denmarke, France</hi> (and particularly the reliefe of <hi>Rochell,</hi> then besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged)
against the Papists and their potent enemies was made the principall end thereof,

                  <p>IT is now knowne to all men, that Our deare Uncle the King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> is
brought into great distresse, that without present succour the Sound will be lost,
Our Garrison in <hi>Stoad</hi> broken by the Emperours Foroes, which now streightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
it, Our Eastland Trade (which maintaines Our Shipping) and the Staple of

Hamborough (which vents Our Cloath) both gotten from Vs: Besides, it is knowne
likewise,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> that two great Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the Pope with them are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to root out Our Religion; that their Admirals the Duke of Guise and <hi>Don Frederick
de Toledo,</hi> are at this present before <hi>Rochell</hi> and endeavouring to block it up: that
they have store of Land-men ready upon the coast of Britaine, with them and other
forces ready to invade us.</p>
                  <p>Of these <hi>imminent dangers to true Religion,</hi> to Our Allies, Our Countries, and
the Trade of Our people, We assure Our selves every well-affected Subject will be
very sensible, as We are; and certainly there is a necessity come upon Vs, not so much
of debating as acting Our defence; and unlesse there be a present meanes found to set
a Fleet to Sea to disband them that lye before <hi>Rochell,</hi> that <hi>Towne and Our Religion in
those parts are sure to be ruined.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have (beyond the custome of Our royall Progenitors) spared neither Our Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
nor Plate, nor Our Lands, to supply publike occasions; We now expect speedy and
proportionable supply for this service from the love and duty of Our People, whence
that charge for their owne preservation should ever come.</p>
                  <p>We find further in the debate of this businesse with Our privy Counsell, that it is
not possible this I lect of Ours now to be set forth, can stay safely till a Parliament
be assembled; and We think it neither wise nor safe for Our Selve or you to be taken
sitting, in a Parliament, and so proclaime to the world that We consult too late;
therefore though We are issuing out Our Writs for a present Parliament, yet because
We find the businesse cannot stay so long (since that must have the ordinary course of
Summons) VVe expect your present performance of this service, not doubting but
that the Parliament when it comes will consider the urgency of the thing, and the
hast of the time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and give Us thanks for this timely provision.<note place="margin">NOTE.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this VVe must let you know, <hi>that if you make this present supply, We will then
goe on with Our Parliament, if not, then We must thinke of a more speedy way:</hi> and yet
it is not VVe that put this condition upon you but the moere necessity of the time
and the service; which if you neglect, then it is not Our fault but your owne that ye
have not a Parliament; for VVe must put you in mind, that it is not possible the
affaires of Christendome should receive a turne to Our advantage, but onely by Gods
blessing and Our speed; and we assure you that your making us and your selves by this
present ayd to sit safe in Parliament, nothing shall then divert us from meeting you at
our day prefixed.</p>
                  <p>And since all men see that it is not safe to set downe now without this Fleet to
back us, it will be lesse sit then when the yeere is further advanced, and though this
may seem to you a great charge, yet we have been so carefull in ordering and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
the businesse, that we have laid a greater summe upon Our Selfe then upon
You.</p>
                  <p>And we further recommend upto you, that Our former distractions (the onely
causes of Our disadvantage abroad) may be laid downe, that so God's blessing may
come in to Our successe: that as Our last devisions did us more harme then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enemy, so our present union testified in this foregoing signe of preparing this
Fleet (which is of greater consequence and will adde more credit then the money it
selfe) may be the happy forerunner of a future happinesse.</p>
                  <p>And last of all, since this great businesse of setting out Ships used to be chaged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the port Townes and neighbouring Ships, is too heavy for them to beare alone in
this great proportion; therefore we have thought sit, with the advice of Our privy
Counsell, and agreeable to the presidents of former times, to cause the whole charge
of this Fleet to be cast up and distributed among all the Counties at a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rate, according to which proportion the summe to be raised in.</p>
                  <p>And because we are confident of your forwardnesse and zeale to the service so
deeply concerning the interest and safety of you all; we give you the power, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the trust for the manner of levying thereof to your care; yet in such sort, that
you will not make the uneven rate of Subsidy your onely rule of proportion, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99895:48"/>
according to the true worth of mens-lands and estates within the County, that
so the poorer may be eased, and yet the businesse be done.</p>
                  <p>The time assigned for Our said Fleet to beat sea, is the first of <hi>March</hi> next; and

                  <p>FATHER RECTOR, let not the damp of astonishment seize upon your
Ardent and Zealous Soule in apprehending the sodaine and unexpected calling of
a Parliament: We have not opposed, but rather furthered it, so that we hope as much
in this Parliament, as ever we feared any in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes.<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> You must
know, the Counsell is engaged to assist the King by way of Perogative, in case the
Parliamentary way should faile; you shall see this Parliament will resemble the Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican,
which takes a pleasure to digge out with her beake her owne bowels.</p>
                  <p>The election of the Knights and Burgesses hath been in such confusion of apparant
faction, as that which we were wont to procure heretofore with much art and industry
(when the Spanish match was in treaty) now breaks out naturally as a both or boyle,
and spets, and spues out its owne rankor and venome.</p>
                  <p>You remember how that most famous and immortall States-man, the Count of
<hi>Gondamare,</hi> fed King <hi>Iames</hi> his fancy, and rocked him asleep with the soft and sweet
sound of peace, to keep up the Spanish treaty. Likewise we were much bound to
some States-men of our owne Country, to gaine time in procuring these most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
cessations of Armes in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and advancing the honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of the Spanish Nation, and villifying the Hollanders, remonstrating to King
<hi>Iames,</hi> that that State was most ungratefull both to his predecessors (Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth)</hi>
and his sacred Majesty; that the States were more obnoxious then the Turke,
and perpetually injured his Majesties loving Subjects in the East Indies; and likewise
they have usurped from his Majesty, the regality and unvaluable profit of the narrow
Seas, in fishing upon the English coast, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This great States-man had but one principall meanes to further their great and
good designes, which was to set on King <hi>Iames,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> that none but the <hi>Puritane Faction</hi>
which plotted nothing but Anarchy and his confusion, were averse to this most happy
Union. We steered on the same course, and have made great use of this anarchicall
election, and have prejudicated and anticipated the great one, that none but the Kings
enemies and his are chosen of this Parliament, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We have now many strings to our Bow, and have strongly fortified our faction, and
have added two Bulwarks more; for when King <hi>Iames</hi> lived (you know) he was very
violent against <hi>Armininisme,</hi> and interrupted (with his pestilent wit and deep lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
out strong designes in <hi>Holland,</hi> and was a great friend to that old Rebell and
Heretick the <hi>Prince of Orange.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we have planted that soveraigne Drugge Armintanisme,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> which we hope will
purge the Pretestants from their Heresie, and it flourisheth and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> fruit in due
season.</p>
                  <p>The materials which build up our other Bulwarke, are the projectors and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of all ranks and qualities whatsoever. Both these Factions cooperate to destroy
the Parliament, and introduce a new species and forme of government, which is Olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy.</p>
                  <p>These serve as direct mediums and instruments to our end, which is the universall
Catholike Monarchy: Our foundation must be mutation, this mutation will cause
a relaxation, which will serve as so many violent diseases, as the Stone, Gout, &amp;c. to
the speedy destruction of our perpetuall and insufferable anguish of the body, which is
worse then death it selfe.</p>
                  <p>We proceed now by counsell and mature deliberation, how and when to worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Dukes jealousie and revenge, and in this we give the honour to those which
merit it, which are the Church Catholikes.</p>
                  <p>There is another matter of consequence which we take much into our considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and tendor care, which is to stave off the <hi>Puritanes,</hi> that they hang not in the Dukes
eares, they are impudent subtill people.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be feared left they should negotiate a reconciliation between the Duke
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99895:49"/>
and the Parliament; 'tis certaine the Duke would gladly have reconciled himself to the
Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Westminster;</hi> but now we assure our selves we have so han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
the matter, that both Duke and Parliament are irreconcilable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the better prevention of the Puritanes, the Arminians have already locked up the
Dukes cares, and we have those of our owne Religion which stand continually at the

in this regard.</hi> I cannot chuse but laugh to see, how some of our owne coat have re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
themselves, you would scarce know them if you saw them: and 'tis admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
how in speech and gesture they act the <hi>Puritanes.</hi> The <hi>Cambrige</hi> Schollers to
their wofull experience shall see, we can act the <hi>Puritanes</hi> a little better then they
have done the <hi>Iesuits;</hi> they have abused our sacred patron Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> in jest, but
we will make them smart for it in earnest. I hope you will excuse my merry digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
for I confesse unto you, I am at this time transported with joy, to see how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
all <hi>Iustruments and meanes, as well great as lesser, cooperate unto our purposes: But
to returne unto the name fabricke: our fouaedation is Arminianisme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                     <hi>the Arminians and
Projectors, as it appeares in the Premises, affect mutation: this we second and enforce by
probable arguments.</hi> In the first place, we take into consideration the Kings honour
and present necessity, and we shew how the King may free himselfe of his ward, as
<hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. did, and for his great splendor and lustre, he may raise a vast revenue,
and not be beholding to his Subjects,<note place="margin">

                     </note> which is by way of imposition <hi>of Excise:</hi>
Then our Church Catholikes proceed to shew the meanes how to settle this excise,
which must be by a mercenary army of Horse and Foot: for the Horse, we have
made that sure, they shall be Forreigners and <hi>Germanes,</hi> who will eat up the Kings
Revenues, and spoile the Country whensoever they come, though they should be
well paid; what havocke will they make there when they get no pay, or are not
duly paid? they will doe more mischiefe then we hope the army will doe.</p>
                  <p>We are provident and carefull that this Mercenary army of 2000. Horse and 20000,
Foot shall be taken on and in pay before the excise be setled: in forming the excise,
the Country is most likely to rise; if the mercenary army subjugate the Country,
then the Souldiers and projectors shall be paid out of the confiscations; if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
be too hard for the Souldiers, then they must consequently mutiny, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
advantagious unto us. Our superlative designe is to worke the Protestants as
well as the Catholikes to welcome in a Conquerour, and that is by this meanes.
We hope instantly to dissolve trades, and hinder the building of Shipping, in
devising probable designes, and putting out the State upon Expeditions, as that of
<hi>Cales,</hi> in taking away the Merchants Ships, that so they might not easily catch and light
upon the West India Fleet, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>AS with all humble thankfulnesse we (your dutifull Commons now in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of your Majesties pious disposition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> so we think it a most necessary duty
(being called by your Majesty to consult and advise of the great and urgent affaires of
this Church and Common-wealth, finding them at this time in apparant dauger of
destruction) faithfully and dutifully to informe your Majesty thereof, (and with blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
heart and bonded knee) to crave such speedy redresse therein, as to your owne
wisdome (unto which we humbly submit our selves and our desires) shall seeme most

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and convenient.</p>
                  <p>What a multitude and potency of your Majesties enemies are abroad; what be
their ambitious and malicious ends, and how vigilant and constantly industrous they
are in pursuing the same, it is well knowne to your Majesty, together with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
threatned thereby to your sacred person and your Kingdomes, and the calamities
which have already fallen, and hath daily increased upon your Friends and Allies; of
all which we are well assured your Majesty is most sensible, and will accordingly (in
your great wisdome, and with the gravest and most mature Counsels according to the
exegency of the times and occasions) provide (by all good meanes) to prevent and
help the same. To which end, we most humbly entreat your Majesty first especially to
cast your eyes upon the miserable condition of this your owne Kingdome, of late
so strangely weakned, impoverished, dishonoured and dejected, that unlesse (through
your Majesties most gracious wisdome, goodnesse and justice) it be speedily raised to
a better condition, it is in no little danger to become a sodaine pray to the enemies
thereof; and of the most happy and flourishing,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> to be the most miserable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Nation in the world.</p>
                  <p>In the discovery of which dangerous, mischiefs and inconveniences lying upon us
we doe freely protest, that it is farre from out thoughts to lay the least imputation
upon your Majesties sacred person, or the least scandall on your government: For we
doe in all sincerity, and with joyfulnesse of our hearts (not onely for our selves, but
in the name of all the Commons in your Realme, whom we represent) ascribe as
much honour to your Majesty and acknowledgement of duty, as a most loyall and
affectionate people can give unto the best King, for so you are, and so you have been
pleased abundantly to expresse your selfe this present Parliament, by your Majesties
cleere and satisfactory answer to our Petition of Right; for which both our selves and
our Posterities shall blesse God, and ever preserve a thankfull memory of your great
goodnesse and justice therein; and we doe verily beleeve, that all, or most of all
those things, which we shall now present unto your Majesty, are either altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unknowne to you, or else by some of your Majesties Ministers offered under
such specious pretences, as may hide their owne bad intentions and ill consequence of
them from your Majesty: But we assure our selves that according to the good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of your noble Predecessors, nothing can make your Majesty (being a wise and
Judicious Prince, and above all things desirous of the welfare of your people) more
in love, with Parliaments then this (which is one of the principall ends of calling
them) that therein you may be truly informed of the State of all the severall parts of
your Kingdome, and how your Officers and Ministers doe behave themselves in the
charge and trust reposed in them by your Majesty, which is scarce possible to be made
knowne to you but in Parliament, as was declared by your blessed Father, when he
was pleased to put the Commons in mind, that it would be the greatest unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and breach of duty to his Majesty, and of the trust committed to them by their
Country that could be; if in setting forth the grievances of the people, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of all the parts of this Kingdome from whence they came, they did not dealt
cleerly with him (without sparing any how deare or neere soever they were unto him)
if they were hurtfull unto all the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>In confidence therefore of your Majesties most ready and gracious acceptation in a
matter of so high importance; in faithfull discharge of our duties, we doe (first of
all) most humbly beseech your Majesty to take notice, that howsoever we know your
Majesty doth from your soul abhor that any such should be imagined or attempted yet
there is a generall feare conceived in your people of some secret working and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99895:50"/>
to introduce into this Kingdome Innovation and change of holy Religion
(more precious to us then our lives and whatever the world can afford.) Our feares and
jealousies herein are not merely conjecturall, but arising out of such certaine and visible
effects, as may demonstrate a true and reall cause, for notwithstanding the many good
&amp; wholsome lawes made to prevent the encrease of Popery within this Kingdome, and
notwithstanding your Majesties most gracious and satisfactory answer to the Petition
of both Houses on that behalfe,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> presented to your Majesty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> we find there
hath followed no good execution or effect; but on the contrary (at which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
out of the quick sense of your owne Religious heart, cannot but be in the
highest measure displeased) those of that Religion doe find extraordinary favours and
respects in Court from persons of great quality and power there, unto whom they
continually tesort; and in particular to the Countesse of <hi>Buckingham's,</hi> who her selfe
openly professing that Religion, is a knowne favourer and supporter of them that doe
the same; which we well hoped (upon your Majesties Answer to the aforesaid Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of <hi>Oxford)</hi> should not have been permitted,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> nor that any of your Majesties
Subjects of that Religion, or justly to be suspected, should be entertained in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of your Majesty, or of your Royall Consort the Queen: Some likewise of that
Religion have had Honours, Offices, and places of command and authority lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
upon them.</p>
                  <p>But that which striketh the greatest terrour into the hearts of your loyall Subjects
concerning this point is,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> that letters for stay of legall proceedings against them have
been procured from your Majesty (by what indirect meanes we know not) and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
under the great Seale granted and executed for composition to be made with
popish Reculants: inhibitions also and restraints both to the Ecclesiasticall and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Courts, and Officers to intermeddle with them; which is conceived to amount
to no lesse then a Toleration, odions to God, full of dishonour and extreame dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profit
to your Majesty, of great scandall and griefe to your good people, and of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
dangers of the present estate of your Majesty and this Kingdome; and in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
about <hi>London</hi> and the Suburbs thereof, where exceeding many Families of them
doe make their abode, frequent Masse at <hi>Denmark-house</hi> and other places; and by
their often meetings and conferences, have unhappy opportunities of combining their
councels and strengths together, to the hazard of your Majesties safety, and the
State; and most especially in these doubtfull and calamitous times. <q>As our feare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
change or subversion of Religion is grounded upon the daily encrease of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,

a daily growth and spreading of the Faction of the <hi>Arminians;</hi> that being (as your

                        </gap> as in the neighbour Countries: and your gracious Majesty imitating his most
worthy example, have openly and by your Proclamations declared your mislike of
those persons and of their opinions; who (notwithstanding) are much favoured and
advanced, not wanting friends even of the Clergy, neere to your Majesty; namely,
Doctor <hi>Neale</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> and Doctor <hi>Land</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wels,</hi> who
are justly suspected to be unsound in their opinions that way; And it being now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the way to preferment and promotion in the Church, many Schollers doe bend
their S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ndias to maintaine those Errours: their Books and opinions are suffered to be
printed and published; and on the other side, the impressions of such as are written
against the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and in defence of the Orthodox Religion, are hindered and prohibited;
and (which is a boldnesse most incredible) this restraint of Orthodox Books, is made
under colour of your Majesties (formerly mentioned) Proclamation: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and meaning whereof, we know was quite contrary.</q> And further to encrease
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99895:50"/>
our feares (concerning innovation in Religion) we find that there hath been no small
labouring to remove that, which is the most powerfull meanes to strengthen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our own Religion, and to oppose the contrary, which is the diligent teaching and
instructing the people in the true knowledge and worship of Almighty God; and
therefore meanes hath been sought out to disparage and discountenance pious, painfull,
and Orthodox Preachers, and how conformable soever, and peaceable in their disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and carriage they be; yet the preferment of such is opposed, and instead of being
encouraged, they are molested by vexatious courses and pursuits, and hardly permitted
to Lecture, even in those places where are no constant preaching Ministers: whereby
many of your good people (whose soules in this case we desire your Majesty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserate)
are kept in ignorance, and are apt to be easily seduced into errours and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.
It doth not a little also encrease our dangers and feares this way, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the miserable condition of your Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole
the popish Religion is openly professed and practised in every part thereof,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
jurisdiction being generally exercised and avowed; Monasteries, Nunneries and
other superstitions houses newly erected, re-edified, replenished with men and women
of severall orders, and in a plentifull manner maintained in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and most of the
great Townes and divers other places of that Kingdome, which of<note n="a" place="margin">Note this.</note> what ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it may prove, if not seasonably repressed, we leave to your Majesties wisdome
to judge: But most humbly beseech you (as we assure our selves you doe) to lay the
serious consideration thereof to your Royall and pious heart, and that some timely course
may be taken for redresse therein.</p>
                  <p>And now if to all these your Majesty will be pleased to adde, the consideration of
the circumstance of time, wherein these courses tending to the destruction of true
Religion, within these your Kingdomes have been taken; even at such times, when
the same is with open force and violence persecuted in other Countries,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> and all the
reformed Churches of Christendome either depressed or miserably distressed; we doe
humbly appeale to your Majesties Princely judgement, whether there be not a just
ground of feare, that there is some secret and strange cooperating here with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of our Religion abroad, for the utter extirpation thereof; and whither if these
courses be not speedily redrest, and the profession of true Religion encouraged we
can expect any other but misery and ruine speedily to fall upon us; especially, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the visible and apparant dangers, whereby we are encompassed round about, you
would be pleased piously to remember the displeasure of Almighty God alwayes
bent against the neglect of his holy Religion; the stroaks of whole divine justice
we have already felt, and doe still feele (with smart and sorrow) in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>This memorable Petition and Remonstrance predicting (and if then cordially em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruced,

the great and hearty desire We have to take off all feares and jealousies from Our loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and loving Subjects; We have thought fit to declare these reasons following, why We

have called in this Remonstrance, which yet We presume and constantly beleeve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
framed and delivered up unto Us with good intentions, though by amisguised Zeale.</p>
            </q>
            <p>For first that Remonstrance begins at Religion, and feares innovation of it, innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Popery: But We would have Our Subjects of all sorts to call to mind
what difficulties and dangers We endured not many yeers since for Religions sake;
that We are the same still, and our holy Religion is as pretious to Vs, as it is or can be
to any of them; and we will no more admit innovation therein, then they that think
they have done well in fearing it so much.</p>
            <p>'Tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue that all effects expected have not followed upon the Petition delivered

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inabled
Us to execute all that was desired, and caused the stay of those legall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
which have helped to swell up this Remonstrance: Yet let all the Countie: of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
be examined, and <hi>London</hi> and the Suburbs with them, neither is there such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
encrease of Papists, nor such cause of feare as is made, nor hath any a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nounted
to such an odious Tolerating as is charged upon it, nor neere any such.</p>
            <p>For that Commission so much complained of, both the Matter and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of it are
utterly mistaken; for it doth not dispense with any Penalty or any course to be taken
with any Papist for the exercise of their Religion; no nor with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
or not conformity to Ours; It was advised for the encrease of Our profit, and the
returning of that into Our purse, which abuse or connivency of in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eriour Ministers
might perhaps divert another way: If that or any other shall be abused in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
We will be ready to punish upon any just complaint.</p>
            <p>The next feare is the daily growth and spreading of the Arminian Faction, called
a cunning way to bring in Popery: But We hold this charge as great a wrong to Our
Selfe and Our Government, as the former; for Our People must not be taught by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Parliament Remonstrance or any other way,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> that We are so ignorant of Truth, or so
carelesse of the profession of it, that any Opinion, or Faction, or whatever it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
should thrust it selfe so farre and so fast into Our Kingdomes without Our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it; this is a meere dreame of them that wake, and would make Our loyall
and loving People think, We sleepe the while.</p>
            <p>In this charge there is great wrong done to two eminent Prelates that attend Our,
Person, for they are accused without producing any the least shew or shadow or proof
against them; and should they, or any other attempt innovation of Religion, either
by that open or any cunning way, We should quickly take other order with them, and
not stay for your Remonstrance.</p>
            <p>To help on this, Our people are made beleeve there is a restraint of Books Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall:
But We are sure since the late Parliament began, some whom the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
cals Orthodox, have assumed to themselves an unsufferable liberty in printing.
Our Proclamation commanded a restraint on both sides till the passions of men might
subside and calme; and had this been obeyed as it ought, We had not now been tossed
in this tempest: and for any distressing or discountenancing of good Preachers, We
know there is none, if they be, as they are called, <hi>Good:</hi> But Our good people shall
never want that spirituall comfort which is due unto them. And for the preferments
which We bestow. We have ever made it Our great Care to give them as rewards of
desert and paines; but as the preferments are Outs, so will We be Judge of the desert
Our Selfe, and not be taught by a Remonstrance.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Ireland</hi> We thinke in Case of Religion, 'tis not worse then <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>
left it; and for other affaires 'tis as good as We found it, nay, perhaps better: and We
take it for a great disparagement of Our Government that it should be voyced, that
new Monasteries,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> Nunneries, and other Superstitious Houses are erected and repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in <hi>Dublin</hi> and other great Townes of that Our Kingdome: for We assure Our
Selfe, Our Deputy and Counsell there will not suffer God and Our Government so
to be dishonoured, but We should have had some accompt of it from them; and We
may not endure to have Our good people thus missed<note n="a" place="margin">They are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

There is likewise somewhat considerable in the time, when these practises to
undermine true Religion in Our Kingdomes are set on foot. The Remonstrance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
Vs, it is now when Religion is opposed by open force in all other parts. But We must
tell Our people, there is no undermining Practises at home against it, If they practice
not against it, that seeme most to labour for it; for while Religion seems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for in such a factious way which cannot be Gods way, the heat of that doth
often melt away that, which it labours earnestly but perhaps not wisely, to preserve;
And for Gods judgements which We and Our people have felt, and have cause to feare,
VVe shall prevent them best by a true and religious Remonstrance of the amendment
of Our lives, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Answer to the Parliaments Remonstrance, and the publike calling of it in gave

commanded to commit him to prison without baile or mainprize, and presently

                  <p>AS to the imputation cast upon us to burthen and charge the poore people for
clandestine Marriages, Christnings, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We humbly propose to your Lordships consideration.</p>
                  <p>1. That the cognizance of these causes doth by the Lawes of this Realme
belong to the Judicature Ecclesiasticall, with a very severe charge in Gods name to
see to the due execution thereof, as in the Statute of 2. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. may appeare.</p>
                  <p>2. That the res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to divine service and administration of Sacraments, and other Rites accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the forme of the book of Common-prayer, is no way to be cherished or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
especially in the apparant endeavours which is now used by the popish facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note>
to draw them away from the obedience of his Majesty to that of the Pope.</p>
                  <p>3. That if it be permitted to them to marry and baptize without controle, all other
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>abaptists, Brownists, &amp;c. may claime the like.</p>
                  <p>4. That they are in no worse condition then those of our owne; and his Majesty in
those very graces which their very Agents obtained, and to which they have reference
in their Petition, did referre the Delinquents in these particulars to be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
according to the ordinary course of Law, <hi>Art.</hi> 49.</p>
                  <p>5. That if this proceeding he stopt, these inconveniences will arise: The Bishops
and Ordinaries are not able to answer the Kings writs, which are by the common Law
to be directed unto them, as in cause of Bastardy, and Certificate of marriage, and the
like; as also the whole Common-wealth will swarme with Incest, Adultery, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
&amp;c. if it be lawfull for popish Vicars to dispence and divorce at pleasure, and
voyd new marriages upon pretext they were not solemnized by the parish Priest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Trent Reformation, and other like frivolous pretexts, contrary to the
law of God.</p>
                  <p>6. As to the burthen of the poore people, we doe humbly desire, that the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
may be informed against<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon conviction severely punished.</p>
                  <p>7. And if it seeme to your Lordships, that the fees of the Ecclesiasticall Courts be
over-burthenous, that the Commission for regulating them may be speedily executed.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Touching the continuance of the Courts longer then one day at a sitting.</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the same to be for the ease of the people, and expediting of causes, and the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of chamber-justice; but if it shall appeare otherwise to your Lordships, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
your Lordships to set downe what order you shall think most fit for the ease of the
people, and due performance of that service.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Concerning Inquisitors fees for their entrance.</hi> We doe deny that ever any such
thing was done, and if any can be justly charged therewith, let him be punished.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Touching our Subsidy.</hi> We doe think it is not unknowne to your Lordships,
how cheerfully we have strained our selves for the safety of the Country, some of us
having besides contributed to the Souldiers as deeply as they, even of our mensall lands
which we hold in our owne hands.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Touching School-Masters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> We humbly desire your Lordships to consider:</p>
                  <p>1. How much it concerneth the Reformation of the manners of the people, that
School-Masters be well-affected to Religion and to the present Government.</p>
                  <p>2. That popish School-Masters doe breed up and prepare the youth of this Realme
to be Priests, and contrary to the Priviledges of his Majesties Progenitors, to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of <hi>Dublin,</hi> doe teach them Logick and Philosophy.</p>
                  <p>3. That under the name of School-Masters, divers dangerous and seditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may be nourished in private Families, to the corrupting and seducing the youth
of this Realme, and withdrawing them from his Majesties alleagiance.</p>
                  <p>4. That wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> if such be put downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the parents would out of necessity send their

at <hi>Dublin;</hi> by the allowing them, they will be still nouzeled in Superstition
and Barbarisme.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, whereas your Lordships lately desire us to certifie you, who are the chiefe
abettors of the popish titular Clergy, your Lordships have them now shewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their presenting this Petition, which we hope you will be sensible of for the

            <p>From which Protestation I shall observe these considerable particulars.</p>
            <p>1. First, that the papists in <hi>Ireland</hi> had their own popish Arch-bishops, Bishops, and
a Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at Apostolicall residing then amongst them, as the Title and body of this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
manifest.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that their Arch-bishop <hi>Flemming</hi> had a popish Clergy under him in his
Province, and did exceedingly tyrannize over them, usurping jurisdiction even in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ses, and over the Kings owne Courts among the Catholikes of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the popish Bishops in <hi>Ireland,</hi> did usually conferre orders, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
all Episcopall jurisdiction there.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> that they had a speciall Cardinall at <hi>Rome (Ludovisius) given by the Pope
unto the Irish, as the onely patron and protector of the Irish Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, That the secular Priests were exceedingly jealous, least the Monks and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in <hi>Ireland</hi> should overtop Lord it, and usurpe a Monarchy over them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
appealed to the Pope against them and their Franciscan Arch-bishop.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, that they were growne extraordinary bold and insolemthere, so as they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
published this their protestation and appeale in print both in Latin and English to
all the world, and avowed it under their hands, subscribed to it.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That they had then erected a popish University in <hi>Dublin</hi> it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
which <hi>Paul Harris</hi> professeth himselfe Deacon (or Deane, as Bishop <hi>Bedle</hi> stiles him)
even in print, of which more hereafter in the Bishop of <hi>Kilmores</hi> letters.</p>
            <p>This very yeere 1632<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Papists in <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon a false suggession, procured a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99895:59"/>
for paying 12. d. for their absence from Church every Sunday towards the
maintainance of the army, and put the greatest charge of it upon the Protestants, to
their great grievance; as appeares by this passage of the Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> his letter
to <hi>Bishop La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Plantators and poore Clergy, was by them satisfied and payed according to his
Majesties directions, with hope that thereupon they should not be further charged with
the like impositions.</p>

that it may be considered, that though they be many in themselves, yet are they but
few, being compared with the rest, and that their proffers seem probable to be for their

                        <head>My humble Opinion concerning a Parliament, in this
your Majesties Kingdome of IRELAND.</head>
                        <p>ALbeit the calling of a Parliament in this Kingdome, is at no time of so much
hazzard (where nothing is propounded as a Law, before it first borrow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from your Majesties immediate allowance under your Great Seale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is in <hi>England,</hi> where there is a Liberty assumed to offer every thing in their
owne time and Order: And this Subordination whereunto they have been
led by the Wisdome of former times, is ever to bee held as a sacred Prerogative
not to bee departed from, in no piece to bee broken or infringed; yet is the
Proposition alwayes weighty, very necessary to bee considered with great delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether the present conjuncture of Affaires doth now advise a Parliament,
or no? And after a serious discourse with my selfe, my reason perswades mee for
the Assembling thereof.</p>
                        <p>For the contribution from the County towards the Army ending in <hi>December</hi>
                           <pb n="115" facs="tcp:99895:61"/>
next, your Majesties Revenue fals short twenty thousand Pounds sterling by yeere, of
the present charge it is burthened withall; besides the vast debt of fourescore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds Irish upon the Crown, which yeerly payments alone, are impossible by
any other ordinary way to be in time supplied, but by the Subject in Parliament.
And to passe to the extraordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y, before there bee at least an attempt first to effect
it with ease, were to love difficulties too well; rather voluntarily to seek them,
then unwillingly to meet them. And might seeme as well vanity in the first respect,
so to affect them, as faintnesse to bow under them, when they are not to be avoided.</p>
                        <p>The next inclination thereunto ariseth in mee from the conditions of this
Country, growne very much more civill and rich, since the accesse of your Royall
Father of blessed memory, and your Majesty to the Crowne; That all you have
here, is issued out againe amongst them for their protection and safety, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
considerable reservation for other the great affaires and expences abroad:
That this great charge is sustained, and this great debt contracted, thorough im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
for a publike good, whereof the benefit hitherto hath been intirely
theirs. That there hath been but one Subsidie granted in all this time, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Supply but this Contribution; in exchange whereof your Princely Bounty
returned them Graces as beneficiall to this Subject as their Money was to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
so as their substance having been so increased, under the guard of your
Wisdome and Justice; So little issued hence from them; The Crowne so pressed
only for their good; And so modest a calling upon them now for a supply, which
in all Wisdome, good Nature and Conscience, they are not to deny; should they
not conforme themselves to your Gracious will, their unthankfulnesse to God, and
the best of Kings would become inexcusable before all the World, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
Power more warrantably to be at after extended for redeeming and recovering
your Majesties Revenews thus lost, and justly to punish so great a forfeit as this must
needs be judged to be in them.</p>
                        <p>Next, the frightfull apprehensions which at this time makes their hearts beat,
le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t the Quarterly Payments towards the Army, continued now almost ten yeeres,
might in fine turn to an Hereditary Charge upon their Lands, inclines them to
give any reasonable thing in present to secure themselves of that feare for the future;
And therefore according to the wholsome Counsell of the Physitian,<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                           <hi>Dum
dolet accipe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And lastly, if they should meanly cast from them these mighty obligations, which
indeed I cannot feare: Your Majesties affaires can never suffer lesse by their starting
aside, when the generall Peace abroad admits more united Power in your Majesty,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
and lesse distracted thoughts in your Ministers to chastise such a forgetfulnesse to
call to their remembrance, and to inforce from them other and better duties
then these.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, the time your Majesty shall in your Wisdome appoint for
this meeting imports very much, which, with all submission, I should advise might
not be longer put off, then <hi>Easter</hi> or <hi>Trinity</hi> Term at furthest; And I shall crave leave
to offer my reasons.</p>
                        <p>The improvements mentioned in my dispatch to the Lord Treasurer, (from
which I no wayes recede) would not be fore slowed, wherein wee lose much by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
this Meeting. A circumstance very considerable in these straits, wherein if
surprized, might be of much disadvantage, in case the Parliament answer not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.
And to enter upon that worke before, would bee an Argument for them
to scant their supply to your Majesty.</p>
                        <p>Againe, a breach of a Parliament would prejudice lesse thus, then in winter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at the worst six moneths to turne our eyes about, and many helps to be gained
in that space; where in the other case the Contribution ending in <hi>December</hi> next,
wee should be put upon an instant of time, to read our lesson at the first sight.</p>
                        <p>Then the calling of a Parliament, and determining of the quarterly payments,
falling out much upon one, might make them apprehend there were a necessity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99895:62"/>
a present agreement, if not the good one wee would, yet the best wee could
get: And so imbolden them to make, and flatter themselves to gaine their owne
Conditions; and Conditions are not to bee admitted with any Subjects, lesse
with this People, <hi rend="margQuotes">where your Majesties absolute Soveraignty goes much higher,
then it is taken, perhaps, to doe in <hi>England.</hi>
                           </hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And lastly, there being some of your Majesties Graces, which being passed into
Lawes, might bee of great prejudice to the Crowne: and yet it being to bee feared
they will presse for them all; and uncertaine what humour the denying any of
them might move in their minds; I conceive, under favour, it would bee much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to make two Sessions of it, one in Summer, the other in Winter. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
to settle your Majesties supply, and in the latter, to enact so many of those
Graces, as in Honour and Wisdome should bee Judged equall; when the putting
aside of the rest might bee of no ill consequence to other your Royall purposes.</p>
                        <p>All the Objections I am able to suggest unto my selfe, are two. That it might
render fruitlesse the intended improvement upon the concealments, and prejudice
the Plantations of <hi>Conn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>gh and Ormond.</hi> The firster, may easily be helped, by a short
Law propounded in my dispatch to my Lord Treasurer. And, <hi>posito,</hi> that there no
other Law passe the first Session; the second, is likewise sufficiently secured.</p>
                        <p>Then it is to bee foreseene what your Majesty will demand, how to induce and
pursue the same, for the happy settlement of the Regall Rights and Powers in this
more subordinate Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>My humble advice is, to declare at the first opening of the meeting, that your
Majestie intends and promises two Sessions. This former for your self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that latter in
<hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term next, for them. This, to ascertaine the payments of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and to strike off the Debts of your Crowne; that, for the enacting of all such
profitable and wholsome Laws, as a moderate and good people may expect from
a Wise and Gracious King.</p>
                        <p>That this being the order of Nature, Reason, and Civility, your Majesty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
it should be intirely observed, and your selfe wholly intrusted by them; which
they are not onely to grant to bee fit in the generall case of King and Subjects, but
ought indeed to acknowledge it with thankfulnesse due to your Majesty in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
when they look back, and call to mind, how, for their ease, you were content
to take six score thousand pounds (which their Agents gave to bee paid in three)
in six yeeres: and not barely so neither: but to double your Graces towards them
the whil'st, which they'have injoyed accordingly, much to their advantage, and
greatly to the losse of the Crown.</p>
                        <p>And that considering the Army hath been represented over to your Majesty from
this Counsell, and in a manner, from the body of this whole Kingdome, to bee
of absolute necessity to give comfort to the quiet minds in their honest labours, to
containe the licentious Spirits within the modest bounds of sobriety; it consists
not with your Majesties Wisdome to give unto the World, no not the apparence
of so much improvidence in your owne Counsels, of so much forgetfulnesse in a
case of their safety; as to leave that Pillar of your Auctority and their Peace, unse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
for continuance, at least, one six moneths before the wearing forth of their
Contribution.</p>
                        <p>Therefore your Maiesty was well assured, in conformity to the rules of Reason
and Judgement, they would presently grant three Subsidies to bee paid in three
yeeres, to disengage the Crowne of fourscore thousand pounds debt: and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
their Quarterly payments towards the Army foure yeeres longer: in which
time it was hopefull, (suitable to your Gracious intentions) some other expedient
might bee found out to maintaine the Army, without further charge to them at
all. VVhich Law passed, they should have as much leisure to inact for themselves
at after as they could desire, either now or in winter: Nay, your Majesty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
be graciously pleased with the assistance of your Counsell to advise seriously with
them, that nothing might remaine either unthought of, or denyed, conducing to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99895:62"/>
the publike good of this Kingdome. But if they made difficulty to proceed with
your Majesty in this manner, other Counsels must be thought of, and little to bee
relyed or expected for from them.</p>
                        <p>I am not to flatter your Majesty so farre, as to raise any hope on that side that
all this should be granted, but by pressing both, and especially the continuance of
the quarterly payments to the Army, which they dread above any earthly thing: I
conceive it probable, that to determine &amp; lay asleep (as they think) the contribution;
and in acknowledgement of your Majesties happy accesse to the Crown, they may
be drawn to a present Gift of three Subsidies payable in three yeares, which alone
would keep the Army on foot during that time; and if my calculation hold, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
discharge the debt of the Crowne besides.</p>
                        <p>For thus I make my Estimate, the contribution from the Country is now but
twenty thousand pounds sterling by the yeere, whereas I have good reason to trust
each Subsidy will raise thirty thousand pounds sterling. And so there will bee ten
thousand pounds for three yeeres over and above the establishment, which thirty
thousand pounds sterling, well and profitably issued, will I trust, with Honour to
your Majesty, and moderate satisfaction to the parties, strike off the whole fourscore
thousand pounds Irish, which in present presseth so sore upon this Crown.</p>
                        <p>And then Sir, after that, in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Terme, all beneficiall Acts for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
be thought of, as many, no fewer, nor no more inacted, then were fit in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and wisdome to be granted: If for a conclusion to this Parliament, we could
gain from them other two Subsidies, to buy in Rents and Pensions to ten thousand

That this Parliament was equally ballanced with Protestants, and Papists, &amp; how
farre the said <hi>Deputie</hi> pursued, obtained his forementioned designes thereby to
inslave that Realm, is so well known to most, that I shall not insist upon it: onely I
shall observe that this connivence and underhand fomenting of that faction made
them grow so insolent, that they raised a strong mutinie even in <hi>Dublin</hi> it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
against the Archbishop, the Mayor and Justices, and rescued two Priests from them,
which they had taken in a religious house saying open Masse, and were like to stone
them to death, so as they were enforced to retire to the Castle for Sanctuary, as

death on Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> day last: for the two Justices sent them in a peaceable
manner to <hi>surprise certaine Priests at Masse in a Religious house</hi> in <hi>Cock street,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> where
they tooke away their habits and pictures in peaceable manner, and then laid hold
of two of the Priests to bring them to the Justices <hi>to answer their exercising of Popery in
so publique a manner, contrary to the Kings Proclamation;</hi> they were no sooner come
out into the street, but all the multitude of mechanicks &amp; common people fell upon
them, and tooke away the two Priests from them by force, and followed the
Mayor and the Archbiship, and the rest so fast with stones all along the high street,
as they were forced to house themselves in Skinners Row, till the Justices and
wee all came from Church and rescued them, and so orderly wee all went through
the multitude to the Castle, and in our passage there was but one stone call out of a
window, which lighted betweene the two Justices. Wee presently made Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
for all people to keepe the Kings peace and their owne Houses; and since,

imitation of his predecessors, as well to continue the reall defence of his owne
right and authority, as the Pope doth his pretended and usurped, which two wayes
may easily bee done.</p>
                        <p>The first, by lively pressing his naturall subjects to take the oath of Allegiance, in
as much as it concernes the abjuration of the Popes authoritie for the deposition
of Princes, as of late the State of <hi>France</hi> hath proceeded against the Jesuites without
any respect to matter of Religion or Priesthood: for the obligation of a Subject to
his lawfull Prince being founded in the Law of Nations, Nature and God, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
thereof is <hi>crimen laesae Majestatis,</hi> and so may bee ordained by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or otherwise, and so those who shall bee punished by death for refusing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
cannot pretend cause of Religion, the oath being propounded in forme as it
is now stiled, or the forme altered in substance onely reserved, as prudent men shall
define.</p>
                        <p>The second by constrayning all <hi>French</hi> servants to King or Queene, to disavow
or detest (according to the late ordinances of State Parliaments, Universities of
<hi>France,</hi> namely of <hi>Sorbon, that damnable and erronious doctrine for the deposition of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
against the Iesuites.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And that it may please his Majestie not to admit any Catholique servant which
shall refuse either of the foresaid manners of oathes or detestations.</p>
                        <p>Besides, that diligent search and punishment bee used against all Agents and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiators,
which in these Realmes advance the contrary errour to the prejudice of
his Majesties authoritie and peace of his State.</p>
                        <p>For the reservation of the Queenes house to the <hi>Pope,</hi> it is evident in all antiquity,
and now practised in all Christian Nations, that the institution and destitution of
Ecclesiastiques (in regard of their persons and as members of the State) depends of
the Prince, or of his Subjects by his consent, although their spirituall faculties or
internall jurisdiction may bee derived from a superiour Prelate, Patriarck, or <hi>Pope,</hi>
but all by equitie, justice and Canon, whereby the King of England propounding
such his Subjects Ecclesiastiques as hee thinkes fit for the Queenes service, cannot bee
refused by the <hi>Pope</hi> or other, untill they have shewed and proved sufficient cause of
refuse.</p>
                        <p>Finally, how dangerous, prejudiciall and dishonorable such reservation is to the
Kings authoritie,<note place="margin">Note.</note> State and posteritie, upon what end or colour soever, every man of

the choice be in the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> yet the confirmation and approbation of all
and every one be in the King of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> according to the last clause of the
eleventh Article of the Treaty. Secondly, that concerning the French Bishops and
Priests sent into <hi>England</hi> by the Popes authority, two things are to be considered; the
first is the spirituals power, Catholike Religion and Jurisdiction, as well in the head
as members; the second is the exaltation of the Popes temporall power in prejudice
of the Kings sovereigue authority, under pretext of Catholike Religion, by obtruding
as matter of faith, the Popes power for deposition of Princes. Howbeit then the King
of great Brittaine permitteth the full exercise of Catholike Religion and spirituall
power to the Queens Clergy and Catholike domestiques, notwithstanding the laws and
statutes made to the contrary in this Realme since <hi>Henry the eighth;</hi> so is it necessary
for the preservation of his soveraigne authority and peace of his State, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
the intrusion of the Popes temporall power under pretext of Religion in preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of his owne; which he may in this concurrence most conveniently doe, by using
the same remedies against these French Ecclesiasticks and Domestiks; which the State
of <hi>France,</hi> but particularly the Parliament and University of <hi>Paris,</hi> assembled in their
Colledge of Sorbon procured against the Jesuits, this same yeere 1626. the one by

                  <p>TOM. I writ to you this afternoon already, immediately upon my arrivall here
and gave you account of my passage into these parts, and this was by the Master
of the boat that brought me hither; since, understanding that the Pacquet-boat is to
part away from hence to morrow, I thought fit to take that occasion to communicate
some thoughts of mine concerning my unfortunate businesse in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>It is not unlikely but that the House of Commons will, notwithstanding mine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
(or the rather for it, as taking my retreat for a confession of the charge) proceed
to present me to the Upper House for a Delinquent of so high a nature, as never came
so much as into my thoughts to be guilty of: In this case you shall doe well to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whether it will not be fit for you, most humbly to move his Majesty in favour of
me, to deale with some of the Lords best inclined to me, namely, the Lord Duke of
<hi>Lenox,</hi> the Lord Marquesse <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earle Marshall, Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> Lord <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi>
and others, not leaving out the Lord Chamberlaine, that my charge may be
set downe in writing, and that I may be permitted to make my answer to it; if this
may be granted, the next particular that will fall into consideration will be, how farre
his Majesty will please to advow me in the two great parts of the charge, namely, the
enlarging of Priests, and the procuring of bils of grace from his Majesty for stay of the
conviction of Recusants, and likewise for such letters as my selfe have written upon his
Majesties commandement, for stay of such indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ements: For the first of these there are
27. or 28. Bonds taken of such Priests as I have set at liberty, which Bonds you shall
doe well to shew his Majesty, being all taken by his speciall direction, and I doe not
remember that any have been delivered out of prison but such as are so bound, unlesse
perhaps some may have been taken out of the hands of those two Hell-hounds <hi>Gray</hi>
and <hi>Newton,</hi> that were disabled by the Lords from prosecuting Recusants, and this
at the instance of the Queen to his Majesty:<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> For the second namely, the stay of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
by Bils of grace and otherwise, they were all entirely moved and procured by
the Queens Majesty and some of her servants, and likewise of those neere his Majesty,
who had no small benefit by them, and I had nothing at all to doe with them, but in
the dispatch of some of those Bils which belonged to me as Secretary, and his Majesty
may please to remember, that before those Bils passed my hands, some of them were
made during life, which upon my motion to his Majesty and the representation
I made of that inconveniency, was altered, and they were granted but during pleasure,
&amp; so became revokable wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

further please to remember, that of late I did humbly represent to him the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to his revenue by these bils of grace, and besought him there might be a stop of
them, and I doe not remember that any have been granted these two or three yeers;
howsoever, I doe religiously professe I never moved in them,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> nor any other businesse
of Recusants, originally, nor without his Majesties speciall commandement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if I should not be advowed in all, my condition must be very hard: Neverthelesse
rather that his Majesty or his affaires shall suffer, I desire the whole burden may be
laid upon me, and though I have his Majesties hand for most of them and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

late, and so long after the delivery of all others, that I was in great paine and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
I should not have been made happy with the knowledge of the estate of
my poore Family this weeke, which would have added much to my sad thoughts: I
have now, I thanke God, received full satisfaction in that which I so much longed
for, and hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatsoever my other afflictions may be that I shall receive no other
newes of your healths during my absence from you:</p>
                  <p>There is little in your letters that requires answer; that onely concerning my charge
when it shall be made, is of consideration, which will require little answer, if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty

How many letters of grace were granted to the most noted Recusants to stay
all prosecutions and proceedings against them before and after their Inditements, you
may read in my <hi>Royall Popish Favourite,</hi> where many of them are recorded, and in
Master <hi>Glins</hi> report 1 Dec. 1640. in the Commons Journall, who reported to the
<hi>Commons House</hi> from the Committee concerning Secretary <hi>Windebanke, that there
were 64 Letters of grace to stay prosecution against Papists, directed to severall Officers
and Iudges, short entries whereof were made in the Signet-Office, and that his house was
the place of resort for Priests and Iesuits:</hi> Many of these letters of <hi>grace</hi> and discharges
of Priests were gained upon petitions to the King or Queene, presented to them by
this Secretary, in whose Trunks they have since been found. Among others, I find a
petition of the Lord <hi>Viscount Mountgarret</hi> (now one of the principal Rebels in <hi>Ireland)</hi>
and of his Ladies, with a draught of a letter of grace inclosed therin for the discharge of
all proceedings against them upon an inditement for Recusancy, found against them
both at <hi>Coventry,</hi> with other petitions of Recusants; as namely, of Master <hi>Richard Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
Master <hi>Tankred</hi> and others, for the abatement of their compositions made with
the King for Recusancy in the North, where the compositions of the Lord Viscount
<hi>Dunbarr,</hi> Master <hi>Anthony Metcalfe</hi> and <hi>William Green</hi> had formerly been abated;
Besides, those Recusants who compounded at low rates in the North (as you have seen)
got them abated lower afterwards, and obtained speciall protections from the
Commissioners against all future prosecutions, of which I shall give you but one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
at large, in the case of Sir <hi>Henry Merry.</hi>

where he was <hi>Dominus fac totum,</hi> whiles he was Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> having the
Lord <hi>Deputie, Councell, Bishops, and Clergie there at his owne becke, and devotion</hi> (as
appeares by sundry Letters thence;) but likewise into the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where
the Bishops and Court-Clergy were exceeding prone, but the other Ministers and
people very averse to entertain them. Whereupon he was no sooner warme in his
Arch-bishoprick, but he begins to set on foote his designes upon the <hi>Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
to which end he first practised to bring certain new orders, &amp; Ceremonies into

                  </p>
                  <p>My Lord, for the present the King is resolved upon some great reasons of State
which have prevailed with him, not to meddle with the Abbacy of <hi>Lindores,</hi> of
any other of that nature, as yet, but to leave them in that State, in which they now
are, till such time as he may consider the decrees and the Act or Acts of Parliament
which concerne them, And till he can finde a way to Order them better, both for
his owne profit, and the contentment of his people there, Assuring you in the
meane time that both in this, and all other businesse, hee will be very carefull both
of the credit and of the maintenance of the Church, whereof if your selfe or any
other Bishop or Clergie Men, shall make doubt, I am commanded to tell you that
therein, you will not onely doe His Majestie wrong, but hurt your selves, and the
Church which you seeke to benefit, And in this very particular, you are to know,
and make knowne to others, that it is not, the dislike of any person or persons, or of
the thing it selfe, that causes this present stay, but reason of State only, and the care
which the King hath, all proceedings may goe on, according to Law: As for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
his Majestie will take their wants into as provident care as he can, and hath
setled <hi>Arbroth,</hi> upon the Bishopricke of <hi>Brehen,</hi> but in what forme, I am not able
to tell you, as not being so well acquainted with the customes and constitutions of
that Kingdome, and therefore lest I should mistake in any circumstance, I leave
that wholly to the Bishops owne relation.</p>
                  <p>For all the businesse of that Church in future, which must come to the Exchequer
or any other publique audience, or any other businesse that may reflect upon the
Church, or any thing that belongs to the Kings service, in which Churchmen are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
you are immutably to hould this Rule, and that by his Majesties strict and most
speciall Command; Namely, that your selfe, or the Lord <hi>Rosse,</hi> or both of you together
doe privatly acquaint the Earle of <hi>Traquare</hi> with it, before it be proposed in publike,
either at the Councell Table,<note place="margin">Note.</note> or the Exchequor, or else where, and the Earle hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to the King in my presence, that he will strictly observe and hold the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respendency,
and course with you, and further, that he will very redily and faithfully
doe all good Offices for the Church, that come within his power according to all such
Commands, as he shall receive either immediatly from the King, or otherwise by
direction of his Majesty from my selfe;<note place="margin">Note.</note> and if at any time your Lordships, and my L.
<hi>Traquare</hi> shall upon any of the aforenamed businesse so differ in judgment that you
cannot accord it among yourselves, you are to let it rest, and write up either to his
Majesty or to my selfe, to move his Majesty for further direction, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> once received,
you are all to obey. That so this little unhapy difference which lately aros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on with the better successe, <hi>his Majesty precisely Commands, that this mutuall relation

                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>be kept very secret, and made knowne to no other
person, either Clergy or Lay, for the divulging of these things cannot but breed jealousies
amongst men and disservices in regard of the things themselves. And therefore the King
bids me tell you, that he shall take it very ill at his hand, who ever he be, that shall not strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe these his directions.</hi> This is all which I had in Command to deliver to you,
and I shall not mingle with it any particulars of my own; therefore wishing you all

                     </gap>rgy,
the Copy whereof is indorsed with his owne hand.</head>
                  <p>I Have received other Letters from you, by which I finde <hi>you have written to his
Majesty about the Communion in the Chappell Royall,</hi> concerning which the King
holds his former resolution; That he would be very glad there should be a full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
at all solemne times as is appointed. But because men doe not alwayes fitte
themselves as they ought for that great a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d holy worke, therefore his Majesty will be
satisfied if every one that is required to Communicate there, doe solemnly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
performe that action once a yeare at least, And in con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ormity to this, you
are to signifie once a yeare,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> unto his sacred Majesty, who have communicated within
the compasse of that yeare, and who not: And of this you must not saile.</p>
                  <p>By these last Letters of yours, I find that you are consecrated; God give you joy.
And whereas you desire a Coppy of our Booke of Ordination, I have heere s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt you
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99895:80"/>
one. And I have acquainted his Majesty <hi>with the two great reasons that you give, why
the Booke which you had in K. Iames his time is short and insufficient.</hi> As first, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
order of Deacons is made but as a Lay Office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at least, as that Booke may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
And secondly, that in the admission to Priesthood, the very essentiall words of
conferring Orders are left out. At which, his Majesty was much troubled, as he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
great cause, and concerning which, he hath commanded me to write, that either you
doe admit of out booke of Ordination, or else that you amend your owne in these
two grosse over sights, or any thing else, if in more it be to be corrected, and then see
the Booke reprinted. I pray faile not to acquaint my Lord of Saint <hi>Andrewes, and my
Lord Rosse</hi> with this expresse Command of his Majesty.</p>
                  <p>I received likewise from you at the same time certaine notes to be considered of,
that all, or at least so many of them, as his Majesty should approve, might be made
use of in your Liturgie, which is now in printing. And though my businesse hath of
late laine very heavy upon me, yet I presently acquainted his Majesty with what
you had written. After this, I and <hi>Bishop Wren (my Lord Treasurer being now otherwise
busied)</hi> by his Majesties appointment sate downe seriously, and considered of them all,
and then I tendred them againe to the King without out animadversio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> upon them,
and his Majesty had the patience to weigh and consider them all againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This done, so
many of them, as his Majesty approved, <hi>I have written into a service booke of ours, &amp; sent
you the book with his Majesties-hand to it, to warrant all your alterations made therein.</hi> So
in the printing of your Liturgie, you are to follow the Booke which my Lord <hi>Rosse</hi>
brought &amp; the additions which are made to the Book I now sent. But if you finde the
Book of my Lord <hi>Rosses,</hi> and this to differ in any thing that is materiall, there you
are to follow this later Booke, I now send, as expressing somethings more fully.</p>
                  <p>And now that your Lordship sees all of your animadversions, which the Kings
approved written into this booke, I shall not need to write largely to you, what the
reasons were, why all of yours were not admitted, for your judgement, and modesty
is such, that you will easily conceive some reason was apprehended for it. Yet because
it is necessary, that you know some what more distinctly, I shall here give you a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
accompt of some things which are of most moment, and which otherwise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
might breed a doubtfullnesse in you.</p>
                  <p>And first, I thought you could not have doubted but that the Magnificat, &amp;c. was
to be printed according to the Translation of King <hi>Iames,</hi> for that was named once
for all. And that translation is to be followed in the Epistles and Gospells, as well as in
the Psalmes. Where I pray observe in the Title-page of the Psalmes in the booke I
now send an alteration which I thinke my Lord <hi>Rosses</hi> booke had not. And if you
have not printed those Psalmes, with a Colon in the middle of every verse,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> as it is with
ours ordinarily in the English, it is impossible those Psalmes should ever be well sung
to the Organ. And if this error be run into, it must be mended by a painfull way, by a
pen for all such Bookes as the Chappell Royall useth, and then by one of them the
next impression of your Liturgie may be mended wholly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly in the Creed of Saint <hi>Athanasius.</hi> We can agree to no more emendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
no not according to our best Greeke Copies, then you shall finde amended in
this Booke.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly though the Bishops there were willed to consider of the Holy Dayes, yet
it was never intended but that the Office appointed for every of them, should be kept
in the Liturgie, and the consideration, was on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y to be of the observation of them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly for the sentences at the Offettorie. We admit of all yours, but Wee
thinke with all that diverse which are in our Booke would be retained together with
yours. As namely the 2d. 4th. 6th. 7, 8. 9. 10. 13. 14. 15.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I would have every Prayer or other Action through the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
named in the Rubrick before it,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> that it may be knowne to the people what it is,
as I have begun to doe in the Prayer of Consecration, and in the memoriall or Prayer
of oblation. <hi>Fac similiter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:99895:81"/>
Sixtly, We doe fully approve the Collect of Consecration and Oblation should
preceed, and the Lords Prayer follow next, and be said before the Communion, in that
order which you have exprest, but for the Invitation, Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssion, Absolution, Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Preface, and Doxologie, We thinke they stand best as they are now placed in our
Liturgie, and as for the Prayer of humble accesse to the holy Communion, that will
stand very well, next before the Participation.</p>
                  <p>Seaventhly, I have ordered a Rubrick in the Margin of this Booke according as you
desire, to direct him that celebrates when to take the Sacrament into his hand. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to take, and breake, and lay hands on the Chalice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he speakes the words. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly
the practise of the Church of England therein is very right. And for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
that we should not doe it till we expresse our Warrant so to doe, which you
conceive is in these words, <hi>Do this,</hi> &amp;c. I Answer, 1. That those words, <hi>Do this,</hi> &amp;c: are
rather our Warrant for the Participation, or Communication, then the Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
2. That our repeating what Christ did, is our Warrant to doe the same, being there
to commanded, 3. That the whole Action is <hi>Astus continuus,</hi> and therefore though in
our saying (<hi>Do this</hi>) followes after, yet it doth, and must be intended to that which
We did before; and comes last to seale and confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me our Warrant for doing so. And
so tis in the other Sacrament of Baptisme, where we take the Child first, and Baptise
it, and then afterwards Wee say, We receive this Child, &amp;c. Which in <hi>Actu continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
must needs relate to the preceeding act, for the Child was actually received into the
Church by the very act of Baptisme it selfe. And this is but our Declaration of that
Reception.</p>
                  <p>And Whereas you write, that much more might have beene done, if the times would
have borne it; I make noe doubt but there might have beene a fuller Addition. But
God be thanked this will doe very well, and I hope breed up a great deale of devout,
and religious pietie in that Kingdome. Yet I pray for my Farther satisfaction, at
your best leisure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Doctor <hi>Iohn Maxwell</hi> the late Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi> came to me from his Majesty. It
was during the time of a great sicknesse which I had, <hi>Anno</hi> 1629, (which is 11.
yeares since) The cause of his comming was to speake with me about a <hi>Lyturgie</hi> for
<hi>Scotland.</hi> At this time I was so extreame ill that I saw him not. And had death
(which I then expected daily) seased on me, I had not seene this heavy day.</p>

concerning a <hi>Lyturgie,</hi> that he was imployed about it, I told him I was cleare of

made by their owne Bishops, but withall that it might be according to the forme of
our English Booke, I added if this were the resolution, I would doe nothing till I
might by Gods blessing have health and opportunity to waite upon the King.</p>
                        <p>And heare give me leave (I humbly beseech you) to tell your Lordships, that this
was no new conceit of His Majestie to have a <hi>Lyturgie</hi> framed, and Canons made
for the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> For he followed the example and care in the businesse of
his Royall Father King <hi>Iam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>When I was able to goe abroad, and came to His Majesty, I represented all that
passed. His Majesty avoyded the sending of Doctor <hi>Maxwell</hi> to me, and the busines,
but then agreed to my opinion to have the English without alteration. And in this
case I held the busin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Bishops still pressing His Majestie that a <hi>Lyturgie</hi> made by themselves, and in some
things different from the English service would relish better with their Countrymen,
they prevailed with His Majestie at last to have it so, notwithstanding all I could say
or doe to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Then His Majesty commanded me to give the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> the best assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
I could in this way and worke. I delayed as much as I could with my Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
When nothing would serve but it must goe on, I did not only acquaint His
Majesty with it, but writ downe most of the amendment or alterations in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
presence. And doe hope there is no one thing in that Book which may not stand
with the Conscience of a right good Protestant.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Sure I am his Majestie approved
them all, and I have his warrant under his Royall hand for all that I did about that
Booke.</p>
                        <p>As for the way of introducing it, I ever advised the Bishops both in his Majesties
presence, and at other times, that they would looke carefully to it, and be sure to doe
nothing in any kinde but what should be agreeable to the Lawes of that Kingdome.
And that they should at all times as they saw cause, bee sure to take the advice of the
Lords of his Majesties Councell in that Kingdome, and governe themselves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
Which course if they have not followed that can no way (as I conceive) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon me. And I am able to prove by other particulars as well as this, that for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing concerning that Nation, I have beene as carefull their Lawes might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
as any man that is a stranger to them might be.</p>

alteration and insertion for the same purpose,</hi>
               <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> THOUGH IT BE LAWFULL
TO HAVE WAFER BREAD <hi>(which the Papists use)</hi> it shall suffice that
the Bread be such as is usuall. <hi>And whereas the old Rubricke was:</hi> If any of the Bread
and Wine remaine, the Curate shall have it to his owne use: <hi>It is thus altered in the new.</hi>
And if any of the Bread and Wine remaine which is consecrated, it shall be reverently
eaten and drunke by such of the Communicants only as the Presbyter which celebrates
shall take unto him: But it shall not be cursed out of the Church. And to the end there
may be little left, he that Officiates is required to consecrate with the least; and then if
there be want, the words of Consecration may be repeated againe, over more either Bread
or Wine, the Presbyter beginning at these words in the prayer of Consecration. Our
Saviour in the same night that he was betrayed tooke, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Finally in the commination against sinners, he hath made these insertions. <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

no doubt for which it was made.</p>
            <p>To conclude: Whereas there were <hi>diverse godly-prayers</hi> printed at the end of the
common Prayer Book after the Psalms, <hi>to be used for sundry purposes;</hi> some whereof
were made use of in private families, Morning and Evening; the Arch-Bishop gives
this direction in the Margin concerning the expunging of them, with his own hand.

My Lord, I have much a doe to read some words in your hand-wrig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

some things concerning that Kingdome, I understand not. Betweene these two if
I mistake any thing, I heartily pray you it may goe <hi>pro non scripto.</hi> And now for
Instance, I confesse I doe not well understand what that particular is at which my
Lord of St. <hi>Andrewes</hi> checks; but what ever it be, I am sorry his Grace will not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
debate it before it come in publike: Or since he cannot gaine his Commission
in Exchequer hee will take a course before the Commission of surrenders that may
bee prejudiciall to the Archbishoprick. For I hope hee will not thinke of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
way to particular persons with disadvantage to the publike.</p>
                  <p>His Majesties intention certainly is, that all mortifications to Bishopricks or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pious uses should have all immunities for the advantage of the Church that
may bee had. And if my Lord of Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> either by the Commission
to which His Majesties hand was gotten, or by valuation before the Commission of
surrenders, depart from the good of the Church in the particular of the Prio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, I
must be sorry for it, but certainly the Kings bounty must not be abused. Only I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
your Lordship looke carefully to it, that my Lord Arch-Bishop have no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
for it seemes exceeding strange to me, that any thing should be attempted by
him in this, that is not pregnantly for the Churches good.</p>
                  <p>For the Commission of surrenders, you know my opinion of it, and of whom I
learn'd it. And I hope before these Letters come to you, you will understand His
Majesties pleasure concerning that Commission from the Earle of <hi>Sterling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To your Lordships demands and desires, I give you briefly this answer.</p>
                  <p>First, I heartily thanke you that you are minded once more in a private way to
move my Lord Chancellour to alter his intended course by debate there, or from
hence (if there bee any use of me) and I heartily pray you so to doe. And if you
think fit, you may tell him, tis my desire as well as yours. For I have not at this time
written any one word of this businesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the Kings intentions for the laying the foundation of the Cathedrall
Church of Saint Andrewes, will in this way my Lord Chancellour now takes bee
wholly eluded, you must by all good and faire meanes prevent it. And if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so doe it, you must acquaint His Majestie with it before it be too late.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I doe hereby heartily pray you to stop all things which come to your
knowledge,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> if you finde the Church prejudged or any thing intended contrary to
the generall course introduced in favour of the Church. And I assure my selfe, that
His Majestie will thank you for the service.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Your Lordship did understand me right, and I am still of opinion, that
more care is to bee taken in the settling of all these Church businesses, for the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and advantage of the places themselves. And that course I beseech you
hold for those things which come within your power. And yet I shall still desire
the present incumbent may be considered also, where it may be without prejudice to
the place it selfe in perpetuity.</p>
                  <p>This hath been one of the heavyest Termes that ever I indured,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> and it seemes you
have had troubls enough. The best is, the remembrances which I last put into your

then if nothing can be said that shall make it appeare more beneficiall to that Church
then yet it doth to me, it may be with the better deliberation quite extinguished.
The truth is, at least as it appeares to me, in the present use of it, it is made a publicke
pretence to privat ends.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, J thinke you know my opinion how J would have Church-businesse ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
were I as great a Master of Men, as <hi>I</hi> thanke God, <hi>I</hi> am of things. Tis true the
Church as well there as else where hath beene overborne by violence both in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of maintenance, and jurisdiction.<note place="margin">Note.</note> But if the Church will recover in either of these
she &amp; her Governours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must proceed, not as shee was proceeded against, <hi>but by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
temper sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> must make the world see she had the wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but offer none. And since Law
hath followed in that King dome perhaps to make good that which was ill done, yet since a
Law it is, such a reformation or restitution would be sought for as might stand with the
Law, and some expedient be found out, how the Law may be by some just Exposition helped
till the state shall see Cause to abolish it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majesty takes it very ill that the businesse concerning the stablishment of the
Service booke hath beene so weakly caried, and hath great reason to thinke himselfe
and his Government dishonoured by the late tumult in <hi>Edenborow, Iuly</hi> 23. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expects that your Lordship and the rest of the honourable Councell set your selves
to it, that the Liturgy may be <hi>established orderly and with Peace,</hi> to repaire what hath
beene done amisse.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For his Majesty well knowes the Clergy alone have not power
enough to goe through with a businesse of this nature, and therefore is not very well
satisfied with them, either for the <hi>Omission, in that kind, to advise for assistance of his
Lords Councell, or for the preparation, or way they tooke.</hi> For certainly the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a weeke before, that on the next Sunday the prayers according to the Liturgy
should be read in all the Churches of <hi>Edenborow,</hi> was upon the matter to give those
that were ill affected to the service, time to communicate their thoughts, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate,
and provide against it, as it is most apparent they did.</p>
                  <p>Nor is his Majesty well satisfied w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th the Clergy, that they which are in authority
were not advertised, that they might attend the countenancing of such a service, so
much tending to the honour of God and the King. And I am verily perswaded if that
accident of the marriage of your Kinsman had not carryed your Lordship out of the
City that day, some things would not have beene altogether so bad, and my Lord pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
seale would have had the better assistance.</p>
                  <p>Neither was this the best Act that ever they did to send away their letters apart
without acquainting the Councell, that their advertisements might have come by
the same Messenger, together with their joynt advise, which way was best to punish
the Offendors, at least the prime and chiefe of them, and which to prevent the like
disorders. And after so long time of preparation to be to seeke who should read the
service is more then strange to me, unlesse they think such a businesse can do it selfe,
but his Majesty out of his piety and wisedome gave (by the Messenger which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
sent) such full directions both to the Lords of the Councell and the Lords of
the Clergy, as I hope will settle the businesse from further trouble. But the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which you have now sent up to the King, I have not yet seene.</p>
                  <p>Of all the rest, <hi>the weakest part was, the interdicting of all Divine service, till his
Majestyes pleasure was further known.</hi> And this (as also the giving warning of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing)
his Majesty at the first reading of the letters and report of the Fact, checked
at,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and commanded me to write so much to my Lord of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> which I did

of the service. For that were in effect as much as to disclaime the work, or to
give way to the insolency of the baser multitude and his Majesty hath commanded
me to thankyou for it in his name. <hi>But the disclayming the Book as any act of theirs (but,

a Liturgy &amp; it was time they had one. They did not like to admit of outs, but
thought it more reputation for them (as indeed it was) to compile one of their own,

will be better advised:<note place="margin">Note.</note> certainly they were very ill advised, when they spake thus at

the principall, presented to them <hi>August</hi> 23, 1637, containing some reasons against
receiving the Booke.</p>
            <p>MY Lords of secret Councell, Vnto your Lordships humbly mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es and shews;
We your subjects Master <hi>Alexander Henderson</hi> Minister at Lenchars, Master
<hi>George Hamilton</hi> Minister at Newbourne, and Master <hi>Iames Bruce</hi> Minister at
Kings-Barnes That where we were required of late by the Moderator of our Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
to receive two Copies of the new Booke of Common Prayer, and declaring
our selves willing each of us to receive any of the sayd Bookes to read, that wee
might know what it contained before we could promise to practise it; Alleadging
that in the matters of Godsworship, we were not bound to blinde obedience. It was
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99895:87"/>
refused by us and taken out of some of our hands; And yet we are now charged with
Letters of horning Decreed be your Lordships, upon a narrative that we have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the sayd Bookes out of curiosity and singularity. To provide each one of us
two of the sayd Bookes for the use of our Paroches; Which hath made us, who
were never before acquainted with any charge from Authority, and knowing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way so just and voyd of offence, to have recourse to your Lordships; Most
humbly entreating that the charge may bee suspended for the reasons following.
First, Because this Book is neither warranted by the authority of the generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
which are the Representative Kirke of this Kingdom, &amp; hath ever since the
Reformation given direction in matters of Gods Worship, nor by any Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which in things of this kinde, hath ever bin thought necessary by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and the Estates. Secondly, Because the liberties of the true Kirke, and the
forme of Worship and Religion received at the Reformation, and universally pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
since, were warranted by the Acts of the general Assemblies, and divers Acts of
Parliament; specially of the Parliament 1567, and the late Parliament 1633.
Thirdly, The Kirke of <hi>Scotland</hi> is a free and Independent Kirke, and her owne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
sould be most able to discerne, and direct what doth best beseeme our measure
of Reformation, and what may serve most for the good of the people. Fourthly,
It is not unknowne to your Lordships, what disputing, division, and trouble hath
beene in this Kirke, about some few of the maine Ceremonies contained in this
Booke, which being examined (as we shall be ready, a competent time being assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by your Lordships to shew) will bee found to depart farre from the forme of
worship &amp; Reformation of this Kirk, and in points most materiall to do all neer to
the Kirke of <hi>Rome;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> which for her Heresies in Doctrine, Superstition, and Idolatry
in worship, tyranny in government, and wickednesse every way, is als Antichristian
now as when we came out of her. Fifthly, The people have been otherwise taught
by us, and by our Predecessors in our places, ever since the Reformation, and so it is
likely they will be found unwilling to the change, when they shall be assayed, even
where their Pastors are willing. In respect whereof, The sayds Letters of horning
whole effect and execution thereof, ought to be suspended simpliciter in time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
Therefore we beseech your Lordships, that we may have Letters Direct,
charging the persons who have caused vse this charge against us, to compeir
personally, bring, and produce the sayd Letters of horning, with the executions and
indorsations thereof before your Lordships at a certaine day, to be seene and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of. And in the mean time to suspend them, And your Lordships Answer.</p>
            <p>The Copy of this Petition was sent up to <hi>London</hi> to the Archbishop, together
with the Answer of the Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi> thereunto; who received both of them
<hi>September</hi> 5, 1637. as appears by the endorsments under his own hand.</p>

understand thereby, the formes of Confession, Prayers, celebration of Baptisme,
and the Lords Supper, &amp;c. were committed in the time to some few Ministers, not
exceeding the number of Seven, as is cleare by the Psalme Booke, that beares the
number of the approvers. Whereas this Booke of Common Prayer committed in
the Assembly of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> Anno 1616. to some three or foure that since are decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

both in Marriage, Baptisme, Celebration of the Lords Supper, Visitation of the

of any fault upon your Grace, and the rest of your Brethren, as if the thing were
done precipitatly: I think few men will believe that. But that which is thought here, is,
that though you took advice among your selves, yet the whole body of the Councell was
not acquainted with all your Determinations, nor their advice taken, nor their Power called
in for assistance, till it was too late. And that after the thing was done, you consulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and sent up to the King without calling a Councell, or joyning the Lay-Lords with
you: whereas all was little enough in a businesse of this nature, and so much opposed by
some factious men gathered (it seems) purpos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

too far. And if any Lord here spake too much when he thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t the service might
have bin received throughout all that Kingdome in one day, I hope your Grace falls as
much too short on the other side. For I hope it will be setled in far l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sse time than 7. years.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you write, that the fault is m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be true: But then they should have bin dealt withall before hand and made plyable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in <hi>Edenborow,</hi> or els some others appointed in the roome of such as disliked.
And since your Grace is of opinion that a sharper course would do more good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
you would have taken such with Master <hi>Ramsey,</hi> if my Lords had not alter'd your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
His Majesty leaves you to take that course both with him and others, as you shall
finde fittest for his service, and the Churches. And for the Postscript, I am sorry as

                  <p>
                     <hi>I Have received your Letters of</hi> Aug. 20. <hi>And am very glad to read in them that mine
came safe to you by your servant: For the businesse, I had some little inkling given me
by</hi> my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Sterling</hi> about the stay of the service: But till I read your Letter, I did not believe it
possible that way should be given to an Interdiction, especially considering how strongly you had
ever opposed it; and withall how weak,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and uncounsellable (at least in my judgement) the
thing it selfe was. For they could not but fore-see, that that course would adde a great deale
of heartning and encouragement to the Puritan Party. And therefore tis no wonder, if such
Lords and others as were ill-affected to the Lyturgy, were easie in giving way to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
which they could not but see would advance to their own ends. But that my <hi>Lord of Rosse</hi>
should give the advice, and my <hi>L. of St Andrews</hi> follow it with such stifnesse, may be a wonder
to any man that knowes them, and the businesse.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Lord of St Andrews</hi> hath lately writtten to me, that my <hi>Lord of Rosse</hi> was gone
into his Diocesse. But for my part, I did not think that all the rest would have gone away
and left the businesse: For they cannot but think that the adverse part would make use of
the present time to put further difficulties upon the work; And therefore they should have
been as carefull to uphold it, my <hi>Lord of Rosse</hi> especially, whose hand hath been as much
in it as the most: But since they are gone, His Majesty takes it extremely well from my
<hi>Lords of Edenborow, Galloway, and Dunblane,</hi> that they stay and attend the businesse
as well as they can: But he hath expresly commanded me to give your Lordship thanks for
staying with them,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and keeping them so well in heart: For as the businesse is now foyled, if
you doe not stick close to Gods and the Kings service in it, it will certainly suffer more
then is fit it should.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty likewise takes it exceeding well from your Lordship, that you have dealt
with the City of <hi>Edenborow</hi> for maintenance for such as shall take upon them to read the
Lyturgy: And takes it as well from the City it selfe, from whom I have received a very
faire and discreet Letter, which I have shewed his Majesty, and writ the City an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
by this Returne, and given them His Majesties thanks, which indeed hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
mee to doe very heartily: And in truth they deserve it, especially as the
times stand.</p>
                  <p>As for the Ministers of <hi>Edenborow,</hi> I know the refusall of Mr <hi>Ramsay,</hi> and
Mr <hi>Rollock:</hi> But that any other of them stuck at it, or that any Bishops seeme not to be
forward, is more then I heard till now: But for that of Mr <hi>Ramsey,</hi> or any of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
that would have somewhat amended, if that should be yeelded unto now (unlesse they
should be able to give such reason against it,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as I know they cannot) it would mightily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonour
the King, who to my knowledge hath carefully lookt over, and approved every
word in this Lyturgy: And I doubt, it would utterly destroy the service it selfe: For whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
one man out of a humour dislikes one thing, and another another, by that time every mans
dislike were satisfied, I doubt there would be but little left to serve God with: Besides, it is
not improbable but that some men would bee as earnest to have the selfe same thing kept
in, which others would so f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine thrust out, what ere it bee: And that may make it grow
up into a formall contestation upon some particulars, and quite distemper the service. But
whereas you write that some Bishops speake plainely, that if their Opinions had been craved,
they would have advised the amending of some thing: Truly for that, and in that way I
would withall my heart they had seene it: And why my <hi>Lord of St Andrews</hi> and they
which were trusted by the King, did not discreetly acquaint every Bishop with it, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that every Bishop must be used in their severall Diocesses, I know no reason; and sure
I am, there was no prohibition upon them. And since I heare from others that some excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is taken, because there is more in that Lyturgy insome few particulars, then is in the
Lyturgy in <hi>England,</hi> why did they not then admit the Lyturgy of <hi>England</hi> without more
adoe? But by their refusall of that, and the dislike of this, 'tis more then manifest they
would have neither, perhaps none at all, were they left to themselves: But my Lord to your
selfe only, and in your eare; a great favour you should doe mee, if you will get my <hi>Lord
of Galloway</hi> to set me down in briefe Propositions without any further discourse, all the
exceptions that are taken against the Lyturgy by <hi>Ramsey, Rollock,</hi> or any other; and I could
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99895:89"/>
be content to know which the Bishops are, which would have amended something, had they
been advised with, and what that is which they would have so amended, &amp;c.</p>

How active and industrious both the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scottish Iesuites</hi> were in fomenting
the Scottish Commotions, Warres, upon what termes and designs the Papists promised

            <p>The 9. of <hi>September,</hi> 1638. The Arch-bishop received from some great man in

                        <p>SUch Lords and others as had lands and livings upon the Borders, were commanded
to reside there, with their retinue.</p>
                        <p>Those that had Castles neare the Borders, were enjoyned to fortifie them.</p>
                        <p>The Lords of the Kingdome were summoned by writ to attend the Kings Army
with Horse and Armour at a certaine time and place, according to their service due to
the King: or to repaire to the Exchequer before that day, there to make Fine for their
said service.</p>
                        <p>So were all Widowes Dowagers of such Lords as were deceased.</p>
                        <p>So were all Bishops and Ecclesiasticall persons.</p>
                        <p>Proclamations were likewise made by the Sheriffs in every County, that all men
holding of the King by knights service or sergeancy, should come to the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
or make Fine as aforesaid: with a strickt command that none should conceale
their service under a great penalty:</p>
                        <p>Like Proclamations were made, that all men having 40. l. land by the yeare, should
come to the Kings Army with Horse and Armour.</p>
                        <p>The Earle Marshall made a Roll, and entred the appearance of all such as came and
tendred their service.</p>
                        <p>If any failed to come, or to make Fine, their Lands, Tenements, Goods, and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
were distrayned by the Sheriffe upon summons out of the Exchequer.</p>

                           <pb n="173" facs="tcp:99895:90"/>
If any pleaded, that he had attended, he was discharged upon certificate out of the
Marshals Roll, testifying that he had done his service.</p>
                        <p>If any being come, did depart before the warre ended, their Lands, Tenements,
Goods, and Chattles were seized untill they had made Fine, or the King had pardoned
their offence.</p>
                        <p>Commissions went out for levying of men in every County, and bringing them to
the Kings Army.</p>
                        <p>Like Commissions were made for mustering and arraying the Clergy through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                        </p>
                        <p>Commissions were likewise issued to enquire and punish all Bayliffs, and other
Officers, that for reward had suffered Souldiers to depart before they came to the
Kings Army.</p>
                        <p>The King appointed certaine Captaines in such Counties as bordered upon <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to levie able men in those Counties, and to bring them with their Horse and
Armes to the Kings Army.</p>
                        <p>Those of the bordering shires were commanded to be ready at eight dayes war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to come unto the Kings Army well armed: and Commissions were made for
punishing such as refused.</p>
                        <p>Writs were sent into severall Counties for certifying the King what number of
Horse and Foot every County could afford him in his warres of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Clergy of <hi>England</hi> furnished the King with a proportion of armed men.</p>
                        <p>The Ports were summoned to attend with their service of shipping.</p>
                        <p>The Constable of <hi>Dover</hi> Castle was commanded to guard the Ports, lest any by
comming in or going out there, should bring danger to the Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>The Sheriffs of Counties were commanded by writ to make provisions of corne and
victuals for the Kings Army, and to cause them to be carried to the place appointed.</p>
                        <p>Writs also were sent to divers Townes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> commanding all
Merchants to bring provisions to the Kings Army.</p>
                        <p>Ships of the Subject were taken up for transporting those provisions to a place as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.</p>
                        <p>Inhibitions were made, that no victuals or other munition should be transported

                        <p>Divers Subsidies and Fifteens granted to the King by the Subject towards the war.</p>
                        <p>Merchants strangers gave the King ayde of money towards the warres of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and lent him divers summes.</p>
                        <p>Those of <hi>Wales</hi> furnished the King with a proportion of money toward the war.</p>
                        <p>The Lords and Clergy of <hi>Ireland</hi> were required to contribute toward the war.</p>
                        <p>The King suspended the paiment of his debts for a certaine time, in regard of the

That this Warrant was since forged by him, to which he procured the Kings hand,
is apparant, not only by the freshnesse of the inke, but by the very Letter he writ
to the Bishops of his Province to set on this Contribution, dated the last of <hi>Ianuary:</hi>
which mentions only the <hi>Lords Order,</hi> but not one syllable of this Warrant of the
King; which, if reall, he would have recited in the first place: His Letters were all
of this forme, two whereof I have signed with his own hand; and thus endorsed;
<hi>A Copy of those Letters which by Warrant from the Lords, I wrote to the severall

                  <p>I Have received an Order from the Lords of his Majesties most Honorable Privie-Councell,
giving me notice of the great preparations made by some in <hi>Scotland,</hi> both
of Armes, and all other necessaries for Warre. And that this can have no other end
then to invade, or annoy this his Majesties Kingdome of <hi>England:</hi> For his Majesty,
having a good while since most graciously yeelded to their demands for securing the
Religion by Law established amongst them, hath made it appeare to the World, That
it is not Religion,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but Sedition that stirres in them, and fills them with this most irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
disobedience, which at last breaks forth into a high degree of Treason against
their Lawfull Soveraign. In this case of so great danger, both to the State and Church
of <hi>England,</hi> your Lordship, I doubt not, and your Clergy under you, will not only
be vigilant against the close workings of any Pretenders in that kinde, but very free
also to your power and proportion of meanes left to the Church, to contribute
towards the raising of such an Army, as,<note place="margin">Note.</note> by Gods blessing, and his Majesties care,
may secure this Church and Kingdome from all intended violence. And according to
the Order sent unto me by the Lords (a Copy whereof you shall herewith receive:)
these are to pray your Lordship to give a good example in your own person; And
withall convenient speed to call your Clergy and the abler Schoole-Masters (as
well those which are in peculiars, as others) and excite them by your self, or such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
as you will answer for, to contribute to this great and necessary service, in
which, if they give not a good example, they will be much to blame. But you are
to call no poore Curats, nor Stipendaries, but such as in other legall wayes of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have been and are by Order of Law bound to pay. The proportion I know not
well how to prescribe to you, but I hope they of your Clergy, whom God hath
blessed with better Estates then ordinary, will give freely, and thereby help the want
of meanes in others: And I hope also your Lordship will so order it, as that every man
will at the least give after the proportion of three shillings tenne pence in the pound of
the valuation of his living,<note place="margin">Note.</note> or other preferment, in the Kings Books. And this, I
thought fit to let you further know, That if any men have double Benefices, or a
Benefice and a Prebende, or the like, in divers Diocesses; yet your Lordship must
call upon them onely for such preferments as they have within your Diocesse, and
leave them to pay for any other which they hold, to that Bishop in whose Diocesse
their other preferments are. As for the time, your Lordship must use all the diligence
you can, and send up the moneys, if it be possible, by the first of <hi>May</hi> next: And for
your Indemnity, the Lord Treasurer is commanded to give you such discharge, by stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Talley, or Talleys upon your severall payments into the Exchequer, as shall be
fit to secure you without your charge: And of this service you must not faile. So to
Gods blessed protection I leave you, and rest</p>

Conspiracies of some ill-affected in <hi>Scotland:</hi> These seditious persons

his Majesty hath graciously condescended to more then they could just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

goe on still, and are satisfied with nothing but their Rebellious Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,

this great and common danger cannot be kept off, but by a common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;

you also, that you calling to you the rest of the Doctors of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
propose to them now while most of them are together, this great

Upon these Letters of the Archbishop, the Bishops in each Diocesse summoned
their Clergie before them, exhorted them by publique speeches, to a liberall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
against the Scotish Rebels (as they stiled them) and Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> among other Motives, used this as a very effectuall one to excite
his Clergy to an extraordinary liberality towards the maintenance of this War,

            <p>How ready the Popishly affected Clergy were to contribute to this War, will
evidently appear by this Letter of Doctor <hi>Iohn Pocklington</hi> (who wrote <hi>Sunday no
Sabbath</hi>) to Sir <hi>Iohn Lamb,</hi> among whose Papers I found it.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>ON Thursday, and Fryday last, the Clergy met at <hi>Bedford,</hi> before Mr. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary,
Mr. <hi>Thorne,</hi> and my Self: We found them willing to contribute as
much as was propounded; The poorest that gave any thing at all, gave no lesse
then 3. s. 10. d. in the pound, without deduction of Tenths: The most gave after
4. s. some after 5. s. some after 6. s. in the pound: Much of the money is paid in,
and I suppose it will be all in Mr. Commissaryes hands by the 26. of this moneth
the day appointed for the payment. I doubt not but the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> will
teach the Ministers of <hi>Scotland</hi> Duty and Obedience; And if their Laity will be
taught the like by ours, His Majesty I hope will have a royall and joyfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
into <hi>Scotland;</hi> which God grant.</p>
                  <p>At this meeting I understood that Doctor <hi>Mickle-thwait</hi> is the man in nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for <hi>Sandy:</hi> He is my old acquaintance, and very good friend, whom I love
with all my heart, for I take him to be a right man for the Church; and if it might
please God that he might be better accommodated neerer his own meanes, I
thinke we should mutually rejoyce.</p>
                  <p>No parsonage of <hi>England</hi> could sit me better then <hi>Sandy:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> It is of good value, it
would draw me out of that corner where my stirring for the Church-rights makes
me lesse acceptable with some great hands: It brings me into the neighbour-hood
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99895:94"/>
of my best friends, Doctor <hi>More,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Martin,</hi> and sets me within a small
distance of <hi>Bedford,</hi> where I shall be ready at hand to assist any service for the
Church and King, though I am not ignorant that my devotion that way hath done
me no great good amongst some, no meane ones; and paradventure Mr. <hi>Thorne</hi>
may suffer a litle for such imployments.</p>
                  <p>To Mr. <hi>Thorne</hi> I shewed your Letter, and he shewed me <hi>Wallingers</hi> Petition
to the Lords; To him I spake nothing at all about it; but I beseech you give me
leave to vent my thoughts of it to you: The hands that delivered it may be a
Commoners of <hi>Bedford;</hi> but the head that devised it, hath the countenance of a
Commissary, rather then a Commoner of that Town; the inditer maketh familiar
use of divers words that come not within the Cognisance, nor liberty of the Town
of <hi>Bedford:</hi> Their Charter surely reacheth not to take up errors and strayes of
youth, that are laid hold on at <hi>Oxford;</hi> I am afraid that some retainers to the
Commissaryes Court cast an evill eye upon him, because it is like enough he may
cast an eye upon some evill, that may be done there.</p>
                  <p>I shall not easily beleeve that either <hi>Smith</hi> late vicar of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> or <hi>Collyer</hi> have
trayned up their Auditors to be so zealous to have the King prayed for according
to Canon. I would to God they and all the Churches of <hi>England</hi> might be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a Prayer for the Kings happy journey, and joyfull return out of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
to see how zealously they would pray for the conversion, or confusion of their
own Faction, and how they would make the Pulpits ring with invectives against
Puritan Rebellion and Traytors, which as yet are silent enough. When Treason
and Rebels is with like zeale detested, and declaimed against in Puritans, as in
Papists; I shall beleeve there is some Religion and Piety in that Generation.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you will pardon me if I am thus profuse and loose with you; where I have
not a window to the heart, I am reserved and close enough. Thus with remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of my due respects and best wishes, I rest,</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>At your service ever to be commanded,
<hi>John Pocklington.</hi>

            <p>The King asisted with these Contributions, raised an Army, and marched into
the<note n="*" place="margin">See the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate of the Archbishops life; page 22:</note> North against the <hi>Scots,</hi> departing from <hi>London</hi> North-ward March 27. 1639,
and through Gods blessing on the 17, of Iune following, a happy Pacification
and Agreement was concluded and ratified between His Majesty and His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thereupon the Armies disbanding, and all parties returned
home with much joy and contentment.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Canterbury</hi> upon his Majesties return, disliking the Articles of Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
as prejudiciall to the Lordly Prelacie, and giving overmuch Ecclesiasticall
Iurisdiction to the generall Assembly of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was very much discontented
and offended at this happy Pacification, stiling, it <hi>a very dishonourable Peace to
His Majesty, and exceeding prejudiciall to the Church;</hi> telling His Majesty, that
it was made <hi>by a company of hunting Lords, who regarded their own sports and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
more then His Majesties honor, or the honor and safety of the Church and
Realm;</hi> and by his violent importunity, caused His Majesty to dissolve and Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
the Pacification, as dishonorable; And by Proclamation dated August 11.
1639. to call in some papers dispersed concerning the Pacification, as scandalous,
ordering them to be publikely burnt by the hand of the common Hangman,
ingaging His Majesty in a new resolution to subdue the <hi>Scots,</hi> and establish both
a Lordly Prelacy and Liturgy amongst them, by force of Armes.</p>
            <p>Which being resolved on by the perswasion of <hi>this Arch-Incendiary,</hi> he thereupon
projects and resolves upon new wayes of raysing moneys without a Parliament by
way of <hi>Loane,</hi> and thereupon combines with <hi>Windebank</hi> to send for severall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
Iudges, Servants of the King and Queen, and others before the Lords of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99895:94"/>
the Councell, to lend such fums of money towards the raysing of a new Army,
and maintaining of a new War against the <hi>Scots,</hi> as he was pleased to prescribe.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, in November 1639. by the Arch-bishops directions and procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
divers Persons were sent for before the <hi>Councell Table</hi> to lend and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
towards the maintenance of this civill Warre, on whom they imposed seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

            <p>How much of these sums were lent or contributed I cannot certainly define,
but on April 13. 1640. the Parliament called about the Scots assembled, wherein
many Subsidies were demanded to be presently granted and levied before any
grievances redressed: in conclusion after much debate, the Parliament on the 5. of
May was suddenly dissolved, and no Subsidies given; but then the Convocation
was continued by the Archbishops means; who granted the King a large Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

patience, dexterity, and courage; If the end whither one would go cannot be

This Towne of Newcastle I beleeve may be fortified in such manner as that an

that will be to the King is, that the Country will be better assured if they have a

this benefit will arise to <hi>the King, that he may make this a constant Revenue to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;</hi>
they will I beleeve be brought to doe this willingly for their owne safety,
which they will never know how to put off from themselves, and it will be a
faire example for others to follow; if you will get it resolved on while the power
that I have here doth continue, which will not now that the Army is comming
hither be long, I will doe my best to get it effected; If you think this to be out
of your way, I desire your pardon for giving you the trouble; but knowing you
to be faithfull to the Kings service, and not knowing very many that would be
sincere in a Proposition for the King to lay any imposition, I did thinke it a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

made without the Walls, for the safety of the Town of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle,
which will require a great charge both for the erecting and
keeping the same; For the raising of Moneys to that purpose, these
four Propositions are to be considered of:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IMprimis, Whereas this new Corporation of Masters of Ships, have imposed
of every severall Master who shall carry Coales, from either <hi>Newcastle</hi> or
<hi>Sunderland</hi> the payment of 2. <hi>d. per.</hi> Cha. of Coals so carried; which doth
amount unto 1300. l. <hi>per annum</hi> at least, which they say is for the maintenance of
their Corporation: Now forasmuch as the moneys thus paid doth arise forth of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99895:96"/>
the purses of those, which are owners of Ships according to their severall parts,
of which number aboundance of them are no members of that Corporation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought not to be Assessed for this purpose: It is therefore desired, that this
2. d. <hi>per.</hi> Cha. henceforth may be paid for two or three years, or as long as need
shall be for the use above mentioned, and then quite to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urcease; it being both
reasonable and just, that moneys thus raised should be imployed for the publique
good, and not for any particular society. And in case it be alledged, that they
have spent much moneys in procuring their Pattent to be a Corporation; It may
be answered, they have received these moneys two years already, which is more
then they can have expended; and besides, they have and do still receive a Mark at
least of every one they make free, which doth arise to a great sum of Moneys, for
they make many free every yeer.</p>
            <p>2. That as much be paid upon every Chaldron of Coal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for the same use, by
those who sell the same, for the same time and no longer.</p>
            <p>3. That there be as much paid upon every Chaldron of Coals, which is laden
from <hi>Sunderland,</hi> both by the seller and buyer as is paid at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and during
the same time; for otherwise all the small Ships will go from that place,
which will hurt <hi>Newcastle</hi> very much and be distastefull.</p>
            <p>4. That all common Brewers, and all others who brew strong Ale or Beere to
sell, shall pay so much of every Tun, as shall be thought fitting: And likewise all
those who sell Tobacco.</p>

they meane to fall into <hi>Cumberland,</hi> but I am slow in answering the spurre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the advertisement of the Scotch preparations on this side are not such as that
they may be much feared as yet: In my opinion the <hi>Scots</hi> will not come into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but least they should goe against the rules of right reason, I doe provide as
if they were comming: The horse are now come to the <hi>North part</hi> of Yorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,
into <hi>Cleveland,</hi> the foot about <hi>Selby</hi> were disorderly, and tooke out of
Prison those that were committed; but now a Guard is set upon the prison, and
they begin to be better in order.</p>
                  <p>One thing I will tell you, and shall desire that you will speake with my Lord
Lieutenant in it: I did write to him of it, but I have not heard any thing from him,
so that I thinke that in his sicknesse, beleeving that my Letter did only containe
newes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he did not reade it; the businesse is this; My Lord of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
did write to me, that having had occasion to looke into the power he
hath to give Commissions, the Lawyers and Judges are all of opinion that Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Law cannot be executed here in <hi>England,</hi> but when an enemy is really neare to
an Army of the Kings, and that it is necessary that both my Lord of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and my selfe doe take a pardon for the man that was executed here for the
mutiny; if this be so, it is all one as to breake the Troopes, for so soone as it
shall be knowne there will be no obedience; therefore put some remedy to this
by all meanes very speedily: there are now here in prison two men for killing
of men, and the Provost Martiall for letting them scape out of Prison, although he
tooke them againe: I doe forbeare to call them to a Court of Warre, neither

and other Forces of that County to march and to serve in the common defence
in this time of publique danger, which delayes have been occasioned through some

preventing of further delay in matters of this importance, hereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

your Lordships, that not only the Customes and Laws of this Kingdom do require,
that in a time of actuall Invasion, every man ought to serve in the common defence
at his own charge, but that the very Law of Nature doth teach and oblige us all
thereunto without sticking or staying upon any terms or questions. And that
it hath been the Custome and practice within this Kingdom both in ancient and
modern times, (even but when a doubt or fear was had of an Invasion) is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.
But this present danger is past all manner of doubt, by reason of actuall
Invasion of the Scotish Rebels with so great an Army, and the same so far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that the whole Kingdom may soon be over-run, unlesse by a great power they
be repelled and beaten back.</p>
                  <p>And whereas His Majesties Subjects of the North parts of this Kingdom do
cheerfully hold together, and serve His Majesty in this great occasion at their own
charge, both with their Bodies and Fortunes without trouble to His Majesty.
We have therefore thought good hereby to pray and require your Lordships, to
acquaint the Country with the sence of this Boord in this particular, and that
We doubt not but His Majesties Subjects of that County, will in this occasion
shew as much forwardnesse and zeal for the common safety wherein We are all
so neerly concerned, as is either shewn now in the Northern parts, or hath been
practised in any other time of danger heretofore in this Kingdom. Which We
do hereby effectually recommend to your Lordships care, and bid your Lordship
very heartily farewell.</p>

DONE BY AN ARMY, and BY FIRE AND SWORD. This
<hi>Smith</hi> usually frequented <hi>Lambeth</hi> house, and <hi>Windebanks</hi> Lodgings, with whom
he was very familiar, and was no doubt a great stickler in raising the Scottish
Tumults, and fomenting that war, as well as other Iesuits: to further which and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Catholick cause, the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> of France unexpectedly came over
into <hi>England,</hi> and landed at <hi>Harwich</hi> about the 19. of October, 1638. This war was
no sooner resolved on by the King, by the Archbishop and his confederations insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
but the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> with the Priests, Iesuits, and Roman Catholicks
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> (all privy to the plot) assembled together in a kind of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
or generall Counsell of State, at <hi>London</hi> in Aprill, 1639. In which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
(convened by the Queens command) <hi>Con,</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> sate President,
where (in imitation of the Bishops and Clergies forementioned Contributions

                  <p>THat it is well known unto this Honourable Court,
that there are many thousand Apprentices in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with whom their Parents, and friends have given
some two hundred pounds, some more, some lesse sums
of Money to Merchants, or other Tradesmen in <hi>London,</hi>
who are bound for severall tearmes of yeares, to be trained
up in their severall Callings. That at the end of their
Apprentiship, they might exercise their Trades according
to the Custome and Charter of the City of <hi>London.</hi> That
by reason of the great number of Monopolies, Patents,
and Impositions upon Commodities and Manufactures,
the Trade of the City is so burthened, that to the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
knowledge, divers of their Masters are not able
to live of their Trades, to maintain themselves and their
families. That many Factors and others have been made
free by Redemption, together with the liberty that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners
use in this City; contrary to the Custome and
Lawes in that case Ordained and Provided, whereby
your Petitioners evidently perceive, that they are deprived
of all hope to live by their calling, and that the freedome
of this City will not be a benefit, but a burthen to them,
unlesse some speedy course be taken for redresse. Further
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99895:103"/>
sheweth: <hi>That by the multitude of Papists, Priest, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
residing in and about this City, many weak in Learning,
and young in understanding, are subject by their subtill delusions
to be drawn away to Romish Religion. That many feares are upon
us by reason of their audatious and insolent carriages, and demeanor
in speeches, and their furnishing themselves with Armes, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ruine of this City, which hath been famous for exercise of
Trade and Religion.</hi>
                  </p>

due and serious consideration, and to be pleased to the future encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and lively-hood of the Petitioners (who are the inferiour members

the evills and feares afore specified may be removed, and others in your

                  <p>THe Pope his Catarre arguing a multiplicity of humors dangerous in 74. yeers

and to him, to make serious instance with the Pope for a Creation, lest some
sudden sicknesse portended by those Catarres, prevent him. This makes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants

there would not be much improbability in it, the creation importing the Pope and

                  <p>I affirmed not, <hi>that I had leave of his Majesty to follow that particular businesse,

            <p>First, concerning the first, the whole Christian world doth acknowledge
the prediction which the Vniversity of <hi>Paris</hi> doth foresee in two severall
Decrees they made, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1565. where the society of <hi>Iesuits</hi> did labour to be
members of the Vniversity:<note place="margin">Note.</note>

Reipublicae et subvertionem literarum:</hi> that is, This society is erected to be
the overthrow of Christendome and ruine of Learning, as wofull experience
hath taught us.</p>
            <p>They were the onely cause of the troubles, which fell out in <hi>Muscovia,</hi> when
under pretence to reduce the <hi>Latine Church,</hi> and plant themselves and destroy
the <hi>Greek Church</hi> (which is onely profess't in the Empire of <hi>Russiae</hi>) the poor
King <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his <hi>Queen,</hi> and those that followed him from <hi>Polonia,</hi> were
all in one night murthered, by the monstruous usurper of the Crown, and the
true Progeny rooted out.</p>
            <p>They were the onely cause that moved the <hi>Swedes,</hi> to take Armes against their
lawfull King, <hi>Sigismund,</hi> and chased him to <hi>Poland;</hi> and neither he nor his
successors were ever able to take possession of <hi>Sweden;</hi> For the Iesuits inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was to bring in the Romish Religion, and root out Protestants. They were
the onely cause that moved the <hi>Polonians</hi> to take Armes against the said <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismund,</hi>
because they had perswaded him to marry too Sisters, one after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
both of the House of <hi>Austria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have been the sole cause of the Warre entered in <hi>Germany,</hi> since the year,
1619. as <hi>Pope Paulus Quintus</hi> did tell the Generall of their Order, called <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescus,</hi>
for their Avarice, pretending to take all the Church-Lands from the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits</hi>
in <hi>Bohemia</hi> to themselves; which hath caused the death of many thousands,
by the Sword, Pestilence, and Famine in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have been the cause of civill Warres in <hi>France,</hi> during all which time
moving the French King to take armes against his own Subjects the Protestants,
where innumerable people have lost their lives, as the Seige of <hi>Rochell</hi> (and other
places) will give sufficient proof: For the Iesuits intentions were to set their
society in all Cities and Townes Conquered by the King; and quite to abolish
the Protestants.</p>
            <p>They were the cause of the murther of the last King of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were the only Projectors of the <hi>Gunpowder-Treason,</hi> and their Penitents
the Actors thereof.</p>
            <p>They were the only cause (namely Father <hi>Parsons</hi> that incensed the <hi>Pope</hi> to
send so many fulminate <hi>Breeves</hi> to these Kingdomes, to hinder the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
and lawfull obedience to their temporall Prince, that they might still

               </gap>agems which they use with their Penitents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

will inspire them: And there be some of them that make no Conscience

which for the most part were composed of younger Brothers, who at their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
sold their Lands and Annuities, and gave them their moneys; assuring
them that they should lose nothing; and get all again: But when they came in
their great necessities, and demanded it, they absolutely refused them; and so
they saw the most part of those younger Gentlemen perish for want, in Hospitals.</p>
            <p>The like they did with above two hundred Gentlewomen of good extraction,
whom they seduced, and got from them their portions; the least having a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds (for lesse they would not take) and when they came to <hi>Flanders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> they
were committed to the charge of Mistresse <hi>Mary Ward,</hi> who forced them to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
with their hands, and live in great misery with bread and water: And at
last (like gallopping Nuns) made thirty of them to take their Iourney to <hi>Rome</hi>
and <hi>Naples,</hi> and there to teach young Children: When it came to the <hi>Popes</hi>

knowledge, he made a thundring Bull against them, either to enter into a Monastry,
or else within fifteen dayes to depart the Territorirs of <hi>Rome,</hi> and within forty
dayes all <hi>Italy;</hi> but afterwards this Bull was retracted.</p>
            <p>The Colledge of Saint <hi>Omers</hi> is no lesse memorable, which was erected by <hi>Pope
Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, and partly indowed by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with great
meanes: The <hi>Iesuits</hi> neverthelesse (insatiable cormorants) have by their allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
got great wealth from <hi>England</hi> under pretence to nourish some Students,
which in time might labour in this Vineyard; some by Testament, others by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
have left meanes to bring up, some two, some three, and payd twenty five,
and thirty pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> But since, they are not willing to undergo the toil
to take it yeerly, but have enticed the Donators to give them, some three, some four,
and some five hundred pounds; and in my knowledge they got in this manner for
nourishing above two hundred; so that they have extorted and got great sums of
money from this Kingdome, to the great prejudice of the State.</p>
            <p>The wise State of <hi>Venice,</hi> foreseeing their ambition to creep into the knowledge
of their Government,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and to Conquer high Territories by tricks, unlawfull means,
and sleights: By Order of their great Councell, they were adjudged to be banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for ever their Dominions, and never to return thither till they had the consent
of the whole Senate, which is impossible to be obtained, although the French King
and the <hi>Pope</hi> have laboured sundry times, yet in vain. And also the said State did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
That whosoever should speake in their favour (for their re-establishing)
should be degraded of his Honor, and his Posterity after him, and loose all his
goods; and the like should befall to them that send their children to their colledges.</p>
            <p>Would to God such Lawes were made in these Dominions, severely to punish
the Parents for sending their Children to Iesuits Colledges: And to conclude, they
should be expelled from all humane society, as unsit to be dealt with, for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation
and mentall reservation; never telling the truth, being mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to all charity, and the true fore-runners of Antichrist, oppugning all verity, and
taking all for themselves without Communication of good to others: And as for
those that are beyond Seas in their Colledges, it were more then necessary, to make
a Decree, that within a short time prefixed, they should return to their Native
soil, under pain of perpetuall banishment; and their Parents to lose their goods
and estates. As also to enquire and learne who they be that do live now at <hi>Doway,</hi>
and <hi>St. Omers</hi> under them, and their Parents be brought in question, which may
easily be done with small charges; sending two or three over into those parts, who
by degrees may know the speciall of them: I omit their jugling with the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Potentates, and with the <hi>Popes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as they have publiquely confest,</p>
            <p>Secondly, not to be tedious, I come to the second point: The reformation of some
things in her Majesties Court,<note place="margin">Note.</note> is so necessary for the quietnesse of the State, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more; and therefore labour to remove all impediments that may happen.</p>
            <p>It is to be observed, that a great part of the unquietnesse of this State comes
from thence;<note place="margin">Note.</note> and of some persons about Her Majesty not fit to remain there;
For it is known, Her Majesty doth nothing but as she is acquainted with, which
she after delivers to the King, and he to the Councell, and when there's any cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
there arises Iarres and unquietnesse.</p>
            <p>The actors of those are <hi>F. Phillips,</hi> her Confessor, &amp; the superior of the Capuchins.</p>
            <p>This last, in times past, was one of the Knights of <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a
most turbulent spirit,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and one sent by <hi>Cardinall Richlien,</hi> to be a spye at this Court
for the <hi>French Faction,</hi> who labours by all means to breed dissentions.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>French</hi> (as I have read in <hi>Cardinall D'Ossats</hi> Epistles) aime at nothing
more then to make a schism betwixt the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> that this state may be
weakned &amp; not able to do them harm, the more easily to conquer these kingdoms.</p>
            <p>This unquiet spirit at all occasions, hath accesse to Her Majesty, and acquaints.
Her with all he thinkes fit for the <hi>French Faction,</hi> and when he thinkes it
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99895:106"/>
a hard businesse, then doth he entice <hi>Father Phillips</hi> to present it. This man being
of a quiet and meeke nature (yet a great Favourite of <hi>Cardinall Richliens</hi>) Doth
acquaint her Majesty with the businesse,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and she the King, and obtains by oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
things which are not fit and convenient for the State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Father Phillips,</hi> is guided altogether by a <hi>Scottish Grey Fryar,</hi> (who by degrees
hath intruded himselfe to be a Clerke of her Majesties Chappell) and he goes by
the name of <hi>Master Wilson,</hi> but his true name is <hi>William Tompson,</hi> a Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
and a most furious and unqviet spirit, and by a nick-name was called <hi>Cacka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugo</hi>
shit fire; He rules altogether <hi>Father Phillips,</hi> insomuch as he fears him, and
dares not disobey him. He rules all the busines which concernes the two Kingdoms,
and the most part of the matters for <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his perswasion, <hi>Father Phillips</hi> hath plac'd many unfit persons about her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
He was the only Agent in promoting Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> to be her Majesties

so got into that place.</p>
            <p>He was also the cause that <hi>Signior Georgio Conne</hi> (late Agent of the <hi>Pope</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
was admitted to be extraordinary Servant to the Queen;<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> A man altogether
unworthy of that place, and a most scandalous person, having at this present three
wives alive, as after shall be related; Sundry Priests by his means (to <hi>Father Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi>)
have been admitted to be the Queens extraordinary Servants; Some, by some
supposed office or other, as one Master <hi>Laborne,</hi> &amp; <hi>George Gage</hi> (brother to Colonell

(who are all factious and turbulent spirits) by <hi>Father Phillips</hi> means, and this

            <p>
               <hi>Father Phillipt</hi> his servant, called <hi>Iohn Belfaur</hi> a Scot, rules all the rest, and guides
<hi>Father Phillipt</hi> at his pleasure, and obtains many things not lawfull.</p>
            <p>It is not expedient at this present, to remove <hi>Father Phillips</hi> from her Majesty, it
will irritate her greatly, but remove all those that incense him: he is a very good
man, and of a sweet disposition, but easily perswaded, by Sir <hi>Toby Matthewes,</hi> Sir

            </p>
            <p>That same time he did move his Majesty to make that Church a <hi>Cathedrall,</hi> and

            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:99895:107"/>

to all the Bishops of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who being blowne up with pride (follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Archbishops footsteps) began to erect a <hi>High-Commission</hi> Court in their
Diocesses, and called to it the Gentry and Nobles, punishing them for trifling
things; and sining and confining them to the farthest part of the Kingdom, from
<hi>Galloway</hi> to <hi>Cathnes,</hi> neare three hundred myles. A cruelty never practised in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
before in any Age.</p>
            <p>Nay, the became so insolent, <hi>being made Privy Councellours (by the Archbishops
sollicitation of His Majesty,)</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> And the <hi>Archbishop of Saint Andrews,</hi> being made
great <hi>Chancellor of that Kingdom</hi> (never practised this three hundred years) <hi>that in

of <hi>Argile;</hi> which affront was done by one <hi>Sedeserfe</hi> now <hi>Bishop of Galloway,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
at this present in London, where began the fire to appeare, which before this
was but smoake.</p>
            <p>The Nobles, Gentry, and Commons made a league, which they called a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and combined together for the rooting out of Bishops, and Conservation of
their ancient Liberties, upon which is ensued a million of miseries, putting both
the Kingdomes to excessive charges, exhausting the Kings Coffers, and oppressing
the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I believe, If my Lord</hi> Archbishop were meerly questioned, it would be found, he stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up His Majesty to make up his Army two severall times,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which hath bin the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

which losse will not be repaired in an hundred years.</p>
            <p>These firebrands Bishops of <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Rosse,</hi> who are Clyents to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and
altogether guided by him; it is more than expedient that they and other Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aties
were given to the <hi>Scotts Commissioners</hi> to betryed by their Parliament. But I
believe <hi>Rosse</hi> will flye to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where His Majesty hath given him a <hi>Bishopricke:</hi>
And <hi>Galloway</hi> will be forced to hide himself in some <hi>Island</hi> and shake off his Robes,
or become a Pedler in <hi>Poland,</hi> as his Father was before him.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Sandall,</hi> a Clerke of the Rolls told me, he saw my Lord <hi>Sterling,</hi> Secretary
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (Agent at Court for the <hi>Bishops</hi>) viewing very narrowly the Rolls, to

then began he to erect Altars, to take away the Communion Table, to make all kneel when
they tooke the Sacrament, to be all uncovered at Divine service, to stand up at the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

against Puritan Ministers, <hi>calling</hi> them into his high Commission some for Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

others for Heresy, <hi>as one Doctor</hi> Everd, <hi>Chaplin to the Earle of</hi> Holland.</p>
            <p>Then began he to practise his Excommunications and aggravations against Sir
<hi>Robert Willoughby</hi> (Sonne in Law to the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi>) and Mr. <hi>Hope</hi> a Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
man, Cup-bearer to his Majesty, for contemning his Citations. In the end,
such were his Actions, that <hi>he is an Admiration to the whole world for Inconstancy.</hi> At
the last he became soe outragious, as were never any of his Predecessors, conventing
before him the Bishop of <hi>Lincolne;</hi> whose heavy hand and Dragon-like wrath hee

            <p>Tis a petious thing worthy of consideration to see, what Injustice is don in that
Court by his owne knowledge; and what extortion and exaction is used by his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.
There is not a more corrupt Court in the world, wherein Innocency is punished,
&amp; publique sinnes countenanced; the greatnes of the extortions of that Court cannot

Benediction, are remitted to Sir <hi>Iohn Lambe</hi> and Doctor <hi>Ducke,</hi> I will instance in
two parties.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Willoughby</hi> spent in suit in lesse then two yeares (as shee related to me)
five hundred pound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and above, and all tended, that her Husband should weare a
white sheete at the Church doore. When [God knowes] her selfe deserved no lesse; For
Doctor <hi>Ryves</hi> assured me, she was declared innocent by Bribery.</p>
            <p>The other was Mr. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> Nephew to the Earle of <hi>King stone,</hi> who claimed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Lady to be his Wife, having married her before two witnesses, and used the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
words of Matrimony; And seene by the said witnesses lye together in naked bed;
yet by force of money he was divorced from her, having spent in the suit, in Charges
only, three hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>In like sort <hi>Francis Conne</hi> [brother to <hi>Signiour Georgio Conne</hi>] now Cup-bearer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
to her. Majesty, was convented at the high Commission, for having <hi>mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one Mistresse Steward,</hi> his Country Woman in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had maried another,
(one <hi>Mistresse Wiseman</hi>) in <hi>England,</hi> with whom he cohabited here in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scottish Woman claymed him, but she being poore and none to protect her,
after two yeares suite he was declared to be <hi>Wisemans</hi> husband, money was his Cause
for himselfe assured me, it cost him in gifts, feasting his Advocates and Clerks, above
150. pounds. What intollerable Injustice was this, it being notoriously knowne that
the <hi>Scottish Woman</hi> was his wife?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:99895:108"/>
The chiefe Extortioners are, the Registers of the Court, <hi>Stephen Knight,</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
(Brother in law to <hi>Sir Iohn Limbe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When his Grace foresawe, the Parliament would call them in question, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
deposed them, and made the said Knight principall Proctor in his Court, who
fearing to be questioned for the same misdemeanours fled with his whole Family to
<hi>Norwitch,</hi> and there bought of that Bishop the Registers office, and so is like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his accustomed trade of extortion, except this Honourable Court call him coram
to answer his innumerable oppressions which are to be seene in the Registers booke of
the high Commission.</p>
            <p>He hath two bonds of mine, and two letters of Atturney made by me to him; His
ordinary course was this, to take for every one twenty shillings, for that he should
have had but two shillings sixpence, which extended to a great summe in the yeare;
And out of Terme he had Fees for six Clerkes, and so many Promoters, which went
throughout England, plaging the poore, and inriching themselves and their Master
Knight.</p>
            <p>Likewise, the other extortioner was <hi>Bonnyragge,</hi> the greatest Knave in the Country;
For money he would doe any thing; He carried in his Pouch a number of Citations,
and when he pleased for money dismissed any one; <hi>A Master Quashet, Mr. Smith</hi>
the Iesuite, and <hi>Mr. Fisher</hi> of the same Order; And one <hi>Cutbert,</hi> a lay brother of theirs,
of whom I spoke before; A great number of lay persons Recusants, whom I know
have beene dismist by him some for forty shillings some for twentie shillings, but the
least was ten shillings: Of a great part of Anabaptists, and Brownists, some that were
poore he imprisoned; But the rich for money escaped, as themselves will depose. It
is fit this <hi>Bonnyragge,</hi> and also the Bishop of Londons Pursivants be called in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with many other of his Promoters, and under Officers; As <hi>Arthur Huffe</hi> living

the two former Popes <hi>Clement the eight,</hi> and <hi>Paul the fifth,</hi> his Predecessors,
having been: <hi>in minoribus</hi> protectors of <hi>Scotland.</hi> He thought to do something more
to reduce both (under one King) to the Romish Church.<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> And as <hi>Clement the seaventh</hi>

               </gap>coriation, from the obedience of the
sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> he might be the meanes of their reconciliation. Wherefore he was no
sooner made Pope but the same day with his owne hand (a thing not accustomed)
he writ a letter to King <hi>Iames,</hi> of good memory, shewing his election &amp; promotion to
saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire and offering his correspondency with his Majesty; at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
he nominated <hi>Signiour Georgio Conne</hi> a Scottish youth (who was Schoole fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
with his Nephew Signior <hi>Francisco,</hi> afterwards <hi>Cardinall</hi>) who should informe

            </p>
            <p>This Signior <hi>George,</hi> was a very faire youth of some fifteene yeares of age, and of a

And assoone as any <hi>English, Scottish or Irish</hi> Runagates came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he went
to their lodgings in the <hi>Popes</hi> behalfe, and brought them of his Holinesse Bread, and
Wine, and other rarities, as <hi>Boligman, Sauseges</hi> and other dainties; letting them see all
the Antiquities of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Churches, though they were not of their Religion,
and feasting them on the <hi>Popes</hi> charge when they visited the seaven Churches, as the
Lord <hi>Craven</hi> and others; And now the <hi>Pope</hi> with his politique braine, began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitate
the meanes, to have correspondency with the King: by fortune there was at
<hi>Rome</hi> a <hi>Hollender</hi> expert in drayning of Lands to make the Marish grounds pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:99895:108"/>
The Pope [for his profit] gave a great eare, and understanding by this man the
meanes to effect if in a short time, that he needed great store of men to worke, and
that of all Nations the English were most expert, The Pope presently takes hould
thereof, apprehending it, as a fit occasion to treat with our K. wherefore he sends hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

signifying from whence he came, and the great profit which would redouud to
this Kingdome, if he would permit some two thousand Familyes of his People, with
their Wives and Children to goe and inhabit there, and after, successively more, For
he had gotten promise of the Pope, that they should not be troubled, but use their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
without any vexation at all: More, this <hi>Hollander</hi> signified to his Majesty,
the great Commodity it would be to the trade in those parts, for transporting from

            <p>Touching the fifth point, in my Iudgement, <hi>Roman</hi> Catholikes, especially those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
that have lands and goods, should bee stopt from going over Sea; In respect by the
selling and Mortgazing of their Lands the money is transported to forreigne parts,
and there spent, whereby the Kingdome is depauperated, His Majestie looses his
yearely pay for their Recusancy; the Shites where they remained are disabled to
pay so much subsedies as formerly in time of their Residence; And finally the poore
looseth much by their absence.</p>
            <p>This voluntary Relation of this ancient Intelligent. <hi>Popish-Priest</hi> (which I finde
to bee generally true and reall, by orher Letters, and Intelligence, and concurring
with the Plot discovered to the Archbishop and King Himselfe in my <hi>Romes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-peece,</hi>
in most particulars touching the Jesuites, Scottish troubles, Popes Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioes,

to many of the premises and some ensuing passages; therefore I could not
well omit it, though it be somewhat tedious.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: the 2d. intended Civill War against the Scots ceasing contrary to
the Prelates expectations, through the overruling providence of God, both in the

            <p>There was also a great Nobleman in <hi>Wales</hi> that bought up all the Provisions hee

a strong Commission to furnish whom hee would: And there was also a Letter
brought to the house, as from Secretary <hi>Windebanke</hi> in the Queenes name, to have
all the Papists fast every Saturday for the good successe of that designe. Whereupon
there was also this day an order made, that all Iudges in the next Circuits at the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sizes,

That if any man entertained a Popish servant knowing him to bee so, and lodged

and had issue by Her, his Children should not onely bee Christened after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

pull the good Queen in pieces: Can the good King of</hi> France <hi>suffer a Daughter of
France his Sister, and her Children to be thus affronted? Can the wise Cardinall endure
England and Scotland to unite, and not be able to discerne; in the end it is like they will
joyne together and turn head against France? A stirring Active Ambassabour might
do good service here; I have sent you a</hi> Copy of the Kings Speech on <hi>Satturday</hi> last,
at which time he discharged his conscience, and was advised to make that speech by
the Earle of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Sey,</hi> but I believe there is a mistake in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and that it should have bin the Lord <hi>Savill.</hi> This Speech did much operate
to the disadvantage of the Earle of <hi>Strasford.</hi> for the Commons were much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
incensed and inflamed against him; and this brought forth the next day being
Monday, a Protestation which was taken in both Houses of Parliament; of the
same nature, but rather worse than the Scottish Covenant.</p>
                  <p>The Londoners who are very boysterous, came upon Munday 5 or 6000. and
were so rude, that they would not suffer the Lords to come and go quietly and
peaceably to their houses; but threatned them, that if they had not justice, and if
they had not his life, it should go hard for all those that stood for him, following
them up and down, and calling for Iustice, justice, justice.</p>
                  <p>There was in the House of Commons, fifty sixe that denied to passe the Earle of
<hi>Straffords</hi> Bill, their names were taken, and they were fixed upon posts in divers
parts of London, and there was written over the head, these are <hi>Straffordians,</hi> the
betrayers of their Country.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes it came to passe that the Lords and Iudges were much affrighted,
and the most of his friends in the Lords House forsooke him all; the Popish Lords
did absent themselves, the Lord of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hartford</hi> were absent, so was <hi>Bristol</hi>
and others; <hi>Savill</hi> and the Duke onely stucke close and faithfully to him and some

which makes the Citizens and House of Commons shew their heads: some

afflicted,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> and in my conscience, the Puritans if they durst would teare her in pieces;
this cannot be for the honour of <hi>France,</hi> to endure a Daughter of that Nation, and
her Children, should be thus oppressed and affronted.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> is made Generall of the Army, whither he is gone down;

and after some stay, came and told the Officer that he had bin with the Queen, who
had commanded him that he should not go till she had spoke with the King, and
that he would obey her command before the Parliament. Which being related to
the House of Commons, they were much distasted at it, and sent another Warrant
to apprehend, and bring him forthwith the next day as a delinquent.</p>
            <p>There was also a Warrant sent by the Serjeant at Arms for the Popes Nuncio,<note place="margin">NOTE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

to bring him likewise before the House, but he was not to be found. The next day,
the King sent a Message to the Commons, promising that the Popes Nuncio should
be presently sent away out of this Kingdome. Presently hereupon, the Officer was
again sent with a Warrant to apprehend <hi>Father Philips,</hi> and waiting for him at
White-hall, complaint had bin made (as it seemed) to the King about it, and the
<hi>Lord Chamberlain</hi> at the Kings Command, sent for the Officer to examine him, by
what Authority he came within the Verge of the Court, to Attach any one; who
shewing his Warrant, desired he would trust him with it to shew the King, which
the Officer did; And the <hi>Lord Chamberlain</hi> soon after returning, gave this answer;
That His <hi>Majesty</hi> would satisfie the House about it, if <hi>Philips</hi> did not appeare. But
in the afternoon, the sayd <hi>Philips</hi> appeared before the Committee, and was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

a speciall Committee of both Houses to attend His Majesty and the Queen
at White-hall; and to present them with reasons against their intended journey,
which they accordingly presented to the King the 15th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and the next day

                        </p>
                        <p>1. There is a great cause to doubt, least the Papists have some designe upon her
Majesties journey,<note place="margin">Note.</note> because the House hath been informed, that divers of them have
sold off their Lands to a good value, and used other means to get ready money.
2ly. It is observed, some of them have been very diligent, gathering great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of gold. 3ly. It is informed, that more than an ordinary number of Papists
are gone beyond Sea already, and those of the better sort.</p>
                        <p>2. The great number of English fugitives now beyond the Seas, who by their
late designes and practises are knowne to be full of malice to the State, and will no
doubt seeke all opportunities of accesse to her Majestie, and as much as they can
labour to infuse into her Majesty, such evill Councells, as may trouble the peace
of the Kingdome, whereof at this time there is more danger, because the affaires
of the Kingdome, are not yet fully setled, and upon disbanding of the Army,
all parts will abound with Souldiers, and such others as will bee apt to be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to tumults and seditions; and especially in the time of the Kings absence in

the Queene, not only in such a proportion as the present occasions, with due respect
to her Majesties honour may seeme to require, but a farre greater quantity: and
that diverse Papists and others, under pretence of Her Majesties goods, are like to
convey great summes of monyes, and other treasure, beyond the Seas, which will not
onely impoverish the State, but may bee imployed to the fomenting of some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
attempts to the trouble of the publike peace.</p>
                        <p>4. That as it will be great dishonour to the State, if Her Majestie should not bee
attended and furnished sutably to her quality, so it will be a very heavy burden in
this time of great necessity, and occasions of other publike charges, if she should

be provided in so royall a manner as shall be fit for her Majesty, and the Honour of

The House of Commons have thought good to Declare; That if any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the power of Parliament may give Her Majesty contentment, they are so tender
of her health, both in due respect to His most Excellent Majesty and Her Selfe, that
they will be ready to further Her satisfaction in all things, so far as may stand with
that Publike to which they are obliged.</p>

            <p>You have heard before what a labouring and plotting there was to keep the Irish
Army from disbanding, and to give a new occasion of assembling them to some
parts of <hi>Ireland</hi> under pretence of transporting them into the Low Countries or <hi>Spain</hi>
to serve the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> but no doubt, the true reason was to execute that horrid bloudy

the popish party in one day, which was formerly plotted, and intended to be put in

be recommended in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to be a principal actor in this Plot, being there ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to raise men, Armes, and traine up the conspirators to the use of Armes without
suspition or noise, better then in any other place. 6ly. That they had then drawne
<hi>Standley</hi> and other Souldiers to their party. Seventhly that all this was confessed

And this examinant saith, that Sir <hi>Phelim Roe O Neale</hi> had sent a Table with

<hi>Daniel O Neale,</hi> brother to the said <hi>Conn</hi> now in restraint in <hi>England,</hi> and
for whom he had stayed, and was in feare of staying over-long least he should be

what to doe, which the said President daily expected, which Letters
were sent from the said <hi>Conn</hi> unto him the said <hi>Owen</hi> into Flanders by a speciall
Messenger: At which time one <hi>Byron Mac Phelim Birne</hi> came out of England
unto the said Colonell <hi>Owen,</hi> and stayed with him a few daies, and had conference
with him, and so returned back for England; and after in October last the said
Col. <hi>Owen O Neale</hi> sent one <hi>Art. Mac Ginnis</hi> a Fryer, being his Nephew, into
England, who at Dunkirk met with a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> who as this examinant was told
was a sonne of the Lord <hi>Viscount Netterfield</hi> which came thether with him into
England, and so for Ireland. And this examitant further saith, that in November

to be made on the Castle of Dublin for the taking of the said Castle by the
Lord <hi>Mac Guire, Mac Mahone,</hi> one of the <hi>O Neales</hi> and others; which Plot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discovered, the said Lord <hi>Mac Guire, Mac Mahone, O Neale</hi> and others
were imprisoned. <hi>And that neverthelesse the Irish had raised a great company of
men, and possessed themselves of the Newrie, Dundalke, Ardmagh, Monaghan, and
severall other Country Townes. And that they had taken prisoners the Lord</hi> Calfield,
<hi>the Lady</hi> Blaine, <hi>and her Children,</hi> and that their numbers did daily encrease.
And being demanded how they could have the said Newes so soone in Flanders,
answered,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that they had that and most of the Newes of <hi>Ireland,</hi> out of <hi>England;</hi>
and <hi>that it was notable to observe, with what speed and certainty the Irish in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
received the Newes of Ireland out of England: upon</hi> receipt of which News,
the said Col. was <hi>in a great rage against the discoverer, and said he wondered how
or where that villaine should live; for if he were in Ireland, sure they would pull
him to peeces there. And if he lived in England, there were footmen and other Irish
men enough to kill him.</hi> And he further saith, that the said Col. <hi>Owen</hi> acquainted
the generall <hi>Francisco de Melloe,</hi> with the said News, who told the said <hi>Colonell</hi>
that he had understood as much before. And thereupon the said <hi>Col.</hi> desired <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense</hi>
to depart for <hi>Ireland.</hi> And <hi>likewise that he might have Armes and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition

there, which were the safest and best way Ports in <hi>Ireland</hi> where Armes and
Ammunition might be landed; and to direct that some <hi>Fryer or Priest might for

that some person of speciall trust should be sent into France, Rome, and to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

<hi>Ireland,</hi> with the said Message and these instructions. That he this Examinant
should repaire unto Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale, Conn O Neale, Brian O Neale;</hi> and
<hi>Hugh O Birne,</hi> and to acquaint them that he the said Col. was purposed to come
from <hi>Dunkirke</hi> for <hi>Ireland</hi> with all expedition, and to <hi>bring with him three Ships,

and advised from them in <hi>Ireland</hi> (by <hi>some Fryer or Priest to be sent from thence
for that purpose</hi>) what Port in that Kingdome he should land in. And directed the
sending <hi>of the aforenamed Ever Roe</hi> Titular Bishop of <hi>Downe into France</hi> unto

And another of this Examinants Instructions was, to perswade them by all meanes
that they should not mistrust or doubt of his comming, for he would be with
them ere long, and that he had taken <hi>a great Oath, that if he could not obtaine
leave,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                           <hi>Munition and Armes from the Generall, yet if all failed he would adventure
him and his whole estate in that service, and that if he lived he would assuredly be
with them within ten weekes, and would bring with him Miners, Canons and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneers,
and such other instruments as should be necessary for them.</hi> And that he did
wonder although there were no Miners there, that his Country-men did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
and set on worke such persons as digged for Iron, Mine, or Coales. And
further that the <hi>Lords and Commanders of the Catholique League in Ireland should
send one</hi> Patrick Heggartie <hi>a Fryer,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                           <hi>who had spent much time in Scotland to solicite
for them there. And to put the Scots in mind that they were for the most part discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the Irish, and that the Irish never drew any of their bloud. And therefore
that they should not offer the Irish any injury: But keepe themselves quiet in their
owne Country, not helping the one part or the other,</hi> Another of this Examinants
Instructions was, <hi>to perswade the Lords and great Commanders of the League, that
they should hold firme,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Note.</note>

were forced to fly the Kingdome, and many others beheaded, and others restrained in
the Tower of London untill they there dyed and lost their Lands; and that they should
not doubt of succour.</hi> And further saith, that he was directed by his said Colonel
to impart these Instructions and Message unto such Lords, Commanders and
Gentlemen in Ireland; as the said Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale, Conn O Neale, Brian O
Neale,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Birn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from his said Colonell, he the said Col. called for a Glasse of Wine, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:99895:116"/>
dranke the health of the said Captaine <hi>Hugh Mac Phelim Birne,</hi> who he said
was desigred Governour of the Fort of <hi>Duncannon</hi> in the County of <hi>Wexford.</hi>
And this Examinant further saith, that he being directed with a Letter in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember
last, from his Col. unto one <hi>Brian Birfield</hi> a Fryer, and resident at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirke,</hi>
for the helping of him this Examinant, that he the said Fryer would make
a Iourney forthwith unto Col. <hi>Owen O Neale,</hi> and from him unto Col. <hi>Preston,</hi>
to labour the joyning together of the said Colonells to goe into <hi>Ireland, to further
with all the force and aide they could make, the prosecution of the present warre
there.</hi> And further saith, that in his this Examinants Voyage from <hi>Ireland</hi> (he
with a <hi>Fryer in his company</hi>) was landed at <hi>Dover</hi> before Christmas last;<note place="margin">Note.</note> where
they the <hi>said parties remained for three weekes, no examination or notice being taken
of them there.</hi> And from thence the ship being bound for the Port of <hi>Waterford,</hi>
the same landed him this Examinant and the Fryer at the Port of <hi>Youghall,</hi> about
the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> last, where they were brought before the <hi>Earl of Cork,</hi>
and by his Lordship sent by sea unto the City of <hi>Dublin.</hi> And further this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
saith, he conceived that the said Col. <hi>Owen</hi> may be easily surprised in his
passage for Ireland, if he be laid for with good advisement. The said <hi>Owen</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
to come with his Men, Munition, and Armes unto <hi>Bergam,</hi> within a mile
of <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> which place he intends to gaine for his Garrison; and to carry in
<hi>Lighters</hi> the said Armes, Munition and Men as secretly as he may by night unto
the Ship at <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> without shewing himselfe there: And his pretence will be
that he is imployed into <hi>Spaine.</hi> And <hi>the said Col. purposeth to bring with him all
the Irish Mariners which may be had about Dunkirke,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                           <hi>where there are store; and in

Dover, or if he see cause by the North of Scotland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this Examinant further saith, that he this Examinant durst not refuse to
go into <hi>Ireland</hi> with the said message, and instructions, for fear of his said Mr.
Collonell <hi>Owen O Neale,</hi> well knowing of his severity. But this Examinant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to discover the same when he thought he safely might: And he saith, that
he doth not know or hath heard of any other that was sent from his Collonell
into <hi>Ireland</hi> of this message besides himself; but beleeveth that some Messenger
might be sent from Col: <hi>Preston</hi> unto the Lords of the Pale, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
in the Province of <hi>Lemster,</hi> as well as he was sent by his Col: unto Sir

            <p>BY this examination it is clear, that <hi>ô Neales</hi> Regiment in <hi>Flanders,</hi> (consisting

and make a generall Massacre of the Protestants there, when they should finde

               </gap> sitting opportunity; and that <hi>Owen ô Neale</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Daniell ô Neale</hi>
his Brother in <hi>England,</hi> (who was in extraordinary favour with <hi>His Majesty</hi> and
the <hi>Queen</hi> at Court, and one in Mr. <hi>Iermyns</hi> conspiracy), were two of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
contrivers, and abbetters of this conspiracy, in which all the Irish, Popish
Bishops, Priests, Friars, Iesuits (and scattered like Frogs in severall Popish King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Seminaries) were very active.</p>
            <p>I shall onely adde to this, That <hi>William O Conner,</hi> an Irish Priest, servant to the
<hi>Queen-Mother,</hi> who lodged at one Mistris <hi>Scarlets</hi> house in <hi>Coven-Garden,</hi> and
shifted his habit very often to disguise himself, coming to one <hi>Anne Hussey</hi> an
Irish Gentlewoman, a little after Easter, 1640. with another Irish man in his
company, having a long gray coat, &amp; a sword girt close to his side, to her lodging;
and going with her thence to Mistris <hi>Prinocks</hi> house in the <hi>Strand;</hi> she demanded
of <hi>O Conner,</hi> who his companion was? who answered, he was one of the number of
7000. that were in privat pay, AND IN READINES TO AYD THE
CATHOLICKS,<note place="margin">Note.</note> AND TO OUT THE PROTESTANTS
THROATS THAT SHOULD RESIST THEM; and that he
was one who played on the Flute to the Drum. After which, about the end of
July, 1640. he came to her foresaid lodging, and said, <hi>He came upon great occasion,
and in great haste, and he must immediatly return back, for he had three Letters
from the Queen-Mother, to deliver to three Ambassadors, the</hi> Spanish, <hi>the</hi> Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
<hi>the</hi> French,<note place="margin">Note.</note> TO SEND TO THE POPE, FROM WHOM,
OR FROM HIS LEGATE, WE MUST KNOW WHEN
TO BEGIN THE SUBDUING OF THE PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS:
That they must first BEGIN TO CONQUER <hi>ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND</hi>
BEFORE <hi>IRELAND.</hi> Being demanded by him, <hi>How, or
in what manner will they begin with England? And when will it be?</hi> He replyed,
<hi>When the King goes to</hi> Scotland. To which she answering, <hi>There was no hopes of
the Kings going to</hi> Scotland; He replyed, <hi>He warrant you he doth.</hi> He further
added, <hi>That he had long been imployed by the Queen-Mother in her businesse with
all the Princes of Christendom: That they had some designe to cut off and kill the
King:</hi> adding, <hi>That they would kill an Heretick at any time, for the advancement
of the Mother-Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>and swore by Saint</hi> Francis <hi>and Saint</hi> Dominick
<hi>that he would do it:</hi> He further said, <hi>He was bound to keep the Queen-Mothers
secrets; and that he would be burnt in fire before he would reveal them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this she discovered soon after to the Lords of the Councell, by whom and
by severall Iustices of Peace, she was examined upon Oath, and produced
Letters of this Priest, written to her with his own hand; whereupon, he was
Committed close Prisoner to the Gate-house, where he yet remaines unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against. After this she attested it in the Parliament House upon Oath,
before the Rebellion brake forth, and witnessed it since upon Oath at the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
Tryall; who said she was mad when she attested it at the Councell Table,
<hi>demanding of her, how she durst speak any thing of this Nature of the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
and telling her she was set on and hired by the City of</hi> London <hi>to do this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>and
Commanded her to be Committed:</hi> But she producing the Priests own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and he confessing it to be his own hand before the Lords; she was sent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to one of the Sheriffs of <hi>Londons</hi> house, and there secured, till released by the
Parliament.</p>
            <p>About the time of this discourse, the Earl of <hi>Worcester</hi> a great Papist, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
powerfull in <hi>Southwales,</hi> bordering next to <hi>Ireland,</hi> procured a Commission
from His Majesty for to be Lord Lieutenant and Commander in chief of all
<hi>Southwales,</hi> (as the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> his Son an Arch-Papist, hath been since the
Rebellion brake forth) as appears by this Minute, an Originall draught of a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:99895:117"/>
Letter under Secretary <hi>Windebanks</hi> own hand to the then Lord Chamberlain
signifying as much.</p>
            <p>HIS Majesty being well inclined to employ the Earl of <hi>Worcester</hi> in some
particular service best known to himself in South-Wales,<note place="margin">Note.</note> being most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his Loyalty, Duty and good affection to His Person and Service; hath
thought fit to acquaint Your Lordship therewith, considering the great Power
and Interest Your Lordship hath in those parts, and hath commanded me in his
Name to signifie his pleasure to Your Lordship, that you give speedy and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
order, to all Your Principall Officers,<note place="margin">Note.</note> Tenants, and Dependents, and such
others as have relation to you; that as soon as the said Earl shall produce any
Commission or Authority from His Majesty, for the performance of any service
in those parts, they fail not, to obey His Lordship in all such thinges as by vertue
of such Power given by him and His Majesty he shall require and Command.
This His Majesty expects Your Lordship shall do with expedition, to the end,
Your Officers there may be the better prepared whensoever the said Earl shall
exercise any such Commission from His Majesty; that so His Majesties service
may not suffer. His Majesty hath already signified His pleasure to the Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
of the Marches to this effect, who hath yielded all obedience and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
thereunto, and His Majesty is confident that in that Your Lordship and
those who have Relation to you will give place to none.</p>
            <p>This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission was ordred to be brought into the Commons house as dangerous.</p>
            <p>But the happy unexpected Treaty and assembling of this Parliament, frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the intended Massacre and Designe of subduing the Protestants in <hi>England</hi>
for the present; the Plot in <hi>Ireland</hi> still proceeding, and was to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the 23. of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. on which day, all the Forts and Towns in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
should have been surprised at an instant by the Popish Rebells, and most of
the Protestants destroyed; and accordingly that very night <hi>Charlemont</hi> Fort was
on the 23. of <hi>October</hi> at night surprised by Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale,</hi> a principall actor
and conspirator in the Rebellion; who there took the Lady <hi>Calfield</hi> prisoner,
and murthered the young Lord <hi>Calfield</hi> her Son: And at that time Sir <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim
ô Neale</hi> himself and other of his companions told her, That <hi>Dublin</hi> castle and
city,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and most other Forts of <hi>Ireland</hi> were surprised by their confederates
the Papists; that the Tower of <hi>London</hi> was taken by their party, and the
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> released thence; (a good signe he was their
friend:) that <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> and the Protestants there, were then, or
would be very shortly in the same, or as bad a condition as <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
there were; and some of them said, that their party had taken <hi>Edenbrough</hi>
castle: All which was attested upon Oath by the Lady <hi>Calfield,</hi> and her Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman

That ALL THE PAPISTS IN <hi>ENGLAND</hi> WERE PRIVY
TO THE PLOT IN <hi>IRELAND,</hi> and intended the like in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which we have since experimentally found to be true. Divers other Forts
were the same day and soon after surprised by the Irish Rebels, and above one
hundred fifty two thousand Protestants there destroyed in the first four months
of the Rebellion, as the Rebells themselves certified the Pope upon inquisitions
of their number taken upon Oath.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding those their successefull proceedings in other parts, yet
through the admirable Providence of God, they were prevented of the main
part of their design; the surprising of <hi>Dublin</hi> Castle, the chief strength and
Magazine of that Realm; which had they gotten, they had in very few dayes
been Master of the whole Kingdom: For the very night before the Castle should
have been surprised, the Plot was discovered to the Lords Iustices of <hi>Ireland</hi> by
<hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en Connelly;</hi> whereupon, that design was frustrated, and the Lord <hi>Maguire</hi>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:99895:117"/>
and <hi>Hugh Macmahone,</hi> two principall men in the Conspiracy, who came pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to surprise it, with other their Confederates taken Prisoners; whose
Examinations and Confessions, together with the Lords Iustices Letter to the
Earl of <hi>Leicester;</hi> discovering the manner and proceedings of this Conspiracy;
I shall here insert.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with the Relation of the Lord <hi>Maguire</hi> himself, written with his
own hand in the Tower, and delivered by him to Sir <hi>Iohn Conyers</hi> then Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
to present to the Lords in Parliament, because it is the fullest.</p>
            <p>BEing in <hi>Dublin</hi> Candlemas Term last was 12. moneths, the Parliament then
sitting, Mr. <hi>Roger Moore</hi> did write to me, desiring me that if I could in that
spare time, I would come to his house (for then the Parliament did nothing but
sit and adjourn, expecting a Commission for the continuance thereof, their former
Commission being expired, and that some things he had to say to me, that did
meerly concern me; and on receipt of his Letter, the new Commission for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
the Parliament Landed; and I did returne him an answer, that I could
not fulfill his request for that present, and thereupon he himself came to Town
presently after, and sending to me, I went to see him at his Lodging, and after
some little time spent in salutations, he began to discourse of the many afflictions
and sufferings,<note place="margin">Note.</note> of the Natives of that Kingdom, and particularly in those latter
times of my Lord of <hi>Straffords</hi> Government, which gave distaste to the whole
Kingdom) and then he began to particularize the suffering of them that were the
more ancient Natives, as were the Irish; how that on the severall Plantations
they were all put out of their Ancestors Estates, all which sufferings he said did
beget a generall discontent over all the whole Kingdom in both the Natives, to
wit, the Old and New Irish, and that if the Gent. of the Kingdom were disposed
to free themselves furtherly from the like inconvenience, and get good conditions
for themselves for regaining their Ancestors (or at least a good part thereof)
Estates, they could never desire a more convenient time, then that time (the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers
of <hi>Scotland</hi> being then on foot,) and did ask me what I thought of it; I
made him answer, that I could not tell what to thinke of it, such matters being
altogether out of my Element; then he would needs have an oath from me of
secrecy, which I gave him, and thereupon he told me, that he spoke to the best
Gentlemen of Quality in <hi>Lemster,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Conaght,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> touching that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and he found all of them willing thereunto, if so be they could draw to them
the Gent. of <hi>Vlster,</hi> for which cause said he, I come to speak to you; then he
began to lay down to me, the case that I was in then, overwhelmed in Debt,
the smalnesse of my Estate, and the greatnesse of the Estate my Ancestors had,
and how I should be sure to get it again, or at least a good part thereof; and
moreover how the welfare and maintaining of the Catholique Religion,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which
he said undoubtedly the Parliament now in <hi>England</hi> will suppresse, doth depend
on it, for (said he) it is to be feared, and so much I hear from every understanding
man, the Parliament intends the utter. subversion of our Religon; by which
perswasions he obtained my consent, and so demanded whether any more of <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
Gent. were in Town? I told him that <hi>Philip Relly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Torrilagh ô Neal,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Sir <hi>Phillim ô Neale,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cosloe, Macmahone,</hi> were in Town: so for
that time we parted.</p>
            <p>The next day he invited Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> and I to dine with him, and after dinner, he
sent for those other Gent. Mr. <hi>Neale, and</hi> Mr. <hi>Macmaehone,,</hi> and when they were
come, he began the discourse formerly used to me, to them, and with the same
perswasions formerly used to me, he obtained their consent: And then he began
to discourse of the manner how it ought to be done: Of the feazebility and
easiness of the attempt, considering matters as they then stood in <hi>England,</hi> the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the great number of able men in the Kingdom (meaning <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:99895:118"/>
what succours they were (more then) to hope for from abroad,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
then raised all Irishmen, and well armed, meaning the Army raised by my
Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> against <hi>Scotland.</hi> First, that every one should endeavor to
draw his own friends into that act, and at least those that did live in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
with them; and when they had so done, they send to the Irish in the Low-Countries
and Spain,<note place="margin">Note.</note> to let them know of the day and resolution, so that they
be over with them by that day, or soon after, with supply of Armes and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as they could, that there should be a set day appointed, and every one in his
own quarters should rise out that day, and seize on all Armes he could get in his
County, and this day to be near winter so that <hi>England</hi> could not be able to send
Forces into <hi>Ireland</hi> before May; and by that time there was no doubt to be made,
but that they themselves would be supplyed by the Irish beyond Seas, who he
said could not misse of help from either <hi>Spain</hi> or the <hi>Pope,</hi> but that his resolution
was not in all things allowed. For, first it was resolved, nothing should be done,
untill first they had sent to the Irish over Seas, to know their advice, and what
hope of successe they could give, for in them, as they said, all their hope of reliefe
was, and they would have both their advise and resolution before any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
more then to speak to, and try Gent. of the Kingdom, every one as
they could conveniently, to see (in case they would at any time grow to a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
what to be, and strength they might trust to: Then Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> told them that it
was to no purpose to spend much time in speaking to the Gent. for there was
no doubt to be made of the Ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh, that they would be ready at any time: And
that all the doubt was in the Gent. of the Pale; but he said that for his own part,
he was really assured when they had risen out, the Pale Gent. would not stay
long after, at least that they would not oppose them in any thing, but be Newters,
and if in case they did, that they had men enough in the Kingdom without them.
Moreover he said, that he had spoke to a great man (who then should be name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse)
that would not fail at the appointed day of rising out to appear, and to be
seen in the Act; but that untill then he was sworn not to reveal him: And that
was all that was done at that meeting; onely that Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> should the next
Lent following, make a Iourny down into the North, to know what was done
there; and that he also might inform them what he had done, and so on parting
Mr. <hi>Philip Relly,</hi> and I, did importune Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> for the knowledge of that great
man that he spoke of, and on long entreaty, after binding us to new secrecy, not
to discover him untill the day should be appointed, he told that it was the <hi>Lord
of Mayo,</hi> who was very powerfull in command of men in those parts of <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aght</hi>
wherein he lived; and that there was no doubt to be made of him, no more
then was of himself: and so we parted.</p>
            <p>The next Lent following, Master <hi>Moore</hi> according to his promise came unto
Ulster, by reason it was the time of Assizes in severall Counties, there he met
only with Mr. <hi>Rely,</hi> and nothing was then done, but all matters put off till the
May following, where we or most of us should meet at Dublin, it both being
Parliament and Terme time; in the meane time there landed in Ireland one
<hi>Neall O Neale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> sent by the Earle of <hi>Tyrone</hi> out of Spaine, to speake with their
Gent. of his name and Kindred, to let them know that he had Treated with
<hi>Cardinall Richelieu</hi> for obtaining succour to come for Ireland, and that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with the Cardinall, so that he was to have Armes, Munition, and Money
from him on demand to come for Ireland, and that he only expected a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time to come away, and to desire them to be in a readinesse, and to procure
all others whom they could to be so likewise; which mess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge did set forward the
proceedings very much, so that Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> Mr. <hi>Relly;</hi> my <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>I</hi> mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the next May in Dublin, and the same Messenger being there too, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that he should returne to the <hi>Earle</hi> into Spaine with their resolution,
which was; that they would rise out 12. or 14. daies before or after Alhollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99895:118"/>
as they should see cause, and that he should not faile to be with them by
that time; there was a report at that time and before, that the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi>
was killed, which was not beleeved, by reason of many such reports formerly
which were found to be false,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and so the Messenger departed with directions,
that if the Earles death were true, he should repaire into the Low Countries to
Colonell <hi>Owen O Neale,</hi> and acquaint him with his Commission from the Earl,
whereof it was thought he was not ignorant, and to returne an answer sent by
him, and to see what he would advise, or would doe himselfe therein: B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after his departure the certainty of the Earles death was knowne, and on
further resolution it was agreed that an expresse Messenger should be sent to the
<hi>Colonell</hi> to make all the resolutions known to him, and to returne speedily with
his Answer, and so one <hi>Toole O Connelly</hi> a <hi>Priest</hi> (as I thinke Parish Priest to
Mr. <hi>Moore</hi>) was sent away to <hi>Colonell O Neale;</hi> in the interim there came seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Letters and Newes out of England to Dublin, of Proclamations against the
Catholikes in England,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and also that the Army raised in Ireland should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded
and conveyed into Scotland; and presently after severall Colonells and
Captaines landed, with directions to carry away those men, amongst whom Col.
<hi>Pluncket,</hi> Col. <hi>Birne,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Breim O Neale</hi> came, but did not all come
together, for Col. <hi>Pluncket</hi> landed before my comming out of Towne, and the
other two after: wherein a great feare of suppressing Religion was conceived,
and especially by the Gent. of the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le, and it was very common amongst them,
that it would be very inconvenient to suffer so many men to be conveyed out of
the Kingdome, it being as was said very confidently reported, that the Scottish
Army did threaten, never to lay down Armes untill an vniformity of Religion
were in the three Kingdomes, and the Catholike Religion suppressed.; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
both Houses of Parliament began to oppose their going, and the Houses
were divided in their Opinions; some would have them goe, others not, but
what the definitive conclusion of the Houses was touching that point I cannot
tell, for by leave from the House of Lords I departed into the Country before the
Prorogation: but before my departure I was informed by <hi>Iohn Barnawall</hi> a Fryer,
that those Gent, of the Pale (and some other Members of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons)
had severall meetings and consultations how they might make stay of the
Souldiers in the Kingdome, and likewise to arme them for the defence of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, being much injured both of England and Scotland then (as they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
and to prevent any attempt against Religion:<note place="margin">Note.</note> and presently after I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
into the Country, and Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> being a Member of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
stayed the prorogation, and on his comming into the Country sent to me
to mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e him, and I came to his house, where he told me that he heard for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that the former Narration of <hi>Barnawall</hi> to me (for I did acquaint him with
it) was true, and that he heard it from severall there: also was <hi>Emer Mac Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hone</hi>
(made privie formerly to all our proceedings) at Mr. <hi>Rellies</hi> lately come
out of the Plea, where he met with the afore-named <hi>Iohn Barnawall,</hi> who told
him as much as he formerly told me; and moreover that those Colonells that
lately came over, did proffer their service and industry in that Act, and so would
raise their men under colour to convey them into Spaine, and then seixe on the
Castle of Dublin,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and with their Armes there to arme their Souldiers, and have
them ready for any action that should be commanded them, but that they had not
concluded any thing, because they were not assured how the Gent. of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
parts of the Kingnome (and especially of Ulster) would stand affected to
that Act, and that assurance of that doubt was all their impediment. Then we
three began to thinke how we might assure them of the assistance and helpe of
Ulster Gent. It was thought that one should be sent to them to acquaint them
therewith, and they made choise of me to come, by reason as they said that my
Wife was allyed to them, and their Country-woman, and would beleeve me,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99895:119"/>
trust me sooner then other of their parts, they or most of them being of the Pale,
and so (without as much as to returne home to furnish my selfe for such a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<hi>(Volens nolens)</hi> they prevailed, or rather forced me to come to Dublin
to conferre with those Colonells (and that was the last August was twelve-moneth)
comming to Towne I met Sir <hi>Iames Dillon</hi> accidentally before I came
to my Lodging, who was one of those Colonells; and after salutation he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me where my lodging was, which when I told him, and parted; The next day
being abroad about some other occasions of my owne in Towne, I met him (as he
said) comming to waite on me in my Chamber, but being a good way from it, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
me to go into his own Chamber being near at hand, and then began to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the present sufferings and afflictions of that Kingdom, and particularly of
Religion,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and how they were to expect no redresse (the Parliament in England
intending, and the Scots resolving never to lay downe Armes untill the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Religion were suppressed, then he likewise began to lay downe what danger
it would be to suffer so many able men as was to go with them to depart the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in such a time, neither (saith he) doth their other Gent. that are Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells,
and my selfe affect our owne private profit so as to preferre it before the
generall good of the Kingdome; and knowing that you are well-affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
(and I hope, said he, ready to put your helping hand to it on occasion)
I will let you know the Resolution of those other Gent. and mine, which is if
we are ready to raise our men, and after to seaze on the Castle where there is
great store of Armes,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and arme our selves there. This was the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st motion that
I ever heard of taking the Castle, for it never came into our thoughts formerly;
nor am I perswaded never would, if it had not proceeded from those Colonells,
who were the first motioners and contrivers thereof for ought knowne to me;
and then to be ready to prevent and resist any danger that the Gentry of the
Kingdome like thereof and helpe us, for we of our selves neither are able nor
will doe any thing therein without their assistance: I began according to the
directions that was sent with me to approve of the Resolution, and also to let
him know how sure he might be of the assistance of those of Ulster; then he told
me that for my more satisfaction I should conferre with the rest of those Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells
themselves, as many as are privie to the Action, and accordingly a place
of meeting was appointed that after-noone, and on the time and place appointed
there met sir <hi>Iames</hi> himselfe, Colonell <hi>Bourne,</hi> and Col. <hi>Pluncket,</hi> and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
discourse being renewed, they began to lay downe the Obstacles to that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise,
and how they should be redressed.</p>
            <p>First, if there should warre ensue, how there should be money had to pay
the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, how and where they should procure succour from forraign parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, how to draw in the Pale Gentry.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, who should undertake to surprize the Castle, and how it should
be done.</p>
            <p>To the first it was answered, That the Rents in the Kingdome every where, not
having respect whose they should be, due to the Lords and Gentry thereof,
should be collected to pay the Souldiers; and moreover they might be sure (nay
that there was no doubt thereof) to procure money from the Pope, who gave
severall promises formerly to my Lord of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> (in case he could make way to
come into Ireland)<note place="margin">Note.</note> to maintaine six thousand men yearely at his owne charge,
and that notwithstanding that my Lord of <hi>Tyrone</hi> was dead, yet that he would
continue the same forwardnesse now. To the second it was answered by Colonell
<hi>Bourne,</hi> that helpe from abroad could not faile them, for (said he) Colonell <hi>O
Neale</hi> told me that he had or would procure in readinesse, (I doe not remember
which of those the Colonells spoke,<note place="margin">Note.</note> or whither he spoke positive, that Col. <hi>O
Neale</hi> had the Armes, or would procure them) Armes for ten thousand men.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99895:119"/>
And moreover (said he) I make no great question that if we send into Spaine
we shall not misse of Ayde; for I being in London the last yeare, in the <hi>Scots</hi>
troubles,<note place="margin">Note.</note> I was in conference with one of the Spanish Ambassadors there then,
and talking of their troubles then a foote, he said, that if the Irish did then rise to,
and send into Spaine, their Messengers would be received under Canopies of
gold; these last words he told me, and some one man of those that were present
privately, whose name I cannot call to mind, (neither well remember I whether
he spoke to them all or no.) Then it was thought that when they were both in
Armes for defence of the Catholike cause,<note place="margin">Note.</note> they would be succoured by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Princes of Christendome. To the third it was Answered by Colonell
<hi>Pluncket</hi> that he was as morally certaine (for those were his words) as he could
be of any thing that the Pale Gentry would joyne with them, and assist them;
for he said I have spoke to severall of them since my landing in the Kingdome,
and I finde them very ready and willing, and withall I have at London spoke to
some of the Committees,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and particularly to my <hi>Lord of Gormonstone</hi> to let them
know his resolution, and they approved of it very well, and withall they knew
of the former consultations by those Gentry, told me by <hi>Barnewall:</hi> For it was
said but very secretly, that the King did in these termes say to Mr. <hi>Nicholas Plunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi>
one of the Irish Committee then in England,<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>that if they would stick to him,
he would stick to them;</hi> this I heard I thinke from the said <hi>Iohn Barnewall,</hi> but
in truth I am not sure whether from him or no, but certaine I am that he from
whom I heard it did confidently report it. All this was not done at the first mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
but at three or foure meetings, and so on the last meeting it was resolved
to the last doubt touching seizing the Castle; That Colonell <hi>Pluncket</hi> and Col.
<hi>Burne</hi> should undertake that taske because they were nearer to it then any other,
and also seize on all the Forts, Garrisons and other places where they thinke any
Armes should be, and in particular London Derry, which should be undertaken
by those of Ulster. And then there was a set day appointed for the execution
thereof, that was the fifth of the ensuing Septemb. (this being the latter end of
August, or the beginning of Septemb. Anno 1641. I doe not know whether)
and every one should make provision to rise out that day, and they were named
that should first succour them that should take the Castle with men presently,
namely sir <hi>Iames Dillon,</hi> who did undertake to be with them within three (or at
the most foure daies with one thousand men, and so much more, should come to
them out of the North, for those two Colonells did not intend to use above one
hundred men in the surprisall, whereof they were to have twenty good able Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen;
for they made account that having the Castle, they with the Artillery
would master all the Towne untill they were releeved by men from the Country:
and because there was a doubt made, how all this could be done in so short a
time, they did appoint that all that were there present should not fail to meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
there the 20. of September, to give an accompt of all things aswell hopes as
impediments, and if on that interview all things should happen to be well, that
they go forward, or if otherwise, to prolong the Execution of it to more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
time, and so we parted, every man into the Country, about his own taske,
and I in my way home, came to Mr. <hi>Rellyes</hi> house, and there I received a Letter
from Sir <hi>Phelim ô Neale,</hi> that his Lady was dead, and to be buried on the Sunday
following; this being on the Satterday, and desiring mein all kindnesse to come to
the buri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll; and Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> having received another Letter to the same effect,
would needs have me go thither, (whereunto I was very unwilling, being weary
withall, not provided to go to such a meeting) aswell (said he) to prevent any
iealousy from the Ladies friends, as also, to confer with Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> touching all
these proceeedings, (for neither he nor I did ever speak with Sir <hi>Phellim</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those matters before) but to his Brother <hi>Tirolagh ô Neale,</hi> and coming
thither, we found Captain <hi>Bryan ô Neale,</hi> lately come out of the Low-Countries,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99895:120"/>
sent over by Col: <hi>ô Neale,</hi> to speak to and provoke those of <hi>Vlster</hi> to rise out
into Armes, and that he would be with them on notice of their day; the same day
or soon after it: and it was asked of the said Captain, what aide he could send
or procure, being but a private Collonell, or where he could get any? he replyed
that the said Col: told him, that he had sent to severall places that Summer to
demand aide,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and in particular to <hi>Cardinall Richelieu</hi> into <hi>France</hi> (to whom he
had sent twice that year) and had comfortable and very hopefull promises from
them, and especially from that <hi>Cardinall</hi> on whom he thought the Collonell did
most depend, so that there was no doubt to be made of succour from him, and
especially when they had risen out, that would be a meanes to the Cardinall to
give aide:<note place="margin">Note.</note> We did the more credit him in regard of the former Treaty between
the said <hi>Cardinall</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> as formerly is said; for my own part,
I did and do beleeve that the Col: doth depend on <hi>France</hi> for aide; more then
on any other place, aswell for these reasons, as also that <hi>Ever Macmahone</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mentioned told me, that presently after the Isle of Rees enterprize (he
being then in the Low-Country, did hear for certain that the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Collonell did send into <hi>France</hi> to the Marshall of <hi>France</hi> (that
was generall of the French Forces at the Isle of Ree) to deale with him for<note place="margin">Note.</note>
procuring of aide to come then for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he received an answer from
the said Marshall, that he was most willing and ready to contribute his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
for his furtherance therein, but that for the present he could not answer my
Lords expectation, by reason that the King had warres in Italy, which he thought
would be at an end within half a year or little more, and then my Lord should
not doubt of any thing that he could do for his assistance, but those continued a
great deal longer, so for that time that enterprize faild: So after the Buriall was
done, I gave these Gentlemen knowledge of what I had done at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
how I was to retire thither, and then they began to think how to surprise London-Derry,
they being near it, but could not then agree in the manner; and so Sir
<hi>Phelim</hi> desired me to take his ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se in my way going to Dublin, and that I should
have a resolution to carry with me touching London-Derry, and thereon I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
home; but soon after came to Dublin, to the afore appointed meeting with
those Collonells: But first, I took in my way Sir <hi>Phellim ô Neales</hi> house to be
certain what he had done; and his answer was, that he knew that matters could
not be put in execution by the 5. of October, as was appointed, and that they
would make another longer day for it, and that he would provide for the taking
of London-Derry by that day; and so I came to Dublin, to give an accompt of
that was done, and also know what further should be done: I was not two
houres in my lodging, when Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> came to me (who knew of what was
done by those Colonells formerly from <hi>Col. Burne,</hi> and told me that the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
sent to Colonell <hi>Neale</hi> was come with answer, desiring us not to delay any
time in rising out, and to let him know of that day before-hand, and that he
would not faile to be with us within fourteen daies of that day with good ayde,
also desiring us by any meanes to seaze the Castle of Dublin if we could,<note place="margin">Note.</note> for he
heard that there was great provision in it for Warre, and Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> moreover
said, that time was not to be over-slipped, and desired me to be very pressing with
the Col. to goe on in their resolution; but on meeting the Col. with them they
were fallen from their resolution, because those of the Pale would doe nothing
therein first, but when it was done they would not faile to assist us; Col. <hi>Plunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
did affirme, and so by severall meetings it was resolved on by them to desist
from that enterprize for that time, and to expect a more convenient time; but
before that their resolution Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> O <hi>Neale,</hi> and the afore-said Capt <hi>Brion</hi> O
<hi>Neale</hi> followed me to Dublin (as they said) to assist and advise me how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with that Colonell (but neither they nor Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> would be seene there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99895:120"/>
done at every meeting, alleadging for excuse, that I being first imployed in that
matter, it would not be expedient that they should be seene in it. And moreover
they would not know to be in the Towne but by a few of their friends, untill
they were in a manner ready to depart the Towne, at least as long as I was in
Towne, for I left them there: But when I made them acquainted with their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of desisting from that enterprise, they thought it convenient that we
should meet with Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> and Col. <hi>Burne,</hi> to see what was further to be
done concerning the former intention of their owne, and accordingly we did
send to them that they should meet us, and on that meeting it was where was
only Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> Colonell <hi>Burne,</hi> Captain <hi>Neale</hi> and <hi>my selfe;</hi> after
long debate it was resolved,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that we with all those that were of our Faction
should goe on with that determination that was formerly made, concluded to, to
rise out; moreover to seize on the Castle (as the Collonells were purposed, for
if it were not for their project and the advise sent by Col: <hi>Neale,</hi> we would
never venter to surprise it, neither was it ever thought on in all the meetings and
resolutions between, before that those Collonells did resolve on it; but by reason
that the other Gent. that were privy to these proceedings were not present, the
certainty of the time, and the manner how to execute it, was put off to a further
meeting in the country, and this was resolved in <hi>Dublin</hi> on the Sunday at night
being the 26. or 27. of <hi>Septem.</hi> and that meeting was appointed on the Saturday
following, at <hi>Mac Collo mac Mohones</hi> house in <hi>Farney</hi> in the county of <hi>Monaghan,</hi>
and thereupon we all left the Town, onely Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> stayed about some other his
private occasions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but did assare his being there at that day; and by reason that at
that meeting the Gent. of <hi>Leinster</hi> could not be, considering the remotenesse of
the place from them, it was thought fit that Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> should there meet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the finall resolution, and should acquaint them therewith; and in the mean
time Colonell <hi>Burn,</hi> who had undertaken for Col. <hi>Pluncket,</hi> should inform them
all of the intention conceived, and dispose them in readinesse against that day that
should be appointed; on Saturday I came to Mr. <hi>Mac Mohones</hi> house, there met
onely Mr. <hi>Mac Mohone</hi> himself, Captain <hi>Neale, Ever Mac Mohone,</hi> and my self,
(and thither that same day came the Messenger that was sent to Col. <hi>Neale,</hi> and
did report the Colonells Answer, and advise <hi>verbatim,</hi> as I have formerly repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Mr. <hi>Moore</hi>) and by reason that Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> his Brother or Mr. <hi>Philip Relly</hi>

they should follow us thither, (whether only went Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> Captain O <hi>Neale</hi>
and <hi>my selfe</hi>) and there we expected untill the Tuesday subsequent, before any
of those did come: On the Tuesday came Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> and <hi>Ever Mac Mahone,</hi> all
the rest failing to come, Mr. <hi>Mac Mahones</hi> wife was dead the night before,
which was the cause that he was not there, but I gave his assent to what should
be concluded to win therein, and execute what should be appointed him, and
then we sive, viz. Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> Captaine O <hi>Neale, Ever Mac Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hone,</hi>
and my <hi>selfe,</hi> assuring our selves that those Gent. absent would both allow
and joyne to what we should determine, did grow into a finall resolution,
grounding all or most part of our hope and confidence on the succour from Col.
<hi>Neale,</hi> to seaze on the Castle, and rise out all in one day, and the day was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99895:121"/>
on the 23. of that moneth (this being the fifth day of September, having
regard therein to the day of the weeke whereon that day did fall, which was the
Saturday, being the Market day, on which day there would be lesse notice taken
of people up and downe the streets; Then began a question who should be depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the surprisall of the Castle, and then Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> said he would be one of
them himselfe, and that Col. <hi>Burne</hi> should be another, and what other Gent, of
<hi>Leinster</hi> they could procure to joyne with them; and seeing the Castle had two
Gates, the one the great, and the other the little Gate, going down to my Lord
Lieutenants Stables, hard by which Stable without the Castle was the Store-house
for Armes, they of <hi>Leinster</hi> would undertake one Gate, and that should be the
little Gate, and the Gate should be undertaken by those of Ulster, and (said he)
of necessity one of you both (meaning Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> and me) must be there for the
meere countenance of that matter, it being the glory of all our proceedings, and
all that his speeches were well liked of all present, but Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from that imployment, and so would I, but then all of them set on me,
desiring me to be one,<note place="margin">Note.</note> alleadging for reason that their proceedings and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were very honourable and glorious, it being for Religion, and for to procure
more liberty for their Country, as did (say they) of late Scotland, and that in
taking the Castle consisted all the glory and honour of that said Act, all
which should be attributed to them which should be imployed therein, and
so by consequence all or most part to be there,<note place="margin">Note.</note> being (as they said) the
chiefe in that enterprise, and more, Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> said, that he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to take or procure others to take LONDON-DERRY the
same day, and if he should be away that place would not be taken: with
these, and many other perswasions they obtained my consent, and then the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
offered himselfe; they began to thinke what number should be imployed in
that Act, and they concluded on two hundred men, a hundred from each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
for those States which they seaze on: of which number Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale</hi>
should send forty with an able sufficient Gentleman to conduct them, and likewise
Captaine <hi>Neall</hi> twenty, Mr. Colonell <hi>Mac Mahone,</hi> Mr. <hi>Relly,</hi> ten more, and I
should bring twenty two. Then began a doubt how they should raise those men, and
convey them to Dublin without suspition? and it was answered, that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of carrying them to those Colonells that were conveying souldiers out of
the Kingdome, it might safely be done; and to that purpose Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> and the Captaine had severall blanke Pattent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with deputations to
make Captaines to those Colonells, which they sent to those Gentry that should
send men to Dublin: for the more colour they be thought of what was to be done
in the Country that day,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and it was resolved that every one privie to that matter
in every part of the Kingdome should rise out that day, and seaze on all the
Forts and Armes in the severall Counties, to make all the Gentry Prisoners, the
more to assure themselves against any averse fortune, and not to kill any but
where of necessity they should be forced thereunto by opposition (and that
those that were appointed for taking the Castle should observe) and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
the Gentry: all their Army in Ulster to take that day London Derry, which
Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> did undertake, and <hi>Knockfergus</hi> which they thought Sir <hi>Henry
Mac</hi> O <hi>Neale</hi> would doe, and to that end Sir <hi>Phelims</hi> brother <hi>Terlagh</hi> O
<hi>Neale</hi> should be sent to them; and the Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie, which should be undertaken
by Sir <hi>Conne Kenish,</hi> and his Brothers, for whom Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> (in regard they
were his Brothers in Law, his deceased Lady being their Sister) did undertake:
Moreover it was agreed, that Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> Mr. <hi>Relly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Coll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and my Brother should, with all the speed they could after that day, raise all the
forces they could, and follow us to Dublin, but to arme the men and succour us,
and defend and Garrison the Towne and Castle, and likewise Master <hi>Moore</hi>
should appoint Leinster Gentry to send like supply of men. Then there was feare
of the Scots conceived, that they should presently oppose themselves, and that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99895:121"/>
that would make the matter more difficult, and to avoyd which danger, it was
resolved on not to meddle with them, or any thing belonging to them, and to
demeane themselves towards them as if they were of themselves, which they
thought would pacifie them from any opposition,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and if the Scots would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of that offer of Amity, but would oppose them, they were in good hope
to cause a stir in Scotland that might divert them from them, and I beleeve the
ground for that hope was, that two yeares before, in or about the beginning of

out of Spaine, and that this I take it was the time that he was in Treaty with
Cardinall <hi>Richelieu</hi> to my Lord of <hi>Argile,</hi> to treat with him for helpe from my
Lord, for him to come into Ireland as was said for Marriage, between the said
<hi>Earle</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Argiles</hi> Daughter (or Sister, I know not which) and this
Messenger was in Ireland, with whom Mr. <hi>Torilagh</hi> O <hi>Neale,</hi> Sir <hi>Phelims</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had conference from whom this relation was had: that said Messenger went
into Scotland, as I did heare from the said Mr. <hi>Neale,</hi> or from <hi>Emer Mac Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hone</hi>

I thinke) to a great Lady in Scotland, I know not her name, but did heare that
she was much imbarked in the troubles of that Kingdome;<note place="margin">Note.</note> then she questioning
how they could subsist against the two Kingdomes of England and Ireland, that
if the King did endeavour to stir Ireland against them, he would kindle such a
fire in Ireland as would hardly or never be quenched: And moreover, they
knew my Lord to be powerfull with the Ilanders, Red-shankes in Scotland,

we parted. The next day being Wednesday, from Lough Rosse every man went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his own task, and so when I came home I acquainted my Brother with al that
was done, and what they had appointed him to doe, and did like according as
they appointed me, send to Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> to let him know as much, and the 18. of
the same moneth I began my Iourney to Dublin, and when I came to Dublin
(being the day before the appointed day of putting that resolution in execution
there, I met with Captaine <hi>Conn O Neale,</hi> sent out of the Low Countries by
Colonell <hi>O Neale,</hi> who was sent after the Messenger sent by us formerly to the said

Colonell upon our Resolution of the day to give notice thereof to him, and that
he would be within fourteen daies over with them with ayde, but he landed nine
or ten daies before, and meeting with Captaine <hi>Brian O Neale,</hi> who made him
acquainted with what was resolved, he did write all the matter to Col. <hi>O Neale,</hi>
so as he was sure of his speedy comming; and so that Evening he and I came to

taking an accompt of those that should have been there, it was found that Sir

Col. <hi>Burne</hi> did misse Sir <hi>Morgan Kennanaugh</hi> that had promised him to be there,

but he said he was sure he would not faile to be that night or the next morning in
Town, and of the two hundred men that was appointed there was only eighty
present, yet notwithstanding they were resolved to goe on in their resolution,
and all the difference was at what time of the day they would set on the Castle;
and after some debate it was resolved in the after-noone, and the rather hoping
to meete the Col. there then, for they said, if they should take the Castle, and
be enforced by any extreamity for not receiving timely succour out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

the other 16. or 17. which <hi>Art.</hi> was also taken there and put in prison, and for

English Protestants (that were then present) upon oath before the said Sir <hi>William

            <p>And further I say, that I have heard sundry credible persons in Ireland relate,
that the Roman Catholiques in that Kingdome,<note place="margin">Note.</note> did brag and report that they did
destroy 152000. Protestants in the province of Ulster, in the beginning of this

riches of the said Castle and Town, but to have also the Barony of Clanawley
granted and confirmed in Fee to them and their Heires from the said Lord <hi>Mac
Gwire</hi> and his Heires. And the said <hi>Don Mac Gwire</hi> was for the same taken (in
February or March last, or there abouts by the said Sir <hi>William Cole,</hi> to whom
he confessed upon his Examination, that he was to have surprised and taken the
Castle and Town of Eniskillin the 23. of Octo. 1641. but denyed that he had any
intent to kill the said Sir <hi>William,</hi> or his wife, or children; wherefore the said Sir
<hi>William</hi> did commit him to prison in his Majesties goal at Eniskillin about February
or March 1643. where he remained the 18. of May 1644. when the said sir <hi>William</hi>

reputed the Kings good subjects, and sent for over into <hi>England</hi> to commit the like cruelties on

came to me the Lord Iustice <hi>Parsons</hi> to my house, and in great secrecy (as indeed
the case did require) discovered unto me a most wicked &amp; damnable Conspiracy,
plotted and contrived, and intended to be also acted by some evill-affected Irish
Papists here. The Plot was on the next morning, Saturday the 23. of Octob. being
<hi>Ignatius</hi> day, about nine of the clock to surprise his Majesties Castle of Dublin, his
Majesties chiefe strength of this Kingdom, wherein also is the principall Magazine
of his Majesties Armes and Ammunition, and it was agreed (it seemes) amongst
them; that the same houre all other his Majesties Forts, and Magazins of Armes
and Ammunition in this Kingdome should be surprised by others of those Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99895:126"/>
and further,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that all the Protestants and English throughour the whole
Kingdom that would not joyn with them should be cut off, and so those Papists
should then become possessed of the government and Kingdom at thesame instant.</p>
                  <p>As soone as I had that Intelligence, I then immediatly repaired to the Lord
Iustices Palace, and thereupon we instantly Assembled the Councell, and having
sate in Councell all that night, as also all the next day, the 23. of October, in
regard of the short time left us for the consultation of so great and waighty a
matter: although it was not possible for us upon so few houres warning, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
those other great mischiefes which were to be acted even at that same houre,
and at so great a distance as in all the other parts of the Kingdome; yet such was
our industry therein, having that night caused the Castle to be that night
strengthned with armed men, and the City guarded as the united councells of
those evill persons (by the great mercy of God to us) became defeated, so as
they were not able to Act that part of their Treachery which indeed was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,
and which if they could have effected would have ended the rest of their
purposes the more easie. Having so secured the Castle, we forth-with laid about
for the apprehension of as many of the offenders as we could, many of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
come to this City, but that night intending (it seemes) the next morning
to Act their parts in those treacherous and bloudy crimes.</p>
                  <p>The first man apprehended was one <hi>Hugh Mac Mahone</hi> Esquire (Grand-so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n
to the Traytor <hi>Tirone</hi>) a Gentleman of a good fortune in the County of Monog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han;
who with others was taken that morning in Dublin, having at the time of
their apprehension offered a little resistance, with their swords drawn; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those we imployed against them more in number, and better armed yeilded:
He upon his Examination before us at first denyed all, but in the end when he
saw we laid it home to him, he confessed enough to destroy himself, and impeach
some others, as by a Copy of his Examination herewith sent may appeare to your
Lordship. We then committed him untill we might have further time to examine
him againe, our time being become more needfull to be imployed in Action for
securing this place then in examining.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> had been abroad, and served the King of Spaine as a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Colonell.</p>
                  <p>Upon conference with him and others, and calling to mind a Letter we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the weeke before from sir <hi>William Cole,</hi> a Copy whereof we send your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
here inclosed we gathered that the Lord <hi>Magwire</hi> (was to be an Actor in
surprising the Castle of Dublin; wherefore we held it necessary to secure him
immediatly, thereby also to startle and deter the rest when they found him laid
fast: his Lordship observing what we had done, and the City in Armes, fled
from his Lodging early before day (it seemes) disguised, for we had laid a watch
about his Lodging, so as we thinke he could not passe without disguising himselfe,
yet he could not get forth of the City, so surely guarded were all the gates.</p>
                  <p>There were found at his Lodging hidden some Hatchets with the Helves new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut off close to the Hatchets,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and many Skeines, and some Hammers. In the
end the Sheriffes of the City, whom we imployed in strict search of his Lordship,
found him hidden in a Cockloft, in an obscure house farre from his Lodging,
where they apprehended him, and brought him before us.</p>
                  <p>He denyed all, yet so as he could not deny but he had heard of it in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
though he would not tell us when or from whom; and confessed that he
had not advertised us thereof as in duty he ought to have done. But we were so
well satisfied of his guilt by all circumstances, as we doubted not upon further
Examination when we could be able to spare time for it, finde it apparent; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we hold it of absolute necessity to commit him close prisoner, as we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
done, <hi>Mac Mahone</hi> and others, where we left them on the 23. of this
moneth in the morning, about the same houre they intended to have been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of that place, and this City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:99895:126"/>
That morning also we laid wait for all those Strangers that came the night before to
Town, and so many were apprehended, whom we finde reason to belive to have hands
in this Conspiricy, as we were forced to disperse them into severall Goales; and wee
since found that there came many Horsemen into the Suburbs that night, who finding
the Plot discovered, disperst themselves immediately.</p>
                  <p>When the houre approached, which was designed for surprizing the Castle, great
numbers of Strangers were observed to come to Town in great parties severall wayes,
who not finding admittance at the Gates, staid in the Suburbs, and there grew numerous,
to the terrour of the Inhabitantss; we therefore to help that, drew up, and instantly
signed a Proclamation, commanding all men, not dwellers in the City or Suburbs, to
depart within an houre upon paine of death, and made it alike penall to those that
should harbour them; which Proclamation the Sheriffe Immediatly proclaimed in all
the Suburbs by our commandement, which being accompanied with the example and
terrour of the committall of those two eminent men and other, occasioned the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of those multitudes: And in this case all our lives and fortunes, and above all, his
Majesties Power and regall Authority being still at the stake,<note place="margin">Note.</note> we must vary from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
proceedings, not onely in executing Martiall Law as we see cause, but also
in putting some to the Rack to finde out the bottome of this Treason, and all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
thereof, which wee foresee will not otherwise be done.</p>
                  <p>On that 23 day of this Moneth, we conceiving that as soone as it should be known,
that the Plot for s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>izing <hi>Dublin</hi> Castle was disappointed, all the Conspiratos in the
remote parts, might be somewhat disheartned; as on the other side, the good Subjects
would be comforted, and would then with the more confidence stand on their guard,
did prepare to send abroad to all parts of the Kingdom this Proclamation, which we
send you herein inclosed, and so having provided that the City and Castle should bee
so well guarded, as upon the sudden wee could provide, wee concluded that long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
consultation.</p>
                  <p>On Saturday at twelve of the clock at night, the Lord <hi>Blaney</hi> came to Town, and
brought us the ill newes of the Rebels seizing with 200 men his House (at Castle
<hi>Blainey,</hi> in the Countey of <hi>Monoghan,</hi> and his wife, children, and servants; as also a
House of the Earle of <hi>Essexs</hi> called <hi>Carrickmacrosse</hi> with 200 men, and a house of Sir
<hi>Henry Spotwords</hi> in the same County with 200 men, where there being a little Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Brittish,<note place="margin">Note.</note> they plundered the Town and divers houses, and it since appeares that
they burnt divers other Villages, and robbed and spoyled many English and none but
Protestants, leaving the English Papists untouched as well as the Irish.</p>
                  <p>On Sunday morning at three of the clock, we had intelligence from Sir <hi>Arthur Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ingham,</hi>
that the Irish in the Town had that day also broken up the Kings store of Arms,
and Munition at <hi>Newry,</hi> where the store for Arms hath been ever since the Peace, and
where they found threescore and ten barrels of Powder, and armed themselves, and
put them under command of Sir <hi>Con-Magenis</hi> Knight, and one <hi>Cerly</hi> a Monke, and
plundered the English there, and disarmed the Garrison: And this though to much, is
all that we yet heare is done by them.</p>
                  <p>However wee shall stand on our guard the best we may to defend the Castle and
City principally, those being the peeces of most importance: But if the Conspiracie
be so universall as <hi>Mac Mahoun</hi> saith, in his Examination it is, namely, that all the
Counties of the Kingdome have conspired in it,<note place="margin">Note</note> which wee admire should so fall out in
this time of universall peace, and carried with that secresie that none of the English could
have any friend amongst them to disclose it; then indeed we shall be in high extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Kingdom in the greatest danger that ever it underwent, considering our want
of men, money, and armes, to enable us to encounter so great multitudes as they can
make, if all should so joyne against us: the rather because we have pregnant cause to
doubt that the Combination hath taken force by the incitement of Iesuits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and Fryars.</p>
                  <p>All the hope we have here is that the old English of the Pale, and some other Parts,
will continue constant to the King in their fidelity as they did in former Rebellions.</p>

                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:99895:127"/>
And now in these streights, we much under God depend on aide forth of <hi>England</hi> for
our present supply with all speed, especially money we having none; and Armes which
we shall exceedingly want, without which we are very doubtfull what account wee
shall give to the King of his Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>But if the Conspiracy be only of <hi>Mac Guire</hi> and some other Irish, of the kindred and
friends of the Rebell <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and other Irish in the Counties of <hi>Down, Monaghan,
Cavan, Termanagh,</hi> and <hi>Armagh,</hi> and no generall revolt following thereupon, we hope
then to make head against<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>them in a reasonable measure, if we be enabled with money
from thence, without which we can raise no forces; so great is our want of moneys as
we have formerly written, and our debt so great to the Army; nor is money to be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
here, and if it were, we could engage all our estates for it; neither have we any
hope to get in his Majesties Rents and Subsidies in these disturbances, which addes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely
to our necessities.</p>
                  <p>On Sunday morning the 24, we met again in Councell, and sent to all parts of the
Kingdome the inclosed Proclamation, and issued Pattents to draw hither seven horse
Troopes, as a further strength to this place, and to be with us, in case the Rebels shall
make head, and march hitherward, so as we may be necessitated to give them Battell;
we also then sent away our Letters to the Presidents of both the Provinces of <hi>Munster</hi>
and <hi>Conaught:</hi> and we likewise then sent Letters to the Sheriffes of the five Counties of
the Pale, to consult of the best way and meanes of their own preservation; That day the
Lord Viscount <hi>Fitzwilliam,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Houth,</hi> and since the Earle of <hi>Kildare,
Trigall,</hi> and the Lords of <hi>Dunsany</hi> and <hi>Slane,</hi> all Noble men of the English Pale, came
unto u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, declaring that they then, and not before, heard of the matter, and professed all
Loyalty to his Majesty, and concurrence with the State; but said they wanted Armes,
whereof they desired to bee supplyed by us, which wee told them we would willingly
doe, as relying much on their faithfulnesse to the Crown; but wee were not yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
whether or no we had enough to Arme our strength, for the Guard of the City
and Castle, yet we supplyed such of them as lay in most danger, with a small proportion
of Arms and Ammunition for their Houses, lest they should conceive we apprehended
any jealousie of them: And wee commanded them to be very diligent in sending out
Watches, and making all the discoveries they could, and thereof to advertise us, which
they readily promised to doe.</p>
                  <p>And if it fall out that the Irish generally rise, which we have cause to suspect, then
we must of necessity put Armes into the hands of the English Pale in present, and to
others as fast as wee can, to fight for defence of the State and themselves.</p>
                  <p>Your Lordship now sees the condition wherein we stand, and how necessary it is
first that we enjoy your presence speedily, for the better guiding of these and other the
publike affaires of the King and Kingdome: and secondly, that the Parliament there be
moved immediately to advance to us a good sum of money, which being now speedily
sent hither, may prevent the expence of very much Treasure and blood in a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
warre: and if your Lordship shall happen to stay on that side any long time, we
must then desire your Lordship to appoint a Lievtenant. Generall to discharge the great
and weighty burthen of commanding the Forces here.</p>
                  <p>Amidst these confusions and disorders fallen upon us, we bethought us of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was formerly adjourned to <hi>November</hi> next, and the Terme now also at
hand, which will draw such a concourse of people hither, and give opportunity, under
the pretence of assembling and taking new councells, seeing the former seemes to bee
in some part disappointed, and of contriving further danger to this State and people; wee
have therefore found it of unavoydable necessity to prorogue the Parliament to the 24
day of <hi>February</hi> next, and therefore we doe by Proclamation prorogue it accordingly,
and to direct the Term to be adjourned to the first of Hillary Terme, excepting only the
Court of Exchequer for hasting in the Kings money if it be possible.</p>
                  <p>We desire that upon this occasion, your Lordship will be pleased to view our letters
concerning the Plantation of <hi>Conaught</hi> dated the 24 of <hi>April</hi> last, directed to Mr Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

In the last place, we must make known to your Lordship, that the Army we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting

of the foure Provinces for the security of those parts, as they continually have been since
they were so reduced, as if they be all sent for to be drawn together, not only the places
whence they are to bee drawne, and for whose safety they lie there, must be by
their absence distressed; but also the Companies themselves comming in so small
numbers may bee in danger to be cut off in their March; nor indeed have we any
money to pay the Souldiers to enable them to March. And so we take leave an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Queens sending Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> to him for a <hi>Cardinals Cap</hi> for
the Lord <hi>Aubeny</hi> (since made an Abbot in <hi>France</hi>) and intimating that there is some
designe to make the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> a professed Papist, Governour of <hi>Bristoll</hi> ere long, and
to put that City and Castle into the Papists hands; where thousands of them at this
present reside, and some overtures of putting this designe in speedy execution (if our late
intelligence thence deceive us not) have been lately made, and much feared by
the Inhabitants. This Letter was intercepted in its passage towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
brought to the Committee of Examinations, where the Originall remaines, out of
which I copied it.</p>
