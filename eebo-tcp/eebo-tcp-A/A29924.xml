The authorship has been attributed to François van Aerssen, 1572-1641, and to his grandson François van Aerssen, 1630-1658.  The latter was the traveler, accompanied by Antoine de Brunel, who seems to have been the author (cf. Foulché-Delbose. Bibl. des voyages en Espagne et en Portugal, p. 63-65).</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Preſent you the
vaſt body of the
Spaniſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
which,
though it hath ſpread its roots
into many and diſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
is but of late growth,
having but little before the laſt
age firſt aſpired, not only to a
competition with the two anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb facs="tcp:42656:3"/>
ballancing powers of
Chriſtendom, <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France</hi> (for two they were
when <hi>France</hi> depended not on
<hi>England)</hi> but the Empire of
the World. Our near concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
either in peace or war
with it, rendring it very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be known to us, I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſhew it you in ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
remarks of the people
and Countrey, as I think you
have not yet ſeen, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of obſervation on its
ſodain advance, and almoſt
as ſodain decay; ſo that it
is no longer a competitor
with the other two, but
<pb facs="tcp:42656:3"/>
ſo much fallen from it,
it could ſcarcely any longer
ſubſiſt, did not the moderation
and juſtice of one of thoſe
Monarchs, oblige him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to joyn in ſupporting
its Throne, then enjoy his
ſhare of the many advantages,
his maritime power and ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of his Dominion, might
reaſonably promiſe by the fall
of it; eſpecially in regard by
ſending abroad he ſhall not
need to fear ſuch a depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
as it ſuffers under, when
his doors ſhall be opened by
Acts of Naturalization and
Regiſters, to admit and ſecure
<pb facs="tcp:42656:4"/>
ſuch as (out of conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the fertility of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
temperature of its Air,
and convenience for Trade)
will abundantly ſupply what
may be ſo exhauſted.</p>
            <p>The time of taking this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
ſufficiently diſcovers it
ſelf in it, and though ſome
years ſince relates to ſeveral ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
modern tranſactions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
of the higheſt concern,
as the Engliſh rebellion, renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation

either in its Government, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,

            <p>You have in it a clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of decay of Power, with

Metals for which this People

you abound in all things elſe

Maſters of the Fountains of

and miſerable as you fancy your
ſelves to be in the want of
<pb facs="tcp:42656:5"/>
them alone. It makes no leſs
evident that when a Nation
(eſpecially its Nobility and
Gentry) contemns or neglects
Arms, it is at the higheſt, if not
declining. If it be a little Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirical
as to the haughtineſs and

            <head>A
JOURNEY
INTO
SPAIN.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen we left <hi>Italy,</hi> we reſolved for
<hi>Spain;</hi> but becauſe <hi>M. P.</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Son ſhould take that Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
with us, had ordered him to
expect us at <hi>Monpellier,</hi> whither
he had commanded him to repair, from the houſe
of a Gentleman of <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> where he had reſided
ſome months, we were obliged to tarry for him.
He came not till the later end of <hi>December,</hi> the
extremity of which ſeaſon preſſing us to ſpend
the Winter there, we deferred our departure till
the Spring: and the weather in <hi>Languedoc</hi> being
pleaſant in March, we went away the 6th of that
month. I ſhall not concern my ſelf in deſcribing
what we ſaw in that moſt agreeable Province,
nor in repeating what we learned that was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
whilſt we traverſed it almoſt from one
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42656:6"/>
end to the other; nor yet ſay any thing of <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony,</hi>
through which we paſſed; nor of <hi>Bayonne,</hi>
where we took our leaves of <hi>France.</hi> Having
travail'd thoſe parts only as they lay in our way
to <hi>Spain,</hi> I ſhall reſerve all my curioſity for it,
and not charge my Table-book with any obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
till I come to the Frontiers of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
That I may not neglect many particulars
I learned of the Government, Cuſtoms, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Condition of the Imperious Nation that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits
it, I will here make an Extract of what I
ſcattered in ſeveral Papers during our abode at
<hi>Madrid:</hi> to put which into method, were to
unravel confuſion it ſelf; every thing ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have its place, as I ſaw or heard it; and if
ſome be repeated more than once, it is becauſe I
deſign not a poliſhed work, but to give liberty to
my diſcourſe according to Time, Place, Perſons,
Companies, and Entertainments, and ſuch refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
as have preſented from them; not
confining my ſelf to what I ſaw, or happened to
me, or my Company, but enlarging to what was
told us, having ever endeavoured to get the beſt
informations poſſible. It ought not to ſeem
ſtrange if in ſome places I happen to ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths
without lying, and in others to wander
without knowing I am out of the way, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting
my Book to thoſe only that have ſeen its
foundations laid, and materials gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to ſerve us as memorials of part of that time
which for ſix years we employed in ſtudying the
World in its great School, which is Travail: The
miſtakes and errors made either by me, or ſuch
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42656:6"/>
as I converſed with, will not to them appear very
conſiderable or uneaſie to be effaced as ſoon as
diſcovered: and if it accidentally happen into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hands, they may make choice of what is
weighty and certain, leaving what ſeems light
and doubtful, without any juſt cauſe of complaint
againſt me on account of that which I write not
for their ſakes. I have nevertheleſs endeavoured
to make as few errors as poſſible, and what I ſet
down at night according to the ſeveral Objects
and Companies of the day, I overlook'd next
morning, and made farther enquiry of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as I thought likely to diſabuſe me if ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and give me clearer light if what I had
received were imperfect. According to this
method I have (better or worſe) ſatisfied my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
in examining this grave and haughty Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at its own home, ſince it ſeldom goes abroad
unleſs to command others, and ſecure its King
of their obedience by Garriſons and Colonies ſent
into all parts of his Dominions in the new and old
World, and by the Governments and Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
he beſtows upon it, with an intire excluſion
of the Inhabitants of thoſe Countries to which
he diſtributes them.</p>
            <p>Reſolving to enter by way of <hi>St. Sebaſtian,</hi>
which is the moſt eaſie, we lodged at the laſt
Town of <hi>France</hi> called <hi>St. John de Luz.</hi> It is the
Seat of Commerce between the two Frontiers,
and may paſs for a good City, being large, well
built, and rich: Its Mariners are eſteemed and
employed in fiſhing for Cods, and Whales; and
we found Dutch men there that had hired fifty to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42656:7"/>
be made uſe of at <hi>New-found-land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as we had paſſed <hi>Baione</hi> we perceived
the humour of the people to incline to that of
their Neighbourhood, being inſolent and little
complying with ſtrangers: the women in paſſing
the Streets caſt their Coats over their heads, and
ſo to cover their cheeks diſcover their buttocks.
The next day we wanted but two leagues to the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominion, and at a good diſtance diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Fontarabia,</hi> a Fort at the falling of <hi>Bidaſſao</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſea: This River, or rather Torrent, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
the two Kingdoms; it is pretty broad at the
Ferry, the Country thereabouts being fenny, and
ebs and flows with the Sea: at low water it is in
many places fordable. <hi>Andaie</hi> a little Town or
Village is ſeated on its bank, right over againſt
<hi>Fontarabia,</hi> and ſeparated from it only by that
ſtream: but we were fain to go higher to ſeek
the Ferry-boat, and were troubled how to find
it, having been wrong directed by the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,
who does all ill offices he can to thoſe
that travail on their own horſes: The <hi>Toll</hi> paid
by the Boats goes half to the <hi>French,</hi> and half to
the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> one of them receiving it of ſuch as
paſs into <hi>Spain,</hi> and the other of thoſe that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
into <hi>France,</hi> but both of them equally ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Paſſenger. Theſe Frontiers have no leſs
Communication than if there were no war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Nations; and it is well for them
it is ſo; for otherwiſe an univerſal deſolation
would follow. The Country is barren and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous,
producing nothing but Iron, as well that
which belongs to <hi>France,</hi> as that which is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42656:7"/>
by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which is the greateſt part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It is called <hi>Biſcai:</hi> the language is underſtood on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
by the Inhabitants, and ſo poor that one word
hath diverſe ſignifications, ſo that it cannot
without difficulty be made uſe of in Commerce:
None write it, and the Children at School learn
French or Spaniſh, as they are ſubject to either
King.</p>
            <p>It does not a little ſurpriſe, when having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Bidaſſao,</hi> one is no more underſtood without
ſpeaking Spaniſh, when a moment before French
was intelligible. Half a quarter of a league further
is <hi>Iron,</hi> the firſt Town belonging to the King of
<hi>Spain;</hi> they neither demand Paſsport nor Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of any's buſineſs; and one would think
there were neither warr nor diſtruſt; only the
Alcalde came for two Reals as a due belonging to
him: but ſuch as return and paſs into <hi>France</hi> are
not uſed with the like indifference: We were
entertained at the Poſthouſe, much as we had
formerly been in <hi>Italy</hi> on the way to <hi>Naples,</hi> but
more ſlenderly: little Diſhes with little bits of
meat, made us deſpair of filling our bellies; but
at laſt one after another enow were brought to
ſatisfie us. When the reckoning came they flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
us, and we were forced to give four Crowns
for a Meal that was not worth one. Over ſeveral
Mountains, and by a way very rough and ſtony,
we got that night to lye at <hi>St. Sebaſtians,</hi> where
we arrived before we were aware, it being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by a great bank of ſand, which paſſed, the
Town appears at the foot of a Mountain that
keeps off the ſea, though ſhe embraces it almoſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42656:8"/>
on all ſides, and enters far enough to make a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
but for greater ſafety to Ships, there is a
Redout in form of a Baſin, they riding at the
Town ſide, and foot of the Mountain, where
they ſeem ſecure from ſtorms, though we were
told ſome have riſen to that height that they have
broken in pieces ſuch as anchored there.</p>
            <p>Greater Veſſels cannot enter, the water ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only for Barks and Shallops: Ships of Warr
ride a quarter of a league lower, towards <hi>Fonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi>
where is the Arſenal for the Oceans Fleet,
at preſent in no very good condition. It returned
from <hi>Bourdenux</hi> much weather-beaten, and for
want of money nothing is done towards refit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>St. Sebaſtian</hi> there is a great Ship on
the Stocks intended for Admiral: it will be a
ſtately Veſſel if ever finiſhed: we were told it
had been long in the condition in which we ſaw
it, and that more money had been ſpent about it
than would have ſerved for a dozen ſuch Fabricks,
of which the greateſt part became a prey to the
Overſeers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bilbo</hi> and <hi>St. Sebaſtian</hi> are the principal Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath on the Ocean;
<hi>Corugna</hi> alſo is ſpoken of, where the Marquis of
<hi>St. Cruz</hi> tarried ſomewhat too long, whileſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> for want of his Succors, was
ready to return to its Kings obedience: he could
not have choſen a fitter place to refreſh his Fleet,
none on that Coaſt abounding more with Limons
and Oranges, which from thence are tranſported
into <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> and if he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42656:8"/>
was better pleaſed there than he ſhould have
been in fighting, Monſieur <hi>de Vendoſme,</hi> he payed
dear enough for it, having been detained priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ever ſince his return from ſo famous an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
<hi>St. Sebaſtian</hi> is ſeated in a very little
Province called <hi>Guipuſcoa;</hi> Trafick draws to it
a great concourſe, though the Town be but ſmall,
it is very compact, and extremely populous, one
houſe containing ſeveral Families. A Merchant
Stranger is there forced to lodge with ſome Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
it not being permitted him to be a Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper:
many Dutch men are obliged to live in
this manner. The cuſtom was thus introduced;
ſtrangers at the firſt ſettling of Trafick out of
meer liberality gave their Landlords as a Gratuity
one in the hundred of all the Commodities they
ſold; and the Inhabitants to preſerve this profit
made ſuch an Order, which hath cauſed ſome that
would not obſerve it to be ſued at Law. That
which moſt pleaſed me in this Town, was, that
the Streets are wide, ſtreight, and very well pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with a broad ſtone, like that of <hi>Florence.</hi> The
principal Revenue of the Country is drawn from
Iron-mills, ſome of them of a very pure mettal,
and ſo rich they may furniſh all <hi>Europe:</hi> Wools
of old <hi>Caſtile</hi> are alſo ſhipped here, ſent in good
quantity by the Merchants of diverſe places. The
Baron of <hi>Batteville,</hi> a Gentleman of the <hi>Franch
Contie</hi> (who was then preſent) is Governor,
and with it of all <hi>Guipuſcoa.</hi> Though he hath
rendered very many good ſervices to <hi>Spain,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the Troubles of <hi>Gaſconie)</hi> and ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſoned
himſelf with Spaniſh Cuſtoms, that he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42656:9"/>
hath forgotten his own Language and Country;
this employment, to which that of Admiral is
joyned, draws on him no little envy. We waited
on him, and he received us well, but returned not
our Viſit, and we went away without bidding
him adieu. Here we ſtayed three dayes, and
kept our Eaſter: we had been recommended to
a worthy Merchant, who after Dinner carried us
to a Nunnery, where we heard moſt pitiful Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.
This Cloiſter is on an Eminence, from which
the Town that is overagainſt it may be very well
battered; and the Caſtle or Citadel which is on
the top of a hill, at whoſe foot the Town ſtands,
ſeems rather a Sentry-houſe to watch, than a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
to defend it.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday in Eaſter-week, having been
treated by our Merchant, we took the way of
<hi>Madrid,</hi> 84 leagues diſtant. The Country we
paſſed through is mountainous and barren, and
we perceived that we traverſed the tops of the
<hi>Pirenean,</hi> which almoſt divide <hi>Spain,</hi> as the <hi>Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine
Italy.</hi> Neceſſity quickly taught us the Mode
of the Country, which obliges Travailers to
buy in ſeveral places all accommodations neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.
We tarried a while at <hi>St. Sebaſtians,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to provide us a <hi>Moco de Mulas,</hi> that is a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
or Guide, to bring us to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to whom
it belongs to buy victual, and carry other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
Forty Crowns were demanded of us for
the attendance of one of thoſe Raſcals, which
being ſo dear, we reſolved not to take any, and
to guide our ſelves as well as we could. The part
of <hi>Moco de Mulas</hi> fell to my ſhare: I ſhall give
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42656:9"/>
you the particulars of this imployment, and of
travailing in <hi>Spain.</hi> At the firſt arrival at an Inn
you ask for Beds, which being provided, you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give the meat you bring raw with you to the
Hoſt to be dreſſed, or go your ſelf and buy it in
the Market: if you find any Capon, Pullet, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge
you ſeek to make ſure of them. We were
told we ſhould meet plenty of the laſt, fatter,
larger, and better than thoſe of <hi>France;</hi> but in
all our Journey we found but one, neither had it
all thoſe advantages. The beſt way is to carry
your proviſion along with you in Wallets, and
provide what you find on the place to be made
uſe of the next day. Coming to your Inn, you
go abroad to buy bread, wine, and eggs; for
ſomething of thoſe is uſually to be had, but none
allowed to ſell them except ſuch as farm that
Priviledge: Exciſe goes ſo high, that the King
hath a <hi>quarto</hi> upon every egge. Theſe Inns are
ſad ſpectacles, and the ſight of them gives one a
belly full. The fire is made on a hearth in the
middle of the Kitchin, choked with ſo thick a
ſmoke, that you would think your ſelf in the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
of a Fox that the Hunters would drive out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a man or woman all in rags like a begger, and no
leſs lowſie, meaſures the wine to you, which is
drawn from a Hogs, or Goats skin, in which it is
kept, and which is to it both Barrel and Celler:
the beſt wine out of theſe is a very unpleaſant
liquor, having a moſt abominable taſte of the
pitched hide. The White-wine is as fiery as <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae,</hi>
yet bears not water, the leaſt drop being
mixed with it, becoming inſipid and without
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42656:10"/>
ſpirit. By what I have ſaid may be gathered how
ill living is in <hi>Spain;</hi> yet I found it not ſo bad as
I expected, eſpecially in <hi>Biſcai,</hi> though a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
leſs fertile then <hi>Caſtile.</hi> It is true indeed, that
being a Frontier, it is not ſo much taxed, and the
People enjoy greater liberty, and ſome proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may be found in the Inns, but at double their
value.</p>
            <p>About a day and a halfs Journey from <hi>St. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi>
we paſſed over a pretty high Mountain
called <hi>St. Adrians;</hi> it is none of the ſteepeſt or
craggieſt, but that which I found moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is that on the top of it runs a ridge of rock,
which hinders paſſing; one would think it pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
there by nature, as a fixed and inſurmounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſeparation between <hi>Biſcai</hi> and old <hi>Caſtile,</hi> in
ſuch a manner, that they have been fain to open
a way with much difficulty; for the rock is cut
thorough thirty or forty paces: In this there is
one houſe, which muſt needs be very well roofed,
having ſo great a Maſs of the quarry to cover it.
Freed from this wonderful paſſage, we deſcended
into old <hi>Caſtile,</hi> ſomething more plain, though not
much more fertil. We found here no leſs trouble
than on the <hi>Alpes</hi> at the Mountain of St. <hi>Godard,</hi>
night ſurpriſing us in the middle of the deſcent,
and for increaſe of our misfortune, we could get
no lodging at the next Village: this the more
incommoded us in regard one of our horſes had
loſt both his ſhoes before: notwithſtanding which
we were forced to ſeek entertainment in another
miſerable Village (to which the Hoſt was our
Guide) which afforded us only bread and wine,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42656:10"/>
and two wretched Beds, whoſe Sheets and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes
could not oblige us to put off our cloths.</p>
            <p>We began now to approach the heart of <hi>Spain,</hi>
having entred the old <hi>Caſtile,</hi> where ſtands the
City of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> for a long time the Seat of its
Kings, the Country is all ſand, and little hillocks
of unfertil earth, often interrupted by Mountains
hooded with rocks, unleſs in ſome few places
where ſmall Plains and Valleys appear, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
the Inhabitants ſuch proviſions as ſuſtain
them. But never did I ſee any Country leſs beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with Gardens: I know not whether by
reaſon the ſoil affords them not, or that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are not induſtrious enough to take care of
them.</p>
            <p>Coming near <hi>Vittoria,</hi> the firſt City of <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
we paſſed through the faireſt and beſt cultivated
Plain we had till then ſeen: that little City is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the end of it, as ſeemed to us, very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly:
we reſted there half a day, as well to ſhoe
our horſes, as to deliver a letter we had for the
Maſter of the Cuſtom-houſe, from whom we
hoped addreſſes neceſſary to continue our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
ſecurely. We heard rumours of Theeves, and
beyond <hi>Burgos</hi> a great Robberie had been lately
committed. This Letter was very uſeful to us,
for till then we had not been any wayes moleſted
about our horſes or baggage, but we were aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that had we only paſſed the Gate without a
Ticket from the Cuſtom-houſe all had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated.
It fell out very luckily for us to have a
letter to him that is the Kings Farmer, who as
ſoon as he had received it, viſited us, and not only
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42656:11"/>
cauſed a ſufficient Paſsport to be given us,
but made us a Preſent of Wine, Capons and
Neats-tongues, with which furniſhing our Knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks,
we had recourſe to them in caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
The civility of this <hi>Spaniard</hi> was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to us, and made us judge this Nation more
generous then the <hi>Italians,</hi> though they be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for their particular intereſts, and one of them
as little communicable as the other.</p>
            <p>The firſt of <hi>April</hi> we dined at <hi>Pancorbo,</hi> and
lay at <hi>Miranda,</hi> and the next day did the like
at <hi>Barbieſca</hi> and <hi>Monaſterio de Rodillas;</hi> the
Third we arried at <hi>Burgos,</hi> the chief City of
<hi>Caſtile,</hi> and ſo conſiderable in both <hi>Caſtiles,</hi>
that it poſſeſſes the firſt place, though diſputed
by <hi>Toledo:</hi> we were not at all troubled with
heat on our way, but not a little that day with
cold; a ſharp wind cauſed a hoar froſt, and in
ſome places Ice: <hi>Burgos</hi> is the coldeſt City of
<hi>Spain,</hi> being ſeated at the foot of a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
it hath formerly enjoyed a conſiderable
Trade, which of later days is almoſt loſt; it is
not very great; and the moſt remarkable things
in it are the Church and Arch-biſhops Palace,
admirable Fabricks for <hi>Spain,</hi> where generally
they build ill; in ſome places becauſe they are
poor, and in others for want of Lime and Stones,
ſo that in every part, and even in <hi>Madrid</hi> it
ſelf, many houſes are made of earth; and the
beſt Fabricks cimented with Clay inſtead of
Mortar. Another ornament of <hi>Burgos,</hi> is a
large and very convenient Bridge, paſſing from
the Suburbs to the City: its inhabitants are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42656:11"/>
thought to ſpeak the beſt <hi>Caſtilian;</hi> this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory,
of a certain breeds the beſt ſoldiers, and
very few afford the King a greater number; we
received extraordinary civilities from a Merchant,
to whom we were recommended by the Cuſtomer
of <hi>Vittoria.</hi> He did not only inquire us out com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
for our journey to <hi>Madrid,</hi> becauſe of the
danger of Thieves; but finding us in a lodging
where we could not be well entertained, after
ſhewing us the Town, carried us to his Houſe,
where he Treated us at Dinner with a frankneſs,
much more valuable then his good cheer; it was
ſerved in diſh after diſh, and began by a ſlender
potage, with two or three ſlices of bread in it;
every one of us had an earthen porrenger of
it preſented him, but the Saffron and Pepper
gave ſuch a hogo, it could hardly be eaten.
It was on a <hi>Saturday</hi> and according to the cuſtom
of that Countrey to eat on ſuch days, the heads
and intrails of Sheep and Oxen, we had ſuch
meats, ſo that we fared much better then we
ſhould have done by hunting among the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
and victualing houſes to make our own
proviſion: beſides, the gallantry of his manner
of Treating, ſurprzed us, conducting us with a
great deal of freedom into the chamber where
the Cloth was laid, and his wife lay ſick abed of
a Quartane Ague; that day I ſpurred up my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
to furniſh me with all the Spaniſh, had
lain dormant there, ſince I ſtudied it at <hi>Florence,</hi>
and lighting on any expreſſion of civility,
repeated it ſo often, that it was very evident,
Compliments were ſcarce with me; <hi>M. P.</hi> ſpoke
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42656:12"/>
now and then a word, and <hi>M. S.</hi> was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſilent, ſo that the burthen of the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lay all on me, who knew not very well how
to acquit my ſelf, eſpecially, when the wife
began to ſpeak from the bed; I knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I was to Treat her with <hi>Vueſtra Merced,</hi> or
<hi>Vueſtra Sennoria,</hi> which ſo confounded me, that
often ſuppoſing, the firſt belonged onely to men,
I bluſhed as if I had committed ſome hainous
crime, and recalling my ſelf, brought out the
ſecond, due only to perſons of eminent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
for <hi>Vueſtra Merced</hi> is of all genders, and
ſo common, that Grooms and Footmen ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
one another with it: To bring my ſelf
off, I drank her good health, ſaying, <hi>Sennora
a la Salud de</hi> XXXX and there was gravell'd,
not knowing which word to chuſe, and I think
I made uſe of both, <hi>que dios le dia prompta gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,</hi>
I cannot tell whether ſhe underſtood me,
for I have ſince been told, the laſt word is not
Spaniſh; but this I am ſenſible of, that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a great incivility by putting off my Hat,
which is never done there at Table: Having
made better uſe of our teeth then tongues,
it was at laſt, time to be gone; the Maſter of the
houſe, according to the cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
leading the way, for as they button con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to other nations, they are alſo contrary in
this particular; and they ſay, that in accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the ſtranger, the Maſter of the houſe goes
firſt to leave the other in poſſeſſion. I forgot to
give the woman a parting Compliment. Coming
back to the Inn, where we alighted, we found
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42656:12"/>
the widow that kept it, drunk, on which I muſt
take occaſion to ſay, that I never ſaw ſo many
women drunk in <hi>Germany,</hi> as on this ſide the
<hi>Pireneans;</hi> this was the ſecond that gorged
with wine, which they ſend for to Taverns,
came to piſs before us all in the Stable. Though
we had almoſt reſolved to lie at <hi>Burgos,</hi> as ſoon
as we had left our Merchant, our minds alter'd,
becauſe we were told that three Leagues from
thence we ſhould find a very good Inn, but our
ſervants being walked abroad, had like to have
hindred our putting this in execution. One of
them having enter'd a Church with ſpurs on,
the Gates were ſhut upon him, till he payed
money exacted as on ſhipboard, but at laſt he
freed himſelf; we preſently took horſe, and as
ſoon as out of Town, miſſed our way; after which,
making uſe of a Prieſt we met with for our guide,
we happened to be very ill lodged: the next day
cold and rainy, we dined at <hi>Lerma,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lit on a good Inn, we continued till the
morning after; we went to ſee the Palace of the
Lord of it, next the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> eſteemed the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in <hi>Spain,</hi> It is a vaſt Fabrick, but ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd,
without either Garden or Plantation for
Walks: being holiday, the inhabitants were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
drinking in a large Hall, into which, as
ſoon as we enter'd, they very civilly preſented
us Wine, and the Corrigidor, or chief Officer of
the place, entertained and ſhewed us ſeveral
rooms of the Palace.</p>
            <p>Leaving <hi>Lerma</hi> the 5th, we arrived at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi>
the 9th. where we were very glad to be, as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42656:13"/>
well to reſt our ſelves as to enjoy a milder Climat,
for in <hi>Caſtile</hi> we were tormented with continual
cold wind and rain, and a Countrey ſo Steril,
that we could not but rejoyce to approach one
ſomething leſs ſavage. An inexpreſſible number
of <hi>French</hi> pilgrims paſs to and from <hi>St. James</hi> in
<hi>Galicia,</hi> the occaſion of the Spaniards calling them
<hi>Gavachos,</hi> this makes evident that <hi>France</hi> abounds
in people, and thoſe very idle, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to peſter the roads of <hi>Spain.</hi> Ignorance,
poverty and abuſe in matters of Religion, cauſe
this diſorder, and that a great many poor pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
(not entertain'd here as in <hi>Italy,</hi> the
Hoſpitals affording only houſe-room) die every
year in <hi>Spain.</hi> The beſt Town we ſaw on the way
was <hi>Aranda de Duero,</hi> where we provided our
ſelves to paſs the 7th the Mountain of <hi>Samoſierra,</hi>
which ſeparates Old <hi>Caſtille</hi> from New, in which
<hi>Madrid</hi> ſtands. Theſe paſſages are called Ports,
as if there were Rivers to be forded or ferried
over, and at firſt deceived us with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome rapid and difficult Torrent. This
day we ſuffered by rain, hail, ſnow, and wind,
and found not <hi>Spain</hi> hotter then other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
being almoſt frozen in ſo advanced a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and between the two <hi>Caſtiles.</hi> We were not
free from the Mountains, till within Three or
Four Leagues of <hi>Madrid,</hi> the ſnowy tops of
which are diſcerned at it: the Plain in which
it is ſeated is ſomewhat uneven, riſing and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every halfe quarter of a League: it is not
adorned by any one tree, the Land on that
ſide by which we went towards it is tilled, yet
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42656:13"/>
ſeems very barren, conſiſting onely of Sand and
light Earth, unleſs ſome few eminences; no wood,
and abundance of ſtones: the way all along is
good, as is uſual where Land is bad; and when
we enquired after it, we were anſwered with a
Spaniſh Rhodomontado, that we could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
miſs it, becauſe the greateſt high-way in the
world. On the ſide we enter'd it appears not
much, but on that where <hi>Buon retiro</hi> ſtands,
gives a very agreeable Proſpect. It is not walled,
the Streets are large, but foul, and ſtinking They
which calculate all the ordures caſt into them,
ſay they are daily perfumed by above a hundred
thouſand Cloſe-ſtools; the Pavement is ſo defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
and the Coaches ſo ill hung, that to ride
in them over ſo uneven ground is to be broken
on the Wheel. Houſes (as well as all things elſe)
are very dear here. They build only with brick
and clay, having little lime, and no ſtone but
what is brought ſeven leagues from about the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial.
A Houſe that in another place were very
inconſiderable is ſold here for 20 or 25 thouſand
crowns. Whoever builds is concluded to have a
Purſe very well lined. They which return from
Governments beyond ſea, demoliſh their Houſes
and build Palaces, which make appear they have
either been Viceroys of <hi>Naples,</hi> or Governors
of <hi>Flanders</hi> or <hi>Milan.</hi> In this manner this
Town, which is new, and the greateſt part very
ſlightly built, according to the abilities of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
becomes every day more beautiful, as
the better part of the Kings Revenue, is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to thoſe that have the managing of it.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42656:14"/>
               <hi>La Placa Major</hi> is very fair, ſomething more
long than large, the houſes on all ſides uniform,
and the higheſt in <hi>Madrid.</hi> They are all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
by two or three ranks of Balconies,
which ſerve to ſee the Feaſts of Bulls, the famouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Ceremonies of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Report ſpeaks this Divertiſement to have been
derived from the Moors, and indeed it ſavours
not a little of their Brutality: It ſuits ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the genius of this People, that no Town
is ſo mean but it hath its peculiar Feaſts, and
think a Curſe would follow ſhould they omit
ſolemniſe them. The King cannot abſent himſelf
from thoſe of <hi>Madrid</hi> without the murmurs of
the People. His Palace is at one end of the Town,
on an almoſt indiſcernable riſing, that ſide on
which we went to it enjoys the proſpect of a
little River, and part of a Valley in which are
ſome trees: by it he can paſs to <hi>la Caſa del
Campo,</hi> a wretched Houſe of Pleaſure, without
other Ornament than a few Walks in a Wood.</p>
            <p>On this Brook, rather than River, <hi>Philip</hi> the
Second built a very great and broad Bridge, ſome
of its arches not touched by any water: And I
believe it was rather made for a more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
paſſing the deſcent of the Valley, than to be
a great Bridge to little or no River. The Kings
Houſe hath nothing magnificent, yet is not ſo
mean as was reported to us. There is a very fair
Piazza before it, to which it repreſents no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome
Frontiſpice, were the building higher,
and a defective Tower finiſhed. It hath two Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangles
very large: All Councils meet in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42656:14"/>
Palace, and the King by private Galleries can go
to any of the Rooms where they ſit. There is a
great Concourſe, and no leſs noiſe, when any of
them are aſſembled: But in the Kings Apartment
all is very ſtill, and no body appears till he goes
to Maſs, the only time of ſeeing him: His Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdiers
are then drawn out on each ſide the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie,
by which he paſſes; Theſe are <hi>Germans,
Burgundians,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> about two or three
hundred, wearing all Liveries of yellow trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with red Velvet. When he comes from his
Apartment the Captain of the Gard goes before
him, and he is followed only by two or three
Perſons. Paſſing between theſe Halberdiers he
receives ſuch Petitions as are preſented him. One
day as he went to Chappel we would have gone
in before, the better to view him, but a Door-keeper
(as formerly happened at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> on
ſuch an occaſion) told us, that none were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
unleſs clothed in black. I liked no Houſe in
this Town ſo well as the Priſon, where yet I
would leaſt deſire to lodge: It is a maſſie ſolid
building, the Windows fortified with great barrs
of Iron, as much for ornament as ſecurity: they
are artificially wrought and guilded, ſo that my
miſtake will not ſeem very ſtrange, who at firſt
thought it the habitation of ſome Grandee of
<hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All agree that no City of <hi>Spain</hi> is ſo populous
as this, and excepting <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> I never
ſaw ſo many Coaches in any; they are drawn by
Mules only, and none but the Kings and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of his Horſe with more than four: They are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42656:15"/>
no wayes magnificent but in ſome ſlight guildings
of the Iron-works, and about the Boots: the
greateſt part of them are covered with waxed
cloth. On one ſide of the Town is the <hi>Prado,</hi> a
large Walk made uſe of for the <hi>Tour;</hi> near it is a
great Fabrick, but low, called <hi>Buen Retiro.</hi>
The Duke of <hi>Olivares,</hi> during his adminiſtration,
ſpent many Millions on a Structure that is not
very conſiderable: I ſaw but part of it, where
a Comedy was preparing with Scenes, that would
amount to a great expence; a <hi>Florentine</hi> was the
Undertaker. For ordinary Comedies here are
two Theaters, where they act every day: The
Players have to themſelves not above three half
pence for every perſon, the Hoſpital as much,
and as much the Town-houſe; to ſet down it
coſts ſeven pence, the whole amounting to fifteen
pence. I can ſay little to the Lines or Plots, not
being skilful enough in the language to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Poetry, nor the figurative faſhion of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that belongs to it: but know they play their
parts ill, few or none having either the meen or
genius of true Actors. They preſent by day-light,
ſo that their Scenes appear not with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
Their Clothes are neither rich, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to their Subject; and the Spaniſh ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
ſerves where the Scene is <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi>
The Playes I have ſeen have but three Acts, called
<hi>Jornadas:</hi> They uſually begin by a Prologue in
Muſick, but ſing ſo ill, that their harmony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
little Childrens whinings: Between the
Acts there is ſome little Farce, Dance, or Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
the moſt diverting of the whole Piece: The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42656:15"/>
people are ſo taken with them it is hard to get
place, the beſt being beſpoken, and the exceſſive
idleneſs of this Country, as that of <hi>England,</hi> is
made evident in that in <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, though there
are not Playes every day, there is no ſuch crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them. Having with ſome exactneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
the particularities of ſuch places as we ſaw,
I will now acquaint you with what I in general
obſerved of the Spaniſh humor and Government.
This Nation is thought to be very proud and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful,
but is really neither ſo much as it ſeems:
its meen doubtleſly is deceitful, and they which
frequent it find not all the vanity imagined, and
may perceive it to be a vice proceeding rather
from erroneous Morals than an inſolent temper.
To Hector it both in words and geſtures, ſeems
to them a ſymtome of a great ſoul; and viſiting
other Countries, little or not at all they diſcover
not this defect, derived to them from the firſt
milk they ſuck, and the firſt Sun gives them
light.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ſo ignorant that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not there is any other Country than <hi>Spain,</hi>
other City than <hi>Madrid,</hi> or King than their own.
When I ſpeak of ignorant <hi>Spaniards,</hi> I mean
thoſe meer <hi>Caſtillians</hi> who never having quitted
their Threſhold, know not whether <hi>Amſterdam</hi>
be in <hi>Europe,</hi> or the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Nobility and
Grandees go little out of <hi>Madrid,</hi> neither as
Soldiers nor Travailers, unleſs commanded and
employed. They have no information either by
Gazetts or other news written or printed, and I
never more admired any thing than that this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42656:16"/>
we eſteem ſo politick, and imperious, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the ſecret of the univerſal Monarchy, and
capable of impoſing fetters on the reſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,
hath ſo very few able heads, amongſt
whom it is thought the Earl of <hi>Castriglio,</hi> Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
of <hi>Naples</hi> is none of the meaneſt: <hi>Pignoranda,
Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> and <hi>Don Fernando de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treras</hi>
govern all. The Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> is a great
head-piece, but the Favourite is jealous of him,
and as much as poſſible keeps him from affairs.
The Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> appear ſuch only at a
diſtance: here they ſeemed to me very little, and
without any other advantages than to put on
their hats, and ſit down in the Kings preſence;
in other particulars I never obſerved leſs inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the moſt popular Republick. A Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
when he hath laid aſide his Awl and Laſt,
and hung his Sword and Dagger by his ſide, will
hardly give the firſt ſalute to him he wrought for
in his Shop a moment before. You cannot ſpeak
to one of the moſt inferior of the rabble without
giving him titles of honor; and they treat one
another with <hi>Senores Cavalleros.</hi> If a Beggar
ſeeks an Alms, and you refuſe him, it muſt not be
without a Compliment, <hi>Pardone Vueſtra merced,
no tengo diveros:</hi> pardon me Sir, I have no money.
No other Prince lives like the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> his
employments are continually the ſame, in ſuch a
manner, that he at all times knows how every
day of his life is to be paſſed over: You would
think ſome indiſpenſable Law prohibited his omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to do according to cuſtom; ſo that neither
weeks, months, years, nor hours change any
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42656:16"/>
thing of his manner of living, nor preſent him
any thing new. As ſoon as he riſes and recollects
what day it is, he knows what buſineſſes he is to
diſpatch, or what pleaſures to enjoy. He hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
hours for forain and domeſtick Audiences,
and for ſigning all that tends to the expedition of
his Affairs, diſpoſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d of his Treaſure, Meals, and
Devotions. And I have been aſſured that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
happens he continues firm in ſuch a manner
of acting. Every Saturday he goes to a Church
at the farther end of the old Pardo called <hi>At<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cha,</hi>
where he hath a moſt particular Devotion to the
Holy Virgin, ſaying it is from her he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſo great favours, and admirable aſſiſtances in
his greateſt extremities. <hi>France</hi> alſo imputes all
its ſucceſſes to her mediation, and the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of theſe potent Kingdoms, having been ſo
long diametrically oppoſite, it ſeems ſomething
inconſiſtent, that (little happineſs coming to one
without the others misfortune) they can both
boaſt to have her propitious. Every year at the
ſelf ſame time he goes to his Houſes of pleaſure,
and they ſay nothing but ſickneſs can prevent his
retiring to <hi>Aranjuez, Pardo,</hi> or the <hi>Eſcurial</hi> in
the Months he had wont to enjoy the Air of the
Country. In a word, they which have ſpoken to
me of this humor, tell me it is very conformable
to his Meen and Port, and they that are near
him aſſured me, that when they ſpeak to him he
changes neither look nor poſture, but receives,
hears, and anſwers them with the ſame counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
nothing in all his body being moveable
but his lips and tongue. This gravity, whether
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42656:17"/>
natural or affected, is in this Country ſo eſſential
a part of Majeſty, that we were told that the
Queen one day, tranſported at dinner to a more
than ordinary laughter, at the ridiculous poſtures
and diſcourſes of a Buffoon, was put in mind, that
to do ſo became not a Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> who
ought to be more ſerious at which ſurpriſed,
being young, and but newly come out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
ſhe ſaid ſhe could not help it unleſs that
fellow were taken away, and that they ſhould
not have brought him thither if they would not
have had her laugh at him. Two dayes in the
week he gives publick Audiences, principally to
receive Petitions and Memorials of ſuch as beg
any favour of him. He anſwers not immediately,
but cauſes them to be all carried into a certain
place, where they are peruſed by a Secretary of
State, who diſtributes them to ſuch of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils, as their contents relate to; after
which he that would be diſpatched, muſt enquire
at the Secretaries Office what anſwer is returned,
but ſeldom finds any, eſpecially if the pretence
be arrears or reward; and when he hath loſt all
hope of hearing what is become of his Petition,
it is permitted him to preſent as many more as
he pleaſes, but to little purpoſe, for the King ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſees any, and all are carried to the Council
that received the firſt, which having no intention
to ſatisfie him, returns neither Petition nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
For this reaſon <hi>Madrid</hi> is ever full of
pretenders, who with the attendance of whole
years, loſe their ink and Paper. His Majeſty
hath alſo certain hours in which he ſigns all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42656:17"/>
of State, and of his Treaſurie; ſo that
nothing is done, nor one penny given out without
an Order ſigned by him, whereas in <hi>France</hi> the
Secretaries of State have the Seal and Signature
of the King in their power, which would give
them oppportunities of doing many things on
their own accompt, ſhould they abuſe it. It is true
yet, that neither here nor there the Secretary
ſigns or preſents any thing to be ſigned, but by
conſent of the Favourite or chief Miniſter: and
<hi>Don Fernando de Contreras,</hi> principal Secretary,
who with <hi>Pigneranda,</hi> and <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi>
governs all, cauſes nothing to be ſigned but what
is approved by the later, and the King intirely
confiding in him, ſigns all he preſents without
reading it: for never any Prince was more eaſie,
nor put greater confidence in his Miniſters:
When delivred from <hi>Olivares,</hi> he was no longer
without a Favourite then till the Queens death,
which happened very ſodainly after the diſgrace
of that chief Miniſter: Then he received into his
privacy (as they call it here) the Nephew of the
former, at preſent the moſt powerful in this
Court: He is alſo one of the richeſt, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the great wealth he inherited from his Uncle,
contents himſelf to enjoy his fame, and neglect
his maximes, which would probably be attended
by the publick hatred, his politicks having been
thought very corrupt and biaſſed. It is believed
this Favourite makes no uſe of his Maſters coffers;
and it is but neceſſary he ſpare them, they having
never been ſo exhauſted; for beſides the Monthly
Penſions of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and thoſe that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42656:18"/>
follow him, which are very ill paid, this Court is
obliged to an extraordinary charge in <hi>Catalonia,</hi>
and its forces being very weak there, to treat for
three or four thouſand Wallons and <hi>Germans,</hi> of
which the pooreſt foot Souldier will ſtand it in ſix
ſcore crowns. The Marquis <hi>Serra</hi> a noble <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noueſe</hi>
(who on that condition returned to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona)</hi>
is promiſed a hundred thouſand crowns a
month to maintain that Army, and to reſiſt the
<hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet was expected, which
brought but 800 thouſand crowns on the Kings
accompt the laſt year; what it would then bring
was very uncertain, thought it was given out to be
very rich, and that it had aboard it two years Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</p>
            <p>Before the King went to <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Eſtates of both <hi>Caſtiles,</hi> which conſiſt
of the Deputies of 22 Towns, each Town ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two. Such Aſſemblies are called <hi>las Cortes.</hi>
The King made them a Speech, and told them,
that of the ten Millions of Gold, his Kingdoms
yearly ſupply him with, not above three came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Coffers, and neceſſities of State conſidered,
it was his pleaſure they ſhould conſult of wayes
to bring the entire ſum into his hands. That to
this purpoſe every Town and Province ſhould
take care themſelves to bring their proportion
into his Exchequer, where he willed them to
ſuppreſs many of the Officers that managed his
Revenue, and devoured the greateſt part of it:
after this he alſo demanded ſome augmentation.
The <hi>Cortes</hi> met, and laboured in this affair, but
it was much feared they would not conſent to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42656:18"/>
ſuch a ſuppreſſion, which would undo many, and
ſome of their Relations, for the augmentation,
it was believed they would not think the people
able to pay any more, the miſerie and poverty
of the Country conſidered. In the mean time
this King, (his ten Millions of crowns excepted)
draws little or nothing from the People; and
<hi>Navarre, Arragon,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Valentia,</hi>
(not united to the <hi>Caſtiles)</hi> are not thought to
bring up above two Millions.</p>
            <p>The great expences to which his Warrs oblige
him, are known to all the world, but ſome near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
home conſume the beſt of his Revenue: theſe
are many Penſions, there being hardly any Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee
of <hi>Spain,</hi> Duke, Earl, Marquis, or Knight
that hath not ſomething from the Publick: not
in recompence of ſervice in War; but becauſe the
moſt of them are extremely neceſſitous, in ſo
much that I have been aſſured that many of them
compounding with their Creditors, have aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them their Penſions, reſerving only ſome ſmall
ſum towards a wretched ſubſiſtance. Neither are
any accompted rich (the three Favourites above-mentioned
excepted) but the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> the
Marquis of <hi>Leganes,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Ognate,</hi> and two
or three others whoſe names I have forgotten;
the reſt of the Nobility wanting wherewithal to
ſupply their ordinary expences. But did the King
allow no Penſions to them, he payes enow to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to divert a very conſiderable part of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com.
His Armies abound with Reformadoes,
who receive pay as if actually in ſervice: it is
true indeed that theſe are ſo il paid, that I connot
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42656:19"/>
imagin how they ſubſiſt, and I ſpoke with an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieres</hi>
that came from <hi>Portugal,</hi> whoſe Penſion is
twelve crowns a month, that proteſted he had
not recived ſix in ſix year.</p>
            <p>The Jeſuits have of late been obliged to bring
ſixty thouſand crowns into the Kings Coffers,
which very much diſguſted them, and allayed
their zeal in theſe quarters for the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</hi>
This Sum was ſhipped by them on the
Indian Fleet, without regiſtring it, and upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
confiſcated according to the Law. The
Jeſuit to whoſe care it was entruſted, playd his
part ſo well that the Kings Officers could not
find it, but that which belonged to other Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
being ſeiſed, they peached, and it became
the Kings, notwithſtanding the good Fathers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged
it deſigned to build a Church in <hi>Navarre,</hi>
in the Town where the Saint the Founder of
their Order was born.</p>
            <p>This King ſpends nothing either in Buildings
or Gardens. Much of ornament might be added
to his Palace, and its height require a Wall in
form of a Terraſs, to ſupport its declining, that
increaſes daily. A Wood below it, that ſerves
only for a Shelter to Rabbits, and a Neſt for
Crows, brought by <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th out of the <hi>Low
Countries,</hi> might be converted into a fair Garden.
The river that paſſes by it is called <hi>Maucanarzes,</hi>
not ſo broad as its name is long; its Channel is
gravelly, and it ſelf in Summer ſo low, that in
<hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> Coaches at the <hi>Tour</hi> go through
it. The Bridge, or rather Cauſey, by which it is
paſſed, is both long and large, and coſt I know
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42656:19"/>
not how many thouſand Ducats; and he was no
fool, that being told that <hi>Philip</hi> the Second be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
ſo much coſt on ſo poor a River, ſaid it
was fit either to ſell the Bridge or buy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen here contrary to the cuſtoms of
<hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> live in Cities; few
of them having any priviledges for Hunting or
Hawking, neither Mannors or Vaſſals as with
us, where they are moſt of them Lords of the
Pariſhes they dwell in: and indeed the quality
of a private Gentleman is here ſcarcely intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the people having reſpect only for Orders of
Knighthood, and ſuch as are Titulados, which
comprehends Dukes, Marquiſſes, and Earls. Here
are yet ſome Families whom they call <hi>Solari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egas</hi>
or <hi>de Solar Conocido,</hi> who alone are true
Gentlemen, and can derive pedigrees, of which
they may have teſtimonies, called <hi>Cartas Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torias,</hi>
and on accompt of them, enjoy ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
priviledges. The moſt antient of
their Titles, was that of <hi>Riccos Hombres,</hi> very
different from <hi>Hombre Ricco,</hi> which laſt implies
no more but a rich man, but the othet antiently
were the great Lords of <hi>Spain,</hi> before Dukes,
Marquiſſes and Earls were heard of: They were
covered in thoſe days in preſence of their King,
and alone had deliberative voices in Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
            <p>Neither Governments, nor Military, nor Civil
Charges are here ſold, which is not altogether ſo
commendable as it ſeems at firſt ſight; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unworthy
perſons (if well looked on by Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42656:20"/>
may more eaſily attain them then if they
paid for them, and ſeveral of antient extraction
and great abilities are willing to lay out their
money to put themſelves in a condition to ſerve
their King with honour: neither in Countreys
where Charges are moſt vendible, are they ſo to
all Chapmen; but to Gentlemen only, and ſuch
as are qualified for them.</p>
            <p>All the while <hi>Olivares</hi> was in favour, he cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an ill underſtanding between the King and his
wife, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> In order to which
(as ſome report) he ſought to corrupt his
Maſter with an abominable opinion of certain
graceleſs People who in <hi>Madrid</hi> joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a Sect, and called themſelves <hi>Alum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi>
as much as to ſay illuminated, or (if you
pleaſe) Phanaticks; theſe ſeeking to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
themſelves in their villanies, that they
might commit them with the greater liberty, held
it out as a Maxim, that part of the Goſpel was
miſ-underſtood, and that it was an error to
believe Copulation with a woman (on what
account ſoever) could render a man blameable
before God.</p>
            <p>This King is ſuppoſed to have had natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
iſſue by ſeveral, but none is owned but
<hi>Don John of Auſtria,</hi> whoſe Mother was a <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</hi>
Of legitimate Children none grew up but
the Prince and the Infanta, the reſt dying very
young. The Prince ſeemed couragious, but, as
was conjectured, of a nature violent and cruel.
Some report he was taken from ſo many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
(as whoſe ſole Heir he was conſidered)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42656:20"/>
by an accidental connivence of <hi>Don Pedro de Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi>
firſt Gentleman of his Chamber, who one
night giving way to his lying with a Curtezan, he
ſo overheat himſelf that next morning he fell into
a violent Feavour; and the Phyſitians ignorant of
what had paſſed, by letting him blood ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
exhauſted his Spirits, whoſe dimunition
was the only cauſe of his Diſeaſe, that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
his death. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> either for not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
or not diſcovering this to the Phyſitians,
continues in diſgrace, and though Brother of
the Favorite, may not yet return to Court: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
only being given him to dwel at one end
of the Town, where he neither receives nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
Viſits with any Splendor.</p>
            <p>The fall of <hi>Olivares</hi> hath been very publick in
<hi>Europe,</hi> and made appear that Favour, which
hath no other foundation than the Princes affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor ſupports it ſelf otherwiſe than by the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
of him that poſſeſſes it, cannot be ſo dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as his that eſtabliſhed on the Baſis of his good
ſervice, renders him neceſſary to whom he is
agreeable, and it is reported that this man did
ſometimes buoy himſelf up in the Kings good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and opinion, by the very ſame inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Artifices, that at laſt ſunk him. Amongſt
other inventions this is diſcourſed; Complaint
having been made that Bread was very dear,
and ſo ſcarce it could hardly be had in <hi>Madrid,</hi>
becauſe he had taken money of all the Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Villages, to exempt them from an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
lay upon them, to bring a certain quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
every day to Market, he gave Order that all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42656:21"/>
that was in the Town diſperſed among ſeveral
Bakers, ſhould be brought and expoſed in the
ſtreet, by which the King was to paſs to our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of <hi>Atocha.</hi> They to whom he gave this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
performed it ſo well, that the Shops and
Stals were loden. The King at ſight of ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſaid he perceived that they which had told
him of ſcarſitie of Bread were impoſtors and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
For better Confirmation the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke
Ordered they ſhould bring every day into the
publick Market place all the Bread, they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to, notwithſtanding the Exemptions, upon
which the complaints ceaſed, and the King a
long time believed that what had been told him
was an effect of the Malice, of ſuch as emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and envied his Favourite: But the Queen by
her Wiſdom and Patience, at laſt ruined him,
and by degrees entred on part of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from which his Ambition and Jealouſie
had ſo long excluded her. As ſoon as ſhe had
gotten credit with the King her Husband, ſhe
made him underſtand the diſorder of affairs, and
danger of the Crown by his Favorites ill conduct:
and this with ſo much Prudence that he was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
the Court; and at laſt preparations made to
bring him to this trial. The Queens chief Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
on this Extraordinary occaſion, was the
Earl of <hi>Caſtriglio,</hi> a very near Kinſman of him
ſhe deſigned againſt. They could not without
great difficulty bring the King to condeſcend, but
at laſt the Inquiſition concerning it ſelf, and
charging him with that accurs'd Doctrine of the
<hi>Alumbrados,</hi> and an endeavour to Corrupt the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42656:21"/>
King with it, he was very neer being abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it, but this was prevented by his death,
ſuſpected to have been haſtened by poiſon, and
that good turn done him by his relations, that
they might the ſooner poſſeſs his wealth. <hi>Don
Lewis de Haro</hi> inherited the beſt part of it, and to
ſo great a value that I was told, by one that had
it from his own mouth, his yearly Revenue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to 130 thouſand Crowns: it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be wondered if he contents himſelf with
the quality of Favorite, or Chief Miniſter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a greedy hunting after all advantages he
might acquire by it: but though by this he
exempt himſelf from the clamors raiſed againſt
his Uncle; he is yet ſupported by very few crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
not endeavouring to make any, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Paſquil, comparing him with his
Predeceſſor. Two perſons have ruined <hi>Spain,</hi>
one by doing ill to all, the other by doing good
to none.</p>
            <p>Before he came into favour, he was in the
Coach with <hi>Villa Medina,</hi> when he was poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arded.
This Gentleman was the gallanteſt Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
and greateſt wit of <hi>Spain:</hi> the Curious
relate many of his Reparties, of which this is
none of the worſt; coming into a Church, a
Baſon was preſented him, the uſual receptacle
of Money to redeem ſouls from Purgatory; and
he (demanding what ſum ſerved to deliver one,
and being anſwered, what he pleaſed) put in
two piſtols; withal, deſiring to know if the ſoul
were free, which the other aſſuring him, he
took again his two piſtols, telling him he had
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42656:22"/>
done enough; the ſoul being in no danger of
returning. Of all his Gallantries, none coſt him
dearer then that of a Mask: he was in love
with the Queen, which he mannaged with ſo
little caution; it occaſioned him to be cenſured
raſh and indiſcreet; the goodneſs of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
inclining her to favour men of parts, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her (altogether ignorant of his folly) to look
well on him. This haſtened his fall, for beſides
that he could not forbear to mention his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
which terms better becomming a gallant
then ſubject, he appeared in a Mask, in a Suit
embroidered with pieces of Eight, with this word
<hi>Mis amores ſon reales.</hi> This, though equivocal,

it was very evident, that he rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
the eminent object of his love, then
the avarice of which he accuſed himſelf. The
violence of his paſſion, made him provide a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
with Scenes, in which he ſpent 20 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crowns, which (to gain an opportunity
of embracing the Queen, whilſt he carried her
out of the danger) he ſet on fire, and with
them burnt almoſt all the houſe. Subjects that
incite their Maſters jealouſie, ſtand on precipices.

            <p>One may very reaſonably inquire the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the great expences of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and
how they undo themſelves, little of pomp or

them going into the wars. They which are
well acquainted with <hi>Madrid,</hi> aſſure, that moſt

Families are ruined by Women: every man keeps
a Miſtreſs, or is beſotted on a Curtiſan; who
(none in the world being more witty, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
or better skilled in that accurſed miſtery;)
as ſoon as they enſnare any, plume them to the
quick; they muſt have Robes of 30 piſtols
price, which they call <hi>Gardepies,</hi> other accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements
anſwerable, Jewels, Houſholdſtuff,
and Coaches. To deny any thing to that Sex,
is accounted diſhonourable. I was aſſured that
the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile</hi> (none of the richeſt)
gave at once to one of theſe Cattle, Fourſcore
thouſand Crowns. One of the <hi>Palavicini</hi> of
<hi>Genoua,</hi> told me, that not long before, an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
coſt him Two thouſand Crowns, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf delayed by the Baggage to whom he
made his Addreſſes, he abandoned her, without
obtaining any thing. Here are four Proceſſions
without the Town, whereas at ſo many So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Rendezvouſes they endeavour to ſet out
themſelves. All Gallants then preſent them,
which if any neglect, they are loſt, and no more
thought perſons of Honour; this makes all with
emulation ſtrive to adorn theſe infamous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and glory not a little in it. No Town in
the World offers ſo many to publick view ever at
all hours of the day, all Streets and Walks are full
of them; they wear black Vails with which they
hide their faces, but diſcover one eye. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt
all men boldly, being no leſs impudent, than
diſſolute. In <hi>Italy</hi> they are more modeſt, not
ſeeking Men as here; and as the diſorder is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,

Theſe Sinners yet enjoy alone all the

Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> are of two ſorts, this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
being ſometimes perſonal, ſometimes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary.
The firſt, the King bids be covered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
the ſecond, themſelves and Heirs for
ever. This is all the Ceremony in making a
Grandee, neither do any other priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to it; ſo that it is but a Chimerical and Airy
Honour, without any profit; they which marry
the Heireſs of a Family of a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi>
that is ſuch hereditarily, become Grandees in
right of their Wives.</p>
            <p>This is all I could learn concerning Grandees,
but Spaniſh Books mention three ſorts, one of
which the King commands to be covered before
they ſpeak to him, another after they have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but before he anſwers; and the laſt cover
not, till they have ſpoken and he anſwered. When
the King creates a Duke, he is alſo a Grandee,
and the conſequence is good; he is a Duke,
therefore a Grandee; but not he is a Grandee,
therefore a Duke; many Marqueſſes and Earls
being alſo Grandees. Their Wives ſit in the
Queens preſence, and ſhe riſes at their coming
in. The King in all Edicts and Letters calls them
Princes: In his Chappel, they have a Seat called
the Grandees Bench, where, without regard to
Antiquity, they ſit as they come promiſcuouſly.
The Title of <hi>Sennioria</hi> belongs to them by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of <hi>Philip</hi> the Third. Theſe are, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
all the advantages they have above other
Gentlemen, who, as well as they, are exempted
from all Taxes, unleſs when the Publick is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
at ſuch times, they have been ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42656:24"/>
burthen'd, that they have paid near half their
Revenue. They are not oblieged to quarter,
unleſs when the Court goes a Progreſs; but to
ſpeak in general of the Spaniſh Nobility, they
have a very conſiderable priviledge (at leaſt if it
be made good to them) which is, that how great
ſoever their Debts be, the Revenue only can be
attached, the reſt being in <hi>Mayorazgo</hi> (as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it) entailed, which goes farther; ſo
that when the Revenue is ſeized on, the Judges
will appoint the Gentleman, whoſe Quality ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieges
him to keep Servants, Horſes, Coaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
a Stipend ſufficient to ſupport him according to
it; and though he owes as much as a Revenue of
50 thouſand Crowns can be worth, and hath but
30, his Creditors can pretend to no more, than
the overplus of what is ordered for his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
            <p>Here are very few Knights of the Golden
Fleece, nor many pretenders to that Honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
difficult to be obtained, and bringing no
profit. It was lately ſent to the Archduke <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold,</hi>
eldeſt Son of the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the
Third. The other Orders are <hi>Calatrava,</hi> known
by a Red Roſe worn on the Cloak, and <hi>Alcanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
by a green one, St. <hi>Jago</hi> wears a Sword gules
or an Arrow, theſe are near of an equal eſteem
and dignity; theſe Knights have ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by the Commands they now and then obtain
by the Kings favour. A great number of them
were ſlain before <hi>Lerida,</hi> ſince which time it is
not believed there are above 1800 in all the
three Orders, whereas before there were above
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42656:25"/>
4000. <hi>Alcantara</hi> is moſt eſteemed, which they
that pretend to, muſt prove themſelves Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of four Deſcents, two being ſufficient to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the other.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Court of the Palace, are Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
for ſeveral Councils. The Council of State
aſſembles under the Kings Apartment, where the
welfare of all his Dominions is conſulted. There
is alſo a Council of War, where the wayes of
executing what hath been reſolved in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of State, are taken into conſideration: Near
theſe is the Council of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> called <hi>Roial;</hi> it
is very powerful, and conſiſts of Seventeen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
and a Preſident. Many Affairs of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Councils are referred hither, eſpecially of
the Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> in which the people of
both <hi>Caſtiles</hi> are very much concerned. <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
hath alſo its Council, <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi>
theirs. The Council for the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the Kings
Revenue called <hi>de la Hazienda,</hi> ſits in another
place; ſo doth that <hi>de las Ordenes,</hi> which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
the differences of the Orders of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and Judges of the proofs of Gentry of
ſuch as pretend to them. All theſe are within the
Palace Walls. That of the Inquiſition hath its
Tribunal in the Houſe of the Preſident of that
holy Office: That of the <hi>Cruzada,</hi> which gives
Diſpenſations to eat Fleſh on Saturdayes, and
ſome other priviledges granted by Popes to the
King, is alſo held at the Preſidents. None of
theſe pretend to be ſo abſolute, as the Inquiſition.
I have been aſſured, that it is not alwayes in the
Kings power to free thoſe that are accuſed there:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42656:25"/>
And though this Juriſdiction derives its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from the Pope, in ſome Conjunctures it hath
had no regard to his Orders. It extends not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to thoſe which in matters of Religion go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Church, but is a ſharp curb to all
whoſe temper gives jealouſie to the State, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
them without noiſe, as was intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Antonio Perez,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Olivares,</hi>
had he not dyed. All reſolutions of theſe ſeveral
Councils, paſs through that of State, before put
in execution, which examines whether there be
any thing in them, contrary to the general good
of all the members of the Crown.</p>
            <p>A Mornings, becauſe then all the Councils aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,
there is a great crowd in the Palace, yet
only below in the two Courts, whither they
which have Buſineſs or Suits (as they ſay here,
<hi>para pretenſiones)</hi> come to follow them. Amongſt
others, you may ſee many undertakers of Levies
of Souldiers, ſolliciting their Disburſments.
When Horſe are raiſed, all the Horſes are
brought into the <hi>Piazza</hi> before the Palace,
where one Ear of each of them is cut off. By
this mark they are made known to be the Kings,
and a Trooper ſelling one of them, or one of
them being ſound in the poſſeſſion of a man that
ſerves not the King, he may be ſeized, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away without any formality of Law; but the
Troopers ſometimes cut off the other Ear, and
then preſenting the Captain ſome Dollars, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged
him to depoſe before the Commiſſary, that
the Horſe is dead, after which he is ſold without
difficulty. This is one of the greateſt profits of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42656:26"/>
Captains of Horſe in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> as they which
have ſerved there informed me.</p>
            <p>It is not only very difficult to raiſe men for
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> but to maintain them, when brought
thither: enduring much hardneſs, they quickly
die, <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> eſpecially; <hi>Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Neopolitans</hi> disband and run away, the
latter getting into <hi>France,</hi> preſent themſelves
there to the General, who uſually gives them a
piece of money to bear their charges to their
Country, the other coaſting to the <hi>Pireneans</hi> on
the ſide of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> return into <hi>Caſtile</hi> by
<hi>Navarre</hi> or <hi>Biſcai.</hi> Old Soldiers, of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſoever, know the Country, and will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſcape, young ones, beſides that they are of
little uſe, laſt not, as being unaccuſtomed to ſo
great fatigue.</p>
            <p>The War here is more troubleſome to the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> than any where elſe, and more
important, being in a part of his Dominion, of
which he is very jealous, and where he would
redeem any loſs by twice the value in <hi>Italy</hi> or
<hi>Flanders.</hi> They which penetrate into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of this Court, aſſure that it hath a kind of
contempt for loſſes in other places, but thoſe in
<hi>Catalonia</hi> touch to the quick, and are as ſo many
wounds the State ſeems to receive in its heart,
by which it appears, that they which have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the certain way of ſhaking the Spaniſh
Monarchy, to be by making war upon it in its
own Countrey, have doubtleſly very well diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
where it is weakeſt.</p>
            <p>To defend it ſelf, it muſt be at a vaſt expence,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42656:26"/>
for very ſmall forces, becauſe in great want, not
only of Victual and Amunition, but much more
of men In this it is become defective but in this
laſt age; for by what <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid of it, we find
it otherwiſe in time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who giving
the epethite of couragious to <hi>England,</hi> gave that
of populous to <hi>Spain,</hi> reſerving to themſelves
that of Piety only. This alteration is eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by thoſe that conſider, how the falling
of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> into this Country,
with the irruption of the <hi>Moors,</hi> that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
followed it, ſcattered the greateſt part of
the Inhabitants: and when theſe ſtrangers had
ſo well ſettled themſelves, that the Cities again
abounded with people, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi>
that conquered all <hi>Spain,</hi> deſtroyed a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and exiled more.</p>
            <p>The diſcovery of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
ſoon after, drew away great Colonies,
and peopled the new World with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
as well by the great concourſe of ſuch as (finding
it a better Country than that they abandoned)
ſeated themſelves there, as by a neceſſity of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
Navies, and tranſporting Soldiers to form
an Army, and Garriſon Forts and Cities; and
this in ſuch manner, that the beſt of <hi>Spain</hi> is
now in the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Kings wants having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
him to ſell his Subjects for gold, though
neither the Mines of <hi>Potoſi,</hi> nor all <hi>Peru,</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſupply the expence he is fain to be at for
want of men; neither do the Gallions ever bring
wealth enough to diſcharge the States debts;
for beſides that the greateſt part of it belongs to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42656:27"/>
particular perſons of <hi>Flanders, Holland, Genoua,</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi> that which comes on the Kings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is due to ſeveral that have aſſignations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: So that <hi>Spain</hi> is no more than the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
by which the Gold of the <hi>Indies</hi> paſſes to
diſcharge it ſelf in the vaſt Ocean of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
and therefore in that ſimilitude, where
the world is compared to a living body, <hi>Spain</hi>
is the mouth, which receives, chaws, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the nouriſhment, but immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
it to other parts, retaining nothing to it
ſelf but the ſavour alone, or the little that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
ſticks between the teeth. And he had
reaſon, that conſidering <hi>Spain,</hi> where little Gold
appears, all other Nations abounding with her
Piſtols, ſaid ſhe ſerves them as the <hi>Damnati ad
Metalla</hi> did the ancient Emperors; or elſe that
ſhe is like the Aſs of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> that laden with
Gold, fed on thiſtles. But that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
her deſolation, was the general expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Moors. There were many
reaſons for the quitting her ſelf of ſo curſed a
Generation, and impoiſoning the waters thereby
to deſtroy all the Chriſtians, having been impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them, and their continual correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
with the <hi>Africans, Turks,</hi> and other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Kingdom diſcovered, <hi>Philip</hi> the
third poſſibly could not have taken a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
than at once to free himſelf from the
continual apprehenſion of them: Though it may
well be objected, that a good Polititian ought
as little as may be to make uſe of ſuch univerſal
puniſhments, by which a State is more enfeebled,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42656:27"/>
than amended; and that when with the dagger
at the breſt, we go about to free our ſelves from
ſome ill we apprehend, we act rather as deſperate
then as couragious and prudent: that it is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of lenitives that forces ſo ſoon to cut and
cauteriſe: That it is a greater vertue to inſtruct
the vicious, and convert them, then to drive
them from their homes, and ſhut the doors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them: In a word, that we may oppoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
without deſtroying perſons. It is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that this Edict coſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> a great
many rich and good Subjects, of no turbulent
principles, and that with time might have been
made ſenſible of the truth, and profeſſion of
Chriſtianity. But they were altogether deprived
of the means of it; for if they embraced Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
dſſimulation was objected againſt them;
and that it was only to avoid the rigour of the
Edict. This gave opportunity to the avarice of
thoſe that executed it to play its game, paſſing
by without moleſtation ſuch as bribed them,
and ſuffering them to continue quiet in their
houſes.</p>
            <p>What diſcourſes ſoever are made on this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
rigour, which ſome have admired
as a policy very high and generous, and others
blamed as a moſt unnatural cruelty, it having
deprived a King of his Subjects, and almoſt a
Nation of its native Country: It is very certain,
that ſince that time <hi>Spain</hi> hath been a deſert,
and could never recover the loſs (as is reported)
of ſome millions of people: But beſides this
her voluntary depopulating her ſelf, the Indies
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42656:28"/>
prevailing either on the neceſſity or inclination of
her Subjects, draw them ſtill away, by frequent
and numerous Colonies, in ſuch manner that it
is believed more people have left <hi>Spain</hi> than at
preſent remain in it.</p>
            <p>After theſe misfortunes (at firſt looked on as
incomparable felicities by thoſe which boaſted
the poſſeſſion of the Weſt-Indies, and expulſion
of the Moors) Wars aroſe, and ſo violent, that it
is computed, that in twenty years they conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a million and a half of Inhabitants, and that
the Plague, which often afflicted this Country,
carried away near another million; ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince <hi>Philip</hi> the third, <hi>Spain</hi> hath extremely
waſted both in men and money: this is very
true, and in ſo extraordinary a manner, that if
its Enemies had underſtood it, and thoſe that
were left behind had not after their ſeparation
differed amongſt themſelves, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would
have been altogether unable to have reſiſted
them.</p>
            <p>Beſides this great ambiguity of good or evil,
which they which judge according to the event
or their own ſenſe, obſerve in the diſcovery of
the Indies, and expulſion of the Moors, another
policy is ſpoken of, which not directed againſt
the Kingdom in general, attacques only that
part of it which is moſt noble and illuſtrous.
<hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, ſtyled the <hi>Solomon</hi> of his age,
apprehending that the Grandees and Nobility
might at ſome time or other make uſe of their
wealth and power againſt his authority, or that
of his Succeſſors; and remembring that they had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42656:28"/>
diſcovered their turbulent inclinations under
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, in ſuch a manner, as had like
to have given him great troubles, thought he
could not better ſecure himſelf againſt ſuch of
them as meant ill, than by the weakneſs of that
whole body; to which purpoſe he caſt the ſeeds
of vanity and envy amongſt them, increaſing
the number of Grandees, Dukes, Marquiſes, and
Earls. The ſmoke of this drove from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
all thoughts of profit, and their honours,
redoubled their expenſes, by every ones endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to ſurpaſs his Companion.</p>
            <p>When he ſaw them deeply engaged, he gave
way to attacquing their Lands, and deprived
them of the Priviledge of <hi>Mayoraſgo,</hi> the moſt
conſiderable that belonged to them; and that
they might not have in their hands any places of
ſtrength, or houſes to retire to when they had
a mind to be troubleſome, he forbad them to
repair their Caſtles: and ſuch as have travailed
between <hi>Valentia</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> obſerve many
ancient Caſtles advantagiouſly ſcituated for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the Country, that decay and fall to the
ground. Thus by heaping honours on them he
took away their power, and obliged them to a
greater charge; and by ſparing them that of
keeping up their Caſtles, deprived them of the
ſubmiſſion and reſpect their Tenants formerly
had for them: Since this they have loſt daily,
and complain that that Prince did not only clip, but
cut off the wings of their Predeceſſors, reducing
them to that inconſiderable condition they are
in at preſent; which, like original ſun, ſo cloſely
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42656:29"/>
follows, that it deſtroys ſuch of them as find not
remedy, by obtaining ſome employment at a
diſtance from the Court, by means of which the
publick Treaſure may paſs through their hands.
Then they neglect not to fill their baggs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
themſelves and Poſterities. It is reported,
that beſides thoſe which endeavour to repair
their fortunes in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> by ſome
employment ſuitable to their birth, many return
rich from the <hi>Indies.</hi> I ſpeak not of Viceroys,
who are canged every 3 years, and lay up milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it being ſufficiently known, that very many
Officers under them make great advantages, and
that in <hi>Madrid</hi> they hide the Treaſures they
bring home even from the Sun that gave them
birth, leſt their diſcovery cauſe an account of
their adminiſtration to be demanded, or they
be obliged to lend the King a good part without
any hope of ever being paid: ſo that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dare put their mony to uſe, nor buy land
with it, but chooſe rather to eat up the main
Stock than to hazard it: Thus by little and little
they conſume what they ſo ſodainly amaſſed, of
which their Family ſometimes enjoys nothing
beyond the ſecond generation.</p>
            <p>They which are employed in the Kings
Councils or Treaſurie, have a certainer and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
way of enriching themſelves, becauſe ſeated
at the helm of Government. Theſe men thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
without any apprehenſion of being moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and demanding account of others, themſeves
not obliged to render it to any; make uſe with
ſplendour of what they have acquired, building
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42656:29"/>
palaces of extraordinary expence in a Countrey
where Stone and Mortar are exceſſive dear.
Their plenty alone is with oſtentation, that of
others ſo reſerved, and as it were baſhfull, that
it often pretends neceſſity that it may avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
really reduced to it: and ſome Dutch Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
in <hi>Madrid</hi> told us, that ſome few years
before, a Tax had been laid upon them, only
becauſe they were thought to be rich and at
their eaſe: The manner of doing it ſeems very
ſevere. A rich Merchant being ſent for to a
Committee of the Council, was told that the
King commanded him to bring three or four
thouſand crowns into his Exchequer; if he went
about to excuſe himſelf as unable, or by reaſon
of mony due to him from the King, it ſignified
nothing; and he was ſent away with notice, that
if he paid it not in three dayes he muſt go ſix
leagues from <hi>Madrid</hi> in cuſtody of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Juſtice on his expence. That time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
without paying, he was ſent 20 leagues
from the Court. They which paid at firſt freed
themſelves from this charge and trouble; they
that were obſtinate againſt what appeared ſo
unjuſt to them, ſuffered both, and were at laſt
conſtrained to pay what had been impoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were permitted to return to their
houſes.</p>
            <p>Gown-men and Pen-men are here the richeſt,
and none ſpoken of but Councellors, Senators,
and Secretaries, who from very poor beginnings
ſodainly become wealthy: They which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the affairs of the <hi>Indies</hi> are thought to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42656:30"/>
all others: and the Earl of <hi>Pigneranda,</hi>
who ſerved his Maſter ſo well in the negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Munſter</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and is
the Favourites Favourite, choſe rather to be
Preſident of the Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> than of
that of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which queſtionleſs had been
more proper for him than any other.</p>
            <p>That Council advantages it ſelf as well by the
employments of which it hath the diſpoſal, as
by all Merchandiſe that paſſes to and again:
Amongſt which wine makes a very profitable
and ſpeedy return, none but Spaniſh being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to be tranſported, which is ſold with ſo
great gain, that that which in <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part where it grows, coſts one crown, is
worth 6 or 7 there.</p>
            <p>That this may be continued, planting Vines
is there prohibited on pain of death, though that
ſoil would as well bear them as any part of
<hi>Spain.</hi> Traffick in general (as I before obſerved)
is not equal to what it hath been; for which (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
many other pretended here) this reaſon
may be given, that the profit made on occaſion
of it by the King and his Miniſters hath diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
Merchants, to the loſs of a very great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
to the Crown: whatever is ſhipped for
the <hi>Indies</hi> muſt be regiſtred, and pay the tenth
penny for fault of which it is confiſcated. By
this the wealth of the Fleet is known to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as well what belongs to the King as to
particular perſons. Some years ſince his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Majeſty (wanting money) laid hands on that
which appertained to Merchants, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42656:30"/>
indeed of borrowing, but (beſides that ſuch
forced lones ſuit not well with Merchants affairs)
it was never returned: For which reaſon many
do not regiſter their Gold and Silver, but chuſe
rather to combine with the Captains (though it
coſt them more) than to abandon all for fair
words. Before the Fleets arrival at Cadis, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
or <hi>Holland</hi> Ships meet it either near that
Port, or that of <hi>St. Lucar,</hi> and receive there
from ſuch Captains as they correſpond with, that
which is on account of thoſe that ſend them,
and carry it away before it enters any <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Haven; and even the Merchants of <hi>Sevil</hi> and
other <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cities ſend their money into thoſe
Countries, where they may freely diſpoſe of it
without fear to have it ſeiſed on. It is ſaid that
the Fleet comes this year more rich than uſually;
but that the wealthieſt ſhip is ſtranded, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
whether the ſilver all ſaved. But they
which will have nothing loſt report that more
Gold and Silver hath been recovered than was
regiſtred, if ſo the King will have the advantage
of it by confiſcation.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the general Government of
theſe Kingdoms, it ſeems to move ſo ſteadily,
that it declines not at all from thoſe bold Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
which are never diſturbed, and that trample
on the ſharpeſt thorns as reſolutely as if they
walked on roſes: but going to particulars we
ſhall diſcover, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who give much
to appearances and the exterior, uſe no fewer
meens and grimaces in their publick affairs, then
in their particular comportment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:42656:31"/>
In the Streets, at the Tour, and in the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
where many eyes are upon them, they ſeem
very grave, ſerious, and reſerved: but in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and to thoſe that are familiarly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with them, they act in a manner ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
you would not take them for the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
being as vain, wanton, and humorous as
other Nations.</p>
            <p>The Politicks of every Country are of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and genius like that of the people that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
it; and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> conſidered by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed
judgement are ſo as well as the reſt.</p>
            <p>At firſt view they ſeem firm, conſtant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
and entirely ſwayed by reaſon and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but coming nearer, and examining them,
piece by piece, we may diſcover weakneſſes we
could not have imagined them capable of. Their
pace is ſometimes ſo unſteady they ſtumble in
the ſmootheſt way, and ſometimes ſo poſitive,
on account of Reputation and Intereſt, they

               </gap>rd all for trifles; but always ſo flow, that
of a thouſand of their Artifices, ſcarce any one
ſucceeds: I ſhall not give ſuch examples as I
might of this truth in times paſt, particularly,
in the revolutions of <hi>Flanders</hi> under <hi>Philip</hi> the
II. and what happened during the League in
<hi>France</hi> in the ſame Kings Raign, being provided

revolt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> both foreſeen, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of neceſſary remedies, not only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               </gap>ſed of at <hi>Madrid:</hi> opinions very much
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42656:31"/>
differ about Sequeſtration of the Goods of the
Genoueſes, ſome declaring it to have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
juſt and prudent; others the contrary: but all
agreeing, that having been ſo vigorouſly begun,
it ought to have been continued in the ſame
manner, and being an affair of reputation and
intereſt, that ſo great a Monarch ſhould not
have boggled at going through with it, or an
accommodation appearing neceſſary, by reaſon
of the prejudice this Rupture gave to affairs,
they ſhould not have moved ſo heavily towards
it, becauſe in that interval they ſuffered for
want of returns from <hi>Genoua,</hi> which during ſuch
a ſuſpenſion they could not ſupply with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
they had ſeiſed.</p>
            <p>They which negotiated in this Court for that
Republick, endeavoured to make underſtood
that the Siege of <hi>Arras</hi> failed the year before,
becauſe the Merchants recalled the Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
they had drawn on <hi>Antwerp;</hi> but the
Spaniſh Miniſters would not acknowledge this,
though it was evident they began to have ſome
light of it. In the mean time, punctilios only
ſpan out a year before matters could be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded,
though the Spaniards were no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of it then the Genoueſes; though theſe
many demurs had no other end but to ſave the
Spaniſh reputation, they failed peradventure of
that effect; what had paſſed was nullified by the
agreement; what had been ſeiſed, releaſed, and
the diſpute about <hi>Final,</hi> which had cauſed it,
referred to arbitration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:42656:32"/>
They had long been agreed of all that was
ſubſtantial; but a punctilio of honour cauſed
the execution to be delayed, it was this: The
Republick would not ſet at liberty the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
taken before <hi>Finale,</hi> unleſs the King asked
them to do it, and the King would have them
ſent home before he made any propoſal: all
being like to break off an expedient, was found
(by means of Marquis <hi>Serra,</hi> brother of
him that commands in <hi>Catalonia)</hi> that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
ſhould viſit the Earl of <hi>Ognate,</hi> and
ask him, if he thought the Republick might
oblige his Majeſty by ſetting the priſoners at
liberty, and the other anſwering yes, all ſhould
be ended; but they add, that this Earl, who
is both high and crafty, and that at his return
from <hi>Naples</hi> had been the firſt cauſe of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding,
ſoundly ratled the Ambaſſador:
In this proceeding, appears to me a very great
zeal in the Spaniſh Miniſters, in reſenting the
affront done them by the Republick, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
not, and the honour of it was blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by uſeleſs delays, all at laſt being concluded
on conditions, that might have been obtained
at firſt.</p>
            <p>The good underſtanding that hath continued ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years between the French and Genouſes,
cauſed the firſt of theſe to offer their aſſiſtance
to the other towards righting them againſt the
Spaniſh violence; on account of which the
Republick held it ſelf ſo much obliged to the
French King, that it ſent <hi>Lazaro Spinola,</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Citizen, in Quality of Extraordinary Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42656:32"/>
to return thanks for the aſſiſtance
and protection offered; that difference gave
the Genoueſes ſuch diſtaſte of the Spaniſh Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,
that it moved them to do this to thoſe
they had formerly looked on as the greateſt
enemies of this liberty. If we except ſuch in
<hi>Genoua</hi> as by Alliance and Intereſt are bound to
the Spaniſh party, the reſt of their inclinations
are very contrary to what they were in their
Fathers days during the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the
I. of <hi>France,</hi> and the Genoueſes have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
no other kindneſs for the Spaniards, then
a Creditor for a Debtor, out of whoſe hands
he would fain recover what belongs to him;
after which they would little value them: but
however the Genoueſes comport themſelves,
their patience will never oblige their debtors
to ſatisfie them, who think they do enough
when they pay the intereſt without any longer
conſidering the principal, which the Spaniards
are well enough content to be thought unable
to diſcharge, whether it be ſo to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from being demanded it, or that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of their affairs obliges them to it.</p>
            <p>This in the mean time is a good caution to
the Genoueſes, by little and little to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Spaniſh clutches. All ſtrangers,
what ſervices ſoever they may have done them,
ought to fear them, they conſidering themſelves
and intereſts only,, in ſuch manner that the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
and <hi>Flemings</hi> that are this Kings ſubjects,
are uſed no more favourably then if born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
another Maſter: If they pretend to imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42656:33"/>
either at Court or in the Armies, they
are told they are not natural Spaniards, who
engroſs all, as well to keep up the glory of the
Nation, as out of diffidence of others, whom
they in a manner declare incapable of all truſt
becauſe not born in <hi>Spain:</hi> this Countrey
are nevertheleſs abounds in ſtrangers, but they
only Artificers and Mercenaries invited by gain,
and that meddle with nothing but their ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
traffick. It is thought that there are above 40
thouſand French in <hi>Madrid,</hi> who wearing the
Spaniſh habit, and calling themſelves <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinians,
Walloons</hi> and <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> keep up Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and Manufacture; it concerns them to
conceal their Countrey, for if it be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they are obliged to pay a daily Pole-money
of about a penny to the Town, and, any bad
ſucceſs happening to the publick, appearing in
the ſtreets, are liable to a thouſand inſolencies,
even to blows.</p>
            <p>They that know what number of ſtrangers
are in this Town report, that would they
undertake it, they might make themſelves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and drive out the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such as have buſineſs, or intend to ſtay any
time, habit themſelves after the manner of the
Countrey, which we muſt have done had we
been <hi>para pretenſiones</hi> (as they call it;) we muſt
then have put on the Caſſock and all the reſt
of the Caſtilian Harneſs, none being welcome
to the Court without it: nor can any ſpeak to
the King unleſs clothed in black, in which they
are ſo punctual, that an Envoye from the Prince
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42656:33"/>
of <hi>Conde</hi> was fain to wait till he ſuited himſelf
in that colour before he could have Audience;
even Women, and of thoſe the looſeſt, leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to appear ſuch, immediately ſolicite ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to quit the habit of their Countrey, which
cauſes them to be the more obſerved when
they make their viſits. The Spaniards wear a
Caſſock with deep skirts which ſits very cloſe to
the body from the neck to the hanches, a black
leather Girdle, which buckles on the Breaſt,
or toward the Navil; their Breeches are ſo
ſtreight, that for more eaſie putting them on
and off, they are buttoned at the ſides towards
the bottom; their ſhooes are ſhaped exactly to
their feet, with narrow ſoles; and a little Foot
and large calf of the leg, are in ſuch requeſt,
that Gallants bind their feet about with Riband,
to their no ſmall torment, whilſt by quilted
ſtockins they put themſelves perfectly in the
mode: their ſilk ſtockins are knit very open,
almoſt like Net-work, which they ſtretch very
ſtreight upon white, that is ſeen through them;
they wear no longer broad brimmed Hats, but
very narrow ones lined with Taffata; they
eſteem it very gallant, and of more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
magnificence, to wear Hatbands of many
broad black Bone-laces, which doubtleſly coſt
as much as Plumes, they ſending for them to
<hi>France</hi> or <hi>Flanders:</hi> they are not curious in
their Linnen, uſing little Bonelace on it.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of their beginning to dreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from above, and to button from below,
is not to be contrary to other nations in all
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42656:34"/>
they do, but becauſe the Air is ſo penetrating,
that if they be not very careful to keep their
breaſts warm a mornings, they hazard ſickneſs;
many for neglecting this, having ſuffered ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
accidents, and loſt the uſe of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
this hath alſo happened to others by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their windows open a nights: Black Bays
and Rattin is their Winters wear; in Summer
they uſe Taffata Suits, but leave not off the
Baiſe Cloak and Caſſock.</p>
            <p>The firſt of <hi>May</hi> we ſaw the Tour of Coaches
without the gate of <hi>Toledo,</hi> this is one of the
moſt celebrated, and at it appear many of all
ſorts, ſome drawn by four Mules, if Dukes or
great Lords, with a Poſtillion, and the former
Mules faſtened by long Harneſs; ſuch as
have ſix Mules, you may conclude belong to
perſons very eminent, who are not allowed this
Magnificence but without the Town, which
prohibition was occaſioned by the Kings being
told that the Tour was little frequented, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the vanity of ſuch as unable to appear
with ſix Mules, forbore it, that they might not
ſeem leſs then thoſe with whom they pretend
equality.</p>
            <p>No Coachman ſits before the Coach, but on
one of the foremoſt Mules; this having been
forbidden by the Conde Duke, who had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
revealed by the Coachman: they almoſt
all uſe Mules, ſince the Coach-horſes were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
effectually taken away, or threatened to
be ſent into <hi>Catalonia.</hi> The breed of horſes is
by this means ſo neer loſt, that if ſomething be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42656:34"/>
not done to prevent it, <hi>Spain</hi> will be entirely
disfurniſhed, the greateſt part of Mares being
reſerved to bear Mules, the profit of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great by reaſon of a quick and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Market. The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied
this, by forbidding the uſe of Mules,
and the Clergy refuſing to obey under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of certain priviledges, he gave them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption,
but on pain of death forbad the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
to ſhooe any Mule, by which means he
eaſily reduced them to obſervance of his order.</p>
            <p>The glory of this ſolemnity principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in the bravery of the Ladies, who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
induſtrious to appear with ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
putting on their richeſt accoutrements,
they forget not Ceruſe and Vermillion:
they are ſeen in divers poſtures in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
Coaches, ſome making a half diſcovery of
themſelves, others with open Curtains, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their gallantry and beauty; ſuch whoſe
ſervants cannot or will not accommodate them
with Coaches, ſtand in the ſtreets that paſs to
the place where the Tour is made, or at one
end of it.</p>
            <p>Part of their liberty, or rather licentiouſneſs
conſiſts in an indifferent demanding of any to
pay for Lemons, Wafers, Sweet-meats or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,
which are carried up and down to be
ſold; they give intimation of this by thoſe
that ſell them, and it is accounted a great inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
to refuſe, though for ſix penny worth of
ware one pay a Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:42656:35"/>
Here appear alſo many fair Horſes with rich
Saddles, and their Mains and Tails tied with
Ribbands; the Riders are either ſuch Gallants
as have lent their Coaches to Ladies, or ſuch
others as having no Coaches, are willing on
horſeback to enjoy the pleaſure of the Tour.
After many circuits, and the view of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
files of Coaches; evening coming on, all
make a ſtand, and in their Coaches eat ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
as they have brought with them. This
cuſtom is not peculiar to this ſolemnity, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every day, eſpecially Sundays, you walk
amongſt Bevers and Collations; ſo much the
Spaniards are pleaſed to Feaſt in the field,
though but on an Onion, a Salad, or a few hard
Eggs.</p>
            <p>Hither alſo come ſome Women of Quality
with their Husbands, and Gallants with their
Miſtreſſes, who being under their eye comport
themſelves ſo modeſtly, they hardly looke on
any, or return a ſalute. Ordinary Citizens are
diſperſed about the fields, or ſit on the River
ſide, or ſome corner of the Medow or green
Corn: they feaſt on very ſlender proviſion
with much Majeſty and Jollity, accompanied
by ſome friend, or their Wives and Families. I
have been aſſured, that beſides theſe ſlight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches,
the Spaniards in their houſes ſeldom or
never Treat one another: and they which have
been at their Feaſts add, that the diſhes, aſſoon
as ſet on the Table, vaniſh, each gueſt ſeiſing
one with this word <hi>Con licentia,</hi> to ſend it to his
Miſtriſs, in ſuch manner that the company is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42656:35"/>
ſometimes without any meat, and almoſt ever
without ſo much as taſting the beſt.</p>
            <p>At this time the King is uſually at <hi>Aranjuez,</hi>
from whence he often comes to view the Tour,
and having ridden about, returns without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
the Town, which at firſt ſeemed to me
but a poor diverſion, it being Seven long
Leagues from <hi>Aranjuez</hi> to <hi>Madrid;</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how ſwiftly he paſſes them, with Six
Mules, ever driven at their beſt ſpeed, and
changed at half way, I could neither think it
tedious nor inconvenient, the ſeven Leagues
being diſpatched in little more then three hours;
but I could never apprehend what pleaſure he
can take at the Tour, ſince as he paſſes by, all
Curtains out of reſpect, are drawn, ſo that he
ſees nothing but the Coaches, though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of it is only to appear with ſplendor, and
enjoy the view of all that is gallant: Reſpect
here queſtionleſs deſtroys the pleaſure it aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in other Countreys, where at the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
approach, all make a ſtand, and Women un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask,</p>
            <p>The 5th of <hi>May</hi> we went to <hi>Aranjuez</hi> to
ſee the Court; this pleaſant ſeat where the
King every Spring reſides a moneth, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
very agreeable, and the Spaniards that ſee
nothing equal to it, mention it no otherwiſe
then as the <hi>Eliſian fields:</hi> their Poets call it the
Metropolis of <hi>Floras</hi> Kingdom, and her Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury;
in the way to it we paſſed the River
<hi>Tagus</hi> by a wooden Bridge, which hath a Gate
at one end of it, that is ſhut when the Court
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42656:36"/>
is not there, then people Ferry over, paying
ſome Duties, which are part of the Rents of
<hi>Aranjuez.</hi> The firſt thing preſents it ſelf is a
Park with Earthen walls, called <hi>Tapia,</hi> it is
large, and beautified by divers Allies; in the
Heath on each ſide the paſſage to it, are Cony-Warrens:
by the Park ſide is a very large
Walk, from which ſeveral others like it; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the right and left, it leads to a Gate
at the end of a bridge over a Canal, drawn
thither from the River; this forms an Iſland
in which the Garden is, very fair and neatly
kept, its entrance is from the Palace, and as ſoon
as the Bridge is paſſed, two Statues of Braſs
appear, from the cut off Arms of one of which,
water diſtils; hard by theſe is the Ciſtern of
the Fountain of <hi>Diana,</hi> which ſtands in the
middle of a Mount raiſed of Stone, Wood,
Moſs and Earth; many Figures of ſeveral Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are joyned to it, who pleaſantly ſpout out
water as they receive it by Pipes from the River;
in all this Garden I ſaw not any Fountain that
derives its ſtream from a Spring; round about
the Ciſtern ſtand Eight Ships (if I miſtake not)
of Mirtle, whoſe Branches are ſo accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the poops, prows, and all the reſt of
the hulks are well ſhaped; on each of theſe is
a little Statue that ſpouts water againſt the
Beaſts that are on the top of the Mount. We
came next to the Fountain of <hi>Ganimed,</hi> who
is mounted on an Eagle at the top of a Pillar;
at the Ciſtern ſide ſtand <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Hercules;</hi> a
little from it is the Fountain of the <hi>Geloſia,</hi> or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42656:36"/>
ſmall Lattice, ſo called, becauſe at the top of it,
the water repreſents the form of one of thoſe
Lattices or Geloſias that are uſually ſet before
windows: neer it is another, called the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Rowel; and at the entrance of the middle
Ally, that of the Harpies, the faireſt of all; its
Ciſtern is ſquare, and at the four corners on
four Pillars, ſtand thoſe monſtrous Creatures,
vomiting water againſt the ſtatue of a man,
that ſitting on one of the middle Columns, ſeeks
a thorn in the ſole of his foot: in the ſame
Ally not far from the end of the Garden is the
Fountain of Don <hi>John of Auſtria,</hi> whoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is placed on the top of it, water diſtilling
from his hair; it is made of a ſtone that was
found in a Turkiſh ſhip after the battle of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto,</hi>
it hath two Ciſterns, and below four
<hi>Cupids</hi> with ſeveral Emblems: this Garden is
very pleaſant, as well in it ſelf, as by reaſon of
its particular ornaments which are not yet equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taking; the Walks are almoſt all too narrow,
and one would think they had been niggards
of ground for the parterres; the Arbors are
low, and upheld only with Laths inſtead of
Deal ſpars, which would not have been ſpared
by a rich private perſon; round about the Iſle
by the River and Canals ſide is a large Walk,
well kept and ſwept, ſhaded by tall Elms;
this is the faireſt, and in which their Majeſties
moſt delight, in it is one Arbor, looking into
the highway of <hi>Madrid,</hi> in which the Queen
was the day the Bulls were fought, to ſee them
paſs by, after the King and his Court had
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42656:37"/>
brought them from the Heard from which they
had ſeparated them: the day of this ſport is
made a great ſecret, the King never declaring
it till the night before he ſends away the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radores,</hi>
or markers of the Bulls, then alſo giving
notice to the countrey people to bring them in:
we had the firſt news of it in the great walk, of
which I will ſpeak anon, where we met the Queen
going to take the Air; as ſoon as her Coach and
that of her Maids of Honour were paſſed by, a
man on horſeback, ſaid to be the Guardian or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeer
of that Sex, taking us for Dutchmen, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to us told us, that one of thoſe Ladys or Maids
of Honour had a Couſen married in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi>
and would be glad to enquire of him,
we turned back and after ſome ſhort diſcourſe,
ſhe acquainted us, that poſſibly the ſight of
Bulls might be the next day, not daring poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to declare it: this caution is to prevent
too great a concourſe: immediately the Ladies
Guardian interrupted our ſmall entertainment,
bidding us go off from the Coach, having talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
long enough with the Ladies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we returned,
admiring no leſs his incivility, then the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of the Queens Buffoon, preſenting one of
us a pipe of Tinn to ſpeak to him with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
deaf as he feigned; this great Walk is
beyond the Village of <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> ſo wretched,
it ſcarcely affords any lodging, ſo that at our
arrival there we were fain to go farther, and
though the Moon ſhone, and we had guides,
loſt our way; in the place where we ſtayed
we had much ado to get Stable-room for our
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42656:37"/>
Horſes, and ſhelter for our ſelves, and were
very well contented to ſleep on Chairs and
Benches. This is not occaſion'd by reaſon of
a great Court, for almoſt all the Officers are
lodged in the Kings houſe, though very ſmall;
but the Village affords but one Inn, which was
taken up by the Emperours Ambaſſadors, ſo
that we could have no place there till next
morning. That day we reſolved to make an
end of ſeeing <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> and when we had
been where the Camels are kept, where there
was only one Female, and a young one, the
reſt being abroad to carry wood, as we return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſeveral f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir Allies, our guide told us, that
after a birth the Females are two years before
they again bring forth: He ſaid alſo, that they
ſometimes bait them with Dogs, and that it is
very pleaſant to ſee how dexterouſly thoſe ill
ſhaped creatures defend themſelves againſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiffs;
and that their fury ſometimes break
through the Rails and diſcharges it ſelf on the
Spectatators: coming near our lodging, he
mentioned a rare Waterwork with ſo many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
that he incited our curioſity to go
and ſee it, by we diſcovered his ſimplicity, it
being nothing but a Mill to ſaw boards. This
confirmed our opinion that what is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in other places, paſſes often here for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous:
in the afternoon we went to ſee the
great and magnificent Walk at the end of the
Village, neer the way to <hi>Alcala de Henares:</hi>
on each ſide it is a double row of fair young
Elms, towards whoſe better growth, they can
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42656:38"/>
at pleaſure let in water between the ranks: it
is very long and large, and in two or three
places are wide circles where Coaches may
wheel about as at our Tour in <hi>Hidepark:</hi> at the
end of it is a bridge over <hi>Tagus</hi> with a door, in
ſuch manner, that the King when at <hi>Aran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juez,</hi>
either without Guards, or only with 10
or 12 Halberdiers, is as within an entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not to be paſſed but by theſe bridges;
on the right hand is another Walk leading to
a Grange where three Aſſes are kept to cover
Mares for production of good Mules; in my
life I never ſaw any ſo big, the youngeſt being
as high as any Mule, the two other not much
lower; the Firſt coſt Two and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Reals, which amounts to <hi>600 l. ſterling;</hi>
they are exempted from Duty but two days
in the year, that is, on <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> and the
<hi>Feaſt of the Aſcenſion;</hi> at other times, as we
were told, the Male Careſſes the Female twice
a day, by this appears that moſt of the Mares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made uſe of to bear Mules, the breed of
Horſes will by degrees be loſt here, and they
would have much ado to raiſe Cavalry, were
there occaſion for it. Rumours have been ſpred
that Mules ſhould be prohibited, but this was
found difficult; I know not whether by means
of the Clergy, if ſo, it had been eaſie to have
applied the remedy made uſe of by the King
of <hi>Portugal;</hi> Though above the folly of thoſe
Travailers, that mind no more of the Courts of
the Countreys they paſs thorow, then to ſee
the Princes Diss or Ride. Our little ſtay in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42656:38"/>
               <hi>Spain,</hi> and difficult acceſs to the Court, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of its great privacy, obliged us to amuſe
our ſelves with what takes the eyes, but little
ſatisfies the intellect. On <hi>Aſcention day</hi> by means
of Sir <hi>Benjamin Wright,</hi> we were permitted to
ſtand in a corner of the chamber where the
Queen dined; ſhe is of a middle ſtature, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inclining to be low; over againſt her ſtands
a Lady that preſents the diſhes, and doth the
Office of Carver; on each ſide of her ſtands
another; ſhe on the right, preſents the
Glaſs, ſhe on the left, the Napkin; ſhe drinks
very little, but eats well; ſhe was ſerved with
many diſhes, but as we thought, few good ones;
ſhe hath a Buffoon that talks continually to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to divert her; four or five youths of
the beſt families in <hi>Spain</hi> bring in the meat out
of the next chamber, theſe are called <hi>Meni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi>
all habited in Gray, yet with difference
in the Colour: we wondred to ſee the Spaniſh
gravity ſuffer ſuch neglect of Majeſty; theſe
<hi>Meninos</hi> uſing very little reſpect in the Queens
preſence, they often prated and ſhared a diſh
of Apples with the Buffoon, and ſome of them
at the door puſhing one another, made a great
noiſe, without any reprehending them; none
are admitted to ſee the Infanta dine, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our expreſſing a curioſity for it, it was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was <hi>incognito</hi>
at <hi>Aranjuez:</hi> an honeſt Spaniard after the fight
of Bulls, brought me into a Garden where I
ſaw her take Coach: ſhe is low, of a ſprightly
meen and quick eye, her face rather long
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42656:39"/>
then round. It is pity the cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
obliges her to paint, for with leſs red ſhe
would certainly appear more lovely, though
the Queen and ſhe ſeem leſs inflamed then the
reſt of the Court, whoſe cheeks are Scarlet, and
that ſo groſly laid on, it ſeems rather to aim
at diſguiſe then beauty; and indeed the moſt of
them are ſo ill favoured, that all the paint in
the world made uſe of with the greateſt Art, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help them. The Maids of Honour take
the firſt three or four Coaches: and the Due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas:
(who are old Women clothed in white,
and almoſt covered with Vails) the laſt; the
Queen and Infanta follow in a Coach with ſix
Horſes, an old Lady ſitting in the Boot; their
wide Farthingales extreamly fill the Coach, and
one would take their thick and knotty Elflocks
for Hempen ſtuffing, broke out of an old pack-ſaddle.</p>
            <p>Their Whisks or rather Cravats are made of
great points, which doubtleſly coſt a great
deal, though unhandſome: almoſt all of them
have Looking-glaſſes, Watches or Pictures
hanging at their Girdles; I ſaw none Court them
but the Marquis of <hi>Aytona,</hi> who walked by a
Coach ſide talking with one that ſate in the
boot; but I was told this is done with freedom
enough in the Queens withdrawing room; and
whenſoever they appear at windows by ſigns
agreed on between them and their ſervants in
order to ſo gallant a converſation. When
they marry, the Queen adds Fifty thouſand
Crowns to their portions, which are very will
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42656:39"/>
paid; beſides theſe Ladies and ſome Querries,
the Queen hath no attendance at her going
abroad but her Buffoon, with ſome mean Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Footmen: ſhe hath no Guards, and
I admired her being publick with ſo little ſtate.
The King hath about a dozen Firelocks that wait
daily at his Stair-head; theſe are either <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi>
or <hi>Burgundians,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> is their
Captain. On the Guard they wear the Kings
Livery (which at other times they lay aſide)
and an odd Kind of Sword or Hanger called
<hi>Cuchilla:</hi> They are in all 150. There wait alſo dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſixteen <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and as many <hi>High-Dutch</hi> Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardiers.
This Guard was firſt introduced in <hi>Spain</hi>
by the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> and we were told there
are beſides theſe two old Companies of <hi>Spaniards</hi>
formerly the Guards of the Kings of <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
which are but ill payed, and the reſt not much
better. The morrow after Aſcention day <hi>Dom
Lewis de Haro</hi> arrived, the King having ſent
for him to the Solemnity of the <hi>Herradura</hi> or
marking of Bulls: a little after which his Majeſty
took horſe at the point of the Iſland of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and having commanded the people to go
without the rails, went with all his Court to the
end of a great Alley, to drive the Bulls into that
part of the field that is incloſed: Men on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
with great cudgels enrage them, whilſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
behind drive them forward with ſhouts
and blows. Then comes the King with his Court,
and the ſport is at an end.</p>
            <p>Their Majeſties having heard Maſs, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> the beſt Torreador, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42656:40"/>
is Champion againſt Bulls, of all <hi>Spain,</hi> begins
the ſecond hunting of theſe beaſts, to drive them
into the innermoſt partition, where they are to
be marked with a hot iron: There they remain
till 3. in the afternoon, at which time all Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and Scaffolds abounding with Spectators,
their Majeſties take their ſeat, and give order
to begin: within the Barricadoes ſtand ſeveral
young Country fellows (whom they call Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radors)
expecting the Bulls to grapple with them,
and two or three being let looſe, the braveſt
run and ſeiſe their horns, or tails, and ſeconded
by the reſt endeavour to caſt them on the
ground, whilſt others with hot irons mark them
on the thighs, ſome the mean while ſlitting
their ears. Much agility is neceſſary in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as well in performing it as afterwards, the
Bulls being very furious. To deceive them, the
aſſailants preſent each a Cloak or Hat, and the
Beaſt ſhutting his eyes when he gores, one of
the boldeſt leaps upon his neck, and catches
hold of his horns, the reſt doing the like to ſuch
other parts as they can light on, but he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
and hurts many, and it is ſtrange that
he kills not the moſt, for oftentimes running
right upon them, he caſts them down and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
over them, but thoſe one would think dead
(I know not how) ſodainly riſe again. They are
indeed very nimble in avoiding their horns,
and ready in falling to let them go by. This
ſport may be very pleaſant, but not to the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
and I admire ſo great a King vouchſafes
to look on it, and conceive he does it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42656:40"/>
out of policy to comply with the cuſtom,
then invited by any delight, he takes in it; but
that ſomething extraordinary might be done
for his diverſion; <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> cauſed his
Fool or Buffoon to enter the Liſts, who clad in
all manner of colours, and mounted on a white
Steed, was with it toſſed into the Air, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
trampled on the ground: Twenty two
or twenty three of the Bulls were marked, which
will be made uſe of at the Feſtivals of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
amongſt which we hope to ſee that of
<hi>St Iſadore,</hi> the Patron of the Town.</p>
            <p>A while after we went to the Eſcurial,
which to give it no leſs then its due, may in
<hi>Spain</hi> paſs for an admirable Structure, but where
building is underſtood, would not be looked
on as very extraordinary. In a general conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
it ſeems a maſs of ſtone of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
but going to particulars, ſcarce any of
them but falls very ſhort of the Magnificence
imagined, and that ſo much, that if <hi>Philip</hi> the
Second who built it, and was called the <hi>Solomon</hi>
of his age, did no more reſemble that wiſe King
then this edifice does his Temple, to which it is
often compared; the copy comes very ſhort of the
Original: in the mean time to ſtretch the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
they pleaſe themſelves in ſaying, that
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth like another <hi>David</hi> only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
this Holy work, which (being a
man of war and blood) God reſerved for his
Son. Ignorant ſtrangers are entertained with
this tale, but ſuch as are verſed in Hiſtory tell
us, that after the battle of <hi>St Quentin, Philip</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:42656:41"/>
the Second made two vows, one never to go in
perſon to the wars, the other to build this Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
for the Order of <hi>St Hierom</hi> inſtead of that
which had been burnt, it coſt him neer ſix Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Gold, though out of conſideration of
parſimony and convenience of bringing ſtone,
he made choice of the worſt ſcituation in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for it is at the foot of a barren Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and hard by a wretched Village called
<hi>Eſcurial,</hi> that can hardly lodge a man of any
faſhion; this may ſeem very ſtrange to thoſe
that know the Court is there twice in a year:
the place it ſtands on, is by tranſcendence called
the Seat, becauſe it was levelled in order to
build on.</p>
            <p>The Fabrick is very fair, with four Towers
at the four corners, but coming to it, one knows
not which way to enter, for as ſoon as out of
the great Walk, in a kind of Piazza, you ſee on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
little doors, which when you are over it,
lead into two Pavilions that contain Offices and
Lodgings for ſome of the Court; when you
have well viewed this ſide of the ſquare, you
come to that which is towards the Mountain,
where is a very large Magnificent Portal, on
each ſide beautify'd with Pillars; by this ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Gate you enter a Quadrangle, where right
over againſt it ſtands the Church, aſcended to
it by a Stair of five or ſix ſteps, as long as the
Court is large, extending from one ſide of it to
the other: very fair Columnes ſupport the
Porch, and on the top of the wall ſtand ſix
Statues, the middlemoſt of which are <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:42656:41"/>
and <hi>Solomon,</hi> by whom they would repreſent
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Philip</hi> the Second. About
the Church are many Pavillions, all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the exact ſquare which environs that
building. Report mentions many Baſcourts, but
we could not reckon above 7 or 8. That this
is a very fair Cloyſter for Friers cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
neither can it be allowed to be a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
Magnificent enough for ſuch a Monarch as
<hi>Philip</hi> the Second, who having built it in One
and twenty years, and enjoyed it Twelve or
Thirteen, boaſted, that from the foot of a
Mountain and his Cloſet, with two inches of
Paper, he made himſelf obeyd in the old and
new world.</p>
            <p>The King and Queens apartment have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them that appears Roial, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unfurniſhed, and they ſay, when the
King goes to any of his houſes of pleaſure,
they remove all to the very Bedſteds: the rooms
are little and low; the Roofs not beautiful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to invite the eyes to look up to them:
its many pictures of excellent Maſters, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of <hi>Titian,</hi> that wrought a great while
there, are very much vanted, yet there are not
ſo many as report gives out. The Spaniards have
ſo little underſtanding of pictures, they are
alike taken with all, and the Marquis <hi>Serra</hi> a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noueſe
that accompanied us ſufficiently, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the fooliſhneſs of a <hi>Caſtillian,</hi> who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have us admire the ſlighteſt and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt
Landskips of a Gallery where we were,
told us nothing could equalize them, becauſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42656:42"/>
in a place where their King ſometimes walked.
There are yet in the veſtry ſome good pieces,
eſpecially a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> and
in the Church, others very eſtimable. For paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in <hi>Freſco,</hi> the Quire done by <hi>Titian</hi> is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
an excellent work, and ſo is the Library,
I think by the ſame hand, where amongſt the
reſt is repreſented the antient Roman manner
of defending Criminals, who ſtand by bound
hand and foot; <hi>Cicero</hi> is alſo there pleading for
<hi>Milo,</hi> or ſome other, I not being ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his meen, to be poſitive and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
apprehenſion of miſtaking: this Library is
truly very conſiderable, as well for its length,
breadth, height and light; the Pictures and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Tables that ſtand in the midſt of it; as for
its quantity of choice and rare Books, if we may
beleeve the Monks; they are certainly very
well bound and guilded, and if I miſtake not,
but ſeldom read. In the Veſtry they ſhew Prieſts
Copes, where embroidery and Pearl with emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
contend, whither Art or Matter renders
them more rich and ſumptuous; they ſhewed
us a Croſs of very fair Pearl, Diamonds, and
Emeralds; it is a very pretty knack, and would
not become leſs ſuch if it changed Countreys;
I would willingly have undertaken for it if they
would have ſuffered it to paſs the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi>
had it been only to ſhew my friends a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand Crowns in a Nutſhel. The Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
I have ſpoken of; the high Altar and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of their Kings, which they call <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon</hi>
(though I know not why, unleſs becauſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42656:42"/>
a ſingle round Arch like the Pantheon at <hi>Rome)</hi>
are certainly the beſt pieces of this Magnificent
Fabrick. The high Altar is approached by ſteps
of Red Marble, and invironed by Sixteen pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of Jaſper, which reach the top of the Quire,
and coſt only a matter of 50 or 60 thouſand
Crowns cutting, between theſe are Niches with
Statues of guilded Braſs, and ſo there are on
the ſide of the Tables, and Praying places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Pantheon is under the Altar, and deſcended
by ſtairs, though narrow, very light; at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of this rich Chappel, a Marble ſhines,
whoſe luſter is heightned by reflexion of the
Gold, with which, all the iron work and part
of that fair ſtone are overlaid: In the middle
of it, and right againſt the Altar is a fair Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick
of Braſs, guilded, and in ſix ſeveral
niches, 24 Sepulchres of black Marble to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
as many bodies: above the Gate are two
more. This ſtately monument is ſmall, but
ſumptuous, it was finiſhed by the preſent King,
who about ſix months ſince placed there the
bodies of <hi>Charles</hi> the V, <hi>Philip</hi> the II, and <hi>Philip</hi>
the III. The firſt was moſt intire; in the niches
on the left, lie the Queens, and the laſt of them
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Burbon.</hi> He that preached
the day that theſe ſeven Tombs or Sepulchres
had bodies laid in them, began by his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
to ſpeak in preſence of ſo many Kings
who had conquered the world, and expreſſed
himſelf ſo well, and ſo highly pleaſed the King
that he got a yearly penſion of a thouſand
Crowns. Nothing attaining ſuch perfection as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42656:43"/>
to ſecure it from the Teeth of Criticks, the
three pieces I have now mentioned, have been
attacqued by them. It is objected againſt the
Library, that its entrance ſuits not with its Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
and Grandeur, and that it ſtands as if
ſtoln in, and not of the ſame piece with the
reſt.</p>
            <p>Over againſt the great Altar, where all is ſo
well proportioned, they wiſh away a ſilver
Lamp, whoſe ſize correſponds not with that of
the place it burns in, which is vaſt and large.
In the Pantheon they find great fault, that all
the ſteps by which it is deſcended are not Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that the ſides of the walls are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruſted
with it, the Chappel being all ſo, and a
like Magnificence requiſite every where: In the
brazen Candleſtick, the inner part which is not
guilded is diſcerned amongſt the black and foul
branches that extend from it. It coſt 10 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crowns, which is ten times more then it is
worth; but it is common in this Countrey to
boaſt things of exceſſive price, which they
would have admired on that account, as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are fooliſh Merchants, the ware
they buy too dear, were therefore the more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.
Theſe are my obſervations of the ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Eſcurial, adorned only by ſome ſmal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terras
and Fountains; one ſide of it affords a
handſome proſpect, but the ground near it is the
greateſt part Rock or Heath; ſome Walks and
Groves are planted about it, but being cold
and windy, trees thrive not. There are ſome
Deer in a kind of Park, ill deſigned, and with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42656:43"/>
very low walls; the way to it is nothing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
and the King who goes thither thrice every
year, one of which times is in the Winter, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
certainly find any great diverſion in thoſe
journeys, for during three months, all is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſnow. I have no more to ſay of theſe
two wonders of the world, <hi>The Eſcurial for Art,
and</hi> Aranjuez <hi>for Nature, The paralels of the
Son of</hi> Auſtria, (as is here ſaid,) <hi>according to
times and fancies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Twentieth of this month, all <hi>Madrid</hi>
aſſembled in the great Piazza to ſee the Bulls
fought; they mention this ſolemnity ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly,
as if it were to be compared to
the Nobleſt Spectacles of the antients: every
Town of <hi>Spain</hi> hath ſeveral days ſet apart for
it, and not any one of them but enjoys this
pleaſure about Midſummer. The people have ſo
great an eſteem for it, that they think you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
injure them if you prefer it not to all
others, and if you ſeem not to admire all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
you may as ſafely deny their King
to be the greateſt in the world.</p>
            <p>The proſpect of the Piazza this day muſt needs
be very agreeable: People of the beſt quality adorn
all the Windows and Balconies, hung with Silks
and Tapeſtrys of divers colours, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
oſtentation poſſible: Each Council hath
its Balcony hung with Velvet or Damask, with
a Scutcheon of the Arms belonging to it. The
Kings is guilded, and under a State; the Queen
and Infanta ſit by him, and the Favorite or
chief Miniſter in a corner of it; on his right
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42656:44"/>
hand is another great Balcony for the Ladies of
the Court, the reſt are promiſcuouſly taken up
by others. Both men and women ſet out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to all advantage poſſible, paying very dear
for the Balconies; thoſe on the firſt and ſecond
ſtories coſt Twenty or five and Twenty Crowns,
though the firſt rank cannot contain above
five or ſix perſons: the King pays for thoſe of
ſuch as are conſiderable to him, as Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
and Envoies of forreign Princes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Balconies are Scaffolds that extend ſome
feet into the Piazza; they are extreamly croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
all the people taking places dearer or cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
according to the poſts they make choice
of.</p>
            <p>Though theſe ſolemnities are very frequent,
three or four being yearly celebrated in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
the meaneſt Citizen will not once neglect
to ſee them, and rather pawn his Goods then
fail for want of Money. This takes its name
of diſtinction from <hi>St Iſidore,</hi> protector of the
Town, which therefore bears the charge; the
reaſon it paſſes not for a Royal Spectacle; it
coſts the King nevertheleſs ſomething, and I
was told, he gives every Council that day Three
thouſand Crowns: thoſe at <hi>Midſummer</hi> and
<hi>September</hi> are moſt eſteemed, when ſeveral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Liſts a horſeback, whereas at this of
<hi>St Iſidore</hi> all do it afoot. There are four paſſages
to the Piazza, which is ſtrewed with Sand, and
freed from thoſe moving Shops or Booths that
at other times peſter it; ſome ride, others walk
about it till the King appears, then his Guards
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42656:44"/>
break through the croud, and place themſelves
on each ſide to attend him: as ſoon as their
Majeſties are ſeated in their Balconies, all go
out of the Piazza, which being cleared, fully
diſcovers its beauty. At the ſame time four or
five <hi>Alguazils</hi> well mounted, and better then
becomes ordinary catchpoles, attend bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
and as ſoon as the King gives the word,
he of them that hath authority over the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
cauſes them to move from the place they
ſtand ranged in, and the barrels and ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins
that are in them, diſtil water ſo artificially,
that the whole Piazza is equally bedewed: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, they immediately depart by the four
Gates, which are ſhut as ſoon as they which are
to fight the Bulls are entered; amongſt theſe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
champions was a fellow of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on a Bull, he had mannaged and accuſtomed
to bridle and ſaddle; one a foot carrying his
Lance by him: he rid ſtreight up to the King,
and after a profound obeiſance, endeavoured to
ſhew his own and his Bulls addreſs; he cauſed
him to trot, gallop, and turn every way, but
that undiſciplinable creature, weary at laſt of
the tediouſneſs of the mannage, fell a kicking
and bounding ſo fiercely, he threw the poor
Peaſant, who not at all daunted at his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
ran after his Bull that made away, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the hooting of all the aſſiſtance till
he had retaken him; but theſe quickly began
again, for as ſoon as an <hi>Alguazil</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the keys of the place where the Bulls were
incloſed, which <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> threw to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42656:45"/>
him in obſervence of the cuſtom, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the Kings giving them to his favorite, and
his caſting them from the Balcony to the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guazils;</hi>
and that thoſe wild beaſts were let
looſe, and furiouſly attacqued one another; his,
though ſo well mannaged and harnaſſed, ſet on
a running without regard either to ſpur or bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
making it impoſſible for his Maſter to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
who ſtood prepared to that purpoſe with
his Lance in Reſt; ſo without any other effect
then the laughter of the aſſiſtants, after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
attempts, he retreated without ſtriking
ſtroke, though his Bull and he had received
many from thoſe that avoided not the ſhock,
but ran to it. At the beginning of this ſport
they uſually let one Bull looſe after another, who
according to his greater or leſſer fury with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation
attaques ſuch as are within the Liſts,
whom he ſoon drives away; but ſuch as are ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then the reſt, when they can no longer avoid
him, fall flat at their lengths, or preſent him their
Hats or Cloaks; he paſſes by thoſe that lie on
the ground without hurting them, becauſe when
he gores he ſhuts his eyes, and commonly
ſtrikes nothing but the Air; they which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
their Cloaks or Hats, by them, put a ſtop
to his rage, which lighting on any thing, is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
What I have hitherto mentioned, is but
the farce; the ſerious part, and that in which
the activity conſiſts, is the darting certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
or little Javelins, which the skilful fix be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Bulls horns, with admirable dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
without which they would be torn in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42656:45"/>
pieces. A Barber ſignalized himſelf, the Bull feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſmart of theſe little Javelins, (which for
their better ſupport through the Air are wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with red Paper) grows to a higher rage,
whilſt by his ſtrugling and tormenting himſelf, the
iron heads piercei farther. It is ſaid, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the horns of theſe creatures is a little
place, ſo very tender and delicate that the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
wound there is mortal; at which ſome of
the Champions can aim ſo well, that they kill
a Bull at the firſt ſtroke; when he ſeems almoſt
tired and ſpent, the Trumpets ſound, the ſignal
to hamſtring him: then with Swords and Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
they endeavor to cut the ſinews of his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
legs, after which, thruſts and ſlaſhes which
they call Cuchilladas ſhowre on the poor beaſt.
In this the common people make their bloody in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
apparent, for ſuch as can come at him,
would ſcarcely think themſelves ſons of honeſt
Mothers, did they not plunge their Daggers in
his body, after which, <hi>quaſi re bene geſta,</hi> they
march off triumphantly: When he moves no
more, Mules come a gallop to draw him out
of the Liſts, and another is let looſe. About
a ſcore were killed that day, the skins ſo
pinked, they could be of no uſe but to make
Sives; Dogs are ſometimes ſet againſt them when
it is too troubleſome and dangerous for men
to joyn them, and the pleaſure would ſure be
greater, if when the dogs have faſtened on them,
they forbore wounding them on all ſides: the
only horſeman that appeared this day, was the
Buffoon of Don <hi>Lewis de Haro,</hi> the ſame that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42656:46"/>
ſhewed himſelf at <hi>Aranjuez;</hi> he made one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
with his Lance handſome enough, but the
King unwilling he ſhould get miſchief, cauſed
him to retire. This manner of fight is to be
performed with ſhort ſtirrups, otherwiſe a leg
may be eaſily ſpoiled; not with mannaged hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but ſuch only as are fleet, and have tender
mouths: when the Bulls are to be attacqued
on horſeback, ſuch as have horſes proper for
it, cannot handſomly refuſe to lend them, nor
with honour pretend to any ſatisfaction, if (as
it often happens) they be ſpoiled in the ſervice.</p>
            <p>This days ſport properly belonging to Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants,
one ſuch, in affront to Cavaliers, came in
mounted on an Aſs, which the Bull at firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw,
but the fellow having recovered his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and ſilly animal, attacqued the Bull with ſo
good ſucceſs, that he gave him a great wound
between the horns, which bled extremely: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo gallant an exploit, he begged the Bull of
the King, which being given him he went
away with his famous prize, better ſatisfied then
if crowned with Laurel. The Bull oftentimes falls
upon the Guards, who ſtand ranked on one
ſide of the Piazza with Darts and Halbards;
if they kill him he is theirs; he twice charged
them through, and overthrew ſome of them,
nothing of gallantry appearing on their ſide, who
ſuffered the Bull to trample on their bellies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of killing him at their feet. The Algu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azils
or Serjeants are very conſpicuous, with fair
embroidered Saddles, and their horſes adorned
with Ribands, and taſſels; they were very nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42656:46"/>
in quitting all places the Bulls approached,
and it had been the beſt of the ſport to have
ſeen them charged home, at leaſt this was
moſt wiſhed, but by the readineſs of their
flight, they eſcaped theſe horns, though probably
not thoſe which are ſo common in <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The grand ſolemnity begins not till the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
but five or ſix Bulls are attacqued in
the morning, for the ſakes of ſuch as cannot
be preſent afterwards: at this, order is not ſo
well obſerved, which ſometimes occaſions miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
I was told that this day in the morning
ſeveral were hurt, and one kill'd by a horn that
entred by his eye. They end not but with day-light,
and every Gallant gives his Miſtriſs a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cone
and Collation. In all the circumſtances of
this diverſion, a certain inveterate cruelty derived
from <hi>Africk,</hi> and hat forſook not this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
with the Moor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is very remarkable: for
the pleaſure of ordinary Spaniards is not fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Bulls, the rabble delighting in nothing
ſo much as ſhedding his blood. At <hi>Tunis</hi> and
<hi>Algier</hi> are the like ſolemnities, but (as they
ſay) with greater ſplendor.</p>
            <p>As the publick ſports, the Moors introduced
in <hi>Spain;</hi> whilſt they poſſeſſed it, continue after
their exile; the Church alſo retains ſomething
of their ſuperſtition, eſpecially on <hi>Corpus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti</hi>
day. The Twenty ſeventh of <hi>May</hi> we ſaw all
its Ceremonies, which are many, and laſt long;
they begin by a proceſſion, whoſe firſt ranks
are intermixed with ſeveral Hoboies, Tabors,
and Caſtanettas, a great many habited in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42656:47"/>
coloured clothes, skip and dance as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
as at a Morrice. The King goes
to <hi>St Maries</hi> Church not far from his Palace,
and after Maſs, returns with a Torch in his
hand, following a ſilver Tabernacle, in which
is the Holy Wafer, attended by the Grandes of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and his ſeveral Councils. This day to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
diſpute, they obſerve not order, ſo that the
Counſellors <hi>de la Hazienda,</hi> joyn with thoſe
of the <hi>Indies;</hi> before theſe Counſellors and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
other perſons, move Machines, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Giants; theſe are Statues of Pasbord car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by men concealed under them: they are
of ſeveral ſhapes, ſome very hideous; all of
them repreſent Femals, except ths firſt, which
is only the Figure of a great head painted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
which is concealed a little man that gives
it meen and motion: it being a <hi>Coloſſus</hi> over
the body of a Pigmie. Amongſt theſe chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Monſters, there is one which repreſents two
Gianteſſes, Moors, or Aethiopians, ſuch having
really been if we may beleeve the vulgar, who
call them <hi>Hios de Vicinos,</hi> that is, neighbors chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
The people are ſo taken with theſe
Gothick figures, that there is ſcarce any Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
without them. They report the Gianteſſes
to have lived in the time of King <hi>Mammelin,</hi>
and on that account ſometimes call them
<hi>Mammelins,</hi> after the name of that Gothick
or Mooriſh King, who once Reigned in <hi>Spain.</hi>
I was told of another terrible Pageant which
they call <hi>Taraſca,</hi> from a wood that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
in <hi>Province,</hi> where at preſent ſtands the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42656:47"/>
City of <hi>Taraſcon</hi> on the banks of <hi>Roſne,</hi> over
againſt <hi>Beaucaire.</hi> They fancy that in this
place was once a Serpent (no leſs enemy of
Mankind, then that which ſeduced our firſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
in Paradice) called <hi>Behemoth,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that <hi>St Martha</hi> by oraiſons triumphed
over it, leading it priſoner in her apron ſtrings.
Be this Hiſtory or Fable, the <hi>Taraſca</hi> is a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of enormous greatneſs, in form of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
moving on wheels, the body covered
with ſcales, a vaſt belly, long tail, ſhort feet,
ſharp talons, fiery eyes, gaping mouth, out of
which extend three tongues, and long tusks.
This Bulbegger ſtalks up and down and they
which are under the paſtboard and paper, of
which it is compoſed, by certain Springs, cauſe
it to move ſo dexterouſly, that it puts off the
Hat to the Sots that ſtare at it, and ſometimes
lays hold on Countrey fellows, whoſe fright
moves laughter amongſt the people. Such as
pleaſe themſelves in telling wonders of this fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
relate that a certain Town having ſent to
ſome of its neighbors ſix of theſe paper Giants,
two Pigmies, and the Taraſca to be made uſe
of on <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, they which give them
their motion being entred, to divert themſelves
in the paſſage, cauſed them to dance as at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
by couples: they were met by certain
Muliters or Carriers, who (Moonſhine diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
at a diſtance, theſe imaginary Monſters,)
marching with a great deal of prattle and
loud laughter, for their merrier paſſing two
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42656:48"/>
or three Leagues) not recollecting what was
to be done the day after, were ſo affrighted,
that the terror ſtill augmenting, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
thoſe fantaſmes, they at laſt run
away with all their might. The conducters of
the Monſters perceiving this, caſting off their
Vizards, went out of the Machines to diſabuſe
them, running after them to cauſe them to come
back to their Mules and charges; this increaſed
their aſtoniſhment, and haſtened their pace,
which aided by the wings of fear, ſoon tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
them croſs the fields to a village, which
they allarmed to free the Countrey of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
men, ſo hideous, they could be little leſs
then Devils: the other in the mean time ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
their caſes, and perceiving themſelves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the the ſpoils, the muletiers had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
began to viſit the baggage, and finding
Wine, drank ſo much they fell faſt aſleep till
morning. The Muletiers after their raiſing the
Village, and bringing the Juſtice to the place,
perceived their miſtake, and the Countrey fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
laughing heartily at them, drank the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the Wine in recompence of their
trouble. The Village of the ſolemnity, a great
while waited for thoſe grim Puppets, which
came too late, and by their excuſe and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what had happened, diſordered the whole
proceſſion, changing it into a Ring of ſuch as
abandoned the Croſs and Banner, to heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to their ſtory. The pleaſanteſt poſture of theſe
Mammelinas that I ſaw was, when they made
their ſalutes before the Queens Balcony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42656:48"/>
ſome ſeats of activity by addreſs of thoſe
that dance them. The King paſſing by it, ſalutes
the Queen with a ſmile, and the Queen and
Infanta riſe a little before he comes at them,
to return his compliment; The Proceſſion ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
filed to the Piazza, returns by the High
ſtreet or Calle Major, adorned by many Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtries
waving on the Balconies, filled with men
and women of all conditions: the croud is ſo
great, one cannot paſs without difficulty, and
we had much ado to return to <hi>St Maries</hi>
Church where the proceſſion ended. As ſoon
as free from it we went to the Palace, and
there ſaw the King, Queen, and Infanta, return
with all the Court Ladies: I think I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
all that is worth notice, unleſs it be that
as on this day all the men put on Summer
cloaths, ſo do all the Ladies, and thoſe new and
very rich, of ſeveral faſhions and colours. In
the afternoon about five a clock, <hi>Autos</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented:
theſe are ghoſtly Comedies, with
interludes, very ridiculous to give relliſh to what
is ſerious and tedious in the pieces themſelves.</p>
            <p>The two companies of Players that belong
to <hi>Madrid</hi> at this time, ſhut their Theaters,
and for a month repreſent theſe Holy Poems:
this they do every evening in publick on Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds
erected to that purpoſe in the ſtreets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the houſes of the Preſidents of ſeveral
Councils. They begin at Court the day of the
Solemnity, where a ſeat under a State is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for their Majeſties: the Stage is at the
foot of theſe Scaffolds, and little painted Booths
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42656:49"/>
rowled to it, environ it, and ſerve as tiring
houſes. This is continued certain days, every
Preſident having one, and a Stage and Scaffold
erected before his houſe: before theſe <hi>Autos</hi>
begin, all the foppery of the Proceſſion dances,
and the Gigantine Machines make the people
ſport; but what I moſt admired in that which I
ſaw at a diſtance in the old <hi>Prado,</hi> is, that in the
ſtreets and open air they uſe Torches to thoſe
pieces, which in the daily Theaters, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
doors, they repreſent without other light
then that of the Sun: all theſe antick ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
appeared much more ridiculous to thoſe
that beheld them, then they can poſſibly do in
my deſcribing them, and confirm me in what
I often obſerved, that the Spaniards, and other
wiſe and grave nations ſeem fondeſt in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions,
as Miſers at their Feaſts ſometimes
become moſt prodigal.</p>
            <p>The next day the Alguazils came to the
houſe where we lodged to demand account of
our hoſte of his proviſion of victuals and what
Poultry he fatted. They were very inquiſitive,
what he did with ſuch abundance, and where
and why he had bought it; he told them we
gave him Money to be our Caterer, but this
would not ſerve his turn, becauſe ſo great ſtore
is forbidden by Law, and gives a jealouſie that
the Maſter of the houſe keeps an Ordinary or
Penſion, which is not allowed: beſides all which
certain witneſſes depoſed that he ſent victuals
abroad to ſome of the company that lay ſick,
and that he bought ſome at the private Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42656:49"/>
of Don <hi>Lewis</hi> de <hi>Haro</hi> and others, all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtreightly prohibited. The reaſon why nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ordinaries nor Penſions are allowed in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
nor any part of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeems very ſtrange,
when they tell you that conſideration of the ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility
of the Countrey, gives apprehenſion of
Famine, and an entire disfurniſhing the Markets
by thoſe that keep ſuch houſes; for it appears
to me, that liberty being left to every one to
buy what he pleaſes, and as much as he pleaſes,
provided it be by his Domeſtick, the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
will no leſs follow.</p>
            <p>However, it is good to keep out of the
Laws clutches in <hi>Spain;</hi> eſpecially, in occaſions
where the Catchpoles interpoſe; for, for a matter
of nothing, they ſeize and carry away all, and
the Maſter to priſon, from whence he eſcapes
not without the aid of Money, be his cauſe right
or wrong; eſpecially, if he be thought rich:
falſe witneſſes are never wanting, and here
the neighbors had depoſed againſt our hoſte out
of envy; but his good luck was to be Tenant
to an Alguazil; this Serjeant mediating with
his Comrades, aſſiſted by four piſtols, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
was cancelled, and our Hoſt not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to priſon as they had intended: by this,
all here appears vendible, though had this cheat
of the Alguazils been complained of they had
run hazard of being ſent to the Gallies. This
was almoſt the only puniſhment inflicted in thoſe
times by reaſon of want of men to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
at the Oar.</p>

An Aſſentiſta, that is a Patentee or Farmer
of Levies of ſoldiers, or of the Kings Revenue,
was a little before aſſaulted in his chamber by
Theeves, one of which being taken, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his confederates; amongſt whom, (though
they ſet daggers at his throat, and wounded him
in the head) was a Frier; the firſt with his
Comrade was whipped and ſent to the Gallies,
and the Frier condemned to paſs the remainder of
his days between four walls with bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This man being a ſtranger, little befriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ignorant of the cuſtomes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
had much ado to obtain this Juſtice. He
was born at St. <hi>Omer,</hi> but reſides ordinarily at
<hi>London,</hi> from whence he ſends Iriſhmen to ſerve

way but to find out ſome <hi>Negro</hi> Slave.</p>
            <p>The Commerce of the Indies hath reſtored

ſcarce any remain to purſue that fatal imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Beſides this deſtruction made by the
Mines, it is ſaid the Wine ſent thither, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſo many diſeaſes, that the greateſt part of
the Indians die. They are paſſionate Lovers of
this liquor, and ſpare nothing that may obtain
it; and the Spaniards to diſcover the Treaſures
they may have concealed, ſell it them, to the
ruin of their goods, health, and ſtrength for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
and I remember to have read a Book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
<hi>Las Excellentias del Eſpannol,</hi> in four or
five Chapters where the Author makes appear
the prejudice the King and Traffick of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
receive by the Vines planted in <hi>Peru;</hi> and
often repeats, that the vice of the Weſt-Indians
being Drunkenneſs, many of them periſh by
Wine, not like their <hi>Chica,</hi> made of Maiz and
more agreeable to their Conſtitutions; beſides
that, the Spaniards to get more, and by ſelling it
cheap, to make quicker returns, falſifie it, in ſuch
a manner, it is little better than poiſon. On
theſe occaſions the Indians are ſo much waſted,
that for ſome years there have not been enough
to work in the Vine-yards nor Mines of <hi>Peru.</hi>
Negro's are therefore made uſe of, bought in
<hi>Guine,</hi> or the Kingdom of <hi>Angola;</hi> by which
means the profit is much leſſened, a Negro coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
50 or 60 Crowns, and ſince <hi>Portugal</hi> hath
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42656:51"/>
re-eſtabliſhed their true King, and that all thoſe
Countries of the <hi>Indies</hi> that are ſtrongeſt in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,
have acknowledged him, Negro's are
not had ſo cheap; for beſides the 60 Pieces of
Eight they coſt, the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> hath laid
an Impoſt equal to the Price, ſo that a Negro
comes not to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> where they land, till
he ſtands the Spaniards in above 200 Crowns.
The profit the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> makes by this, is
incredible, thoſe that underſtand Trade, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it amounts yearly to ſome Millions of Gold.
The conſideration of this and ſome other things
before mentioned, make evident to me what I
was often told at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that the great wealth
of the <hi>Indies</hi> belongs more to particular perſons
and ſtrangers, than to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
that at this time when the Gallions are expected
richer than in many late years, becauſe of the
return of the Viceroy, it is thought 3 quarters
of what it brings is on account of Merchant Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and that there will not come to the King
and natural Spaniards above Three Millions of
Gold.</p>
            <p>They which manage the Affairs of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
very proſperouſly advance their own, and
the Earl of <hi>Pigneranda</hi> Preſident of its Council,
draws vaſt ſums for Licences to French Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;
One I knew, that for leave to bring a
hundred Hides from St. <hi>Domingo</hi> by the Gallions,
gave Ten Piſtols. Notwithſtanding all which,
much deceit is uſed in that particular, and the
greateſt part of the French that trade into <hi>Spain,</hi>
import and export at their pleaſure all manner of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42656:51"/>
Commodities, by pretending to be Walloons,
Burgundians, Lorrainers, or Flemings. For
this reaſon the King was counſelled to give free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to trade, and to aboliſh the Fees of Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Impoſt of the Tenth Peny on all French
Merchandiſe; repreſenting that his profit would
be greater, becauſe the uſual duties would be
paid without any fraud; whereas to avoid this
Tenth, the Merchants combine, and they that
have French Goods, get one or other to atteſt
they are Engliſh or Flemmiſh, and ſo (at moſt)
pay but the ordinary Cuſtom, of which alſo
they are ſometimes crafty enough to deceive
him.</p>
            <p>The Commerce of theſe is principally in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daluſia,</hi>
where they have found a place of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as convenient as <hi>Cadis;</hi> this is the haven of
<hi>Santa Maria,</hi> a little Town belonging to the
Duke af <hi>Medina Coeli,</hi> who protects them, and
draws great Trade to the prejudice of <hi>Cadis</hi> and
<hi>Sevil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were at peace, Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
was more difficult then at preſent, little Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe
arriving that was not confiſcated under
pretence of coming from <hi>Holland.</hi> There never
wanted two or three Knights of the Poſt to
ſwear this, but time and care have given remedy
to this miſchief, and falſe ſwearers eſcape not,
Merchants by preſenting a Bever, or ſome other
Knack, putting themſelves under the protection
of ſome Grande.</p>
            <p>By this is evident that <hi>Spain</hi> cannot well be
without Commerce with <hi>France,</hi> not only on the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42656:52"/>
Frontiers of <hi>Biſcai</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> where it hath
been almoſt ever permitted, but through the
whole Countrey where it is prohibited, for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi>
hath ever had correſpondencies in the
Kingdom of <hi>Valentia,</hi> by its neceſſity of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Commodities; and for the ſame reaſon
<hi>Britaign, Normandy,</hi> and other parts on the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
have continually ſent theirs to <hi>Cadis</hi> and
<hi>Bilbo.</hi> I ſpeak not of Corn and Stuffs of all ſorts
brought from that Country, but even of Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
and Sword; by which it appears a miſtake
to think that in theſe dayes the beſt come out of
<hi>Spain.</hi> No more being now made at <hi>Toledo,</hi>
few but forrain are uſed, unleſs a very ſmall
quantity that come from <hi>Biſcai,</hi> which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſivly
dear.</p>
            <p>It is moreover hard to imagine how much
<hi>Spain</hi> ſuffers for want of manufactures: So few
Artificers remain in its Towns, that native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
are carried abroad to be wrought in
forrain Countries. Wools and Silks are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
raw, and being ſpun and weaved in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> return thither at dear
rates. The Land it ſelf is not tilled by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
it feeds. In Seed-time, Harveſt, and Vintage,
Husbandmen come from <hi>Bearn</hi> and other parts
of <hi>France,</hi> who get a great deal of money by ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and reaping their Corn, and dreſſing and
cutting their Vines. Carpenters and Maſons
are (for the moſt part) alſo ſtrangers, who will
be paid treble what they can get in their own
Countrey. In <hi>Madrid</hi> there is hardly a Water-bearer
that is not a Foreigner, ſuch are alſo the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42656:52"/>
greateſt part of Shoomakers and Taylors, and it
is believed the third of theſe come only to get a
little money and afterwards return home, but
none thrive ſo much as Architects, Maſons, and
Carpenters. Almoſt every houſe hath wooden
windows (here being no glaſs) and a balcony
jutting into the Street. Once in five years all
Fabricks are re-builded, of which the Frontiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
only is done with Lime, the ſides and back-parts,
being uſually earth.</p>
            <p>Every houſe in <hi>Madrid</hi> pays duties to the
King which mount high, the firſt floor of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one is his, which if not redeemed, he may
ſell at his pleaſure; This the Proprietors uſually
buy, to do which if they be not able they build
no more but it alone. This is the reaſon there
are ſo many little houſes in <hi>Madrid,</hi> with only
one ſtair to get up to the Garret. The moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Architecture is that which is adorned
with ſome Tower, only one of theſe is allowed,
and he that will build more, muſt have permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to do it: A fellow that thought he ſhould
have much ado to obtain this, begged leave but
for one, which being eaſily granted, he built
one on account of the permiſſion, and another
becauſe one had never been prohibited. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more notorious, then that <hi>Madrid</hi>
wanting both ſome Rivolet to void its filth and
Vault to receive it, caſts all into the Street; but
it is admirable to ſee that by vivacity and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of the Air, all is conſumed in a moment,
it being as drying and corroſive (if one may ſo
call it) as lime that devours a body before the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42656:53"/>
corruption diſcovers it ſelf, and I have found
dead Dogs and Cats in the Streets that ſmelt
not, by which we may perceive they had reaſon
that choſe this place for the Seat of their Kings,
the Air being not only hard to corrupt, but
takes away even the cauſe of corruption, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of Elementary qualities as ſudden as
imperceptible. In antient times their Queens
repaired hither to lie in, that the Princes might
at their births breath an Air whoſe purity is not
to be equalized. The Waters of this place have
been weighed againſt ſeveral other, and none
have been found ſo light. The Cardinal Infant
had them carried with him into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and
great care was taken to ſhip for him Tuns of the
ſame the King drinks, the Fountain of which is a
little without the Town. The Streets here being
Common Shores, one ran great hazard, were it
allowed at all hours to caſt out at window what
the people will no longer keep in their houſes;
but from day break til ten at Night this is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
under a pecuniary mulct. Once I remember
I ſaw a Woman that had forgot this, whom the
Serjeants, that wait on ſuch little advantages,
immediately cauſed to pay the Fine, which is
Sixty Rials, about <hi>25 s.</hi> of our Money. They
which walk a Nights, carry neither Torch nor
Lantern, which I never ſaw born before any,
whether in Coach, a horsback, or a foot; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of quality only make uſe of theſe, ſuch as
belong to the Court eſpecially, who then mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
all their Footmen. Women here go abroad
with much more ſplendor than their Husbands,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42656:53"/>
for beſides a great number of ſervants about
their Sedans, a Steward or Maſter of the Horſe
ſtill follows them on horſeback: in great houſes,
Footmen neither enter their Lords chamber,
nor yet his apartment, they being ſerved by
their Gentlemen, Pages, and other Officers;
when called, they kneel, receiving their
Commands; this cuſtom hath gone higher in
the Favourites family, for I have been aſſured,
that when Don <hi>Lewis</hi> gives Audience, and his
Secretary ſerves as Interpreter, he kneels; and
what is ſtranger, that <hi>Fernando de Contreras</hi>
(none of his Domeſtick, but the Kings ſervant,
and the moſt conſiderable of his Secretaries of
State, as having charge of the <hi>Deſpecho</hi> Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal)
pays him that honour. For what concerns
the reſpect due to the King and all ſuch as are
near him; they have many little cuſtoms very
extraordinary; amongſt others, that no man ever
mounts a horſe the King hath once made uſe
of: and they ſay, that after the taking of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellona,</hi>
in the Cavalcade his Majeſty made to
<hi>Atocha;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Medina de los torres,</hi> ſent
to preſent him his moſt beautiful horſe that
was ſo famous in <hi>Madrid;</hi> but the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
him ſaying, <hi>Scrina laſtima,</hi> that is, it
were pity, ſince by that means he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
uſeleſs, and rid only by Querries: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no horſes are ſo little rid as the Kings,
who almoſt burſt with fat, acquired by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ſtanding in the Stable, which is not very well
furniſhed, becauſe he gives away the beſt; he
lately ſent the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> Twelve of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42656:54"/>
greateſt value; the wars have made horſes very
ſcarſe and dear in <hi>Spain,</hi> eſpecially in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of winter, when all provide themſelves
to ride about the ſtreets of <hi>Madrid,</hi> whoſe dirt
is ſo troubleſome, it can neither be avoided nor
got out of any thing it lights on.</p>
            <p>They are cheaper in <hi>June,</hi> people going afoot
during the fair weather, which laſts till the end
of <hi>September.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were told of another cuſtom, no leſs
extraordinary, that no natural Son of the
King, owned to be ſuch, may enter <hi>Madrid;</hi>
and that Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
Commands in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> was never there,
he was bred at <hi>Ocanna,</hi> ſome Leagues from the
Court where the King ſometimes viſited him,
and not long ſince he was within a League of
this Town where he alſo met him. It is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this King hath more ſuch iſſue, but being
by Ladys of quality, he owns them not; he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
attempted any without ſucceſs; yet a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Lady of <hi>Madrid,</hi> is reported to have been
inexorable to him, though ſhe was not ſo to
all the world; ſhe ſtill excuſed her ſelf with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
of as much eſteem as reſpect for his
perſon, but that ſhe could not without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
apprehend to become a whore of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
            <p>I enquired the reaſon why the Kings natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
iſſue may not come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> but found
none could ſatisfie me; for that which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
received, that it is to avoid diſputes of
the precedence between them and the Grandes
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42656:54"/>
of <hi>Spain,</hi> is of no validity, ſince I have ſeen
a Letter of <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> to <hi>Don John</hi> of
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> which treats him, not only with High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but moſt Serene Highneſs; but whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the cauſe may be that the Gates of the
Court are thus ſhut againſt them, and of the
jealouſie real or imaginary, might be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by their preſence there; it is moſt certain
that this nation hath a great deal, for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in the leaſt concerns it in love or Honour,
of which, many little ſtories of daily paſſages
in <hi>Madrid</hi> are related, where the extravagance
of Women produces various paſſions in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of criminal Gallantry, which hath its
punctilios of honor as well as a knot of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
men, its juſtice within it ſelf; They which
keep <hi>Amancebadas;</hi> that is, Miſtriſſes main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at their charge, are more jealous of them
then of their wives; and ſuch of theſe as have
a ſervant that ordinarily viſits them, call him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel
and Traytor, if they ever know he goes to
others, and to this purpoſe I have been told that
the King himſelf being with a Lady the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of <hi>Caſtille</hi> kept, that young lord tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by jealouſie, forgetting all reſpect and
conſideration, having knocked violently at the
door, gave the Mother of that wench who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, many boxes on the ear, ſaying, Jade,
thou makeſt me Cuckold, but if I could get
up, I would ſtrangle both thee and thy daughter,
were it in the Kings preſence.</p>
            <p>Though the Profeſſion of Curtiſans admits no
conceptions but of intereſt and deſign for rapine,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42656:55"/>
they are ſometimes excellent Counterfeiters of
Paſſion, and borrow the tranſports of real af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
The Earl of <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> who at his firſt
arrival at <hi>Madrid,</hi> paſſionately attacked that
Sex, tells as a Gallantry, his uſage by one of
thoſe Cattle, who openly at the <hi>Tour</hi> fell upon
him with reproaches of infidelity, calling him
<hi>Traidor</hi> and <hi>Picaro,</hi> becauſe ſhe had heard he
had a new Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>de Mogeron</hi> was not a little ſurprized, by
a Womans treating him in the ſame manner one
Evening, pulling him by the hair with reproaches
and injuries; becauſe he had not viſited her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a promiſe made her at the <hi>Tour,</hi> where
he met her the day before. They do a thouſand
ſuch extravagances, and are really Miſtreſſes of
the Epithite <hi>Bizarre,</hi> which in their Language
is underſtood in ſo good a ſenſe. They are ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
in their habit, and wear their richeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements
under others very homely, ſo that
you would not take any of them to be braver
than the reſt, unleſs you ſee them at ſome Feſtival,
or that as they paſs by, they let the Clinquant of
their Waſtcotes appear; their Linnen is Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
moſt generally uſed and beſt eſteemed in
<hi>Spain:</hi> they paint not their faces only, but change
alſo the colour of thoſe parts that leaſt appear.
Their Smocks are alſo laid with Bonelaces, where
viſible only to their Gallants, indeed of thoſe
ſlight ones that are made in <hi>Provence</hi> or <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
thoſe of <hi>Flanders</hi> being unknown to them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
when they force ſome bits of them from
Strangers, tearing their Bands or Cuffs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:42656:55"/>
Beſides the great numbers of looſe Women
that are to be found up and down <hi>Madrid,</hi> there
are others in certain fixed quarters, countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by Publick Authority, for accommodation
of any that will go to them. Theſe are called
<hi>Cantonera's,</hi> perhaps <hi>Bulkers.</hi> They have a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
from the Town, for which cauſe ſo infamous
an imployment is ſought after, and when one of
the Jades dies or is diſabled by the Pox, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
are ſollicited for the vacancy. What
their Penſion is I could not learn, but thoſe
which aſſured me of this beaſtly eſtabliſhment,
told me that every one that viſits them is obliged
to pay them 12 <hi>Quarto</hi>'s, about 6 Pence of our
Money. Phyſitians are fee'd by the publick, to
take care they be free from thoſe Peſtilential Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
that are gained by ſo honourable a Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
A Matron alſo belongs to them, who is
obliged to advertiſe the Magiſtrate or Phyſitian,
as ſoon as ſhe diſcovers any thing amiſs. They
which deſcribed to me the lives of theſe miſerable
creatures, told me that when they are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
a ſecond man is never admitted, on which
account there never happens any diſorder; the
firſt enterer leaving his Sword and Dagger at the
Door, which when they which come after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
they retire without more ado. Sinning
thus with impunity and toleration of Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they ſeldom forſake the vice they ſo
openly profeſſe, though one day in the year is
devoted to exhort them to repentance: On a
Friday in <hi>Lent,</hi> they are by an <hi>Alguazil</hi> or
two conducted to the Church of Penitents, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42656:56"/>
there ſeated near the Pulpit, where the Preacher
does his beſt to touch their hearts, but ſeldom
with ſucceſs; after many vain exhortations to
amend their lives, deſcending from his Pulpit, he
preſents them the Crucifix, ſaying, <hi>Behold the
Lord, embrace him;</hi> which if any does, ſhe is
immediately taken away, and ſhut up in the
Cloiſter of Penitents; but uſually they only hang
down their heads and ſhed a few tears, without
laying hold on what is offered, and after their
grimaces continue their deboſhed life; neither
can the Story of St. <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> ſo often
inculcated to them, move them to imitation
of her.</p>
            <p>In this antick of remarques which I have dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
with ſo many colours, I muſt not forget what
concerns the impriſonment of the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain.</hi>
He failed but very little of an eſcape,
and that news had not come of his being enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Frontiers of <hi>Portugal</hi> when he was thought
ſtill in the heart of <hi>Caſtille.</hi> As ſoon as he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in <hi>Spain</hi> he was confined to <hi>Toledo,</hi> without
being admitted to the Kings preſence. When
misfortunes of War of State caſt one Soveraign
into the hands of another, methinks he ought
not to be treated altogether as a Priſoner, but
that his Captivity ſhould be made uſe of, to
work upon him and gain his affection by Offices
of honour and civility. Of the two French Kings
that were taken Priſoners, it is notoriouſly
known that <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt left <hi>Spain</hi> intirely
poſſeſſed by thoughts of hatred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
on account of his ill uſage by <hi>Charles</hi> the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42656:56"/>
Fifth: and that <hi>John</hi> returned from <hi>England</hi> ſo
well ſatisfied, that he was ever afterward careful
to live with <hi>Edward</hi> as with a Friend and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
but the Spaniſh auſterity ſuffers not a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime
that may be deceitful, and graſpes hard what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it laies hold on to prevent eſcape: She would
never let Duke <hi>Charles</hi> taſte the air of her Court,
and notwithſtanding his many inſtances, ever
treated him as a ſimple priſoner of State, though
ſhe ſuffered him to go abroad under good Guard
both to Church and to take the Air, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
him to attempt greater liberty. Thus he
laid his deſign, One of the Kings Coaches was
appointed to attend him, whoſe Coachman hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to be a Lorrainer, and conſequently his
ſubject. He ſuppoſed this mans affection to his
natural Prince, would oblige him to be aſſiſting
towards his liberty, and reſolved to have him
ſounded. I could not learn whom he made uſe
of to engage him, nor in what manner he ſet it
a foot, but it is ſaid, that having gained him, he
ſeveral times left Tickets under the Cuſhions of
the Coach, and the place he ſate on, which the
Coachman very carefully took away; and by
means of a Lorrain Embroderer, ſent to
thoſe that had the principal management of the
Affair. This went ſo far before its diſcovery,
that the Coachman had received inſtructions to
drive the Duke very often beyond a ruinated
Building that was near the part he uſually fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented,
and one day, when leaſt ſuſpected, 50
Horſmen were appointed to lie concealed behind
it, who having killed his Guards and ſet him at
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42656:57"/>
liberty, were to convoy him to the Frontiers of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> where 500 Horſe ſhould be ready to
receive him. A Ticket, and perhaps the laſt
that was neceſſary to this Negotiation, diſcovered
it; for whether it were that it was not handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough conveyed under the Cuſhion, or
whether the Captain that then commanded the
Guard, and was in the Coach with him, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
better what was done than others, or that
he was more jealous, going out of the Coach,
ſearching the Cuſhion, he found the Ticket;
upon this the Duke was more ſtraitly ſhut up, the
Coachman impriſoned, and the Ticket ſent to
<hi>Madrid,</hi> where the Dukes Secretary and the
Embroiderer were ſecured; the laſt of theſe was
racked, but the particulars of what he depoſed
never publiſhed The light that appeared at the
bottom of this Affair, moved the Spaniards
themſelves to ſay, <hi>That to hold the Duke faſter
at the very time his liberty was moſt earneſtly ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
they perſwaded him he would have made an
eſcape:</hi> whatever may be of it, it is certain the
Duke was not afterwards allowed to go out of
<hi>Toledo,</hi> and that this unfortunate Prince might
juſtly complain, <hi>That if the French Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
was a ſmoke that drove him from his Houſe
with tears in his eyes, the Spaniſh Friendſhip was
a fire that burnt him alive.</hi> Which if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
publick report, was his own expreſſion to
the Captain that guarded him. All that hath
been given out of the cauſes of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath divulged but part of the miſtery, and
I ſought at <hi>Madrid</hi> to inform my ſelf of the real
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42656:57"/>
motive. They which ſpeak and judge moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly
ſay, <hi>That this was rather done on account of
reaſon of State, and to ſpare money, than that he
had indeed be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>raied his party;</hi> and truly the taking
quarters in the Land of <hi>Liege</hi> that Winter, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him no more culpable that year, then his
ſeeking them at his Swords point had done in
thoſe that went before: but the conjuncture dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
and the Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> who had made
himſelf abſolute Maſter of that people, deſirous to
give them a more powerful protection, clamored
much at the Diet of <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> from whence,
as misfortune would have it, he retired diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the Emperour, for having decided to the
advantage of him of <hi>Mentz,</hi> the Diſpute that
was between them about the Function of crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King of Romans. As ſoon as he arrived
at <hi>Cullen,</hi> he wrote to the Emperour, that
without ſpeedy ſuccors, according to the Laws of
the Empire, to free his Countrey from the deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations
of the Lorrainers, he muſt have recourſe
to the protection of ſome foraign Prince. This
Affair being taken into conſideration, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
only wrote about it to <hi>Bruſſelles</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid.</hi>
The Elector in the mean time took heat,
and reſolving no longer to expect the event of
thoſe delays, raiſed forces, treated with <hi>France,</hi>
and gave her opportunity of re-aſſuming the
Black Eagle in her Colours, and renuing the
Title of <hi>Preſerver of the German Liberty.</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Mazzarin,</hi> who during his retirement
had been ſo well received by this Elector, loſt
not the opportunity of making his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42656:58"/>
and ſent him Troops under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Monſieur <hi>Faber,</hi> which joyned to his
own, forced the Lorrainers to diſcamp, whom
it was reſolved to purſue even into <hi>Brabant,</hi> to
revenge the havock they had made in the Land
of <hi>Liege,</hi> and aſſiſt the French in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.
I his bold proceeding, awaked the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
jealouſie, who perceived that in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moment he had re-eſtabliſhed his Authority
in the Empire, and when he had given an end to
a Diet, in which he had cauſed his Son to be
crowned King of Romans, one of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt
Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſought other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
than his, and gave example to all his
Neighbours to do the like, as often as they
ſhould be oppreſſed by Troops entertained by
<hi>Spain.</hi> Theſe conſiderations obliged the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
to ſend the Earl of <hi>Furſtemberg</hi> to the
Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> to work him, and prevent
his going farther in the Treaty with the French,
promiſing him an effectual and real ſatisfaction
for what was paſſed, and for the future to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
ſuch order, he ſhould no more need to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the like viſits. At the ſame time he
wrote to <hi>Madrid</hi> and <hi>Bruſſelles,</hi> with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
efficacy, to repreſent the dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of this Affair, how prejudicial it was
to him, and neceſſity of the remedies he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
which were to ſatisfie the Elector of
<hi>Cullen</hi> with Money, ſo to oblige him to lay
down Arms and diſmiſs the French, to make
ſure of the perſon of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that
he might be no leſs ſo of his Conduct, the cauſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42656:58"/>
of all theſe inconveniences, and to uſe his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Duke <hi>Francis</hi> for continuing the Army in
the Spaniſh Service, which he thought might
eaſily be prevailed upon, by giving it a Head of
the ſame Family, and preſenting the Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
with money. Theſe reaſons and expedients
were the better relliſhed by the Spaniſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
out of apprehenſion of the Storm that
began to gather againſt them. The great
Services the Duke had rendered the Houſe of
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> were of no advantage to him in their
Council, nor any thing examined but his avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and unequal Politicks, his irreſolutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
were repreſented, and the times in which
he had declined their Service, when they might
have obtained great advantages, if he would
have acted with his forces.</p>
            <p>The accompt was alſo caſt up of the great
Sums he had coſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> yearly, by
a crafty ſelling him his Army as if at an outcry,
ſo that if they would make uſe of it in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of a Campagne, or continue it at the
end of it, he muſt be paid at his own rates. It
was at laſt concluded as well at <hi>Madrid</hi> as <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles,</hi>
that for a certain remedy to all theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
to prevent falling again into the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
and put a ſtop to the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
making at <hi>Liege,</hi> the Elector was not only
to be indemnified, and the protection of the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> abandoned, but his perſon to
be ſeiſed on and ſent into <hi>Spain.</hi> Thus this
Prince ſaw himſelf treated as a Soldier of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and not like a Soveraign, by a Family
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42656:59"/>
whoſe friendſhip cauſed the loſs of his Countrey,
and reduced him to the ſad neceſſity of living
like a vagabond at the Head of an Army that
ſubſiſted only by his induſtry. If what hath
been reported of the firſt heats of his youth be
true, and that he then lamented he was not born
a private Gentleman, to try how far his wit and
courage could carry him; one would think he
had deveſted himſelf of his Dominions, only to
ſhew what he could do without them. That he
had very eminent parts, is undeniable, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed
by ſuch uncouth Policies, and in ſuch
a manner intermixed with humor and vanity,
that one would think he had but one Maxime
ſacred and inviolable to him, <hi>To prefer what
was profitable above what was honourable or honeſt.</hi>
It is not therefore ſtrange that he built his ruin
on ſo bad foundations, nor that after his imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that crafty <hi>Lewis</hi> the Moor Duke of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
and all his ſhifts and ſlights of hand, he is
caught in a trap, from whence his deliverance
is very incertain, and whether he end not his
dayes in the Caſtle of <hi>Toledo,</hi> as the other did
in the Tower of <hi>Loches;</hi> though it is believed
here, that were his Army disbanded, his liberty
might be obtained without much difficulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Spaniards are confident they need ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
nothing from this Prince, who loves
his money too well to employ it in his revenge,
and the 200 thouſand Livres a year he is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have within the Dominions of the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> to forfeit them. To which they adde,
that were he deſirous to take Arms, he needs the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42656:59"/>
ſupport of <hi>France,</hi> which he will probably fail
of obtaining, without an entire giving up <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
which they will either keep ſtill, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
on conditions but little better, and ſuch as
he will never accept, for fear of depriving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of what belongs to him for ſo ſmall an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
towards his particular ſatisfaction.
On theſe grounds they adde, that even the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of <hi>Spain</hi> wiſh the deſtruction of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which in the faſhion it ſubſiſts and is diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined,
coſts them very dear, but they would
gladly gather together its ruins, and incorporate
them with their other Troops, that their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
might not profit by them, the fear of
which hinders their undertaking it. This makes
evident that Princes are incommoded by Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
forces that ſerve in a Body, and under a
Head they own as their abſolute Maſter, for it
is alwayes hard to oblige them to do well, and
no leſs difficult to disband or be quit of them,
and therefore the wiſeſt Princes, that have been
neceſſitated to make uſe of ſuch, have at firſt
endeavoured to ſeparate and mix them with
their own, to prevent their correſpondence,
and diminiſh the Authority of thoſe that
brought them. The Venetians once endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to deal in this manner with the Marquis of
<hi>Roquelaure,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> at relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Berghen ap Zome,</hi> would have obliged
<hi>Mansfelt</hi> to ſuffer ſuch a ſeparation: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them would conſent, but made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that this is not to be propounded or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
but of a Soldier of fortune, that hath
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42656:60"/>
drawn together forces he is not able to make
ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>The moſt publick curioſity, whilſt we were in
<hi>Spain,</hi> was to divine the deſignes of that Fleet
<hi>Cromwel</hi> ſent into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and at our arrival
at <hi>Vittoria,</hi> being ſaluted by a man of good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
who enquired what was ſpoken of it in
the parts we came from, when we told him it
was believed thoſe great preparations were made
to ſubdue the Iſle of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> he aſſured us
that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> began there they would fail
of ſucceſs, that he knew that Country very well,
having lived ſome time in it, and that this Iſland
was one of the ſtrongeſt and moſt populous of
<hi>America.</hi> That after the year 1586, in which <hi>St.
Domingo</hi> (its Capital City) was ſacked by Sir
<hi>Francis Drake,</hi> it was put in ſuch a poſture as
could no more apprehend the like misfortune,
and a very fair Citadel raiſed adjoyining to it,
whoſe ſcituation is ſo advantageous, it ſeems,
deſtined to command the neighbouring Sea.
When we came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> I found that thoſe
little Cabals, as well of <hi>Spaniards</hi> as Strangers,
that met a Mornings in the firſt Court of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
uſually entertained themſelves with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances
<hi>Cromwel</hi> had given the Spaniſh Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,
that the Fleet he had ſent into the <hi>Indies</hi>
ſhould attempt nothing againſt his King: that
they therefore made no queſtion but it was to
drive the <hi>French</hi> out of what they poſſeſſed in
<hi>New France,</hi> and that it was there he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
a Warre againſt them, and break that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Peace from which he had often declined,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42656:60"/>
and again complied with, the better to amuſe
them. But the clear ſighted eaſily judged ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
preparations aimed not at ſo ſlight a
Conqueſt. Computing his charge, they found
that all the <hi>French</hi> poſſeſſed, whether Iſlands or
Continent in thoſe quarters was not equivalent
to any conſiderable part of his expences, and
therefore concluded he had ſome vaſter and
more important deſign. Theſe men ſeemed to
me to flatter themſelves leaſt, and to be moſt
reaſonable, for I had often heard ſuch as had
negotiated with <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſay, that if they had
any judgement, they aſſured themſelves they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook
not in this obſervation, that he had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
paſſion for ſome great Enterpriſe in the
<hi>Indies.</hi> After he had made all <hi>Europe</hi> admire
and fear his Naval Power by a War againſt <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which yet was more glorious than profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his Country, it is probable he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
how to imploy his arms in ſome part where
he might reimburſs part of his charges. Although
of all his Neighbours he at that time uſed the
<hi>French</hi> worſt; yet it may eaſily be judged it was
not his intereſt to come to an entire rupture with
them; becauſe their Traffick for the moſt part
making uſe either of <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> Veſſels,
he ſhould by that means diſpleaſe either his own
Merchants, or thoſe with whom he had lately
made peace, beſides that the <hi>French</hi> had for ſome
years been Maſters at free-booting againſt whom
if he ſent a Fleet, they would eaſily avoid it, their
deſign being only to pillage; ſo that he ſhould
be at a great charge againſt them that would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42656:61"/>
flye from him, and waiting for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
oblige him to convoy's; unleſs he would
loſe all the Trade of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and part
of that of the Ocean. <hi>Cromwels</hi> intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
requiring a War, and a War by ſea, that
may yield him profit proportionable to the great
equipage of Men, Arms, and Ships he is obliged
to maintain, to make himſelf feared, by which
he hath obtained the Command of both Seas, he
will not attaque <hi>France,</hi> who having all within
her ſelf, waits till Strangers bring home to her
that ſhe can be without, and fetch from her
that which is abſolutely neceſſary to them. For
it hath been obſerved that her greateſt and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt
Cities are not ſcituated near the ſea
(though two waſh her Coaſts) but in the middle
of the Country. By this appears that her Stock
of wealth is within her ſelf, and that (according
to the Polititians rule) ſhe is rather <hi>Vendax</hi> than
<hi>Emax,</hi> ſelling more than ſhe buys. Her ſoil
being ſo rich and fertil, it is no wonder ſhe hath
in all times abandoned the Ocean to be plough'd
by her Neighbours, who employ a great part of
their art and labour to ſend her as tribute the
fruits of it. To make a war therefore againſt
<hi>France</hi> with profit, it muſt moſt certainly be
done by land; but if we conſider the preſent
condition of <hi>England,</hi> a War of this nature ſeems
not to agree with it; for we may eaſily judge
that <hi>Englands</hi> deſign now aims at no more then
to maintain her ſelf in her preſent poſture, and
to become redoubtable to all the Princes of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
by a power ſuitable to her ſcituation, which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42656:61"/>
hinders their attempting any thing againſt her,
and obliges them (though againſt their wills) to
approve what hath paſſed, by owning her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.
To this purpoſe ſhe reſolves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
potently armed both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
one of which puts her in a condition to
concern her ſelf in all the affairs of her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
without their interpoſing in hers, whilſt
ſhe is invironed by a prodigious number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
moving Caſtles, which when ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſhe joyns for her defence, and cauſes to fly
for her advantage to what part ſoever ſeems
good to her; by the other ſhe thinks ſecurely
to fix her innovated tyranny, in continual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of an inſurrection of the people, to reſtrain
whom her Militia is a curb, as it is lightening to
deſtroy thoſe that attempt to war upon her. In
fine ſhe can make uſe of theſe winged courſers
both near hand and at a diſtance, and nothing
confining them to her Coaſts, where there will
always remain enow; for Guards and Rounds
exact enough to juſtifie her <hi>Media inſuperabilis
unda,</hi> the reſt may ſeek their fortune abroad,
and either wait for the <hi>Indian</hi> Treaſures in their
way to <hi>Spain,</hi> or ſeize them in their mines. But
it is not thus with her land-forces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who muſt
ever be at home to keep up her uſurped power,
which will be hazarded by the firſt ſhock ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
from the many male-contents that have
much ado to ſuffer her.</p>
            <p>A War by land muſt needs therefore be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to <hi>England</hi> in the preſent Conjuncture,
and with <hi>France</hi> deſtructive, it being the moſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42656:62"/>
potent Nation of Chriſtendom in this age, its
Forces the moſt united, and that may with the
greateſt eaſe be drawn to any part where there
ſhall be occaſion for them, ſo that it cannot be
attacqued, but by great and courageous Armies;
of which if this pretended Republick make uſe,
ſhe muſt disfurniſh her ſelf of her truſtieſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
and ſtouteſt Souldiers, which ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do without danger of loſing her new form of
Government. Neither is it very much to the
purpoſe to ſay, that for ſecuring it ſhe can make
new Levies, to ſupply the places of the old ones
ſhe ſends abroad; for to an unſettled power,
ſupported only by the boldneſs of the Uſurpers
that raiſed it, ſuch a change is very dangerous.
It cannot be denied that <hi>England</hi> uniting with
<hi>Spain</hi> would turn the ballance that way; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, to do ſo would be of little advantage
to her, there would be an incounter of the ſame
inconveniencies. For ſhe muſt either joyn her
Forces to theirs, and then <hi>France</hi> that is ſo great
a nurſery of Souldiers, having put an end to its
civil warre, minding only that which is forraign,
would not need much to ſtrain it ſelf to oppoſe
Armies belonging to ſeveral Maſters, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
intereſts, which ſeldom ſucceed in any thing
they undertake; or elſe ſend an Army of her
own, againſt which <hi>France</hi> would immediately
unite all its power, and be the mean while only
on the defenſive againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> who to make a
thrifty uſe of ſuch a conjuncture, would move
but ſlowly and weakly to aſsiſt her. However
ſhe might proceed, this is moſt certain, ſhe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42656:62"/>
would be conſtrained to weaken her Land For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the only Supporters of that New Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
Should ſhe act only by Sea, and furniſh
the Spaniards with Money, to recruit their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
it hath been already ſhewed ſhe would
make no advantage by the former, and that a
War attended by ſuch Booty and Conqueſt as
may countervail the charge and labour is only
proper for her: for the ſecond, it is ſufficiently
known that the Treaſure of <hi>England</hi> is much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
and that ſhe owes large ſums both to
her Land and Sea Forces; and that to prevent
her over-charging her People, by the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
ſhe is obliged to, the Gold of <hi>Peru</hi> is
more neceſſary to her, then to ſupply from her
own Treaſury thoſe that are Maſters of it.</p>
            <p>During theſe Diſcourſes, Letters came to
<hi>Madrid</hi> that cleared all Doubts, for after a long
amuſing the World with expectation of the Fleet
and the great Treaſure it was to bring with it,
and after knowledge that what was on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Gallion, which had been wracked, was
for the moſt part ſaved, a rumor aroſe that it
had been met with by the Engliſh, who made
no difficulty of attacquing it, but that after a
vigorous defence, in which it ſunk two or three
of their Ships, it had retired into the <hi>Havana,</hi>
the Chief City of the Iſle of <hi>Cuba.</hi> I know
not whether this particular was true, but am
certain it was written from <hi>Cadis</hi> and <hi>Sevil,</hi> and
from that time believed that <hi>Cromwell</hi> intended
to have his ſhare of the Treaſure of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
More to confirm this, the Engliſh Merchants
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42656:63"/>
that reſided in <hi>Spain,</hi> began to ſend away, and
as well as they could to conceal their Goods,
fearing a Confiſcation in caſe of Rupture; a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after which it appeared that this Pre-caution
was not uſeleſs, for Admiral <hi>Blake</hi> who had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Spring and part of the Summer in the
<hi>Mediterranean,</hi> returned into the Ocean juſt at
the time the Gallions were expected. It is ſaid
he deſired to careen, which not being permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but on certain conditions, he ſeemed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
and having taken aboard him ſeveral
Engliſh Merchants with their Conſul, put out
to Sea, and ſcouted about Cape St <hi>Vincent.</hi> It
was then quickly underſtood that he looked for
the Gallions, with intention to fight them if
they eſcaped <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Venables,</hi> who were in the
<hi>Indies;</hi> this cauſed ſeveral Advice Boats to be
diſpatched from <hi>Cadis</hi> by Order of the Council
in <hi>Madrid,</hi> to give notice to the Gallions that
they ſhould not leave the Haven they were reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to, till farther Order: at the ſame time a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
was taken to fit up ſome Ships, partly at
the Kings Charge, and partly at that of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
that were concerned to watch the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this Admiral. Great part of the Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
of <hi>Europe</hi> depending on the arrival of the
Gallions, many Ships are ever about <hi>Cadis</hi> at
the time it is expected. Of theſe and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
a Fleet was quickly made ready, and ſent
to anchor near <hi>Blake,</hi> yet without hoſtility, if
the other began not, and only to endeavour
(in caſe the Gallions had not received the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
ſent them) to ſecure them from him. Theſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42656:63"/>
two Fleets contemplated one another two or
three moneths without any act of hoſtility, either
general or particular, and whileſt one of them
thus waited for his prey, and the other to ſecure
it from him, news came that the <hi>Spaneſh</hi> Fleet
was advertiſed of the deſign againſt it, and would
not leave the Haven it had retired into without
expreſs order. At the ſame time alſo it was ſaid
that <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Venables</hi> had attacqued <hi>St. Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
but with ſo bad ſucceſs, that after loſs of
many of their men, they went off for the Iſland
of <hi>Jamaica</hi> and conquered it.</p>
            <p>This proceeding of <hi>Cromwell</hi> changed the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of thoſe that looked on him as one of the
neareſt and faithfulled Allies of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had
firſt of all acknowledged him: For as ſoon as an
execrable Party of the ſcum of this Nation, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
all Laws divine and humane, had poſſeſſed
themſelves of its Government, and (by an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
ſo horrible it cannot be paralelled in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
times, nor ſcarce miſtruſted in the worſt
that ſhall ſucceed) at one ſtroke deprived their
King of his Crown and head, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
received order from <hi>Madrid</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make advantage by it, and court the
friendſhip of that new Republick for his Maſter,
by giving it in his name all ſuch titles and rights
of a legitimate Power as it ſhould deſire: it was
very likely he might ſucceed in this, there being
probability enough of a league againſt <hi>France,</hi>
who not only received the exiled Family of the
King of <hi>England,</hi> and refuſed to own <hi>Cromwell,</hi>
but ſeiſed all his Ships, and gave freedom of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42656:64"/>
his Havens to thoſe that remained faithful to
their King.</p>
            <p>The hopes of ſo advantageous a Treaty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
in <hi>Madrid,</hi> not only by <hi>Englands</hi> giving
Letters of Repriſal againſt <hi>France,</hi> and landing
forces hoſtilely in <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> but by her being ſo
kind to <hi>Spain,</hi> that ſhe cauſed her Fleet to take
thoſe ſhips <hi>France</hi> ſent to ſuccour <hi>Dunkirk</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
by it. All theſe fair appearances of Amity
proved inſignificant, and the Uſurper that governs
in <hi>England,</hi> who ſeems no leſs crafty than bold
ſo well underſtands the intereſts of his infant
Republick, that he by degrees accommodates all
to them.</p>
            <p>She is Miſtriſs of many ſtrong and populous
Iſies ſcituated on the paſſage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
that are keys to to the Gates that may lay open
a way to ſo rich a Conqueſt, by means of
which, ſhe may ſurprize its treaſures as they
paſs by, if ſhe will not take the pains to dig
them out of the Mines, of which ſhe may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
make her ſelf Miſtriſs: ſhe knows that
all the great extent of Land the Spaniards poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
there, adheres to their Dominion, more
out of apprehenſion of their violence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
none hath vigorouſly attempted to deprive
them of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then by any real power they have
eſtabliſhed, capable of preventing this, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
thus underſtanding the advantages ſhe hath
towards getting her ſhare of the new world,
with the weakneſs of thoſe who pretend it
diſcovered for them alone; it is not ſtrange if
ſhe endeavor to profit by both of them; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42656:64"/>
in a time, where they which ſit at Helme
are obliged to be powerfully armed, and to
employ their many Fleets in ſome profitable
war, that may make them ſubſiſt without the
peoples murmuring at their great charge in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
them: and the Spaniards, as quick
ſighted in their politicks, as ſlow paced in their
enterprizes, very well foreſee, that if the French
Negotiations with <hi>Cromwel</hi> effect a peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, he will purſue his intereſt, and
forget all advances <hi>Spain</hi> hath made to gain his
friendſhip, This they think they ought the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
to believe, when they remember they could
never get ſatisfaction for ſeveral prizes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Engliſh, eſpecially, for the money
deſigned for a whole Campagne which they
ſent by ſea to <hi>Flanders,</hi> not knowing how to
make it over by Bills of Exchange, by reaſon
of their difference with <hi>Genoua:</hi> however, that
they might not in ſo conſiderable a conjuncture,
be wanting to themſelves, and out of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the advice, <hi>Philip</hi> the II gave his Son
at his death, to be in peace with <hi>England,</hi> that
he might be able to make a war with all the
world; they neglected nothing that might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<hi>Cromwel</hi> to a good underſtanding with
them. <hi>Alfonſo de Cardenas</hi> their Ambaſſador in
<hi>England,</hi> and who having reſided there ſince
the beginning of the troubles, is looked on as
very able in manageing thoſe affairs, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all means of a good underſtanding, and to
thwart the French Treaty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but his politicks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apprehended at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to be leſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42656:65"/>
then thoſe of <hi>de Bourdeaux</hi> the French
Ambaſſador; a reſolution was taken to ſend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of <hi>Flanders</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Leda,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> as Extraordinary; theſe
two perſons joyned all their adreſs to bring
<hi>Cromwel</hi> to ſome friendly compoſure of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
about the complaints the Spaniards
made againſt him, and his againſt them; but
finding no favourable Audience of their many
propoſals, the laſt of theſe reſolved to be gone,
with regret, to have done nothing for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ſervice, but to have given him clearer light
of <hi>Cromwels</hi> bad intentions againſt him: it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
began to be more publickly diſcourſed in
<hi>Madrid;</hi> that the many delays in his Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
with <hi>France,</hi> were but tricks to lull the
Spaniard aſleep, whilſt he ſent to attacque his
<hi>Indies;</hi> and that the Treaty which he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſeemed ready to break off, and again to
renew, had been agreed on, and privately ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
three moneths before. <hi>Spain</hi> now beleeved
<hi>England</hi> intended a breach with her, and though
the paſſion of the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> inveighed ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt the avarice and ambition of <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
which moved him to invade their Treaſure;
the moderate ſort reaſoned otherwiſe, and in
what was paſſed, ſought the cauſes of what was
preſent and to come. But by ſuch diſcourſes, one
could not judge of the whole ſecret, or entire
cauſe of the war they apprehended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the thoughts
of ſuch as ſit at the Helme of Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
covered with a cloud of appearances, which
diſguiſe them even to thoſe that have the neareſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42656:65"/>
proſpect; for the moſt part diſcovering nothing
but the pretences; their actions being like great
Rivers, of which, though the ſtreams are view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all, the heads are invſiible. They yet
at laſt eaſily perſwaded themſelves, that whilſt
their King had ſo many irons in the fire, that
he knew not where to find either Wood or
Coals to heat them, <hi>Cromwel</hi> would make uſe of
the occaſion to attacque him both in the new
and old world, where expecting little reſiſtance,
he needed not doubt of a certain profit, more
conſiderable to him then the jealouſie of the
French progreſſions or cautions given by the
maxime, <hi>Decreſeat Iberus nec creſcat Gallus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On theſe grounds they concluded, that <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
fearing a peace between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
and ſtanding in need of an advantagious war to
juſtfy his continuing in Arms, would attacque
the weakeſt, and let the future ſafety of his eſtate
giue way to the preſent neceſſity, and on that
account agree with <hi>France,</hi> that he might ſhare
in her victories by leaving Land enterprizes to
her, and applying himſelf to thoſe of the ſea,
which better ſuit with his affairs and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of his power.</p>
            <p>But if all this diſcourſe be grounded on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
by which they which are curious in
<hi>Madrid,</hi> ſeem to divine of the future, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
reaſons perhaps very different from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Councils; it is not ſo where it concerns
what they ſay of the right the Engliſh may
have to attempt the <hi>Indies.</hi> Such amongſt
them as are moſt reaſonable and leaſt ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42656:66"/>
freely confeſs, that by the law of nations,
Countreys that have made no Treaty or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
may be aſſaulted by them that on other
accounts are in peace with thoſe which appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
them: So that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having,
in all Treaties he ever made with the Kings
his neighbors, declared, that whoever goes to
the <hi>Indies,</hi> either to ſettle or traffick, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
natural Spaniards, ſhall be uſed as enemies,
cannot complain of ſuch acts of hoſtility, as are
made by other nations, ſince himſelf hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
a perpetual State of war, owning neither
friend nor ally beyond the Line, eſpecially in
<hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe the anſwer of a great <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Miniſter is remarkable, rallying on two healthes
were drank to him, one to his Maſters Wife, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his Miſtreſs: <hi>America</hi> ſays he, is my Maſters
wife, and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> his Miſtreſs; for the later
he is not ſo jealous as to think himſelf concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
honor, if any of his friends too freely careſs
her; but his Wife he would keep chaſte and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerved,
without ſuffering any to court her.
Queſtionleſs when he called <hi>America</hi> his Maſters
Wife, he alluded to the Popes Bull, which gave
him power and propriety in this intended Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
but it is generally ſaid that a Rape merits
not ſuch a benediction, ſince he poſſeſſes <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
without either her own conſent, or that of
her relations, <hi>Europe, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſpeak ſeriouſly, the Popes donation is a
ridiculous title to thoſe that own not his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
beſides, that a great number of thoſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42656:66"/>
that do, believe not that it extends to things of
this nature; ſo that if <hi>Spain</hi> have no other right
than what is derived from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe is not well
inveſted in the poſſeſſion of the new world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can they which diſpute it againſt her be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
of injuſtice, ſince ſome of them ſay they
owe him no obedience, and others that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſpoſe of that which belongs not to him.
Nothing then appropriates it to <hi>Spain</hi> but the
firſt diſcovery, to have landed Colonies here
and there, to have built Cities and Fortereſſes,
ſubdued the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and given names to Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and Havens: But all this cannot have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a poſſeſſion abſolutely general, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception; and ſince it made its ſeiſure by
the law of ſuch things as are <hi>Nullius &amp; quae fiunt
primi occupantis,</hi> it hath right to no more than
it inhabits, cultivates, and hath entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.
Any Nation may with juſtice take his
part of the remainder, and <hi>(Spain</hi> going about
to hinder) make uſe of force, and by force drive
away him that hath ſettled himſelf only by
force.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond fortified himſelf by
the Popes Bull, for invading <hi>England,</hi> he added
to that title the moſt conſiderable forces that had
ever appeared on the Ocean: What is ſpiritual
thus ſtands in need of what is temporal, one of
them well ſeconding the other, without which
admirable conjunction it is very hard to ſeiſe
what belongs to others.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Council ſpared neither wit nor
induſtry, nor the wealth of the whole Kingdom
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42656:67"/>
for this redoubted Fleet, in which they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
not to ſend fetters to enſlave the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Great Britain:</hi> but their Forces both
ſpiritual and temporal had very ill ſucceſs, and
that prodigious Navy which could hardly be
compleated in two years, was loſt in two hours;
part of it the ſea ſwallowed, and the reſt fell
into the hands of thoſe it went to ſubdue, and
of all that proud Armado, ſcarſe any eſcaped to
carry the ſad news into their Country: by which
it is very diſcernable that Heaven does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
correſpond with the viſible Head of the
Church. If he diſpoſes of what belongs to the
<hi>Indians,</hi> becauſe Barbarians, one would think
it ought to be reſtored as they become Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
but their Converſion is to little purpoſe as
to recovery of their Country; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
very exactly imitate Eccleſiaſticks in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions,
like ſo many diſmembrings of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies
of the Laity, from whom whatſoever
is taken returns no more; and if they well keep
what they have once laid hands on, they can as
well cauſe themſelves to be obeyed. Their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
is formidable, and he that doubts of this
truth, may be convinced of it in their Cloyſters,
where ſuch religious perſons as have neither
dignity or parts to ſet them out, are rather
Slaves than Brothers in Chriſt to the other. If
within their walls they exerciſe ſo abſolute a
power, on thoſe which are as it were their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
priſoners, and make the ſame profeſſion,
what will they not do to ſuch as are of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
condition, if they obtain the authority they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42656:67"/>
deſire, and which ſome of them know ſo well
how to make advantage of under pretence of
Religion and directing conſciences, without fear
of puniſhment, forſaking the functions of legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Confeſſors, to creep into Families, and
make themſelves arbitrators of their affairs and
intereſts.</p>
            <p>But to return to this Papal Donation, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
clear, that this imaginary propriety of a world
as yet not well known, and of which probably
not ſo much is hitherto diſcovered as we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of, cannot, nor ought not to hinder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
people from trafficking there, becauſe it
belongs to the firſt finder, and that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
acquired thoſe parts of it they poſſeſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any conſent of other Nations to enjoy the
propriety and ſoveraignty of the whole as heirs
of it.</p>
            <p>If then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> now attacque the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſuch as are juſt acknowledge that
this is not ſo much to begin as to continue a
War, ſince they alwayes (more or leſs) moleſted
them there, and that no formal Treaty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Country was ever made with them.
I have heard ſome very curious perſons examine
what good or evil might by it accrue to either
of theſe Potentates; and they hold that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> would be the firſt gainers, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
ſeiſing all that belongs to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in
their Dominion. They would find conſiderable
ſumms in the hands of Merchants of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as well at <hi>Bilbo, Cadis,</hi> and <hi>Sevil,</hi> as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42656:68"/>
other of their Port Towns, which might aſſiſt
them towards the firſt charge of the War.</p>
            <p>For we may remember that <hi>England</hi> hath
for many years been poſſeſſed of all the Trade
of <hi>Spain, Hollanders,</hi> during their War, and the
<hi>French,</hi> ſince their breach, trafficking only by
her interpoſal. So that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves very conſiderably, and poſſeſſed
themſelves of much wealth in a Country that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
in money, and is poor in Commodities,
and that cannot receive from its Neighbours
what is neceſſary for it but by their hands.</p>
            <p>We cannot oppoſe againſt this Confiſcation
of the goods of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants in all parts of
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Territories, the like to be done to
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> for as they never go
abroad to ſerve any forrain Prince in his Wars,
they have a Maxim for ſecurity of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
not to exerciſe it but in Countries where
their King is Maſter. They go not therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
how great ſoever their Trade be, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themſelves to deal at home with Merchants
Strangers, who for want of correſpondence are
forced to ſettle amongſt them, which they do
the more willingly, becauſe having to deal with
people not very well underſtanding their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modies
they make the greater profit.</p>
            <p>We ſee now the King of <hi>Spain</hi> without danger
of a retaliation of his Subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he ſhall
ſeiſe what belongs to thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
here and there in his Dominion: But this
ſmall and inconſiderable advantage, prejudicial
only to private perſons, is not to be compared
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42656:68"/>
to that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will obtain, by cruiſing in both
ſeas, and attacquing what ever is ſent to <hi>Spain</hi>
from its Neighbours, without which it cannot
without difficulty ſubſiſt. <hi>Genoua, Naples, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi>
and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> whoſe Comerce with it
is ſo great, will then be able to ſend little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that ſhall not run hazard of falling into
their hands; and if they ever make Conqueſts
in <hi>America,</hi> or take the Plate-fleet (to which it
ſeems they are forward enough) the <hi>Thames</hi>
will be covered with the ſpoils of both worlds.</p>
            <p>To all theſe conſiderations of particular loſs
one of State is to be added, which is, that by a
War with <hi>England,</hi> the vaſt and ſcattered body
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy will loſe its ligaments,
and all communication with its remoter Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
France leaves her little liberty but by
ſea, of which this potent Nation, that attributes
to it ſelf the Empire of it will deprive her. It
is true, ſome object that ſhift will be made to
open a paſſage as was done in her War with <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but others obſerve great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
thoſe powers, for beſides that <hi>England</hi> is
ſo advantageouſly ſcituated, that it can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty break all correſpondence between
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Naval Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
appeared not at its height, till the War was
grown old, and the firſt animoſity decayed, where
as now <hi>Spain</hi> will have to do with a Nation,
that does not raiſe forces to fight, but fights to
employ thoſe that are already raiſed. Beſides
all which, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was not then ſo
drained of men and money, as at preſent, but
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42656:69"/>
could ſet out conſiderable Fleets to oppoſe the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> who making Traffick alone the end
of their Navigation, rather ſought for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
free paſſage through all ſeas, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
their enemies of Communication by them;
and this ſo much, that though they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
attempted the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleets, and taken
ſome of them, we may perceive they were not
very greedy of ſuch Conqueſts, becauſe their
own Merchants were concerned, and received
almoſt as much prejudice as thoſe of <hi>Cadis</hi> or
<hi>Sevil.</hi> It is well known that at the ſame time
their ſhips cruiſed up and down to interrupt the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Traffick, their Merchants paſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
between <hi>Flanders, Genoua,</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> in
favour of it, and carried thither the ſecreteſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
and beſt ammunition, whereas in a
War with <hi>England</hi> all will go in a more ſerious
and real manner, and <hi>Cromwell</hi> little caring to
advance his Nations Trade, will vigourouſly fall
on, and aiming directly at Conqueſt of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
endeavor every where to incommode <hi>Spain</hi>
in order to it.</p>
            <p>About this time two Books were publiſhed in
<hi>Madrid,</hi> which clearly and ingenuouſly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the great exigencies of the State. This
was admired by ſuch as could not imagine a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<hi>Spaniard</hi> would ever own its ſpirits ſpent,
and it in a languiſhing condition. The Author
of the firſt was one <hi>Don Philippo Antonio Aloſa,</hi>
a Knight of the Order of <hi>Calatrava,</hi> of the
Kings Council, and his Secretary in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
general of the Holy Inquiſition. It contained
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42656:69"/>
an Exhortation to Eccleſiaſticks to ſupply the
King by voluntary Contributions, in the ſo very
preſſing neceſſity of his Kingdom; of which
having firſt declared the Cauſes, which he deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the time when <hi>Philip</hi> the Second en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
almoſt all his Revenues, for aiding the
French League and building the Eſcurial, and
repreſented how under <hi>Philip</hi> the Third his Son,
occaſions of expence augmented, by reaſon of
the Wars of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> removal of the
Court from <hi>Valladolid</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> with his
great Charges in entertaining the Princes of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> and Reception of the Engliſh and
French Ambaſſadors; and that which compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ruin of the State, and drew on it the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremeſt
miſery, the raiſing the value of Copper
Money, by which <hi>Sajavedra</hi> ſays more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
happened to <hi>Spain,</hi> than if all the Serpents
and Monſters of <hi>Africk</hi> had attacked it: he
makes out, that the preſent King at his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
received the Crown ſo poor, it was admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
there could be found wherewithal to reſiſt
ſo many Enemies as at once proclaimed War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it; and concludes, that after the many
ſhocks it hath ſuſtained, it will hardly any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
prove able to defend it ſelf, without recourſe
to ſome ſudden ſupply, though it be uſeleſs to
fancy New Impoſts, or augmentation of the
old ones, there being a general incapacity in the
ſubjects to pay what is already laid upon them.
This pre-ſuppoſed, he continues that applications
ought to be made to the Clergy only, who have
ever kept their doors open to all manner of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42656:70"/>
acquiſitions, and cloſely ſhut againſt the leaſt
alienation, and who with little or no expence
poſſeſs the greateſt wealth of the Kingdom, till
a more learned Pen make evident, they may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be compelled to contribute to the Kings ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
occaſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, he declares his deſign to be no
more but to oblige them to a voluntary loane,
which he ſhews will be to their advantage; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
if the Kings neceſſities force him to preſs
the Laity with rigor, they will abandon Tillage
and the Country, in ſuch manner, that Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Rents, deduced only from the hands of
the other by Tythes, and the like, will fail.</p>
            <p>Going on he adds that ſuch a liberality is
more eſpecially due to the moſt Catholick King,
who aims only at the Churches good, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
aſſiſtance for continuing the War only in
order to an advantageous Peace, neither does
he demand any thing that he firſt gave not, all
of them having received their benefices and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
from his Majeſty as their Patron: That
they need only ſpare part of their Plate, Jewels,
and rich Moveables, abating ſomething of their
great Trains, entertained queſtionleſly by them,
ſhew that grandeur, they will more handſomly
make appear by aſſiſting their King: afterwards
he ſayes that to give this greater efficacy, the
King may pleaſe to make choice of one of his
great Miniſters of State, to whom the Clergy
have ſome kind of obligation on account of
their preferments, and from whom they may
reaſonably expect more, by his report to the
King and Council of their forwardneſs and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42656:70"/>
he adviſes farther, that addreſſes be not
made to the Body or Convocation, but to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
and an exact regiſter kept of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingeſt,
which will on all occaſions be uſeful to
them, towards acquiring greater favors. By
this method, which is nothing elſe but a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of State, he ſuppoſes the King may amaſs a
conſiderable ſum towards paying his Troops,
that periſh for want, and re-eſtabliſhing his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
which the ſame neceſſity hath ſo much
diſordered.</p>
            <p>The Second Book was a Memorial drawn up
by a certain Captain called <hi>Joſeph Puteol,</hi> in
which he repreſented to the King, that by
eaſing his people he would be the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to make War, <hi>Como aſſiſtiendo à to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos
ſe pue da lograr el hazer mejor la Guerra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Expedients he propounded, ſpoke him
a man of parts to ſuch as knew him not, but in
others prejudice, raiſed a contempt of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
becauſe he was not in an eminent condition;
as if the validity of a medicine depended on the
quality of the Phyſitian, <hi>&amp; aliquando etiam
Olitor commode poteſt eſſe locutus, &amp;c.</hi> but paſsing
by theſe, I will here recount what the former
look on as moſt judicious in his Book, which will
alſo very much tend to the better underſtanding
the condition in which I ſhall leave <hi>Spain.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
particulars of all the Revenues his King draws
from his Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi>
(which in groſs amount to no more than Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Millions of Gold, and of which <hi>Philip</hi> the
Fourth when he came to the Crown found but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42656:71"/>
Eight Millions two hundred ſeventy four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crowns without incumbrances, which to
ſupply his Wars againſt <hi>France,</hi> he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
neceſſitated to engage, and afterwards
to alienate, (for reducing <hi>Catalonia,</hi> appeaſing
the troubles of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> defence of
the Dutchy of <hi>Millain,</hi> recovery of <hi>Portolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone</hi>
and <hi>Piombino,</hi> and many Towns in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
beſides aſſiſting ſuch Princes as had ſided
with him in the French revolutions:) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
a very exact and parcimonious oeconomy
for the future to be the only means of repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kings Coffers.</p>
            <p>The wayes he propoſes for this, ſeem ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
remarques of the former ill diſpenſation and
adminiſtration of the Publick Treaſure.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place he ſayes, That what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to the ſubſiſtance of their Armies, fails of
being ſupplied, not only by reaſon of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of the principal Revenues of the
Crown to ſuch as have furniſhed the King in
his neceſſities, but no leſs by the prodigious
cheats of an infinite number of Officers employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards their recovery; which gave the King
juſt cauſe to complain to the <hi>Cortes,</hi> That of Ten
Millions paid yearly by <hi>Caſtille,</hi> ſix ſtuck to the
fingers of Under Treaſurers, Secretaries, Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Tellers, and other Exchequer men, that
ſubſiſt only by Rapines exerciſed on the King and
his People.</p>
            <p>Then he deſires that difference be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Monopoliſts and Farmers of Cuſtoms,
as well old as new, and that ſuch of them as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42656:71"/>
have dealt franckly, without making malicious
advantage of the neceſſity of affairs, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from thoſe that have thriven by
craft and deſign, in purchaſing or renting the
Kings Duties. With the firſt he holds it but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to make a fair compoſition, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that they be permitted the enjoyment of
what they acquired with ſo great equity: the
other he would have treated with all poſſible
ſeverity, and compelled to refund with no leſs
rigor than Sorcerers are burnt and Theeves
hanged. For what concerns rewards, he allows
it juſt to recompence all ſuch as have done the
Crown ſervice, be its neceſſities never ſo great;
but even for this he would not have the King
draw any thing from his own Purſe, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to liberality at a time when he hath not
wherewithal; he therefore adviſes (ſince high
birth is not ever the ſource of eminent actions,
neither do Children alwayes inherit the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Vertue of their Parents) not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the ſame Families, 49<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Commanderies,
which the Eight Orders of Spaniſh Knighthood
poſſeſs, worth above a Million of Gold yearly;
but inſtead of beſtowing them out of favour for
the moſt part to perſons unworthy and uſeleſs,
hereafter to diſtribute them to ſuch as either
have preſerved or extended the Limits of his
Monarchy, or at leaſt by an Honourable Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Arms are in a capacity to do it. And if
he ever ſuffers any of them to be diverted from
the advantage of Soldiers, to whom only they
of right appertain, that it be to ſome able Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42656:72"/>
or Dextrous Ambaſſador, who without
drawing Sword, hath ſaved ſome Town or
Countrey, ſurprized an Enemy, broken in Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
his Levies, cut off Ammunition and Victual
from his Armies, drawn in Neighboring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to unite againſt him, obliged ſome of them
to quit a Neutrality, ſuccored ſome Ally, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
ſome other that wavered; in a word, to
ſuch a perſon whoſe induſtry and prudence hath
been highly advantageous to his King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
He no leſs complains, that inſtead of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what is ſubſtantial in theſe Orders to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Merit, the very Badges of them, which
are only ſuperficial, are for the moſt part refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
He inſtances in Mr <hi>de St Maurice,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> who after very good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
pretended ſeveral years without obtaining
this, though Marquis <hi>Caracene</hi> writ in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and atteſted his Valour and eminent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
This takes away his admiration, that in
all the Troops that ſerve in the Dutchy of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi>
there are but Eight Knights that have this
honour, the peculiar recompence of Soldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
frequently beſtowed on Pen-men, or ſuch as
depend more on the Gown than Sword, though
they wear the later, as a Mark of what they
ought to be, rather than of what they really
are. After this detection of abuſes in manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Kings Treaſure, he paſſes to the wayes of
increaſing and better ſecuring it. Towards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
it, he would have taken into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that <hi>Spain</hi> is inhabited by ſome perſons
that are very rich, others indifferently ſo, the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42656:72"/>
reſt very poor, which is the greateſt number,
and that in raiſing Contributions neither of theſe
three can be favoured, without prejudice not
only of the other two, but of the Soveraign
himſelf: Such a Geometrical proportion is
therefore to be obſerved, as conſiders the means
and faculties of each, and prevents that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
in the State that often afflicts our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
when all the ill humors fall on the part
that is weakeſt. After ſo good a Foundation, he
attacks thoſe that poſſeſs moſt and pay leaſt,
and makes appear that the Spaniſh Clergy, being
very wealthy, pays the King but Four hundred
forty ſeven thouſand Crowns, a trifle compared
to its ability, and concludes that an augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kings Revenue might in ſo preſſing a
neceſſity be charged on it with all juſtice and
reaſon imaginable. He thinks it not fit to impoſe
more on the Nobility and Gentry, who ought to
be in a continual poſture to do the King perſonal
ſervice, but upon Citizens and Farmers, and
concealed Treaſure for the greateſt part in the
hands of Perſons faulty or diſaffected, and that
this might bring up a conſiderable aid, were the
ſources of their abundance well examined. For
ſuch Taxes as are ſettled ill, he ſays that which
is impoſed on the Eighth part of Fleſh, Oil, and
Wine, is the worſt of all others, giving occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to a thouſand cheats, as well by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
as by ſuch as endeavour to bring thoſe
proviſions into <hi>Madrid</hi> and other Towns with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
paying Duties. To which I can adde, that
I have been aſſured, an infinite number live
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42656:73"/>
only by that imployment, in ſo much that not
only ſome poor Gentlemen and Ranting Hectors
that will live on nothing, and without doing
any thing, with whom Courts and great Cities
ever abound, concern themſelves in it; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Churchmen and the greateſt Noblemen, that
are weakly revenued. For this cauſe Guards
have been appointed to attend the Collection
of theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpoſts, on condition that what they
can ſeiſe of Goods that have entered without
paying Duties, ſhall be their own. But this
which was eſtabliſhed, to redouble their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
they have turned into ſmall Politicks,
that cauſing them to conſider the Kings intereſt,
if vigorouſly purſued, as that which would put
an end to their profits, they are not very exact,
perceiving that ſhould they not ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive,
they which buſie themſelves in ſtealing
Cuſtoms, would give over the Trade, finding
no effect but Confiſcation of their Goods, after
which the Kings Duties would be well paid, but
they get nothing. They therefore correſpond
with them, and ſeiſe not their Goods, till ſo
much hath entered, as will make them more
than ſavers. This Confederacy againſt the
King, is maintained at his Charge, and drones
ſuck the blood of the poor people, the effects
of ſo great a diſorder falling on their heads. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other Impoſitions he thinks ill laid, and
which I will not give my ſelf the trouble of reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he mentions Seal'd Paper, and ſays it is a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ery incertain Revenue, becauſe founded on

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aw Suits, to which the folly and obſtinacy of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42656:73"/>
humane nature alone gives being; it is true that
in <hi>England,</hi> madder in this particular than <hi>Spain</hi>
or any other part of the World, more profit
might be derived from this, than in a Countrey
where that infamous imployment is not ſo much
in requeſt; whereas in <hi>England</hi> it is exerciſed
with ſuch avarice, rapine, and ſo prodigious
delays, that this horrible Peſtilence which feeds
it ſelf fat by means of infinite numbers of vile In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects,
Attorneys, Solicitors, Attorneys Lieutenants
and Sub-ſolicitors, it muſt needs paſs for one of
the heavieſt ſcourges of the Nation, and plagues
of its beſt Families.</p>
            <p>To conclude, he implores his King to caſt off
all thoſe ill deſigned Impoſitions, that will be
deſtructive both to him and his Subjects, and to
lay the burthen more equally, which will make
it light, and his people bear it chearfully, when
free from Vexations, that tend more to the
advantage of Pettifoggers, than of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</p>
            <p>If what he propoſes may be endeavored, he
doubts not but his King will vanquiſh all his
Enemies, there being already ſo many Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that teſtifie his Valour, and ſo many Books
that publiſh his Prudence, beſides ſo much Gold
and Silver ſtamped with his Effigies, currant
thorow the World, though <hi>Spain</hi> admits none
that is Foreign; an invincible demonſtration of
its inexhauſtible Treaſure.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe two Books were Subjects of our
Diſcourſe, by reaſon of their ſurprizing Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Genius of that Nation conſidered, which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42656:74"/>
ſeldom diſcovers where the Shoo wrings it, and
whoſe conſtancy is ſo admirable, it alwayes ſets
a good face on an ill game; we received Letters
for ſome of the Principal Miniſters of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
King: had they come to us at our firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
at <hi>Madrid,</hi> they would have introduced us
to a nearer ſpeculation of that Court, but arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in <hi>June,</hi> and we being reſolved, for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great heats, to repaſs the <hi>Pyreneans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they began, we had but little time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in a Countrey, where the Sun is ſomething
too prodigal of his beams. To make uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of all advantages poſſible, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Formalities, which are here eſſential, I
addreſſed my ſelf to Don <hi>Martin</hi> Secretary of
the Earl of <hi>Pigneranda,</hi> deſiring him to give his
Lord the Letter of Recommendation we had for
him. I acquainted him with the qualities of
my Lord <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> and inquired at what hour
we might have acceſs, leaſt we ſhould apply our
ſelves to him when he gave not Audience. Such
precautions are neceſſarily to be obſerved in this
Court, by all Strangers, who without any to
introduce them, deſire to be particularly admitted
to a Principal Miniſter of State: by means of which
they eſcape being expoſed to that dry gravity
which receives Strangers with a leaden auſtere
Fore head, cloſe and reſerved, all ſuch whom they
apprehend they may miſtake in its Civilities, for
want of knowledge of their quality; beſides that,
generally ſpeaking, ſuch as underſtand the World,
ought never themſelves to deliver ſuch Letters,
which ſerve only to make them known to thoſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42656:74"/>
they never ſaw before; for if they be read in their
preſence, they ſuffer ſome time of vexatious incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and if the reading them be deferred till after
their departure; at the firſt Viſit they have but a
cold Reception, the Complements faint and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
directed more to him that ſent the Letter,
then to thoſe that bring it, and for whoſe ſake it
was written. This we avoided, for the Earl ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been informed, as well by the Letter of Dom
<hi>Eſtevan de Gamarra,</hi> as report of his Secretary,
who we were, received us as well as we could
wiſh: And to ſpeak truth of him, none in this
Court underſtands Civility and the World bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
His firſt preſenting himſelf is graceful and
winning, and makes appear, that with the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Countries Cuſtoms and imperious gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of his Nation, he hath mixed a certain fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
air, that takes off from the auſterity, and
makes him ſo agreeable, that if the Addreſs
and Gallantry of the firſt of the <hi>Tarquins</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it to be ſaid, <hi>Graecum ingenium miſcuerat I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talicis
artibus,</hi> he had added the Complacency
of <hi>Greece</hi> to the Arts of <hi>Italy.</hi> We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that thoſe of this great man make evident,
<hi>Hiſpanicum ſupercilium poteſt moribus exteris &amp;
comitate exotica dilui.</hi> That Spaniſh ſeverity
may be moderated by forain Civility. His Wit
and Judgement appeared in his Embaſſy as
Plenipotentiary to <hi>Munſter;</hi> and when News
came to <hi>Madrid</hi> of the promotion of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Chigi</hi> to the Pontifical Chair, and the
great deſire he expreſſed for Peace between
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> this man was ſpoken of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42656:75"/>
to be ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> with the Embaſſy of
Obedience: though indeed he was chiefly
deſigned to that Employment, becauſe it was
hoped that by reaſon of the great friendſhip
he had contracted with the new Pope when
he was <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> he might do his
Maſter good ſervice in all manner of Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Many advantages are alſo reported to
have been offered on behalf of the King to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him to accept this, beſides a conſiderable
ſum of ready money, particularly Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Ducats a Moneth, his Son to be made an
Earl, and himſelf continued Preſident of the
Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and that the Golden Key
he carried only as a Badge of Honour, ſhould
be conferred <hi>à Exercicio,</hi> that is to be made uſe
of, with all Priviledges belonging to it: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of this is yet effected, and they which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the confidence of Don <hi>Lewis de Haro</hi>
in his fidelity and capacity, aſſure he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
him from the Council where he is now
Preſident, till needs muſt. Having thus recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all manner of ſatisfaction in our firſt Viſit,
to ſo accompliſhed a Perſon, who omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might aſſure my Lord <hi>B.</hi> of the eſteem
he had for his quality and merit, at the very firſt
ſight remarkable to him by that vivacity which
is ſo natural to Extraordinary Perſons, they
need not ſpeak twice to thoſe to whom they
would make themſelves known: We thought
our ſelves very forward on our way, to obtain
the like from Don <hi>Lewis de Haro,</hi> when we
ſhould wait on him: For beſides the Letter we
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42656:75"/>
had for him, we doubted not but the Earl would
acquaint him with the Viſit we had made him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and with all that could oblige him to receive us
well. Beſides our Letter for Don <hi>Lewis de Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>
we had another for a Gentleman called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonzo
Vercoca,</hi> Coſin to Dom <hi>Stephen de Gamar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
the Catholick Kings Ambaſſador in <hi>Holland,</hi>
who, we were aſſured was very well with this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite.
We therefore thought beſt firſt of all
to viſit Seignior <hi>Alonzo,</hi> that he might deliver
our Letter, and preſent us when it ſhould be
ſeaſonable. We were not a little troubled in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
after his Loding, but at laſt learned that
he was uſually reſident in the Countrey, and only
a Son of his who was one of Don <hi>Lewis de Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s
Gentleman lived in <hi>Madrid.</hi> Enquiring
for him at the Palace of this Chief Miniſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
was told he had a Chamber in the Town, and
came not thither whileſt his Maſter was with
the King at <hi>Buen Retiro;</hi> the Civility of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of whom I enquired his Lodging, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not ſo far as to ſend ſome body to ſhew it me,
and he being ſeldom at home, I was either to
ſeek him very early in the Morning or late in
the Evening. At laſt I found him juſt out of
Bed, no leſs troubled how to enquire after us,
becauſe he had received a Letter from the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
to his Father, by which he reiterated
his requeſt for doing us all manner of good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in that Court. Some dayes paſſed, in
which he neither viſited us nor returned any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
This made me imagine that eithet he did
not much value the Ambaſſadors Letter, or elſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42656:76"/>
had not ſufficient acceſs to his Maſter to perform
what was recommended to him.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we thought of leaving <hi>Spain,</hi>
I began to conſider how we might obtain
an authentick paſsport, being ſufficiently
informed of the inſolence and impudence on
the paſſes called <hi>Puertos,</hi> as well by the Farmers
of the Cuſtoms as ſuch as are there in guard. On
which account many formalities are neceſſary
to be obſerved in the Paſſes, that they may be
effectual enough to check the importunity and
knavery of thoſe Harpies that lie in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of travailers, eſpecially ſtrangers, to put all
imaginable affronts upon them.</p>
            <p>I made very ſolicitous enquiry of all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpections
neceſſary, and the Earl of <hi>Pigneranda</hi>
having told my Lord <hi>B.</hi> that not to leave <hi>Spain</hi>
without carrying along one of its greateſt rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
he ſhould do well to take ſome horſes;
to which purpoſe he would provide him all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
paſsports; we did not in the leaſt diſtruſt, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
them as advantagious as we could wiſh:
they which have no friends in Court, are obliged
to petition a certain Council, whoſe Secretary is
called <hi>Carnero:</hi> the petition conſidered on, if
the Paſs be granted, the Reſult goes from thence
to the Kings Council, from whence it is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſometimes confirmed, ſometimes annulled,
and often limited or amplified, according to the
petitioners ſucceſs in his ſolicitations. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
though either by favour or bribe,
authentick Paſsports are ſometimes obtained,
and that without delay; ſuch as are unknown
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42656:76"/>
and unfriended, find this trifle become a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
and tedious negotiation. Ours was not
ſo, for having drawn up a very exact memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and according to the ſenſe of thoſe that
underſtand the form of a Paſsport, to go out
of <hi>Spain</hi> without lett or moleſtations: I carried
it to Don <hi>Martin,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Pigneranda</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary:
he read it, and told me ſo many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
were not neceſſary; and that our Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
being to come immediately from the Kings
Council, there needed no more but to tranſlate
into Spaniſh, that we had brought from the
Arch-Duke; the like whereof, which would be
every where reſpected, ſhould be diſpatched
us; I acquieſced in this, and went with him to
<hi>Geronimo de la Torre,</hi> one of the Secretaries of
State, to whom he delivered a Memorial for
the ſaid Paſsport, recommending it to him in
the name of his Maſter; he promiſed to carry
it to the Council of State that very day, uſing
us with great civility, and accompanying us
to the bottom of his ſtairs.</p>
            <p>Our Paſsport being in this forwardneſs, Mr.
<hi>B.</hi> and I, went one morning to viſit Segnior
<hi>Verſoſa,</hi> by it the better to underſtand the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
humour, and whether negligence or want
of credit had cauſed his failing in what the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
deſired of him: he inſtantly excuſed
his not having waited on us, and told us he had
delivered the Letter to Don <hi>Lewis de Haro,</hi> who
had commanded him to accompany us to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
(ſuch is the manner of ſpeaking in this
Court) which he would give us the next day.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42656:77"/>
This diſcovered that his ſlowneſs in returning us
anſwer, was rather an effect of the humor of
his nation, (not very punctual nor forward in
its civilities, no more then in its affairs) then of
his negligence or little power to perform what
had bin recommended to him; being a kin to
the Secretary <hi>Geronimo de la Torre,</hi> who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
our Memorial, he would needs go along
with us to him, and recommend it in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
but I was ſtrangely ſurprized to ſee this
man in this viſit we made in company of his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
ſo different from what I had before found
him; for inſtead of our former civil reception of
which I ſpoke but now, he would ſcarcely move
from his Table and Papers, entertaining us with
interrupted ſentences, whilſt he ranged the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
he held in his hand. I was ſcandalized at
ſuch an inequality, and the favourableſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I could make, was (whilſt I conſidered
him to be of that nation which is eſteemed ſo
unvariable in its humor and actions) that his
thoughts were that day entirely poſſeſſed by
ſomething very important and vexatious. This
prevented not our repairing next morning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our appointment to viſit the chief
Miniſter of ſo ſuperbe a Court. He is not
difficult of acceſs, nor environed with the pomp
and ſplendor uſually affected by ſuch as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
the place next their Maſter: he is not court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor his withdrawing room crouded with any
that have not buſineſs with him; none are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
admittance, but every man in his turn
brought into his chamber, where having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42656:77"/>
he retires and gives place to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To
ſuch as are not admitted, if they have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moved him in their concerns; he ſignifies his
pleaſure by his Secretary, which (if they have
nothing new to offer) muſt of force content
them; ſuch as have never opened their affair,
or have any thing to add, are referred to the
next day or another hour: ſo that few go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
without ſome kind of ſatisfaction or hopes to
receive it, at leaſt, in obtaining Audience. In other
places, Favourites or chief Miniſters ſeldom are
acceſſible, and never till after many refufals; and
not content to participate of the Soveraigns au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
pretend to a degree of adoration above
it: and we may aſſure our ſelves, that though this
quality occaſions in moſt of theſe, pride, vanity,
and pleaſure; it gives Don <hi>Lewis</hi> (as he makes
uſe of it) trouble alone, and that amongſt all
that are in publick employment he is not only
firſt in rank, but in attachment and ſubjection
to the ſervice of his King; to which, to ſpeak
the truth, he intirely reſigns himſelf: for in the
morning immediately after his devotions, and
viſit of the Kings apartment, about Seven a
clock he ſits down in his chamber of diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
where he continues till one; giving order to
his Secretaries in all that is to be done, and
hearing ſuch as are to ſpeak with him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ented
by order as hath already bin ſaid: after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſner
he repoſes, or retires ſome hours; and about
four or five, returns to the ſame chamber, and
like imployment till ſeven. Two days in the
week he, as well as the King, gives publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42656:78"/>
then all enter, and I have ſeen there of
all qualities, even lame and naked ſoldiers, who
amongſt others preſent themſelves and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
without any other difference, then obliging
them to advance with diſcretion and reſpect, if
perhaps they obſerve it not.</p>
            <p>To all this is to be added, his care of the
Court, he being Maſter of the Horſe, with his
hours at both Councils of State and Privy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Audiences of ceremony, and affairs of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
and Agents of forreign Princes; ſo
that I can imagine no life more agitated nor
buſied then his. I ſhall ſay nothing of his parts,
which the Spaniards hold not equal to thoſe of
his predeceſſor; the other having bin quick and
active in the moſt eminent degree; but they
add that they were not therefore more ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
either in publick or particular; and that
the great moderation and good nature of this
man, is equivalent to the heat and zeal of the
former, who to attain his ends, ſuffered none to
enjoy quiet: ſo true is that of the Politians,
that the greateſt intellects are not moſt proper
to govern States and Kingdoms; and that they
look ſo far before them, they often ſtumble in
ſuch a manner as caſts them into extremities,
from whence all their dexterity hath much ado
to free them, and the height of their good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to ſecure them from ruine; whereas the
middle ſort by moving ſoftly are not ſubject to
thoſe politick tranſports, which often toſs intereſt
of State into the air with the ſublimeſt maximes
of him that governs.</p>

As ſoon as we came to <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his lodging,
which was then at the Hermitage of <hi>Buen retiro,</hi>
we were received by Don <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.
He is a little man, of addreſs and ſubtilty
beyond what is uſual in his nation, being a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
of which Countrey he hath ſo little the
meen and preſence, one would rather take him
to have been born at the foot of the <hi>Apennine</hi>
or <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> then on the banks of <hi>Rhine</hi> or
<hi>Danube.</hi> He takes care of all forreign affairs,
and ſerves his maſter as interpreter; we were
immediately preſented to him, and thus he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
us: He ſate in a Chair at the end of a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
with his Cloak on his ſhoulders, and his
ſword by his ſide; he roſe up at our entrance,
and after we had ſaluted him, cauſed ſeats to be
preſented us; and immediately <hi>Don Chriſtopher</hi>
placed himſelf on his knees, on the Carpet that
was between his Chair, and that of my Lord <hi>B.</hi>
who having ſpoken, Don <hi>Lewis</hi> anſwered by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of Don <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> as obligingly as
was poſſible. After the firſt compliments, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after our journey, and continuance at
<hi>Madrid,</hi> and finding us inclined to leave it, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if we would not paſs by <hi>Sevil;</hi> and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
our ſelves, by reaſon the Summer was ſo
far advanced; he replyed, our time indeed
preſſed us, if we deſired to be out of <hi>Spain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the great heats; but not viſiting <hi>Andaluſia,</hi>
we loſt the ſight of the pleaſanteſt Countrey in
the world; he afterwards made us many offers
of ſervice, and when we acquainted him that
we deſired to paſs through <hi>Arragon,</hi> and, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42656:79"/>
enter <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Catalonia;</hi> he promiſed
us two Letters of recommendation; one to the
Duke of <hi>Monteleon,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the
other for Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> He asked us if
we would kiſs the Kings hands; but our time
for leaving the Countrey being ſo near, we
thought it unneceſſary to give him the trouble
of obtaining that honour for us, having ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſeen his Majeſty. In a word, he omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was obliging, or might render our
viſit ſatisfactory; he is indeed of a humour to
diſcontent no body, and never favorite did leſs
hurt: he ſuffers to live at Court, not only ſuch
as envy him, but his profeſſed enemies, as the
Duke <hi>de Medina de los Torres,</hi> and goes abroad
with ſo ſmall pomp, that his Train little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
exceeds the meaneſt Grand of <hi>Spain:</hi>
he is not crouded after, but obſerved to follow
much better then his predeceſſor, the advice of
a favourite of the ſame nation, who after his fall
admoniſhed all of the like condition, themſelves
to put a ſpoke in the wheel of fortune, when by
too great an elevation ſhe almoſt equalized them
to the King, adding, that he which thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
advanced higheſt, is often neareſt his ruine,
and therefore ought never to be tranſported to
receive ſuch honours and attendances, as his
fall cannot deprive him of, without ſhame; on
occaſion of which I muſt needs mention, what
was reported to me to have been ſpoken by a
great Stateſman of this Court: <hi>That a Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
ought to have the moderation and prudence of
that Angel before whom St</hi> John <hi>proſtrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42656:79"/>
with adoration,</hi> and refuſe ſome kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
that may be rendred him with a <hi>Vide ne
feceris, conſervus tuus ſum:</hi> for if God in that
immenſity of glory and power he poſſeſſes to
reduce the univerſe to nothing, admits no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
in his adorations: Kings whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is limited, and whoſe Might only weakly
imitates that which is infinite, will much leſs
endure it. Such boundleſs ambition, and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
thirſt of grandeur, in two years time ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhook Cardinal <hi>Spinola,</hi> one of the greateſt
Favorites of <hi>Philip</hi> the II. and at laſt overthrew
that famous Conde Duke <hi>Olivares,</hi> whoſe place
is at preſent poſſeſſed by Don <hi>Lewis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides what I have touched concerning his
Miniſtry, the curious find a conſiderable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the favors of the Uncle and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
as well in the foundation as manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of them; they conſider that of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
was derived from his conformity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
(real or affected) with thoſe of his King;
and from the care he took to ſecond his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and make himſelf a neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of his ſatisfaction in pleaſures, perhaps
contrary to his greatneſs and condition: but that
of the ſecond had its ſource from the Kings ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
to him, for ſervices rendred him in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
where his Life and Crown were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned:
that the firſt had his good will and
affection, which are but as bloſſoms that a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
accidents blow away, whilſt the other is
eſtabliſhed in the intellect, having been fixed
there by experience, the true and only root of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42656:80"/>
favour, proof againſt time and humor; that the
firſt arrived at ſo eminent a degree almoſt at the
ſame time and the ſame manner as the Duke of
<hi>Luines</hi> roſe near <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII of <hi>France,</hi>
and the later by a way very like that aſcended
by Cardinal <hi>Richlieu:</hi> the Nephew had time to
make uſe of the faults and misfortunes of the
Uncle, as well as the Cardinal of the failings of
his Predeceſſor. But for what concerns the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of his authority, they obſerve it is very
different from the other three. The Duke <hi>de
Luines,</hi> and the Conde Duke <hi>Olivares</hi> diſturbed
the quiet of their Maſters Dominions; the firſt,
that he might make uſe of the ſword of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
he had newly received, and the other to
make oſtentation of the vaſt capacity he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to above all mankind. <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who
ſucceeded the firſt of theſe, though with very
different maximes, thought nevertheleſs he was
to continue the war he found begun, to gain
him reputation, and remove all obſtacles that
might prevent ſuch a one as was more the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of <hi>France,</hi> and would give him oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of entring the Liſts with that ambitious
Conde Duke. Don <hi>Lewis</hi> was no ſooner infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and entred on buſineſs, but he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make underſtood, that the whole world
and eſpecially the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſuffered by

               </hi> though
not often ſo to the ambition of their Kings,
and vanity of the Miniſters that ſerve them;
and that which ſoever of them gains upon the

<hi>Europe</hi> by artifice of their Favorites (who ſet
their Maſters together by the ears to make oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

as Pilots their skill in the height of a tempeſt)
divided into Leagues, and almoſt all of it in

that whilſt war continued, the allies of <hi>France</hi>
would never forſake her to become Neuters,
or turn their ſwords againſt her, but that in the
mean time the dangers into which they preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated
themſelves, were to be repreſented to
them, with a great inclination to peace, even
ſo far, as to purchaſe it at what price ſoever.
That experience in all ages had made evident,
they recovered by Treaties what they had loſt
that by wars. That in <hi>Germany</hi> even they were to
be incited to cry up peace that were confederates
with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> to oblige them to which,
they ſhould have intimation, that nothing was
taken into greater conſideration, then their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
and that it was high time to divert
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42656:81"/>
the jealouſie of their liberty againſt two forraign
Potenthtes, more ready to invade it, then ever
the Emperor was to impoſe fetters upon it. That
in <hi>Italy, Flanders,</hi> and all other parts where
there were Leagues againſt <hi>France,</hi> the like was
to be done; and at the general Treaty of peace,
all deſirable conditions given to their weakeſt
enemies, to enfeeble the more potent by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them of the others aſſiſtance. Thus the
beginning of his Miniſtry, (if what hath been
informed me, and I have here repreſented be
true) was not to cry up war in his Maſters ears,
out of conſideration only, of what might augment
his own power, as is done by ſuch Epicures of
favor as turn it to their particular advantage:
He would neither ſeem idolatrous in his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
by giving no council but ſuch as was to
his Maſters advantage; nor Atheiſtical in valuing
nothing but the good of the people, but with
reſpect to both of them, ſhewed himſelf a good
Stateſman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dealing with them like Husband and
Wife, and concluding that for their living hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
together, they ſhould admit no friend that
might ſeparate their intereſts. I had bin made

at <hi>Munſter</hi> with the Hollanders, is thought
a maſterpiece, they having received as an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
maxime, never to have it with his King;
and the miracle became greater, not only in
that he diſarmed them by a particular Treaty,
under no other garranty, but that Seal and Oath
they had ſo many years proteſted never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in; but made uſe of the family of <hi>Orange,</hi>

            <p>After ſo politick an atchievement, he might
have effected another little leſs conſiderable, if
we may credit ſuch as determine the affairs of
Princes, according to their particular capacities,
had he (during the troubles of <hi>France)</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
a peace with that Crown, which in ſuch
an extremity muſt needs have accepted it, on
conditions, more advantagious to <hi>Spain,</hi> then
the Towns retaken by it, becauſe giving way to
her inteſtine commotions, by removing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
object that might divert her diſſentions
and civil enmities, her fury would have rebound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on her own boſom, and ſhe like a good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have abandoned the greateſt part of her
conqueſts, to gain more leiſure and better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to chaſtiſe her diſobedient children:
here it is that conſidering affairs by their event,
and ſeeing <hi>France</hi> again in as good a way as
ever to purſue her victories, the Spaniſh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
are blamed for neglecting that opportunity
of putting ſuch a ſtop to them, as ſhould have
prevented their progreſſion. Inſtead therefore
of Treaties with the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſiders with
the Princes, and the Princes themſelves, it is
ſaid, <hi>Spain</hi> ought to have negotiated with the
Court alone, from which, as is believed, it might
have had good terms for abandoning the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and their endeavors to encourage the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42656:82"/>
in which interim, the Catholick King
might probably have ſucceeded beyond the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneans,
in reducing the Catalonians, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
<hi>Portugal,</hi> much more conſiderable to
him, becauſe very certain, that the revolt of the
former, and ſeparation of the later, are the
greateſt miſchiefs, that have attacqued that
Monarchy during the whole war; for remedy
of which, it ſhould have neglected ſome ſlight
bruiſes in other places, and applyed it ſelf only
to the cure of thoſe two wounds ſo near its heart.
The ways of doing this, had bin more eaſie, more
ſafe, and of leſs expence then thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<hi>Barcelone;</hi> they which examined the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of that time, were of opinion that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
loſt more by retaking that Town, and
neglecting to relieve <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> then they
would have done by ſome condiſcentions to
<hi>France</hi> in order to peace. For it was freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
in that Court, that the ſiege of <hi>Barcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi>
coſt ſo dear both in men and money, that
ſo great a failing of ſpirits followed, that all the
repoſe obtained by the French diſorders, was
not ſufficient to their reſtoration, and that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
to relieve <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> gave the French
opportunity of freeing themſelves from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
of appeaſing their civil war, and almoſt
at the ſame time of re-beginning an offenſive
one againſt the forraigners with vigor equal
to their former. In the judgement therefore of
theſe criticks, the Spaniards could neither make
all the progreſſions, might have been expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from them in ſuch a conjuncture, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42656:83"/>
their recovering three or four of the
principal places they had loſt, nor embrace the
opportunity of the peace, to which <hi>France</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
neceſſitated, nor yet ſupply the flames of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
diſcord already ſo well kindled, but after ſo
great charge and ſmall profit, they looked on
them as negligent Merchants that had let ſlip
the beſt time of the Fair, and perhaps brought
but one commodity from it, that will never ſell
for what was laid down in ready Money, and is
hereafter to be paid for it: I mean the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi> and reſt of the French that are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
only a charge to them, and whom deceaſed
<hi>Quevedo,</hi> were he now alive, would joyn to the
late Queen Mother of <hi>France</hi> and Duke of—
for that new kind of ſtratagem by which the
King of <hi>France</hi> may batter by diſguſting all his
family, who repairing in diſcontent to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
will oblige him in aſſiſting them to conſume
that which is deſigned to maintain his Armies.
Now the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> is retired to them, and
hath no more places nor Troops in <hi>France,</hi>
they ſeem to underſtand this, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the miracles he did at the rout before <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>
and on occaſion of which it is reported,
the King writ to him in theſe terms. <hi>Mi primo,
he intendido todo estava pardido,</hi> V. A. <hi>ha
conſervado todo;</hi> Coſin, I looked on all as loſt,
your Highneſs hath preſerved all; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the large penſions they allow him,
though they pay them ill. In a word, ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that whilſt they conſume their Treaſure
in entertaining him, and ſuch as have followed
him, the profit of thoſe great penſions accrues
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42656:83"/>
to <hi>France,</hi> as well as the confiſcation of his vaſt
eſtate, by means of which ſhe may well ſupport
the loſs of ſome Regiments to the weakening
her own and ſtrengthening her enemies Army.
Their eſteem for his perſon is indeed equal to his
merit, and his name is in ſuch veneration both
amongſt Nobility and People, that he is looked
on as the greateſt Captain that Europe hath
ſeen in many ages, and to be above all encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums
due to the higheſt courages; his actions
ſurpaſſing all that can be imagined; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which they conſider him to be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and Prince of the blood of a Crown that is
enemy, which makes the eſtabliſhment of an
entire confidence between him and <hi>Spain,</hi> very
difficult, but to prevent all appearance of ſuch
diſtruſts, which they have much ado to diſguiſe,
they have made uſe of an artifice, that hath been
well enough diſcovered by his Agents; which is,
that ſuch of them as cannot be concealed, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the miſunderſtanding between him and
<hi>Fuenſaldaigne,</hi> Maſter of the intrigue of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
whilſt to content him, they find expedients
that rather amuſe then ſatisfy him; to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
which the Prince hath declared againſt
<hi>Fuenſaldaigne,</hi> and cauſed his calling home to
be ſollicited in Court, with proteſtation, that as
long as he continues in the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> with
the preſent power, he will not only ruine
his affairs, but the Kings his Maſters.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Mazecolles</hi> his Agent told me,
he had made them ſufficiently ſenſible of all the
miſchiefs occaſioned by this mans conduct, but
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42656:84"/>
the kindneſs <hi>Don Lewis</hi> hath for him, prevails
againſt any remedy. That the Arch-duke had
given the ſame advice, all which could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their obſtinacy in continuing him, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
perhaps on this Maxim, which requires (as
well in Kingdoms as Families) to nouriſh diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongſt thoſe which ſerve, leſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to betray us, or are not exact enough in
obſerving the comportments of one another,
nothing being ſo induſtrious or penetrating, as
envy and animoſity, which prie not only into
what the Maſter would not be ignorant of, but
into ſuch things of which he cares not for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
information.</p>
            <p>In the mean time let politick Cenſors, who
often judge of counſels and reſolutions, rather
by the events, and what is diſcernable, than
the inductive reaſons of which they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
pleaſe themſelves in diſcourſing according
to their fancies of this great intrigue of State, the
effect of the <hi>French</hi> troubles: they ſhall not yet
hinder my obſerving, that in conſideration of
ſeveral ſucceſſes cauſed by them, as well in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>

<hi>Spaniards</hi> are generally pretty well ſatisfied, with
little other diſpleaſure than that by not ſuccour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> they ſuffered the <hi>French</hi> civil
flames to be too ſoon extinguiſhed; ſo that they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42656:84"/>
cannot without indignation mention the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Marquis of <hi>St. Cruz,</hi> when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
with the Fleet under his command,
that had been fitted up at <hi>St. Sebaſtians,</hi> to open
the paſſage of the River to the beſieged. He was
encharged with this employment, becauſe not
having comported himſelf ſatisfactorily in one
like it, it was believed he would ſtrive to make
amends by ſome very eminent action in ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a neceſſity: but he failed even at his firſt
ſetting out; for having received his orders at
<hi>Madrid,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Fieſque</hi> arrived to
haſten him, he went away in a Litter, with all
the conveniencies of one that had time enough
before him, and as if he had not had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
that required the moſt extraordinary
diligence. His delays were the ſame in embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and having ſhewn himſelf at ſea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
ſcarcely taken view of the Enemy, he retreated
to <hi>la Corugna</hi> in <hi>Gallicia,</hi> where amongſt the
delightful Limon and Orange-trees, that grow
there abundantly, he let the bad weather paſs
over, and with it the opportunity of ſecuring
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> whoſe loſs was the intire ruine of
the diſaffected party in <hi>Gaſconie,</hi> and of the
Treaty of the Prince of <hi>Conti.</hi> His manner of
proceeding aſtoniſhed all that were concerned,
though ſome ſuſpected his orders required no
more but to make a ſhew of relieving the place;
whether it were that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would hazard
nothing in a War that could not laſt long in that
part, or whether there were an underſtanding
(according to the ravings of ſuch as on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42656:85"/>
vent their imaginations) by the return of
<hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to its Kings obedience, to obtain the
like for <hi>Barcelona.</hi> Whatever may be of this,
he was ſecured and confined to a Caſtle where
he ſtill remains, as is thought, more on accompt
of reaſon of State then of his guilt.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the French troubles preſented
great ſpeculations to the chief Miniſter and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Wits here, how far they ought to concern
themſelves in them: but thoſe of <hi>Naples</hi> which
happened a little before, and which the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> beheld as a fire kindled in a corner of his
Dominion, he moſt valued, and diſtruſted were
no leſs ſubjects of the diſcourſe of ſuch as had
curioſity for the affairs of either Crown. All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that <hi>France</hi> drew not ſo great advantages
from them as ſhe might have done, had ſhe
more ſtreightly embraced the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
and ſuch as have diſcourſed with me about
it, have made it evident, that <hi>Spain</hi> in no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ever judged more ſolidly, or acted more
effectually. At the firſt advice of that revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhe was not deceived in taking her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> giving his ſenſe
of it, made the miſchief and its remedy ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
that he was employed to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the later. I ſaw an Extract of his Letter,
which repreſented that the fury of that people
could not laſt, having at firſt declared open war
againſt the Nobility and all that were powerful.
That ſuch commotions (the better part of the
State being contrary to them) bring forth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confuſion and diſorder, without any poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42656:85"/>
of erecting a true form of Government,
which muſt be done (if at all) in a moment, and
that a multitude that had neither feet nor wings
proportionable to mounting ſo high muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
fall of it ſelf, being imprudent in its
Councils, raſh in its Deſignes, and ſlow and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in its Executions. That the people of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
went very aukwardly about forming them-themſelves
into a Republick, beginning by deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the richeſt Families, which could not
be ſo totally ruined, but they would retain pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to joyn with the offended Prince in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
revenge; and that that which would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on this enraged Multitude would be the
more advantageous, in that it would give oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of drawing the reins of Government
ſtreighter, and binding them ſo faſt, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their former ſeveral bloodlettings,
a vein ſhould then be opened, by which ſhould
be drawn the greateſt part even of that which was
beſt, provided all that was corrupted came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with it. His council was followed, and his
hand employed in the Execution, whileſt he
doubtleſly played the part of an able Surgeon,
the whole body of the Rebels ſuffering his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,
and the Ringleaders his Saw and Raſor. All
the world is witneſs of his admirable conduct in
ſo dangerous a Malady. I ſhall only add that
he is looked on here as the ableſt and zealouſeſt
Polititian of <hi>Spain;</hi> and it is not doubted but if
he had employment ſuitable to his wiſhes, he
would add ſomething of vigor that in ſeveral
mens opinions is wanting. But his parts being
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42656:86"/>
apprehended he is kept at the greateſt diſtance
poſſible from the intrigue; and ſetting aſide what
he muſt neceſſarily be made acquainted with by
reaſon of his employments, little is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him. He therefore paſſes his time in
building, and employing part of the great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
he amaſſed in <hi>Naples,</hi> on a Pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Among the great affairs and eminent negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of <hi>Dom Lewis,</hi> was one from the North,
whoſe intereſt was at firſt well enough under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood:
for none admired that <hi>Spain</hi> kept an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
at <hi>Stockholm</hi> for facilitating the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Son of the Emperor to be King of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
The <hi>Swedes</hi> were judged to have great
credit in the Empire, and known to have too
long oppoſed the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to look well
on its elevations; a man of parts might ſound
their intentions, diſcover their deſignes, and by
dexterity allay their greateſt animoſity againſt
the Emperor, if not obtain ſomething really fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
in his behalf. <hi>Piementelli,</hi> choſen for
this imployment, had ſucceſs beyond what was
expected, quickly poſſeſſing himſelf of the good
opinion of that Queen, ever charmed by novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for amongſt the great affluence of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
ſhe drew to her Court, the laſt comer ſtill
carried it from all the reſt. She was ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> having never yet received any
reſpects from that Nation, that it was not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for him to make himſelf acceptable without
taking pains to corrupt any of her Council.
Such as underſtood how matters paſſed in <hi>Swede</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:42656:86"/>
were not ſupriſed at her letters during the Diet
of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> as well to the Emperor, as to the
Electors and other Princes about election of a
King of <hi>Romans.</hi> They eaſily perceived that the
Counſellors of the Kingdom and ableſt heads
had not contributed to ſo open and authentick a
Declaration in favour of the King of <hi>Hungary.</hi>
During her Fathers reign, and in her minority,
they had been otherwiſe inſpired; and if their
opinions might have prevailed, doubtleſly the
Party of the Princes and Towns had rather been
ſupported, who demanded a making good of
all that had been agreed on by the Peace of
<hi>Munſter</hi> before they would proceed to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
This makes eaſily comprehended that
an Ambaſſador from this Court was neceſſary
during all that time, but that he ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
after the reſignation of this Princeſs, and
that when ſhe had left the Kingdom <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſhould every where follow her under that chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
is a myſtery, of which no reaſon can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
that ſeems not too flat and feeble to be
real. For why ſhould the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be at ſuch
coſt to keep in with this Princeſs after ſhe had
diſpoſſeſſed her ſelf of her Dominion, or court
her then, their enemies having received all her
favours whilſt ſhe ſate on the throne? The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
I ſay, that never do any thing, where that
intereſt, that as much governs Kings as Kings do
Subjects, is not exactly obſerved: that repine
at the entertaining the many diſcontented Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that have ſided with them, and that ſeldom
abandon what is ſolid and neceſſary, for what is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42656:87"/>
plauſible and ſuperfluous. Notwithſtanding all
which they not only cauſed her to be attended
by an Ambaſſador, when ſhe had no right to one,
and who (her Prerogative being gone with her
Soveraignty) muſt needs appear rather a
Gentleman Uſher than Publick Miniſter, but
omitted not to complement and preſent her
from <hi>Madrid</hi> it ſelf, with 12 of the beautifulleſt
Horſes of the Kings Stable. What is rumored
here that ſhe hath ſtill the diſpoſal of Forces,
and that <hi>Koningſmarc</hi> by her Order marches to
aſſiſt the Arch-Duke with an Army of Twelve
thouſand men, is a meer raillery.</p>
            <p>Her reſignation was doubtleſs a ſecret of
State, ſpun and wove with more art than is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
and nothing leſs than what it ſeemed;
ſhe retained neither credit nor authority to make
her Miſtreſs of any thing more than her Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and though becauſe the Pill was very well
gilt, the World believed ſhe ſwallowed it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
and taſted nothing bitter, a Perſon of
as great judgment as curioſity, told me, That as
the <hi>Palatine</hi> appeared a great Captain when <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo</hi>
in <hi>Germany,</hi> he no leſs approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
an able Polititian, in a quiet poſſeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of the Crown of the Great <hi>Guſtavus</hi> his
Uncle, even in the life-time of his Daughter
and only Heir: The manner of doing this ſeems
very ſubtle, for after he was declared her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
(partly on occaſion of the over-heroick
inclinations of that Princeſs, who ſeemed amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
only of her own wit, and more ambitious
to be thought a Woman learned and liberal,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42656:87"/>
than a Queen prudent and capable of governing
partly by reaſon of the inclination of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
and States of the Kingdom, who grew
weary of obeying a Maid, more ſollicitous to be
the Miracle of her Sex than of her Dignity)
and a reſolution taken that if ſhe ſhould marry,
it muſt be with none but him, all his endeavors
tended to make known he was fitter to eſpouſe
the Kingdom than Queen: in effect he quickly
appeared equal to the former, and (were it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
or artificially) ſo well acted the part of a
King, that it was very apparent that whileſt he
fell back from probability of being ſuch by
means of the later, he advanced in hopes of it,
by the general inclination of the People, and
Intereſt of State. His Conformity of Humors
and Manners with thoſe of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
opened him ſo fair a way to the Throne,
that the Queen (whoſe Cuſtoms were directly
contrary) became jealous, with ſuch an averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for his Perſon, as ſhe could not ſufficiently
conceal. This obliged him to retire to an Iſland,
part of his Inheritance, leaving all to time and
the Queen her ſelf, who confirmed the People
in their diſlike of her. She continued to value
leſs than ſhe ought the moſt conſiderable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and moſt important Affairs. Her vaſt fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and ardent thirſt after curious Sciences, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that extraordinary manner of conduct that
poſſeſſed her, made her flie from thought to
thought, and from employment to employment,
without ever fixing on the Duties of her Charge,
and Care of her Crown and Subjects. One while
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42656:88"/>
ſhe was entirely taken up by Letters with <hi>Des
Cartes, Salmaſius,</hi> and <hi>Bouchard,</hi> whom ſhe
had ſent for, with the firſt to engage her ſelf
in the Labirinth of his Modern Philoſophy,
with the other to trace the Antiquities of <hi>Rome</hi>
and <hi>Greece,</hi> and with the laſt to penetrate the
Myſteries of the Catholick and Proteſtant Faith.
Sometimes ſhe abandoned both Books and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
calling all the firſt Bawbles, and the laſt
Pedants. At the time of this gay humor, crowds
of young people that ſwarmed about her, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſed
their time very agreeably. Masks, Balls, Plays,
Collations, Huntings, Tours, with all the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pleaſures that are the principal ragouts of the
idleneſs of Courts, were then alone in requeſt.
Wit and Fancy, with all that boundleſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
jollity can produce, then diſplayed
themſelves with the higheſt advantages, and
his parts were moſt applauded, that ſeemed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableſt
of theſe fond Diverſions which lead from
pleaſure to pleaſure and paſtime to paſtime,
without knowing what they ſeek, or on what
to ſettle. In theſe ſeveral manners of living ſhe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ſcattered the Crowns Revenue amongſt
Strangers, by whoſe Counſel ſhe governed her
ſelf in many things, and by her own head in all
the reſt. This gave occaſion to one <hi>Miſſenius,</hi> a
Phyſitian or Hiſtorian, if I miſtake not, that had
been advanced by her, to publiſh a Book little to
her advantage. He highly extolled the Prince Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin,
then declared Heir of the Crown, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſsing
himſelf to him and the Kingdoms Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
for remedy of the diſorders he obſerved.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42656:88"/>
His Stile diſcovered him, and the Queen made
appear very great moderation on occaſion of his
ingratitude, and the Prince no leſs addreſs and
judgment, in ſatisfying her that he too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
the Crime of that unworthy fellow, to
have contributed any thing towards it. All
this while a ſecret averſion for the Queen inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
it ſelf amongſt the greateſt part of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and People. Some ſaid they muſt have a
Soldier to command them, others lamented the
poverty of their Country, and that Rixdollers
were ſo ſcarce amongſt them. That Peace ſuited ill
with a Countrey that produced nothing but iron,
which they ought to truck for the Ducats of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
or Patagons of <hi>Germany.</hi> That an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of rupture with one of theſe could not be
wanting, that the truce with <hi>Poland</hi> was almoſt
at an end, and that they ſtood in need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a King, either a <hi>Charles</hi> or another
<hi>Guſtavus.</hi> That all that was defective in his
Daughter abounded in his Nephew; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all which their reſpect to the next blood
of that great King, ſuffered them not to open
their mouths wide, nor to ſpeak publickly; but
whether it were that the Senators had more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
expreſſed themſelves to the Queen in
private, or that of her ſelf ſhe well underſtood,
by the Conjuncture of Affairs and Inclination
of the People, that ſhe had not long to raign,
or elſe by ſome tranſport of Heroick fancy, or
were it that all theſe things together contributed
to her renunciation, it at laſt became publick to
the admiration of all the world. This change was
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42656:89"/>
the diſcourſe of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and as there had
not happened any thing in many Ages ſo ſupri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
every man endeavored to find the cauſes
of it in a thouſand Chymerical reaſons. This
great Queen was ſo unfortunate, ſhe eſcaped not
the teeth of Satyriſts on occaſion of it. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
by a bad opinion of her underſtanding, and
jealouſie of ill guided Morals; her affections and
judgment ſeemed very unſtable, and her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
reported ſhe quitted not a Crown and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on a Principle of Vertue to live to her ſelf,
and in a ſolitude where ſhe might the better cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
her Mind and exalt her Faith, but out of
of an inclination to wander, and expoſe to Fame
that Prodigy of the North ſhe had ſo highly
vaunted. This ſo feeble Motive of ſo great an
Action made ſome conjecture it was not her
choice, but that her Deſcent from the Throne
might be glorious, ſhe was permitted or adviſed
to cover with the Mantle of Generoſity and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere
Vertue, the neceſſity to which they redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
her of reſigning the Crown to her Coſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her death. That great Soul and vigorous
Intellect ſhe ever pretended to, on this occaſion
doubtleſly furniſhed her with ſuch Maximes, it
repreſented her reſigning the Soveraiguty as
much better than its forſaking her, and that by
anticipation of her defeat ſhe ſhould triumph in
it: That a timely retreat is oftentimes better
than an obſtinat combat. That a good Horſeman
alights, when he perceives his Horſe will not
carry him to his journeys end. That ſhe ſhould
do well to imitate that Illuſtrious Roman that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42656:89"/>
vaunted to have been employed before himſelf
deſired it, and to have quitted before it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
by others; by the firſt deſigning the effect
of his good fortune, and by the ſecond giving
teſtimony of his good Conduct. The Event
ſhews ſhe yielded to theſe reaſons, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to diſguiſe all appearance of conſtraint, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing that might conceal her diſpleaſure.
<hi>Piementelli</hi> her Favorite wrote in ſuch terms to
this Court, clearly diſcovering the bottom of
this affair and humor of this Princeſs, with
which he had order to comply, and offer her all
manner of honour and good reception in the
Dominion of the King his Maſter. He effected
this without difficulty, becauſe ſo well with her
that all was acceptable from him. Having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
reſigned her ſelf to his Counſel and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
ſhe had no ſooner caſt off the Royal Robe,
than ſhe left <hi>Swede</hi> in the Equipage and Habit
of a Modern Amazon. She did not only in her
actions retain nothing of the Cuſtoms of her
Sex, whoſe weakneſs was ſo contemptible to her,
but avoided all converſation with it, her Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
and Servants were all Men, ſcorning to uſe
Women either at her riſing or going to bed.
Her own habit was mixed of what is uſed by both.
A looſe Coat reaching to the middle of her Leg,
and under it a kind of Veſt almoſt to her Heel,
a Handkerchief like a Cravat about her Neck, a
Black Periwig, though her own Hair was flaxen;
with a Hat and Feather, were her ordinary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements,
or rather her Diſguiſe, whileſt
ſhe travailed: Nay at <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Bruſſelles,</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:42656:90"/>
where ſhe continued ſome time, ſhe changed
nothing; and they which have written of her,
repreſent her in a Dreſs very little different. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
or averſion made her alwayes (as much as
poſſible) avoid the Viſits of Women, and as
<hi>Thaleſtris</hi> for <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſo ſhe at firſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a great impatience and extraordinary paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſee the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> She publickly
ſaid, <hi>She was ſorry there was no Houſe in</hi> Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<hi>large enough to lodge them both; that he
was her Hero, and the only Man ſhe admired.</hi>
He was at that time at the Siege of <hi>Arras,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe writ to him ſhe would come, and after
his Example make no difficulty of wearing the
Spaniſh Colours. This Prince having augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his glory, though by an unfortunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of that Enterpriſe, her deſire of ſeeing
him was redoubled; to teſtifie how much ſhe
was concerned in the honour he had acquired by
a retreat that had equalized the defeat of the
Spaniards, to the victory of their enemies. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo handſom advances and obliging addreſſes
for an Interview ſhe paſſionately deſired, one
would hardly believe ſhe could become cold, and
change ſo many evident teſtimonies of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to as viſible ones of indifference. One of
that Princes Agents told me, that out of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
very extraordinary and ſurprizing, ſhe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
Punctilio's on the form of his Reception,
when he was even ready to make his Viſit. The
Arch-Duke after the rout before <hi>Arras,</hi> went
to ſee her at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and ſhe received him with
exceſsive reſpects and honours; for not ſatisfied
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42656:90"/>
to attend him at her Stair-foot, ſhe paſſed over
a great Court, and met him at her outer Gate.
The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> whoſe courage may juſtly
equaliſe him to what is greateſt, and whoſe birth
yields to few that wear not Crowns, deſired to
know how ſhe would comport her ſelf towards
him; thoſe he employed in this could never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any ſatisfactory anſwer, and therefore
doubting ſhe might make ſome difference
between him and the Archduke, he reſolved not
to ſee her: but becauſe he was already on his
way, and importuned not to come to an open
rupture, he reſolved of an expedient to ſee her
<hi>incognito.</hi> He therefore ſent his Train to attend
her as if himſelf were gone back, and that he
might ſee her unknown to her, reſolved to enter
her chamber when full of his people, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
no otherwiſe than as one of thoſe that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on her on his account. At firſt ſhe knew him
not, but at laſt diſcovering him, when he went
away ſhe would have accompanied him; but he
told her <hi>he muſt have all or nothing,</hi> and without
ſtaying for an anſwer went as he came. It is moſt
certain that he whom ſhe looked on as the Hero
of this age, at that interview loſt the opinion that
ſhe was the Heroine. Her reſolution yet, that
hath on ſo many occaſions been remarquable,
was not the principal cauſe of her inequality to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him: It was a trick put upon her by the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> contrived by <hi>Piementelli</hi> at inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Earl of <hi>Fuenſaldaigne,</hi> that was very
ill with him: For though the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had
expreſly ordered that he ſhould be treated e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42656:91"/>
with the Archduke, and the ſame honors
paid him, this was not the firſt time that more
had been promiſed at <hi>Madrid</hi> than performed at
<hi>Bruxels,</hi> ſhe who is entirely devoted to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
and governs her ſelf by their Councels on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
did nothing on this occaſion that was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on with them: and moſt certain that the
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> made appear ſuch a contempt of
their vanity, and indifference for her, that they
were aſhamed as well of their own as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding:
this obliged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
their reconciliation, and to find a neutral
place where they might accidentally meet: which
happened in the <hi>Pall mall,</hi> where a game was
agreed on, in which both of them were on the
ſame ſide; but this had no effect, and they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the ſame indifference as at firſt.</p>
            <p>What I have obſerved of the humour and
comportment of this Princeſs, is but the ſum of
what I have heard from thoſe that diſcourſe of
the deſigne of this Court in its many careſſes to
her: of which publick curioſity hath gained ſo
little light, we may conclude that nothing is ſo
certain as the uncertainty of it. Some will have
that no Northern puiſſance having been ſo fatal
to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> as that of the Kingdom
ſhe abandoned, the chief Miniſter aimed at ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
her affection, and making uſe of her ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity
againſt her Country for diſcovering its
greateſt ſecrets. To this fancy they add, that
it being improbable that the King that ſucceeds
her ſhould continue long in peace with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
her Councils and Creatures that continue
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42656:91"/>
in <hi>Swede,</hi> may be uſeful as moſt proper
againſt all correſpondence he may have in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
for thwarting the Election of the King
of the Romans, and forming a party capable
of recalling him, with another manner of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then what he had before <hi>Prague,</hi> when he
retired with ſo great regret, and diſcovered that
if he had not ſo ſtrong a hand, nor ſo long an
Arm as the great <hi>Guſtavus</hi> his Uncle; he had
no leſs thirſt after victory. Others as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
imagine that a principle of generoſity and
bounty obliges the King to maintain an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
with this Queen, to comfort her in her
Eclipſe of Dignity, by continuing ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of Power and Honour; and
that to mitigate her reſentments, he will in time
make her Vice-Queen of <hi>Naples,</hi> or ſome other
Realm, where though ſhe command not over
ſo largely extended a Dominion, nor with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſo ablolute, as when ſhe ſate on the Throne,
ſhe will have the ſatisfaction to enjoy a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanter
Climate. There are that when they muſt
needs acknowledge they cannot comprehend to
what purpoſe the chief Miniſter is ſo ſolicitous
in cultivating this Queens good graces, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to Zeal for Religion; and that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
to himſelf no other end nor other glory,
then to cauſe an abjuration of her Faith, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the renunciation of her Crown, and to ſend
her to <hi>Rome</hi> as his triumph for ſo great a work.
Whatever it be that moves the Spaniards to a
Negotiation, that to moſt wits ſeems very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;
this is moſt certain that if they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42656:92"/>
for this Princeſs, ſhe hath no leſs for
them. For beſides what I have already ſaid, I
have had advice that at her arrival at <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
ſhe extolled the beauty of that City with ſuch
exceſs, ſhe made no difficulty of preferring it
before the kingdom ſhe had quitted; nor of
ſaying, <hi>She had rather be Marchioneſs of</hi> Antwerp
then Queen of <hi>Sweden.</hi> It is moſt certain, that
in <hi>Stockholm</hi> it ſelf, in her familiar diſcourſe ſhe
made it manifeſt, ſhe had no great value either
for her Countrey or Subjects, whither this were
a deſigne and foreſight, that as ſhe ſhould not
long command the latter, ſo ſhe would ſoon
quit the former, or an effectual averſion for
her people, cauſed by frequentation of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and contempt of her Countrey by reaſon
of the relations they made her of the benignity
of the Air they breathed in the parts where
they were born. Beſides all this, it is well
known, that after ſhe had teſtified a deſire to
become Mediatreſs of a peace between <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Spain,</hi> about which ſhe had diſcourſe with
Mr <hi>Chanut,</hi> when he was to ſee her, (aſſuring
him that the Spaniards wiſhed it, and would
put their concernments into her hands, if <hi>France</hi>
would do the like) ſhe was angry when ſhe
knew her interpoſal was not accepted, and writ
to him in terms very different from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and more advantagious to <hi>Spain:</hi> amongſt
her reſpects for all that comes to her in the name
of that King, might be reckoned her manner
of living with <hi>Antonio Piementelli,</hi> were it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
ſhe had the ſame value for his Character
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42656:92"/>
as for his perſon: ſhe hath an extraordinary
propenſity to all he propounds, even to a forcing
her own inclinations to a compliance with his.
She is known to be Learned, and to love Books
and Schollars, yet buſies her ſelf in trifles to ſuit
his <hi>Genius,</hi> in ſuch a manner, that if any Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men viſit her whilſt he is preſent, ſhe avoids
ſuch diſcourſes as may diſcover his weakneſs,
be tedious to him, ſtrike him dumb and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
that gay humour is reported to be ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to him.</p>
            <p>Having reported all that the Spaniſh Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms
informed me in thoſe matters of State,
(whether Catholic or Paradoxical) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of freſheſt date are their moſt uſual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
and having mentioned their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of thoſe that manage them, or that are
or have bin their principal or acceſſary objects;
it is time to ſay ſomething of ſuch Miniſters of
forreign Princes as I had the honour to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with in this Court, the firſt of theſe
was the Earl of <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> Agent for the Prince
of <hi>Conde;</hi> he was very kind to us, and being
as well one of the greateſt wits as Gallants of
the French Court; it is pity he hath engaged
himſelf in a party and employment that hath ſo
much altered his conſtitution, and changed his
humor, ſo that he is hardly to to be known by
thoſe that have been moſt particularly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him: he is fallen into a ſickneſs that
by intervals makes him pale, diſorders his pulſe
and diſables him for company or diſcourſe. He
keeps a good Table, the Countrey he is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered:
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42656:93"/>
when we eat with him, it afflicted us
to ſee him in the middle of a meal riſe from his
ſeat and caſt himſelf on a bed. At acceſs of the
fit, he ſodainly changes colour, and one would
think him fainting: this is ſuppoſed to be the
effect alone of melancholly and diſpleaſure cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the troubles in which he is engaged, which
have ſeparated him from his relations, eſtate,
and tranquility of the life he had wont to lead.
He took the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s party out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and generoſity only, for it is ſaid, he
had not the leaſt cauſe of diſcontent either from
the Court or chief Miniſter, and his intereſt
would rather have led him to have followed
the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and Madamoiſelle then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other, his wife relating to that Princeſs; but
he thought he was to go on, and not boggle
when he had once choſen a maſter. After ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him well at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and ſeveral ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,
he was ſent hither to give greater
reputation to the affairs of that Prince, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged
by <hi>St Agolin,</hi> in quality of Gentleman of
his chamber. At firſt he endeavoured to divert
himſelf by all the recreations this place afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
beſides which, he enjoyed one peculiar to
himſelf by reaſon of the excellent verſes he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed:
he was pleaſed to repeat to us ſome ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
he had made in praiſe of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>
and almoſt a whole Scene of a piece he begun
in imitation of <hi>Senecas Medea:</hi> but neither love
nor the Muſes had charms powerful enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that diſcontent and melancholly, which
reduced him to the lamentable condition in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42656:93"/>
which we lef him; his health being diſturbed
by ſo frequent and ſodain alterations as neither
himſelf, his friends, nor Phyſitians could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.
He therefore forſook all pleaſures, for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
and inſtead of ſeeking company that
might divert his thoughts from contemplating
his affairs and infirmity; he made <hi>la Caſa del Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po,</hi>
his Hermitage, whither he often went, either
alone, or accompanied by one friend, whom he
tired with ſilent walking. The King allowed him
a Coach with four Horſes, neither good nor bad;
but the Coachman and Footman very ill cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for ſervants of ſo great a King. Beſides
this equipage which he commands whenſoever
he pleaſes; he hath his particular Train which
conſiſts of Some Footmen, a Secretary, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Horſe, a Page, and ſome other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers;
to maintain himſelf and them, the King
allows him 1800 Crowns a month and pays his
houſe-rent: he wears the Spaniſh habit, and ſeems
ſo far concerned in the intereſts of that Court,
whither really, or to juſtify his engagement with
it, that he ſpeaks of it with paſſion, and will
allow nothing to be comparable to the manner
of living in it; this is not becauſe without cauſe
of complaint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, (as is ſuppoſed) obliged by
prudence: He medles with little at preſent, as
well by reaſon of his indiſpoſition, as that the
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſometime ſince, ſent one of his
Counſellors, who ſeems to have the intrigue and
principal affairs in his hand; he is called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeroles,</hi>
and well qualified: he hath as much
Learning as is neceſſary to manage the affairs of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42656:94"/>
the time; he perfectly underſtands this Court
and Nation; his wit is ſolid, yet quick and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
his judgement exquiſite, and in the affairs
he handles there needs be no diſtruſt of his
miſtaking the ſhadow for the ſubſtance, nor
the point for the hilt; his converſation is both
agreeable and ſerious in ſuch a manner, that
none go from him without ſatisfaction, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of many things remarkable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
or circumſtances. In a word, one may ſay
of him that his parts are ſolidly eſtabliſhed, both
by Art and nature, were he not tormented by
an Aſtma, that gives him little repoſe. This
indilpoſition was acquired by riding poſt on his
Maſters occaſions, and it is ſo violent, that for
ſome years he hath not ſlept but in a chair,
not daring to lie in a bed, for fear of being
ſuffocated by a defluxion and ſhortneſs of wind.
The King of <hi>Spain</hi> allows him alſo one of his
Coaches, drawn by as many Horſes as that which
attends the Earl of <hi>Fieſque.</hi> In the Palace which
is called <hi>Conde houſe</hi> remain ſtill ſome of thoſe
that followed that Princes party, and accepted
not the <hi>Amneſty;</hi> the chief of theſe is Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Trincars,</hi> Counſellor in the Parliament
of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> he is a man of parts and honour,
and that was very well with Monſieur <hi>d' Eſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
but that carried with the ſtream, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf to follow the fortune of the Prince
of <hi>Conde,</hi> when he came to poſſeſs himſelf of
the Government of <hi>Gaſcone;</hi> that party decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> ſent him into <hi>England</hi>
to ſolicite ſuccors, whilſt he was there, they of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42656:94"/>
               <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> returned to their Kings obedience,
which expoſed him to a great deal of rigor, the
effects of which, would have been ſenſible to
his Eſtate, had it not been ſecured as his wives
Dowry. That his perſon might be in no leſs
ſafety, he retired to this place; after which, the
Prince made him Intendant of his Army, but
he cannot obtain from theſe Miniſters 500 piſtols
the Prince gave him to be paid out of his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
neither doth he ſolicite them longer, nor
preſs any thing but his diſcharge, which he
knows they will not grant without the 500 pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols,
leſt his arrival with the Prince, give
him a new ſubject of complaint by ſo much the
more juſt, in that this Counſellor, whom he
ſummons to an imployment, in which he will
be neceſſary to him, demands not any gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
or <hi>Ajuda de coſta,</hi> as it is here called, but
the payment of part of a ſum that is due to him;
by what I gueſſed, the difficulty lay not in the
expedition of the paſport, but of the Money,
without which they would not have him go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
In the ſame houſe lives alſo an Agent of
Monſieur <hi>de Marcin</hi> who ſolicits his Maſters pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
(which amounts to 12000 Crowns a year)
as General of the Kings Armies; beſides the aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> gives on the Money
he draws from hence; all theſe and ſome others
that are in this houſe, live on the 18 hundred
Crowns a month that are given the Earl of
<hi>Fieſque;</hi> it is true, that by the death of <hi>St Agolin</hi>
who was the Princes firſt Envoye; this charge
will be ſomewhat eaſed: <hi>St Agolin</hi> was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42656:95"/>
of <hi>Auvergne</hi> that lay ſick long, and was
at laſt killed by hot Medicines; they ſpeak very
pleaſantly of his Doctors, who after ſix months
application of all manner of cold remedies, told
him, that ſince thoſe availed not, they muſt try
hot ones, and ſo brought him to his end, in
which he was happier then in ſo craſie a life: I
ſaw his Grave, and was pointed out one of the
ſumptuoſities of this Countrey, which requires
perſons of quality to have crimſon Velvet or
red Sattin nailed to their Coffin, adorned
with gold and ſilver Lace, at leaſt on the ſeams,
if not covered over.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Agent or Ambaſſador of forrain
Princes, was the Dukes of <hi>Florence;</hi> he is a
Clergy-man that wants not wit, of good meen,
and free and affable converſation. His brother,
whom we knew at the great Dukes Court, where
he is very conſiderable, had given us a Letter for
him, which we delivered quickly after our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
at <hi>Madrid:</hi> he received us well, and made
many offers of ſervice to my Lord . . . . . but
gave us occaſion to obſerve that the ſtudy of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
and its near relation to the <hi>Italian,</hi> made
it very difficult for us to uſe the latter without
mixture of ſome words of the former: nay ſome
<hi>Italians</hi> could ſcarcely avoid this, nor ſpeak their
own languaage with purity after acquiſition of
ſome little of the <hi>Caſtillian.</hi> No Prince in <hi>Italy</hi>
being more ſtreightened by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> than
the Great Duke, he alwayes keeps an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
in this Court to get intelligence of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
paſſes: for beſides that which this King
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42656:95"/>
poſſeſſes in the Iſle of <hi>Elba,</hi> he is Maſter of the
beſt Havens in <hi>Toſcany</hi> that belonged to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
of <hi>Sienna,</hi> and therefore much concerned
in the affairs of this Crown particularly in thoſe
that belong to it in <hi>Italy.</hi> Seignior <hi>Encontri,</hi> of
whom I now ſpeak, is very intelligent in theſe
matters, and too active and quick-ſighted to be
ignorant of what paſſes here. He diſcovered
the Treaty of the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> with this King for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
of <hi>Pontremoli;</hi> and as ſoon as he had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the mine, and recived the great Dukes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to act with all his might towards gaining a
place ſo advantagious to him, he ſo well thwarted
the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> in their Bargain, he broke it off,
and ſtruck up for his Maſter. In acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which that Prince a little after ſent the
Ambaſſador a horſe of maſſie Gold, made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
before for <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, or <hi>Lewis</hi> the
thirteenth of <hi>France,</hi> and removing the effigies
of one of thoſe Kings which was of the ſame
mettal, there needed no more but to place in its
ſtead that of <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth, to be preſented
to <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> who accepting it, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to do ſo on no other termes, but to beſtow
it in his Maſters Cabinet, where, as was reported,
he effectively placed it. My Lord . . . . . made
many viſits to this Ambaſſador, who alſo came
twice or thrice to ſee him; being an Eccleſiaſtick
he only wore along Robe, without taking the
habit of the Country.</p>
            <p>The third forrain Miniſter was Seignior <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi>
Ambaſſador for the Republick of <hi>Venice:</hi>
He is very magnificent and ſplendid, and of a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42656:96"/>
meen altogether ſuitable to the Majeſty of that
<hi>Auguſt</hi> Senate: whoſe dignity yet he better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
by an acquired knowledg of all that belongs
to a perſon of quality, accompanied by a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whoſe ſolidity incomparably moderates the
exuberance of his memory in ſuch a manner,
that the promptitude of the one never claſhes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the maturity of the other.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman of <hi>Piedmont</hi> called <hi>Ranuſio,</hi> who
had been ſent by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs
of <hi>Mantua,</hi> his Aunt, made us known to
Seignior . . . . . Secretary of the Embaſſy, who
preſented us to that excellent perſon. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
us perfectly well, and aſſured my Lord
. . . . . that the memory of his Grandfather was
dear to the Senate, to whom he had been Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
and that they which then governed ſaw
ſo many excellent qualities in that great Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
they mentioned him to their Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as
one of the ableſt headpieces had ever appeared
before them; after this he diſcourſed with us
about the troubles of <hi>England,</hi> and the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> then lately ended,
and told us that the Seigniory of <hi>Venice,</hi> who
was the firſt that ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Henry</hi> the
fourth of <hi>France,</hi> before ſeated on his Throne,
which the League with great might and fury diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
againſt him, and that had made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of acknowledging the States of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>
when they had freed themſelves from
the Spaniſh obedience, had not as yet ſent any
Ambaſſador into <hi>England</hi> to own that Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
or Protector. The reaſon he gave us was,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42656:96"/>
that that prudent Senate would do nothing it
might be forced to revoke; and though theſe
later might ſeem (however ſo ſodainly) better
eſtabliſhed than the former, they could not ſubſiſt
long, and would therefore wait till their power
were better ſettled, leſs tumultuary and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
than as yet: That it would ſee what time
would do with them, leſt with other Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
it might ſuffer the diſpleaſure to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
it ſelf to Muſhrums, who ſtarted up in
a night, and might vaniſh in the morning; for
though the forces and induſtry of the King of
<hi>Great Britain</hi> had till that time failed of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to his Throne, it was probable enough
he might recover it by means of internal revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
and ſuch flowings of State, as return
what the like ebbs have carried away. Viſits
and acquaintance of this nature give a ſoul to
travail, when a moment preſents one part of
what great Perſonages reſident, in the Country
where he is, have been long acquiring. And as
ſuch men obſerve all with great exactneſs, and
have opportunity to do ſo, their diſcourſes are
ſometimes more inſtructive than ſome years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence,
they being uſually moſt open to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>The three Ambaſſadors I have mentioned
were all we knew here, though there was alſo
one on accompt of the Emperor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called <hi>Comte
Lambert,</hi> who ſucceeded the Comte of <hi>Grain;</hi>
but we never viſited him. At our being at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi>
he was alſo there with all his Family; his
Wife is Daughter to <hi>Compte Wallenſtine,</hi> Lord
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42656:97"/>
High Chamberlain of his Imperial Majeſty. He
received the Collar of the Golden Fleece from
the Kings own hands, and went away no leſs ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
than we, by vacancy of ſeveral Chambers
in the Inne, for want of which we did little leſs
than Camp the night before his departure. He
is a tall man, thin-faced, and of no extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
meen. They ſay he agreed better with this
Court than the Earl of <hi>Grain,</hi> a bold wit, that
made himſelf more feared than loved, that
ſpoke free truths to the King, and medled in
more than belonged to his charge: he ſlighted
the Order, that no Coach, except the Kings and
Maſters of his Horſe ſhould be drawn with ſix
Mules or Horſes in the Town. He did not think
himſelf obliged to obſerve this, and ſtill went
through the ſtreets as formerly: He was once in
a paſſion againſt thoſe that admoniſhed him of
it in the Kings name, whereas the laſt complies
and uſes but four like other Ambaſſadors.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> hath alſo an Agent
here, but we had no acquaintance with him;
he lives privately, and the people one day as he
paſſed called him <hi>Lutheran;</hi> the King himſelf
(on occaſion of a difference he had) not uſing
terms more favourable. Beſides ſome ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of State of his Maſters in this Court I
think his reſidence is only to facilitate the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of his Subjects and Allies, he was upon his
departure, and ſtaid only for a paſs from <hi>France,</hi>
that he might not be arreſted on the Frontier.</p>
            <p>An Envoy of the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Armſtadt</hi> was
alſo upon going with more ſatisfaction, (as I
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42656:97"/>
found by his diſcourſe) as well that he was no
longer to trouble himſelf with ineffectual ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations,
as that he had obtained (as he thought)
ſomething for his Maſters intereſts. He came
to demand the Penſions the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ought to
pay him according to Treaties made with him
in <hi>Germany,</hi> and of which the arrears mounted
very high, but he carried away nothing but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with aſſignations very incertain (as I was
told) and no ready mony, beſides <hi>Aynda de
Coſta,</hi> that is ſomething to bear his charges.</p>
            <p>We ſaw alſo the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> who was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
on his departure, for which he had long
prepared, but, becauſe he that was to ſucceed
him, called Seignior <hi>Maſsimi</hi> (if I miſtake not)
had at his landing in the Kingdom of <hi>Valentia</hi>
been arreſted in the Kings name, with prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to go forward, he was fain to ſtay till that
difference was accommoded, which aroſe from
<hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth's ſending him that was to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
without having firſt given the Court ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of it, and known whether it were accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and ſince the <hi>French</hi> had on the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
arreſted the <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> it was
thought <hi>Spain</hi> might do the like; beſides that,
this came charged with ſome inſtructions
relating to <hi>Portugal</hi> and this Court, which in
the Kings opinion were not ſufficiently Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
who poſſeſſed of that title with precedence
of all others, required them after his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.</p>
            <p>Theſe difficulties, and ſuch other as concerned
his reception, being at laſt removed, after his
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42656:98"/>
paſſing ſometime as a private perſon in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Valentia,</hi> he was permitted to come to
this Town, and exerciſe his function: He arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on the Eve of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> or a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, and ſaw the ſolemnity through a grated
Window, not appearing becauſe not received;
and he in whoſe place he came (doubtleſsly not
a little troubled to be removed from ſo profitable
an employment) did that day his laſt office in
attending the King in that Ceremonie.</p>
            <p>Now I am ſpeaking of the Ambaſſadors and
Miniſters of forrain Princes, I will not omit what
I have to ſay of <hi>Margarite</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> Dutcheſs of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> who prepared to leave the Court, and
paſs the reſt of her life in the Dutchy of <hi>Millan,</hi>
where the King had aſſigned certain lands for
her entertainment. She is Daughter of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta
of <hi>Spain</hi> and of <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> Duke of
<hi>Savoy:</hi> She was married to Duke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the
laſt Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> of that Line, and had but
one Daughter during the life of her Father mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the Duke of <hi>Rethel,</hi> Son of the Duke of
<hi>Nevers,</hi> to ſecure to him the ſucceſſion of thoſe
Eſtates as neareſt Heir; but <hi>Spain</hi> reſolving to
diſpute it with him; this woman, whoſe inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were totally <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> ſided with the houſe
of <hi>Auſtria</hi> againſt her own Daughter; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
that were conſequences of this in <hi>Italy,</hi>
are known to all the world, it is enough that I
remember here that this Princeſs being retired
to this Court, for which ſhe had ſo openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
was well received, and to employ her
wit and zeal made Vice-Queen of <hi>Portugal;</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:42656:98"/>
where, to ſpeak truth ſhe comported her ſelf
prudently. But the inſolence and avarice of the
Miniſters impoſed to act under her, ſeconded
by the countenance and approbation of the
Condeduke, at that time Favorite, was ſo great
ſhe could not prevent their driving the people
to diſpair, diſcontenting the Grandes, and
wronging the Clergy, giving occaſion to all of
them to take Arms for reeſtabliſhng their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Theſe things ſhe often wrote both to the
King and his chief Miniſter, particularizing all
exorbitancies committed, and danger of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
revolt: But the Favourite cauſed little regard
to be given to her advice, ever crying out ſhe
was a Woman, and all ſhe writ trifles, more
crediting the letters of the Miniſters he had
ſent with the intrigue than hers; on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
after affairs in <hi>Lisbonne</hi> had changed face,
and a ſhort exile that permitted her not to come
to Court was paſſed over, at her return from
that loſt Kingdom, getting opportunity to ſpeak
with the King, ſhe aſſiſted towards ruining the
Duke of <hi>Olivares</hi> in his opinion. She was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
entertained at <hi>Madrid</hi> by his Majeſty,
who now at laſt gave her permiſſion to retire
to her native Country, there to lay her bones,
being very aged. Some nevertheleſs ſuppoſe her
ſent into <hi>Italy,</hi> to be a means of inticing the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> her Nephew (now of age) from
the French alliance, and of continuing the Duke
of <hi>Mantua</hi> her Grandchild in the Spaniſh inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
into which he entred after the taking <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi>
and from which they diſtruſt he may be bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42656:99"/>
by his great engagements to <hi>France,</hi> as
well on accompt of his birth as of the Eſtate he
poſſeſſes there.</p>
            <p>During our ſtay at <hi>Madrid</hi> we had many
faithful Companions of our Travails Monſieur
...... in whom to the deſire of knowing things
that are conſiderable, is joyned ſuch a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of them, he is become capable of ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
himſelf in ſervice of his Country, as ſoon
as he ſhall attain the rank his own merit, and his
deceaſed fathers ſervices ſeem to have acquired
him. I will ſay nothing of his other vertues,
that have made too deep impreſſion in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
to believe they can ever be effaced, I had
the happineſs to know him in <hi>Florence,</hi> where
Mr. ..... and he renewed the friendſhip they
had contracted in their tender years, when they
bore arms together in <hi>Holland</hi> under Prince <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
of <hi>Orange.</hi> Coming out of <hi>Italy</hi> he landed
in the Kingdom of <hi>Valentia,</hi> and from
thence went ſtreight to <hi>Madrid</hi> in hope of
meeting us, but having continued there ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
deſpairing of our arrival, he reſolved to be
gone: when he leaſt thought of us, and could
not expect at <hi>Madrid</hi> in the Middle of the
Spring thoſe that ſhould have paſſed the Winter
there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> four horſe-men paſſed by his lodging,
whoſe habit and horſes diſcovered them to be
of the other ſide the Mountains, his curioſity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
him to follow them to the place where they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ghted, not a little ſurpriſed to find thoſe he had
ſo impatiently expected: he was then in ſuch an
equipage, that I muſt confeſs at firſt I knew him
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42656:99"/>
not, he wore the Caſſock, Rocket, thin and
ſtreight Stockings, with Pumps and Breeches like
Holſters, which ſo ſtrangely diguiſed him he
ſeemed not the ſame perſon we had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with in <hi>Florence;</hi> his muſtaches or
whiskers grown long and turned up with irons,
made me more a ſtranger to the air of his face, he
not a little reſembling the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> of
whom he hath more of the meen in that habit,
than of himſelf, when clothed after the faſhion
of his Countrey. After mutual expreſſions of
our joy, we acquainted him with the delayes of
our journey, and he told us the ſucceſſes of his,
and having paſſed three moneths in <hi>Madrid,</hi>
during which we failed not one day of ſeeing one
another we reſolved to paſs together into <hi>France</hi>
by way of <hi>Arragon:</hi> but before we put this in
execution, a Troop of illuſtrious Strangers, whom
we were very glad to ſee arrived in <hi>Madrid:</hi>
amongſt them were two Gentlemen whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of mind and body made evident, that if
heaven hath given them great advantages by
eminent birth, their education and docility have
contributed no leſs to that virtue and prudence
which ſurpaſſes their age. They brought many
Letters from the Earl of <hi>Fuenſaldaigne,</hi> Dom <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen
de Gamarra,</hi> and other of the King of <hi>Spains</hi>
Miniſters in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> to the beſt of this
Court, who received them very well, but wanting
the language they took along with them a <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundian</hi>
Doctor called <hi>Rognar,</hi> imployed in the
buſineſſes of ſeveral Officers that ſerve in the
Kings Armies, and other perſons of his Nation
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42656:100"/>
that are concerned in this Court to be their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,
they were careſſed by all, eſpecially by
<hi>Don Lewis</hi> and the Earls of <hi>Ognate</hi> &amp; <hi>Pigneranda:</hi>
Though they reſolved to ſtay at <hi>Madrid</hi> no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then Midſummer day to ſee the fight of Bulls,
they habited themſelves according to the mode
of the Country, and intending within two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
to leave it for <hi>Portugal,</hi> they began at firſt
to provide horſes, and ſolicit the expedition of
a Paſs to make the <hi>Tour</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the exceſſive heat of thoſe Regions.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we got our Paſs we prepared to be
gone, it was in the ſame form as that we brought
out of <hi>Flanders</hi> from the Arch-Duke, very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and unlimited, as well to time as perſons.
Having taken our leaves, and beſides the Nags
we brought out of <hi>France</hi> furniſhed our ſelves
with ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſes, we left <hi>Madrid</hi> the
17th of <hi>June,</hi> taking the way of <hi>Arragon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in the
forenoon we rid ſix leagues, the Country very
dry, which continued to be ſo till we came to
the River <hi>de los Henares,</hi> on which ſtands the
City of <hi>Alcala,</hi> in Latin called <hi>Complutum.</hi> It is
very famous for its Univerſity, founded (as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported)
on the Model of that of <hi>Paris,</hi> and like
it divided into ſeveral Colledges, every one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
of Profeſſors called <hi>Cathedraticos.</hi> Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Philoſophy floriſh more here than in any
other Univerſity of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Salamanca</hi> in the
Kingdom of <hi>Leon</hi> moſt for Students in the Civil
Law, alone equalls it.</p>
            <p>The Town is long but narrow, having little
more than one fair ſtreet, in which the Scholars
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42656:100"/>
lodge. Here, as I was told, Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>
was a Student, ſent by Cardinal <hi>Colonna</hi> when
Legate in <hi>Spain:</hi> the little River of <hi>Henares</hi> that
paſſes by it makes the land about it fertil, and
renders it more agreeable than the reſt of the
Country, where for want of water there are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trees nor graſs: leaving here the poſte
Rode, and taking the ſhorteſt way that led to
<hi>Arragon,</hi> we lay at <hi>Marcamalo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> about 4 leagues
diſtant; this is a little Village without any thing
remarkable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>18th</hi> we dined at <hi>Hita,</hi> a ſmall Town
ſeated on the top of a little hill ſhadowed by a
greater: that night we lay at <hi>Cadadra</hi> a pretty
Town in a Valley: From hence we went the
next morning early, and dined at <hi>Saguença;</hi>
we inned in the Suburbs, where we drunk wine
eſteemed the beſt of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> but it is like <hi>aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae,</hi>
not only ſtrong but fiery, yet bears not
water. Having refreſhed our ſelves, for we had
a very cool chamber, and plenty of ſnow, we
went to lodge at <hi>Fuente Caliente:</hi> or rather to
do penance there for the pleaſure we enjoyed
at noon. Its name (interpreted, the hot foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain)
is not given it without reaſon; we ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here very much, not only by heat, but bad
accommodation on all accounts; the Hoſt was
rude and barbarous, ſuitable to ſo ſavage a habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>20th</hi> over a very barren Countrey and
hot Mountains we came to <hi>Arcos,</hi> the laſt Town
of new <hi>Caſtile,</hi> where conſequently is a Puerto or
Cuſtomhouſe: It was a Sunday and Holiday, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42656:101"/>
the people all at Maſs when we paſſed; we traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it very leiſurely without any one's ſaying any
thing to us; but as ſoon as we were beyond a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
gate, by which we went from the Village
to the High-way, in that part very ſtreight by
reaſon of the Brook and Mountain, and had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
about 100 paces beyond all the Barricado's,
we perceived people running and calling after us;
I ſtaied to know what they would have, and when
they overtook me, they told me the Puerto or
Cuſtom-houſe was in that Town. I replied we
we were not Merchants, nor had any obligation
upon us on that account, having ſufficient
Paſsports from the King, and that if they had
had any thing to ſay to us, they ought to have
done it in the Town, and there have acquainted
us that there was a Cuſtom-houſe, we having no
<hi>Moco de Mulas,</hi> or Guide to inform us. They
deſired that one of us would go back to ſhew
our Paſs, which I did, though unadviſedly; for
I have been told ſince we might have gone on,
and gained <hi>Arragon,</hi> and ſo have avoided the
cavils and impudence of thoſe Harpies. When
I ſhewed my Paſs they ſaid they muſt call a
Council to conſider if it were valid, and that
therefore I ſhould ſend to the Company to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
Which being done they told us we might
go <hi>a la Poſada, e que toda la nueſtra ropa eſtava
deſcaminada;</hi> that we might go to the Inn, for all
our baggage was confiſcated: then gueſſing
they intended by terrifying to get money of us,
I bid them read our Paſs, which was in theſe
termes.</p>

            <p>I thought this Paſs ſufficient to prevent theſe
Publicans detaining us, but thirſt of gain in
which, on ſeveral other occaſions they had had
ſucceſs againſt all Juſtice and Reaſon, made them
obſtinate by expectation of the like. I asked the
cauſe of their diſreſpect to His Majeſties Paſſe?
ſometimes they ſaid it was ſhewd too late, and
otherwhiles that it was not on ſealed paper; by
which I perceived they deſigned to bring us to
a compoſition of 50 or 60 piſtols. Finding us
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42656:102"/>
not at all compliable, and that I cauſed a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
to be made by a publick Notary;
that <hi>Franciſco Salazar,</hi> Alcalde of the place,
ſtayed us contrary to the Kings Paſſe, (having
plotted together to that purpoſe) they began to
talk high, hoping ſo to terrify us, and the Alcalde
ſeiſing our <hi>Valiſes,</hi> cauſed them to be carried
to the Cuſtom-houſe, where opening them he
took an Inventory of all, and not only of ſuch
Money as we had in them, but in our pockets,
and forming an accuſation, obliged us to put in
our anſwers; in which they endeavoured to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent
us, but I looked ſo near to what they
writ, I ſuffered nothing to paſs I had not ſpoken,
otherwiſe proteſting againſt ſigning it: theſe
many formalities were made uſe of to fright
us with the name of Juſtice, of which, all their
noiſe and ſcribling coming ſhort, a Prieſt that
belonged to them and another fellow that did
the Office of a Secretary, told me in private,
that giving 50 piſtols we might go freely; I
ſlighted this, but told them, I cared not if I gave
them 30 Patagons, though their inſolence did
not deſerve it. And ſuch indeed it was, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
on the part of the <hi>Alcalde Salazar,</hi> a
Knight of <hi>St Jago,</hi> but an arrant <hi>raſcal</hi> as well
as the Cuſtomer <hi>Nicholas Lopes de Cordoua</hi> that
had the meen of a Jew; at laſt they became
impudent and deſperately outragious when they
ſaw they could not effect their deſign of plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us; and perceiving it, reſolved that I ſhould
return poſt to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to complain of them and
deſire Juſtice; they alſo provided one to carry
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42656:102"/>
their Juſtification to the Receiver-General of
the Cuſtoms, and ſent him away afoot: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the day was ſpent in ſuch conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with them, but at laſt they ſuffered me
to go about Eight in the evening; their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
being firſt diſpatched: My Lord—
writ all to the Earl of <hi>Pigneranda.</hi> I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon by them at my firſt mounting, in
the prices of the Horſes; no Poſts in the world
furniſht with better then thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor that
are leſs ridden; for, excepting ſuch as carry
Letters and ſome extraordinary Couriers that
are ſent to Court from ſeveral parts, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>St Sebaſtians</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> this way is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
made uſe of, they preferring Hackney Mules:
which indeed are more commodious, as I found
by experience on this occaſion, for though the
Horſes be good, one is tormented by wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Saddles, with very narrow Seats, high Pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,
and extraordinary hard. So that to be
mounted in ſuch a manner, one is little more at
eaſe then on a rack. At the 3d Stage, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
for all furniture had only Pannels with wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
ſtirrups hung in Ropes. Finding fault with
ſuch equipage; the Poſtmaſter told me, it was
not ſtrange he had no Saddles, and that I ſhould
find the pannel eaſier, I complied, and at firſt
was in a great deal of diſorder, becauſe I could
not ſettle on the ſtirrups, and by reaſon of the
extraordinary breadth of the pannel; but this
paſſed over, I liked their Pannels better then their
Saddles, and called for one at the next Stage,
but could not have it, and took a Saddle, not ſo
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42656:103"/>
convenient as the Pannel I was ſo unwilling
to ride on. At the 3d Stage they took me for
the expreſs of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> carrying ſome good
news to the King, which I did not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict,
becauſe I found my ſelf better uſed on
account of it; they demanding for each Horſe
but four Rials, about 2 s. 6 d. of our Money.
Few Poſt-maſters keep above two or three hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
neither are they obliged to more, They
have Salaries of 3 or 400 Crowns; nay ſome
500, for the keeping only of two Horſes and a
Poſt-Boy. The Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> is Poſt-maſter-General,
which is very profitable to him; my
Horſes were every where very good, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped
all the way, but the Poſtilions often ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to give them breath, which they call <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelar,</hi>
is very troubleſome: Beſides, that at chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Horſes, eſpecially in the night, they are
very tedious. The Poſt way is not the ſame we
paſſed in going to <hi>Arcos,</hi> but over a very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Plain, watered by the River <hi>de los Henares;</hi>
5 or 6 Leagues are often rid on the ſame horſes,
becauſe the Poſts are not eſtabliſhed as they
ought to be at every two Leagues.</p>
            <p>Arriving at <hi>Madrid,</hi> after ſome repoſe, and
dining with Monſieur <hi>de Mogeron,</hi> I was forced
to ſtop till the heat of the middle of the day paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
over, before I could endeavour any thing in
my buſineſs, for all here ſleeping after dinner,
I could not ſee the Earl of <hi>Pigneranda</hi> (with
whom I reſolved to begin, and for whom I had
a Letter) till about five a clock; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the interim, went to conſult of my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42656:103"/>
with ſome friends, and meeting in the
<hi>Calle Major,</hi> a very honeſt Fleming, called
Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> that underſtood this Court well,
and ſpoke excellent Spaniſh, giving him account
of our accident, he drew a Memorial to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by the Earl of <hi>Pigneranda</hi> to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
Royal, not doubting of my ſucceſs, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing
me not to be impatient of delays, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moſt certain, that this people as much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
formalities in the ſlighteſt affairs, as in
thoſe of the higheſt concernment, and withal
letting me underſtand there was great indulgence
for Farmers of Cuſtoms, becauſe the Kings princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Revenue, riſing from it, their exactions are
ſometimes connived at. Indeed, Taxes on land
bring up little or nothing in <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe the
Countrey is not ſufficiently manured, and were
Husbandmen burthened, would be leſs ſo, even
to a want of neceſſary ſuſtenance. He told me
more, that when the Cuſtoms are Farmed, it is
done in ſo abſolute a manner, that nothing p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
not for the Kings own uſe, without paying;
and if he give any exemptions, they are deduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Rent the Farmers agreed for. Thoſe
fellows therefore make uſe of a hundred cheats
(too tedious to be here related) in order to
confiſcation, which if they cannot effect with
juſtice, they forge falſe ſuppoſitions, and under
pretence of the Kings rights, exerciſe their Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
with Soveraignty, and are ſo inſolent, that
on all occaſions they vaunt themſelves to be the
Kings ſervants; and a wretched waiter or other
ſpawn of a Publican, will ſometimes be fancy
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42656:104"/>
enough to threaten an honeſt man to beat him,
or break open his Trunk if he be ſlow in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
the Key. In <hi>France</hi> one ſuffers no leſs
by the extravagant greedineſs of this kind of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
and I cannot forget the pains they took at
<hi>Diep,</hi> to ſend an Army of Guards aboard the
veſſel I arrived in, to viſit my <hi>Valiſe,</hi> toſſing up
and down my cloaths, annd taxing a bit of cloth
that remained of a ſuit I had made at <hi>London</hi>
two Crowns; ſo that if Princes or their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
limit not their exactions, Travailers are
miſerably expoſed to them, and this is their great
ſcourge, the more to be apprehended, becauſe
ſeldom or never puniſhed: the greateſt part of
thoſe fellows in <hi>Spain</hi> are thought to be Jews,
and when their plunderings have gorged them
with wealth, the trap of the inquiſition is ſet for
them. Going at nine a clock to the Earl of
<hi>Pignerandas,</hi> he was not returned, but I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
his Secretary Don <hi>Martin</hi> with my
buſineſs, deſiring him to move it to his Lord,
and to give him the Letter I brought from my
Lord—with the Memorial: the next day
about the ſame hour I went again, and found
that Lord very much troubled at what had
happened to us, who after, offering me a Coach,
Money, and all elſe in his power, deſired me
to have a little patience, and told me he was
very ſorry my Lords—and—were in
ſo bad a place, and arreſted by the inſolence of
thoſe <hi>Picaros,</hi> who ſhould be exemplarily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
and we receive all manner of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
the like I did to Don <hi>Lewis de Haro,</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:42656:104"/>
and found the like civility. To make ſhort, my
ſolicitations had ſuch effect, that the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a Commiſſion to be diſpatched by the
Council of <hi>Caſtille</hi> for an <hi>Alguazil de Corte,</hi> and
a Secretary to go along with me to <hi>Arcos</hi> and
bring <hi>Franciſco Salazar</hi> to the publick priſon
of <hi>Madrid</hi> in order to his puniſhment, and
an ampler Paſsport was given me that we might
no more apprehend the like inconvenience.</p>
            <p>The Alguazil and Secretary that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to go with me, refuſed to travail by
night, or to ride Poſt, ſo that I was fain to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
till the 26th of <hi>June,</hi> and then return by
Mule. Experience taught me, that this way of
travailing, is very inconvenient; for, beſides
that, for more expedition, the Mules always
trot, one cannot expreſs how much their hard
mouths preſs and weary the hand, nor what a
torment it is, going down hill to ſuffer their ſlow
progreſſion. Being thus excellently mounted,
and in this honourable company; I neglected
nothing towards my ſpeedy arriving at <hi>Arcos,</hi>
whither I came the 29th of <hi>Iune,</hi> and found the
Lord—and—already advertiſed of the
ſucceſs of my journey by a Letter from <hi>Madrid;</hi>
I immediately carried the <hi>Alguazil</hi> and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to execute their Commiſſion; the Alcalde
was much ſurprized, but making uſe of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
as Knight of the Order of <hi>St Iames,</hi>
refuſed to obey without a Mandate from the
Council of the Orders. My <hi>Alguazil</hi> who was
of the higher Order, and one of thoſe that are
called <hi>Alguazil de Corte,</hi> often ſummoned him to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42656:105"/>
go along with him to <hi>Madrid</hi> as his priſoner,
but he ſtill refuſed to obey, of which the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guazil</hi>
took witneſs, ſaying; he could not uſe
force, becauſe that Town belonging to the Duke
of <hi>Medina Celi,</hi> there was no <hi>Corrigidor above</hi>
the <hi>Alcalde,</hi> but that this would undo the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calde,</hi>
and that he doubted not to return from
<hi>Madrid</hi> with power to carry him thither bound
hands and feet; and we heard afterwards, that
(as Spaniſh juſtice never pardons) he was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
according to his deſerts; the reſt of the
Officers of the Cuſtom-houſe ſeeing the bad
condition of their Protector, were as compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and civil as they had been arrogant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable:
they returned all that belonged to
us without the leaſt diminution, and they which
before pretended to plunder us, and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that we ſhould pay for the tedious writings
they had drawn, deſired now nothing more
then to be quit, not only of us, but of the prey we
had redeemed from their clutches: we had no
leſs impatience to get from amongſt ſuch Raſcals,
which that we might the ſooner do, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
our ſelves, to recommend the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them to thoſe other Harpies, who ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſuffer ſuch as they ſeiſe on to eſcape, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them all damages and coſts we might
pretend the more to incite them to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as freed from thoſe troubles, we
made all haſte towards <hi>Arragon.</hi> Several parts of
this <hi>Province</hi> are very agreeable, and when we
had left the Mountains that incloſe <hi>Arcos,</hi> we
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42656:105"/>
came to very pleaſant Vallies, and the 29th of
<hi>Iune</hi> in the evening, entred <hi>Erizza</hi> or <hi>Herizo,</hi>
the firſt Town on that ſide of that kingdom: the
next day we dined at <hi>Texa,</hi> that hath nothing
remarkable, and lay at <hi>Callatajud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> one of the
principle Cities of the Kingdom, ſeated at the
end of a very fertile Plain, but in nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
unleſs in giving birth and abode to
<hi>Lorenzo Brachian Infanzon,</hi> a modern writer,
very famous amongſt the Spaniards; he hath
publiſhed ſeveral Treatiſes of Morality and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
amongſt which, one is called <hi>el Criticon,</hi>
of which, two parts only are printed, a kind
of Satyr, very ingenious in imitation of <hi>Barclais
Euphormio:</hi> in this piece his ſtile differs much very
from thoſe ſmall Treatiſes in which he is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
abrupt, and ſtrangely laconick, one would
think he had made it his buſineſs to be obſcure;
the Reader muſt often divine his ſenſe, which
found, he perceives an <hi>enigma</hi> hath been made
of ſomething not very extraordinary. <hi>Seneca</hi>
and <hi>Tacitus</hi> are very ſhort of him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of writing, and if it be ſaid of the former,
that his Stile is Sand without Lime, and that
the ſecond is ſo myſterious, he contains more
then he expreſſes: we may conclude that of
<hi>Gracian,</hi> hath ſo little connexion in its periods
and ſo much reſtraint in its words, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is like a Diamond ill ſet, whoſe flame
and luſter appear not ſo that it looſes the eſteem
of the better half of the work.</p>
            <p>There lives in the ſame Kingdom another
<hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> affecting like him the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:42656:106"/>
eloquence, he is called <hi>Vincencio Ivan de Laſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſa.</hi>
by whoſe means moſt of the works of
<hi>Gracian</hi> are printed. This <hi>Laſtannoſa</hi> is looked
on as the moſt curious perſon of <hi>Spain;</hi> he dwels
at <hi>Hueſca,</hi> the ſecond City of <hi>Arragon,</hi> where
he is reported to have collected a Cabinet
that is a very agreeable Theatre of Grecian
and Roman antiquities; there are many Statues,
Vaſes, Urnes, Arms, Precious Stones, antient
Moneys, Medals and Rings; in which he is ſo
well ſtudied, that he hath written a Treatiſe of
the antient Moneys of <hi>Spain,</hi> which paſſes for
exquiſite in its kind, and rare in its obſervations.
The firſt of <hi>July</hi> having dined at <hi>Ofranco</hi> we lay
at <hi>Almunia,</hi> ſeated in a fruitful valley, and
yielding a fair proſpect on which ſide ſoever it
is beheld: <hi>Saragoſa</hi> is but nine Leagues from
it, and we intended to dine the next day at
<hi>la Muela,</hi> and to arrive before the heat, but
unhappily loſt our way on a great heath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
houſe, tree, buſh, or water; it extended even
to the walls of <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> without giving any
opportunity to refreſh, or to avoid the Suns
beams for 5 or 6 Leagues. It fell out well for us,
that the day was not exceſſively hot, ſo that
our ſufferings were not extreme, though
ſome of the company were in no little choller,
to ride ſo far without drawing bit, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
no leſs then if they had traverſed the
Sands of <hi>Libia,</hi> but it is folly to be troubled
where no remedy can be had, and before our
patience was quite tired, half a League ſhort of
<hi>Saragoſa</hi> we came to a Brook, where we all
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42656:106"/>
alit to refreſh our ſelves, and as nothing ſeems
hard to a ſharp hunger, our vehement thirſt
made that water (none of the beſt) to be drunk
with pleaſure: we came at laſt to <hi>Sarragoſſa</hi>
the capital City of <hi>Arragon,</hi> ſeated in a large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extended Plain; it is divided by the River
<hi>Ebro,</hi> but the greateſt part of it on the ſide where
we arrived. A little ſhort of it is an old Caſtle
called <hi>Alta Feria;</hi> with a pitiful graft about it,
we were told it had formerly bin a palace of
their Kings, and was then of the Inquiſition.
The Farmer of the Cuſtoms had Guards at the
Gate, who hearing that our ſervants followed
with our baggage, detained us not long: we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
notice might be given them, that they ſhould
know where we lodged at the houſe of one <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondon</hi>
a Merchant, for whom we had Letters
of credit; we alit at his houſe and found him
at dinner, he preſented us very good Wine,
which refreſhed us, and reſtored the vigor the
long journey and exceſſive heat had deprived
us of; he afterwards brought us to the beſt Inn
in the Town, where we had a fair and cool
room, and to prevent our <hi>Valiſes</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at the Cuſtom-houſe, whither they muſt
of neceſſity be brought; I went to ſpeak with
the Arrendador-General, and ſhew him our
Paſs, which obliged him to be civil and to ſend
us our baggage as ſoon as it came to him; we
tarried here all day to repair our loſs of bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>la Muelan;</hi> ſome of the company went
to bed, others only caſting off their clothes,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42656:107"/>
ſhifted their Linnen. Monſieur—who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
laſt, was the moſt thirſty, though not the
moſt weary, therefore he lay not down; but at
his firſt coming in, drank ſo much water, and
afterwards ſo much wine to correct its crudity,
he became ſick, beſides too ſuddain an attempt
to quench his thirſt; he walked long unbutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and almoſt naked, not only about the houſe,
but came to us in ſlippers and without doublet,
where we were on the banks of <hi>Ebro</hi> that ran
behind the Inn, where we ſucked a gentle gale
that came down the river; on the morrow a
Feavor took him which continued 5 or 6 days,
and obliged us to tarry 10 in that City: ſoon
after our arrival we viſited the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teleon,</hi>
Viceroy of this Kingdom; he is one of
the greateſt Noblemen of <hi>Naples,</hi> of whom in
the laſt revolution of that City, the Spaniards
became jealous, though he had ſerved them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatagiouſly
in the former: that they might no
longer fear him they ſent for him into <hi>Spain,</hi>
and that they might diſguiſe their diſtruſt, made
him Viceroy of <hi>Arragon.</hi> This Charge is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
but not profitable, the King allowing
but little, and the Kingdom bringing in leſs,
neither is any thing ſplendid in his family; we
delivered him the Kings Letter, and that of
Don <hi>Lewis;</hi> having read them in our preſence,
he made us offers of all that lay in his power:
he ſeemed not to us of a Genius much elevated,
whither his reſentments of the Spaniards ill uſage
have dejected it, or whither he conceals a part,
leaſt oſtentation of the whole might be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42656:107"/>
to him. Beſides the Viceroy, whoſe charge
ceaſes every three years; here is a Governour of
the City, or rather of the Countrey, ſince his
power is reported principally to extend over it;
this Charge is the more conſiderable becauſe for
life.</p>
            <p>Though the Viceroyalty and Government of
<hi>Saragoſſa</hi> are the two great charges of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
yet no authority is equal to that of the
Chief Juſtice, called <hi>El Juſticia,</hi> to ſhew that he
is to <hi>do juſtice</hi> in all and above all: ſo that he
determines of what concerns the King, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Subjects, Laws and Priviledges: but for
the better underſtanding this, and that which I
ſhall hereafter obſerve touching the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
here between high powers: it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that I ſet down what I have been told
concerning the Priviledges of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>After the Moors had entred <hi>Spain,</hi> on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Injuiry done by <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> to
Comt <hi>Don Julian</hi> in perſon of his Daughter,
called <hi>la Cava,</hi> whom he raviſhed, <hi>Arragon</hi>
was the firſt Province that freed it ſelf from the
yoke of the Infidels, and that finding not only
the race, but memory of its ancient Kings total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extinct, by it ſelf, made a recovery of
its ſelf, to it ſelf, without owning any Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.
But leſt they ſhould be a Body without a
Head, and that they might enjoy ſecure repoſe
in their new liberty, they ſoon after deliberated
of electing a King, and caſt their eyes on a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Gentleman called <hi>Garcia Ximenez.</hi> It muſt
yet be acknowledged that they made him rather
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42656:108"/>
Prince or Preſident of their State than their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign;
and in imitation of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> ſo
much limited his authority, that that of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pompus</hi>
was not more ſtreightned by the <hi>Ephori,</hi>
than that of this King by the rules impoſed upon
him: and it being very eaſie to violate the moſt
fundamental Laws of a State, when the ſupreme
power is concerned ſo to do, if there be none
with hazard of his life obliged to watch for their
preſervation, they eſtabliſhed <hi>El Juſticia,</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy
of which I have ſpoken, that who
might fear nothing in the vigorous executing his
charge, they ordered he ſhould not be liable to
condemnation either in perſon or goods on
what accompt ſoever, but in the general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Eſtates called <hi>las Cortes,</hi> that is the King
and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Having thus bound up him they ſhould elect
for their King, they made a Law called <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jon,</hi>
which imported that as ſoon as the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed
their Priviledges, it ſhould be in their
power to elect another, though a Pagan; and in
caſe of wrong to any Vaſſal or Subject, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and moſt conſiderable of the Realm might
aſſemble to protect him, and hinder any duties
to be paid the King, till the party injured were
indemnified, and the Priviledge re-eſtabliſhed
in its former validity. They erected <hi>El Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>
as Gardian of this Law, (with ſeveral others,)
who for greater authority ſate in a Chair with
his hat on his Head, whilſt the King bare and on
his knees ſwore their Priviledges between his
hands: afterwards they owned him as their
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42656:108"/>
King, but in a very grange faſhion; for inſtead
of vowing fidelity, they told him <hi>nos que valemos
tanto como vos os hazemos nueſtro Rey y Sennor, con
tal que guardeis nueſtros fueros y libertades, ſino,
no:</hi> that is, We that are equal to you make you
our King and Lord, on condition that you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
our Laws and Liberties, and if not, not.
This deteſtable faſhion of owning a King ſo
much diſguſted <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>the Dagger,</hi>
that partly by intreaty, partly by intrigue, and
offering other Priviledges in the place of it, he
cauſed it to be aboliſhed in an Aſſembly of the
Eſtates, and as ſoon as he got the Parchment in
which the Law for it was written, voluntarily
cutting his hand, he ſaid; that a Law which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
that Vaſſals might elect and limit their
King, was to be effaced with the blood of a King.
<hi>Ley de poder elegir Rey los Vaſſallos ſangre de Rey
avia de Coſtar,</hi> theſe are reported to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
words he pronounced, on which occaſion
the ſurname of <hi>the Dagger</hi> was given to him:
His Statue is yet to be ſeen in <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> in the
Hall of Deputation, with the Dagger in one
hand, and the Priviledge cancelled with his
blood in the other. And indeed the ſacred blood
of Kings can on no accompt be better employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(no not againſt a forain Enemy) then in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
ſuch exorbitant Priviledges of Subjects
as deſtroy the very foundation of Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Beſides the two Priviledges I have mentioned,
not at all regarded by later Kings, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtill in force called the Law of manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
by this every Subject that thinks himſelf
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42656:109"/>
injured either in goods or perſon, by what Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
ſoever, may complain <hi>a el Juſticia,</hi> who
is obliged to make an exact enquiry, and cauſe
the Judge that hath given a corrupt ſentence
to be puniſhed. This City at our being there
was much diſcontented, becauſe endeavours
were uſed to violate this Law. Teo Judges
were accuſed for a Sentence by which a certain
Woman thought herſelf injured, who, according
to cuſtome, deputed 500 Crowns, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of the Judges. The King, the Tribunal
<hi>d'el Juſticia,</hi> the Viceroy, the Governor, and
ſome others that ſought to augment the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Prince, and leſſen the Kingdoms
Priviledges, took theſe Judges into their prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
The Party grieved finding ſhe could get
no remedy, for the wrong ſhe pretended done
to her ſelf and the Law, had recourſe <hi>a las Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
or the States of the Kingdom, who (though
the Inquiſition favoured the Judges that were
accuſed) deputed Commiſſioners called here
<hi>Judicantes.</hi> Theſe are 9 perſons drawn from
the four Bodies of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that is the higher
Nobility intituled <hi>Sennores,</hi> the Clergy, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
called <hi>Hidalgos,</hi> or <hi>Cavalleros,</hi> and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
From the firſt of theſe Bodies three are
taken, and from each of the other two they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
make choice of the moſt illiterate to
judge Gown-men, whether that it may be done
without partiality, or that their Laws ought to
be ſo plain, that even Peaſants and others the
moſt ignorant may underſtand their equity, and
judge if it hath been obſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:42656:109"/>
Theſe 9 Deputies or Commiſſaries condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Judges of injuſtice, and ordered them
to be baniſhed, and their Eſtates confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
This Sentence made great noiſe, and the
Viceroy and Governor by order of the Court did
their beſt to hinder its effect, nay the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
writ to the <hi>Juſticia.</hi> The People concerned
themſelves in the buſineſs, and Paſquils and
Libels were every where caſt abroad with mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſhould it not be put in execution. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
people flocked to the Town, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves only with the violation of their
Priviledges. Doubt that this affair going to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
might cauſe great diſorders, in a time
when the War of <hi>Catalonia</hi> made the People of
<hi>Arragon</hi> more fierce and hardie, cauſed the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
and other favourers of the Judges, without
any farther unſeaſonable mention of the Kings
pleaſure to ſuffer them to be diſmiſt from their
charges, and baniſhed the Town. Were the like
practiſed in all places, there would not be ſo
many ſentences given out of favor, paſſion, and
intereſt, rather than according to law and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not diſtinguiſhable but in this one part of
<hi>Europe,</hi> where the Judges are reported to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
when they give ſentence, fearing it may be
their own condemnation, either as to body or
goods, if unjuſt or erroneous in the leaſt. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all this, juſtice here is ſoveraign;
for though the Judge that hath determined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
be puniſhed, the Sentence he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
remains in full efficacy: ſo that he
which accuſes his Judge hath only the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42656:110"/>
of revenge, and ſerves the Publick rather
than himſelf, by preſerving the Peoples Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
in proſecuting him that hath done wrong,
and putting other Judges in mind of their duties.
He that is found to have accuſed his Judge
without cauſe only loſes the 500 Crowns he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitated,
and though it appear he have reaſon,
recovers little more, which in that caſe is levied
on the Eſtate of the unjuſt Judge. The baniſhment
of thoſe two Judges freed <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> from appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of troubles, the People, by execution of
the Sentence, ſatisfying themſelves, that at that
time no attempt would be made upon their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</p>
            <p>Had we continued longer at <hi>Sarragoſſa</hi> we
might have ſeen a Ceremony obſerved in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading
Murtherers; for he which hath ſlain a
man face to face, receives the ſtroke that
beheads him before; but ſuch as treacherouſly
came behind him are puniſhed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
this is only for diſtinction ſake, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
the blow behind gives leſs pain to the
Criminal than that before. Whilſt we ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Town we received many civilities from
<hi>Dom Pedro Miranda,</hi> born at <hi>Oleron</hi> in <hi>Bearn,</hi>
and one of the richeſt Bankers of this Town.
We had Letters of credit to him, of which
though we made no uſe, he did us all manner of
good offices, every day ſending us his Coach,
and ſometimes accompanying us to what was
moſt remarkable. The Buildings here are large
and high, and generally fairer than in <hi>Madrid:</hi>
there is one long and broad Street where the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42656:110"/>
               <hi>Tour</hi> is made as at <hi>Madrid</hi> in the <hi>Calle Major.</hi>
The moſt conſiderable houſe belongs to the
Duke of <hi>Villa Hermoſa,</hi> who pretends to deſcend
from the ancient Kings of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and thinks
they which enjoy the Crown do him wrong.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak generally of the humor of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Arragon,</hi> they are no leſs proud than the
<hi>Caſtilians,</hi> and value themſelves above them
and all other of <hi>Spain;</hi> and it muſt be
granted that they are equal to, and ſometimes
ſurpaſs the moſt of them in wit, whether applied
to good or evil. Their ſoil is barren, and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
ſome Valleys and ſuch parts to which
the waters of <hi>Ebro</hi> are conveyed by cut Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
to moiſten it, all ſand, heath and rock,
ſo that it hardly affords corn to ſuſtain its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
Though ſo little fertil in fruits it hath
ever produced gallant men, and from their firſt
King to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> they reckon not one that
made not himſelf conſiderable to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
either by his wit or courage: that laſt above
all other was ſo prodigious in the art of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and vaſt ambition ill ſuited to the narrow
limits of his little Kingdom, that he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to extend them, and did ſo even from
the foot of the <hi>Pireneans</hi> to the Streights of
<hi>Gibralter.</hi> That ſucceſs with ſome other put
him upon the deſign of an univerſal Monarchy,
and his Succeſſors are ſtill accuſed to retain the
Intrigue and Model of it, which he then impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his Grandchild, who was to be Heir of ſo
many Provinces, and in his own perſon unite
the many Dominions, that when ſingle had been
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42656:111"/>
ſo formidable to their Neighbours: Beſides which
he had the wealth of a new World to facilitate
his enterpriſe, and aſſiſt towards eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo vaſt an Empire, as had never been known
before. It is true, ſome of the curious ſay, that
to pretend he had a thought of this, is to accuſe
him of a Chimera; but that famous <hi>Arragonian,</hi>
who hath given us a contracted draught of his
Politicks, tells us <hi>Parecieronle a Ferdinando Eſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos
ſus hereditarios Reynos de Arragon para ſus
dilatados deſſeos, y aſſi anhelo ſiempre a la grande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za
y anchura de Caſtilla, y de alli a la Monarquia
de toda Eſpanna y aun a la univerſal de entram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos
mundos;</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>The vaſt deſigns of</hi>
Ferdinando <hi>being too much confined in his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
Realms of</hi> Arragon; <hi>he firſt aimed at</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille,
<hi>then at the Monarchy of all</hi> Spain, <hi>and at
laſt of both worlds.</hi> He was not for all this any
great Captain; neither was this ambition the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of valor, living in a time when wit and
policy bore more ſway then courage. He made
uſe of the politicks of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. of <hi>France,</hi>
the induſtry of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the VI. the
ſubtilty of <hi>Lodowick Storza,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> the
vigilance of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. of <hi>England,</hi> and
prudence of the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the I.
All their diſſimulation and all their cunning the
put into ſo good a cruicible, that he ſeparated
what was ſolid from what was airy, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what was ſtrong and what weak in them,
and extracting ſuch an eſtabliſhment for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and ſucceſſors, that <hi>Philip the</hi> II had great
reaſon, when looking on his Picture, he ſaid;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42656:111"/>
               <hi>We owe this man all.</hi> Spaniſh writers are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
when they ſpeak of the grandeur of
their Royal Family, ſome of them even to impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
and a modern Author ſays of it, <hi>Caſa que

A Family elected by God in the new
Law, as the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the old, that
he might call himſelf the God of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the

            </p>
            <p>But to return to the people, amongſt whom
this dextrous Prince was born, and whom the
Polititians equalize to <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the
XI of <hi>France,</hi> for a third Idol of their <hi>Ragione
di Stato;</hi> I muſt add, that they are nothing hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable
nor civil to ſtrangers. Their lofty humour
is not allaied with ſo much affibility as that of
the <hi>Castilians,</hi> and it is from this Province, that
the Highway-men they call <hi>Vandaleros</hi> ſpred
themſelves even into <hi>Caſtille,</hi> making the Roads
very unſafe; perhaps, by reaſon of its being ſo
near a neighbor to the war, its inhabitants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
more to Arms then other Spaniards;
the Gentry certainly pretends to an effectual
Gallantry, by continual proteſtations, they are
ambitious of nothing ſo much as drawing their
ſwords in their Kings ſervice: neither are

above a Month in riding about the ſtreets of
<hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> ſometimes on one horſe, ſometimes on

Horſes, his Arms, or his own activity; he asked
whither with ſuch an equipage and arms as his, it

but he met an opportunity of ſhewing
his courage, but was ſo unfortunate, he was at
firſt wounded both in his arm and leg, which
laſt was for ever lamed, and he ever ſince called
the Tooth-drawer. In the mean time if the war
have in ſome manner incomoded this kingdom,
it hath made it richer, for the paſſage of the
forces and rendezvous of Ammunition have
cauſed the Kings money to Roll up and down
in its chief Cities; and having particular privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,

the Gazets of <hi>Paris,</hi> and other written in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
but communicates them not except
to particular friends. He told us that at the time
of the Siege of <hi>Arras,</hi> there came an Order
from <hi>Madrid</hi> to the Magiſtrate of this Town,
to make preparations for a publick rejoycing for
taking a place of ſo great importance. None
doubting to hear very ſodainly of its ſurrender,
Scaffolds were begun to be erected for a fight of
Bulls; before which were half finiſhed, <hi>Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
by a particular Letter underſtood that <hi>Arras</hi>
had been relieved: but not daring to publiſh
ſuch bad news, he (with admiration) ſaw that
work go on, yet could not imagine but the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
and other of the principal Inhabitants had
the ſame intelligence with him, though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for a triumph before a Victory. A while
after, and when all was ready for the Feſtival,
the Viceroy received a Letter from <hi>Madrid</hi>
that the Siege of <hi>Arras</hi> had failed, who ſending
for the Governor and Magiſtrates of the Town,
when he ſhewed them his Letter, they were not
a little ſurpriſed, and for their better ſatisfaction
ſummoned <hi>Miranda,</hi> who acknowledged that
beſides that one of his correſpondents in <hi>Paris</hi>
had acquainted him with it eight dayes before,
he had then with the Gazets, received a Print
which gave all the particulars. One of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
grew very angry and ready to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42656:113"/>
him, that he had not advertiſed them to
prevent the unneceſſary charge, and their being
laughed at by the people, threatning that he
ſhould be made to pay the four or five hundred
pound it had coſt the Town. But the Viceroy,
and ſuch as were more moderate, pacified that
man, and ſent away <hi>Miranda</hi> without ever after
troubling him about it. The people in the mean
time ſeemed more concerned for pulling down
the Scaffolds erected for the Feſtival, than for
the failing in recovery of <hi>Arras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After we had ſojourned eight dayes at <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſſa</hi>
and reſolved to return into <hi>France</hi> rather
by <hi>Navarre</hi> than <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where, as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
was neither ſafety nor convenience for
travailers, we took leave of the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telion,</hi>
who gave us a Letter for the Earl of <hi>St.
Stephen,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Navarre:</hi> the 10th of <hi>July</hi>
we went away, and lodged at <hi>Halagon,</hi> a poor
Village. A Factor of <hi>Miranda</hi> called <hi>Bertrand</hi>
ſerved us as Guide in this Journey, and we had
in our company a Spaniard, a man of parts and
good fellow according to that Countries mode.
He travailed in a very pleaſant equipage; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the faiſhon of <hi>Spain;</hi> his Valiſa he
carried before him on the pummel of his Saddle,
leaning upon it, at each ſide and on his thighs
hung his Wallet of proviſions, inſtead of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
two leathern Caſes contained two bottles
of wine, cooled by ice he put in every time he
filled them: for which reaſon ſuch caſes of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are called <hi>Refread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42656:113"/>
us to refreſh our ſelves with his wine,
which when we excuſed he made uſe of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trand</hi>
(better accuſtomed to ſuch debauches
than we) to bear him company. He told us
many pleaſant ſtories, but I have forgot all but
two gallantries of the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for wit and humour, when Viceroy of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
One day, he ſaid, to revenge himſelf of
a Widow that had been ſomething cruel to him,
and who, he yet knew, was not ſo to every
body, he cauſed a certain Frier ſuſpected to be
well with her, and that was believed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
of her Widowhood, to be watched:
As ſoon as he knew he was in her houſe, he
came, and with his Gards inveſted it, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the door to be opened, for a ſearch that
was important to the Kings ſervice: it was late
in the night, yet the Servants were ſo much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed,
that they let him in whileſt the Monk was
with their Lady, without giving her any notice.
He tarried rallying with her all night, and about
8 in the morning cauſed the reverend Frier to
be taken up behind a Trooper, a Trumpet going
before, which was to make a ſtand at every turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and after ſounding to point him out and
ſay: whoever ſtand in need of a Frier to comfort
Widows at midnight, let them addreſs themſelves
to this Gallant, and they ſhall be accommodated;
afterwards he ſent from Cloyſter to Cloyſter to
enquire which of them had loſt a Frier, and when
diſcovered, returned him to his Abbot, who
was to be intreated at his going to bed to take
with him the Key of that good fellows Cell, leaſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42656:114"/>
he might wander another time. His other ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was, that three Curteſans living at <hi>Naples</hi>
ſo exceſſively proud they hardly bowed
when they met him, he cauſed them one day to
be invited to a Collation; they failed not to come
dreſt to all advantages, but with difference,
as well in that as in their beauties, though alike
proud; ſo that they played the Queens with this
Viceroy, who received them very civily; but
perceiving they became nothing more humble,
be obliged them to undreſs themſelves on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of heat, and being two much ſtreightned
in their clothes, afterwards cauſing many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
to be ſcatte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed in the Chamber, he made
them gather them up without quitting their
Chioppins, whilſt with a Trunck he ſhot
the ſugar pellets ſometimes at one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at another. The Father of this Spaniard
had been the Dukes Servant, and he told us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch tales, which I ſhall not trouble my
ſelf to repeat, they not deſerving it no more
then theſe, which I have ſet down only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Genius of this Nation, very much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with trifles and frothy relations. Beſides
ſuch Gallant Stories which they call <hi>Dounoſas,</hi> or
conceits, they have others that they ſtile He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick,
amongſt which are reckoned all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Apothegms of <hi>Charles</hi> the
fifth, and Reparties of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond: thoſe
of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth they ſay imply Courage, of
<hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond Prudence, of <hi>Philip</hi> the third
Piety, and of <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth Love; but their
greateſt eſteem is for thoſe of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42656:114"/>
whom they take to have been a Prince of the
quickeſt and ſublimeſt fancy: amongſt many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
teſtimonies of which, they with admiration
report this of his wit and liberality. A certain Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugheſe
having brought to his Court a Diamond
of great value, immediately looked on by the
Courtiers as the richeſt Miracle the Eaſt had ever
produced, he not at all moved, beheld it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
which the Portugheſe perceiving, ſaid,
<hi>Sennor ſetenta mille ducados que abrevie en eſte dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
nieto del ſol no ſon de aſquear: Sir, ſeventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Ducats which I have contracted in this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
ofſpring of the ſun are not contemptible;</hi> the
King pleaſed in his confidence, asked what he
thought when he laid out ſo much upon it, and
the crafty Portugheſe anſwered. <hi>That there was
a Philip the ſecond.</hi> This ſublety or flattery was
ſo agreeable, that <hi>Gracian</hi> who relates it in
his <hi>Hero,</hi> adds that the King immediately not
only paid for the Diamond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but gave him more.
<hi>Oſtendando</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>la ſuperioritad de ſu guſto en
el precio y en el premio,</hi> manifeſting the height
of his ſatisfaction in the price and in the reward.
The jollity of this Spaniard, who travalled to
<hi>Biſcai,</hi> hath made me forget to follow my own
way; but having omitted nothing of what I
ſaw or heard, the follies I have now ſet down
may paſs amongſt the reſt. He will give me no
farther occaſion of digreſſion; for we parted
at <hi>Tudela,</hi> a pretty Town, but as ſtanding on the
Frontiers of <hi>Caſtile, Arragon,</hi> and <hi>Biſcay,</hi> a
Neſt of Rogues and Banditi, that have forſaken
their Country to eſcape the puniſhment due to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42656:115"/>
their crimes; yet in ſome parts of it there are
fair buildings, which makes us believe it is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by ſome people of quality amongſt the
exiles. At our going away the Guards pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſtop us, but ſeeing our Paſsport durſt not
perſiſt. We were told that the Cardinal <hi>de Rets,</hi>
after he had eſcaped out of <hi>France,</hi> paſſing from
St. <hi>Sebaſtians</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>Valentia,</hi>
where he intended to embark for <hi>Italy,</hi> was
ſtayed and very ſtreightly garded in this City.
He came in a Litter with a ſmall Train, and
the Alcalde who was then walking on the Bridge,
ſent to demand who he was, but he unwilling
to be known, refuſed to tell his name and quality,
upon which the Alcalde ſet a Guard upon him
in the Inn where he alighted. This ſurpriſed
him, and he knew not what to think of ſuch
uſage in a Countrey where he thought he had
ſecured the liberty lately recovered, and that he
ſhould not have loſt it as ſoon as he began to
relliſh it: he therefore diſpatched one of his
Servants to <hi>Pampeluna,</hi> with a letter of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
to the Viceroy, deſiring him to puniſh the
inſolence of that Judge, and deliver him out
of his hands: The Alcalde in the mean time
ſent to the Viceroy and Council of <hi>Navarre</hi> a
formal Narrative of what he had done, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the duty of his place, hoping ſo to avoid
the blame might be laid upon him; for having
acted rather on account of humor and curioſity,
then reaſon and judgment: then he had no other
advantage by his Letter, than the preventing the
Cardinals enlargement one day, becauſe the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42656:115"/>
Viceroy was obliged to aſſemble the Council of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> where the puniſhment of the Alcaldes
inſolence was reſolved on, and he turned out of
his place, and for ſome time baniſhed the Town,
where the Cardinal as ſoon as known received
many civilities, and at his going away was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the principal Inhabitants with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and honour. At that time came news that
the <hi>French</hi> had ſtormed the lines, and beaten the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> from before <hi>Arras,</hi> but he maintained
ſo effectually that this was impoſſible, that he left
in all places where he came a contrary impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which continues ſtill amongſt thoſe people.
<hi>Pedro Miranda,</hi> or ſome that belonged to him,
being then at <hi>Tudela,</hi> ſhewed him Letters of it
received from <hi>Paris,</hi> but he perſiſted. One
may eaſily perceive he endeavoured to cajole
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by this flattery, not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
that time would deſtroy it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> provided it
obtained him the better reception in his paſſage,
and made them ſenſible that he had intirely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
himſelf in their intereſts.</p>
            <p>The 12th of <hi>July</hi> we dined at <hi>Laboroſſo,</hi> and
traverſed <hi>Olitor,</hi> where the antient Kings of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
kept their Court and ſomething of their
Palace ſtill remains, though the Town be now
a miſerable Place, ruined by warrs between the
true Inheritors of the Crown, and ſuch as inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them: we lay at <hi>Teſſalia,</hi> a good Town,
and its Territory more fertil than the reſt we
had paſſed. Next day we came to <hi>Pampeluna,</hi>
the capital City of that Kingdom, it ſtands at
the end of a large Plain that ſeems but barren;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42656:116"/>
it is near the <hi>Pireneans,</hi> yet out of command of
any eminence. Its Citadel, ſo famous in the
world, looks towards the Plain, and is on one
ſide environed by a great Marais. The Town is
not conſiderably fortified, and the ground it ſtands
on hath many little riſings and deſcents ſcarcely
perceptible: there is a large Piazza where the
Bulls are fought. The people are clowniſh,
much addicted to ſmall Traffick, which they free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough exerciſe with <hi>France,</hi> and as if there
were no war between the two Crowns: We ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at the end of a Fair, and met many French
Merchants: we tarried here three dayes as well
becauſe of the indiſpoſition of my Lord—
not well recovered of the Fevor he got at <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſſa</hi>
as that one of our horſes were lame. The
mean while we viſited the Earl of <hi>St. Stephen,</hi>
Viceroy and Captain General of this Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and delivered him the Letter we brought for
him; he is a little man very civil, and no leſs cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of all rarities. He received us well,
and ordered the Captain of his Guards to ſhew
us the Citadel in the afternoon. Between the
Town and Citadel is a ſpacious place ſet with
trees for Walks: it hath five Baſtions, and was
built by <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond with a great deal of
conſideration, as a ſtrong Rampier againſt
<hi>France:</hi> the Baſtions are covered with Stone,
the Grafts large, in moſt parts of them water;
it hath no Outworks, neither doth it need any,
becauſe of the Marais on that ſide where it may
moſt eaſily be attacked: it ſtands on a Rock, but
though the moſt important place of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42656:116"/>
and the only one that can hinder the
<hi>French</hi> from marching to <hi>Madrid,</hi> after they
have paſſed the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> it is not well looked
after. The works in many places want repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the Garriſon is very inconſiderable,
there being few Souldiers, for want of which
the Country people are to come in on the firſt
ſummons: of whom they then had ſent for a
good number, and mixed them with the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
that we might not perceive that want:
but we could eaſily diſtinguiſh, ſo little had they
the meen of Sword-men, ſome of them not
wearing any, and parading with a Musket only,
or an old Pike, which they handled ſo ill, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
they were more accuſtomed to the Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fork.
The Body of the place is well deſigned,
for in the middle of the Bracks where the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
lodge, there is a great round place to draw
up in Battaglia, from whence by five broad ſtreets
they may march ſtreight to the five Baſtions.</p>
            <p>They ſhewed us the Magazins not very well
furniſhed either with ammunition or victual, and
a very fair Towr built to keep powder, of which
it is altogether unprovided, and ſerves for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for greateſt Criminals; they ſhewed a very
fine Handmill for turning which they may alſo
make uſe of horſes. It is the beſt Engin in its
kind that I have ſeen, it hath 4 or 5 Wheels and
as many Bins, in each of which they ſaid they
could in one day grind 24 load of Corn: but this
I thought impoſſible. I told them that ſo great a
Body compoſed of ſo many different pieces,
could hardly move long without being diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42656:117"/>
and conſequently uſeleſe, and that unleſs
the Artiſt that made it laſted as long as the Mill,
nothing amiſs in it could be amended, becauſe
I took it to be a particular invention, and that
none but himſelf knew the Fabrick, and all the
Springs, ſo as to ſet them right when broken;
but they replied they ſucceſſivly kept one that
underſtood it, who, that they might never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute,
ſtill taught ſome Apprentice. Here are
two or three Ponds, as they ſay, derived from
Springs. There were not many Sentries on the
Rampart, nor at the Canon. It hath a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Governor, that immediately depends on the
King: He was abſent, but we were very civily
received by his Lieutenant, who after he had
led us about the Walls gave us a Collation; his
frankneſs pleaſed us, and we perceived that as
by degrees we got farther from the Gravity of
<hi>Caſtile,</hi> and ſeverity of <hi>Arragon,</hi> as little open
to one another as to Strangers, we approached
a more ſociable Country.</p>
            <p>Nothing elſe being to be ſeen in the Caſtle,
that we might not treſpaſs on the Lieutenants
civility, nor tire that of the Viceroys Captain of
his Gard, we took leave of the firſt, expreſſing
our ſatisfaction in his reception, and went
with the other to our Coach. Next day we
returned thanks to the Viceroy, and finding him
at leiſure, had opportunity to diſcourſe with
him more particularly than at our firſt viſit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a knowing perſon, and one of the Councils
of State and Warre, he preſently fell upon the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42656:117"/>
Government of the Low-Countries, making it
appear he underſtood thoſe affairs very well.
He told us afterwards that the Earl of <hi>Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa</hi>
was his near Kinſman, and we could do no
leſs than expreſs the eſteem we had for ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
a perſon one of the ableſt Miniſters
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to whom we had eſpecially been
recommended; ſo we took our leaves. The
15th in the Morning when we were about to take
horſe, that we might get that night to the laſt
Village of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Dominions in the
upper <hi>Navarre,</hi> a Servant of the Viceroys Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of his Guards came to enquire, if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Gloves, which he thought he left in our
Chamber the day before, had been found: we
ordered ſearch to be made every where, and ſent
him with my Lord—s <hi>valet de Chambre;</hi>
but having long looked for what had never been
loſt he went away, and by his meen and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
made us well enough comprehend, he
came not on that account, but to try, if we would
ſend him ſome pairs of thoſe perfumed ones we
had in our Valiſes, and that were mentioned in
our Paſſes: but none being deafer than they
which will not hear, we let him go, without
ſeeming to underſtand him. But this ſerved not
our turn; for thinking we were not ingenious
enough to do ſo, he ſent back his man with a very
bad compliment, in plain terms to beg <hi>de los no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtros
guantes de Ambar.</hi> We were amazed at this,
and our Valiſes being on the Horſes, and our
ſelves ready to mount, let him ſee how trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
it would be to take them off, and open
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42656:118"/>
them, but that if he pleaſed we would write to
our Merchant in <hi>Madrid</hi> to ſend him as many
pair as he deſired. We thus freed our ſelves
with all dexterity poſſible, not thinking we had
done any thing contrary to civility, ſince he that
demands too boldly, and without conſideration,
ought to take to himſelf the greateſt part of the
ſhame of a refuſal Having thus got out of <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelone,</hi>
we took the great Road of the <hi>Pyreneans</hi>
that leads to <hi>France.</hi> We were not far from the
Town ere we began to aſcend a hill, and before
we came to the next Village met ſome Souldiers
that belonged to the Garriſon of the Caſtle,
who begged, which ſurpriſed me, for though the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> wants money, yet he never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
with the forty thouſand Crowns they ſay the
Kingdom of <hi>Navarre</hi> brings up, and I have been
aſſured that all that is levied, though it exceed
the ſum I have ſpoken of, remains in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to pay the Viceroy, who hath a Salary of 10
thouſand Crowns (though he of <hi>Arragon</hi> hath
but ſix) for the entertainments of a Preſident and
ſix Counſellors, and maintaining his Forts and
Gariſons.</p>
            <p>They which know this kingdom, averr that
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> receives no advantage from
it, beſides the ſecuring and extending his fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
even to the Pyreneans, the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
barricade God hath placed between <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Spain:</hi> yet were the Taxes levied here as
in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> he might draw ſomething. But
the priviledges the people of <hi>Navarre</hi> reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to themſelves, and the conſideration that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42656:118"/>
if they ſhould rebel, they might poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the obedience of their natural Prince,
for whom yet they have inclinations,
ſon is the reaſon they are not preſſed with
Taxes; ſo that the certaineſt Leavies for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the publick charge come from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
and are reported to be 24 thouſand
Crowns; but the avarice and deceit of thoſe
that finger the Money, raiſed there for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Gariſons that ought to be better
paid then any others in <hi>Spain,</hi> reduce the poor
ſoldiers to beggery, and cauſe the Kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to be ſo much neglected, that were an
Army ſent thither, it would probably make ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great progreſſion. It is true, that if we except
the inconveniences they would give the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> there is not expectation enough of
advantages from that Quarter to cauſe the
beſt Troops to be ſent thither, which might
more profitably be imployed in <hi>Flanders, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
or <hi>Catalonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before our arrival at <hi>Burguette,</hi> we rather
baited then dined at a pitiful village, where
the Guardian looked on our Paſſes with a great
deal of civility, and diſcourſed with us of the
times in which he had ſerved in <hi>Flanders</hi> un-Marquis
<hi>Spinola.</hi> Having traverſed Woods, Hills,
and Valleys with ſometimes good ſometimes bad
way; we arrived in the evening at the Plain of
<hi>Roncevalles,</hi> famous for the great battle <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi>
fought, and loſt in it, againſt the Sarazens.
My Lords—and—ſpurring on, got
to <hi>Burguette</hi> before it was dark: They had much
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42656:119"/>
ado to find lodging, and were fain to adreſs
themſelves to the Juſtice, who ordered them
to be entertained in the houſe where we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the night. The next day being the 6th of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> without much ſuffering by heat in ſo wide
a Plain, encompaſſed by the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
it, and by ſome Merchants of <hi>Oleron</hi> that
often paſs it, were ſhewed the place where the
battle was fought; here ſaid they <hi>Roland</hi> was
killed, notwithſtanding the force of his Lance;
where this Croſs ſtands, died the brave <hi>Renaldo,</hi>
and had we been curious of all that tradition,
true or falſe, had taught them, I believe they
would have pointed out to us where every one
of the 12 Peers of <hi>France</hi> fell, and perhaps
have ſhewed us ſome of their blood, for that
of <hi>Hero</hi>'s never periſhes, and they went about
to perſwade us, that one place is ſtill Red with
it; but we, whoſe curioſity never went ſo
low as to buſie it ſelf about dumb objects, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on thoſe things only as we paſſed by, and
went not a ſtep out of our way to taſte the air
where they ſaid ſo great perſons had rendred,
or vomited, the prodigious ſouls that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
bodies ranked amongſt the antient Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.
Spurred on by impatience to be quickly
beyond the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> we haſted over this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
or Hiſtorical Valley; Coming to the
end of it, we found a Mountain, to whom it
gives the name of <hi>Roncevalles;</hi> we were told
this was the higheſt of the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> yet there
was no ſnow on the top of it, though moſt of
the other on our right hand had hoary heads;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42656:119"/>
but notwithſtanding this, it ſeemed to approach
nearer Heaven then thoſe that wore its Livery;
and that it changed colour betimes, and in the
beginning of the Summer, by reaſon of the ſeas
neighbourhood; the acrimony of whoſe vapors
aids to melt and diſſipate its ſnow ſooner then
that of ſuch as are more remote. When we
were at the heighth of the Mountain of <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cevalles,
Egregia contemplatione pavimus animum;</hi>
and we pauſed to conſider, on the one hand
<hi>Spain,</hi> that we had juſt then abandoned, and on
the other <hi>France,</hi> which we were about to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The firſt ſeemed a ſcorched Campania,
where the bald Mountains diſcovered only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Rocks, and concealed few Plains or Vallies
that bore graſs, or any thing elſe that is uſeful.
The later on the contrary preſented us a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
where Nature had diſpoſed eminencies and
depreſſions, Plains, Hills, Woods, and Valleys,
to boaſt variety on a fair Theater of univerſal
fertility, ſo plentiully ſowed, that the Land we
ſaw, though none of the beſt of <hi>France,</hi> was
ſurprizingly delightful, as ſoon as compared
with that we had left. To conclude, without
hyperbole or exaggeration, and in a plain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of deſcribing things as they really are, I
muſt declare, that contemplating two ſo differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
objects; me thought that in the one the day
of judgement would find little unburnt; and
that in the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the flames which ſhall cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the worlds Funeral, would be laſt extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
becauſe it ſeemed the fire of Heaven
had already fallen on the firſt, and almoſt roſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42656:120"/>
it; and that to the other, it had imparted
only a cheriſhing warmth to animate it: and
the <hi>Italian</hi> perhaps had reaſon, who vexed at
the Doctors that diſputed about the ſeat of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
ſaid, he wondred men of learning
ſhould be ſo ignorant, for had they underſtood
Maps, they would have placed that of <hi>Europe</hi>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that of <hi>Africk</hi> in <hi>Lybia.</hi> I ſhall
not determine whither he ſpoke ſenſe, or raved,
but only add, that what I have ſaid of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of theſe two proſpects; takes not off
my eſteem for <hi>Spain,</hi> nor hinders my admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the wiſdom, temperance, prudence, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moral and political virtues, that are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in the greateſt part of the men it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
it is not therefore out of contempt of the
one, or too elevated an <hi>Idea</hi> of the other,
that I regiſter the difference I obſerved: I know
very well that the fatteſt ſoils are not ever moſt
beneficial, neither do they always produce the
greateſt perſonages. The ableſt of all the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
was born amongſt the rocks of <hi>Ithaca;</hi>
and in <hi>Provence</hi> there is a certain nook, called
<hi>la Crau,</hi> covered with Flint, whith its Lord will
not exchange for any other that abounds with
Fruits and Flowers, becauſe in that very ſeat
of barrenneſs there grows an herb of ſuch vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
that one twig of it is worth many handfuls
of thoſe of the moſt luxurious meddows; this
makes appear, that fruits of perfecteſt ſavor
often abound in the defectiv'ſt foils, and that
though <hi>Spain</hi> be lean and dry, ſhe is yet ſtrong
and vigorous: and experience teaches, that the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42656:120"/>
Spaniards are ſtouter and more capable of great
fatique, then ſuch as are born in more pleaſant
and plentiful Countreys, and even amongſt
themſelves, the moſt couragious Races flouriſh
amongſt Rocks and Mountains, and in the ſandieſt
Provinces; the other being inhabited by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
neither of ſo warlike ſpirits, nor elevated
fancies, puſillanimity being almoſt always the
companion of fertility; and the Romans were
ſcarce ever more put to it, then in the conqueſt
of this nation; its invincible courage, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of paſſage, ſcarſity of Proviſions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of heat, predominating, almoſt through the
whole peninſula, reſiſted them Sixſcore years;
neither could it in leſs time be overcome in our
age, were it ſtill as populous as formerly.</p>
            <p>But ere I give over, and that I may do <hi>Spain</hi>
right before I looſe the ſight of it; I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that this ſterility and penury objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, is not cauſed ſo much by the default
(if I may ſo ſpeak) of the Countrey, as by that
of its inhabitants; were they more induſtrious,
and inſtead of feeding themſelves with ſmoak
and vanity in their wretched Cabins, tilled bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Land, and contemned not mechanick
Arts, ſhe would be a liberal mother of all things
neceſſary for life, whither to cloath or feed them,
and they might have Corn, Wine, Oyl, and
all manner of fruits, to ſuffice them, without
being beholding to their neighbors; and did
they underſtand Husbandry, or would apply
themſelves to it, it would maintain them in
ſuch abundance, that not only the more fertile
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42656:121"/>
Provinces would ſupply the ſterility of ſome that
are barrener, but they might vent part to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers,
wools of <hi>Segovia,</hi> Silks of <hi>Grenada,</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovans
of <hi>Ciudad Rodrigo;</hi> the Flax and Hemp
of <hi>Andaluſia;</hi> the Iron and Copper of <hi>Biſcai,</hi>
with many other rich diſpoils of its Cattle, Land,
and Mines, might croud its Cities with Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and fill them with the beſt manufactures of
<hi>Europe;</hi> but they ſend theſe abroad unwrought,
which when Forrainers have metamorphoſed
and diſpoſed to humane uſe, part return to them
from thoſe who double the money they firſt
paid for them.</p>
            <p>I have now paſſed the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> and top of
the high mountain that ſeparates <hi>France</hi> from
<hi>Spain,</hi> and whilſt I contemplated thoſe two
great Kingdoms, having ventured to compare
their Climates, and contract as in one maſs all
the remarks of my journey; I will conclude by
ſetting againſt each other the cuſtoms and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks
of this neighbouring people; no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
then the motions that cauſe fire to mount
and earth to deſcend. Whilſt I ſtayed at <hi>Madrid</hi>
I uſed my utmoſt endeavor to diſcover; if the
antipathy reported to be ſo natural and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
were really and ſubſtantially as ſtrong as
it ſeems, and is imagined; but I found that the
contrariety attributed to their humors, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
whither publick or private, proceeds
rather from ſeveral tempers and Genius's, then
any true and real antipathy that renders the
French more incompatible with Spaniards, then
with Engliſhmen, Germans, Italians, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42656:121"/>
nations every one of which hath its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
character and ſpecifick impreſſion, as well
in body as mind, which may (if I be permitted
the expreſſion) be called its principle of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
If beſides this common and general vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
proceeding from the Air we firſt breath,
there be any more expreſs and formal between
one people and another; it is cauſed by ſome
accidents, conjunctures or other circumſtances,
which as to contempt and hatred have the ſame
influence on nations as on particular perſons,
who (that excepted) have no more of contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
then two Rivers that run different courſes,
and ever follow their Channel with equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
though not always with the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity.
This granted, I averre, that beſides
competition of power and State of Rivalſhip, in
which theſe people have ſo long continued, and
which have been animated by many wars and
differences not yet reconciled or ended, no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
can be obſerved between them, more
then each of them hath with all others: and
when theſe conſiderations have bern removed,
and the cauſes of averſion of State for State, and
publick animoſities have ceaſed they have lived
as well one with another, as either of them hath
done with other forrainers. My ſelf have ſeen
very many French inhabiting <hi>Madrid,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragoſſa,</hi>
who not concerning themſelves in the
intereſt of their Countrey, agree very well with
the Spaniards; and the Catalonians and Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes
give convincing teſtimonies of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
All the world knows that theſe renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42656:122"/>
the Catholick Kings Dominion, and abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
with the fealty they owed him, all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of the Spaniſh Monarchy, there followed
ſo great confidence and correſpondence between
them and <hi>France,</hi> that notwithſtanding diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of humors, they have reciprocally been as
well received and looked upon at <hi>Paris</hi> and
<hi>Lisbon</hi> as they could be at <hi>Stockholme</hi> or <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovia,</hi>
where I ſuppoſe no man will imagin any
antipathy for either of them: the former of
theſe wheeled a little more, and caſt themſelves
into the arms of <hi>France,</hi> the difference of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
and inclinations not preventing their
correſponding as well as <hi>Spaniards, Neapolitans</hi>
and <hi>Flemings.</hi> It is only ſince that emulation of
glory, which beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n with the advancement of
the Spaniſh Empire under <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> increaſed
under the <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Succeſſors, that theſe people cannot
brook one another either in publick or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and that have added to the difference of
their tempers and natures, a ſpirit of envy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and contempt, which make them incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible.
For one of them is not only reſerved
and ſpeculative, but impatient of the gay and
ſociable humor of the other; one of them is
not only ſlow and dilatory, but cannot ſuffer the
others activity and brisk temper; one of them
is not only ſatisfied to walk as if he counted his
ſteps, but cannot abide the others negligent and
interrupted gate: one of them does not only
ſalute by leaning backwards, but ſcoffs at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when he bows to do it. In a word one of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42656:122"/>
them hath neither humor nor cuſtom that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes
not the other, and which he blames not
out of the principles of jealouſie and ambition I
have formerly mentioned.</p>
            <p>Theſe different qualities cauſed and height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
by that emulation of grandeur, and thirſt
of precedence, that hath ſo long tormented them,
and coſt Chriſtendom ſo much blood, are the
ſourſes of the diverſity of their Politicks. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all which one of them ſometimes
borrows ſomething of the nature and qualities
of the other, and imitates ſome of its moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
tracings; but the hand and pencil ever differ:
neither is it poſſible ſo to ſettle other mens
clothes on our own backs, that it will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
they were not made for us. There is
ever ſomething in their manner of acting, which
makes apparent its principles are no more the
ſame then its agents. They which have read
the famous conteſt between Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth
and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and obſerved the forms and
ends of thoſe great Potentates, for glory and
intereſt, may find a manifeſt proof of this verity.
It is moſt certain that in their Politicks they
now and then tread in one anothers footſteps;
but it is more ſo, that their pace is never equal
which way ſoever they go. <hi>Spain</hi> is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Chariot, ſeated on a Throne of Tortois-ſhell,
drawn by Remora's, who in tedious tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
vaſt ſpaces of time, loſe many opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities:
yet her extraordinary patience and cloſe
application to the game, with her skill in pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cards, oftentimes diſturbs the deſignes of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42656:123"/>
the craftieſt Gameſters. When at more violent
exerciſes ſhe never ſtumbles by too much haſte,
ſhe waits the rebound of the ball, and if ſhe
miſſes it, is ſatisfied to have judged it well, and
not to have loſt her ſtroke by precipitation, and
giving it before it came to ground. By a vaſt
ſpeculation ſhe embraces the whole extent of
an object, diſcovers the moſt minute parts of it,
all its joynts and muſcles; and if ſhe makes not
her ſelf Miſtreſs of it, it is never becauſe ſhe
miſtook the moſt advantageous part of lay hold
on, but becauſe too intent in ſtudying the hour
and moment, which either paſſes over, or is
ſnatched away whilſt ſhe waits for it, or delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
on it.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledged that this misfortune
doth not often happen to her in her Council-Chamber,
nor in ſuch affairs as depend on ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations
only. Of all parts of the art of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
ſhe ſucceeds beſt in this, where her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
fixed on all circumſtances are very
happy, here ſhe makes appear the ingenious
Fabrick of thoſe artificial Springs which give
motion to a ſlow and circumſpect proceeding,
that ſecures her of a good effect in what ever
ſhe hath leiſure and time to manage. But in the
field, and affairs of warre, where ſhe hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time nor liberty to comply with a long and
mature deliberation, ſuch occaſions as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eaſily ſuffer this, and where oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
muſt be anticipated, and more uſually
left to hazard and fortune, than to prudence and
reaſon, ſhe hath not the like advantage, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42656:123"/>
comes ſo ſhort in her reckoning, that ſhe
ſees her moſt important deſignes periſh becauſe
begun too late, and her ſelf deceived in the hour
ſhe deſtined for their bringing forth. I will
not be buſie about examples of this truth; for,
beſides the Siege of <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> (the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of raiſing which ſhe loſt by delaying to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it as ſoon as it was begun, and where
ſhe pretended ſo much to force and Council, that
ſhe at laſt employed neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but in order to receiving a more publick
affront) the late warrs might furniſh us teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
ſo well known to all the world, that it were
to no purpoſe to inſert them here.</p>
            <p>But I will add that this gravity, and two great
circumſpection, which ſometimes makes the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> fall by endeavouring to fix their feet
more ſteadily, is in a manner recompenſed by a
very conſiderable quality, which is an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
conſtancy after misfortunes that have
been almoſt deſtructive to her, and an inceſſant
perſeverance with indefatigable vigor to purſue
all advantages after good ſucceſs. If we conſider
the rude trials of this to which ſhe hath been
expoſed by inſurrections of ſo many people, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
of one of her richeſt Provinces, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Kingdom; if we obſerve the great
ſhocks ſhe hath received both by land and ſea,
from the Armies of ſo many Princes allied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her, and examine the many Battails ſhe
hath loſt, we ſhall find cauſe enough of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that ſhe is ſtill on her feet, and that it is a
grandeur altogether peculiar to that Nation, to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42656:124"/>
endure, ſo much without fainting, and that no
other ſtomach could digeſt ſo many hard mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
without loſs of appetite: that any thing of
which remains is alone to be imputed to that
gentle and natural heat which acts without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation,
and ſuffers without alteration what
it can neither concoct nor evacuate, caſting it
on time and a more favourable conjuncture:
I mean that her policies are ſo pliable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
that if her expedients and power often
fail, her heart never does ſo, though contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating
her condition, ſhe hath nothing many
times to comfort her, but patience, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertues as ſhe ever makes uſe of both in
Field and Cabinet, how low ſoever. Neither
hath ſhe been wont to give ove a loſer, how
unfortunate ſoever, ſeldom abandoning the gave
and hope of revenge. Though ſhe lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the liberty of the United Provinces,
and renounced her right to diſpute it, it was not
till after a war of fourſcore years, nor without
that abſolute neceſſity which obliges of two evils
to chooſe the leaſt, ſo that we cannot inferre
from it ſhe was ſick at heart, nor that ſhe often
regorges what ſhe hath once ſwallowed. And
perhaps if ſhe ever diſengages her ſelf from the
many tyes that reſtrain her, and gets leiſure to
make a free uſe of her power and wiſdom, it will
appear ſhe laied not aſide the Cards, but becauſe
ſhe had too many Gameſters upon her hand, and
that ſhe will reaſſume them with this proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that there is no preſcription to Soveraigns;
and that the ſolemneſt Othes, if contrary to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42656:124"/>
thoſe of their Coronation oblige them not, and
that there may as well happen to them as to the
honeſt Caſuiſt, a certain apprehenſion that may
diſpenſe with their making good their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>If we conſider on the other ſide (to return to
what I have ſaid of the equality of their vigour
in proſperity) how we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
to make uſe of the favours of fortune, and
all their advantages, when heaven hath compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with that circumſpection and remote fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
according to which they act, we muſt needs
acknowledge all other policies come ſhort of
theirs, being boldeſt, activeſt, and moſt vigilant
after good ſucceſs, that beſt purſue the gain of
a battail, and carefulleſt ſecure a Town after its
ſurrender, that moſt aptly impoſe fetters on Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
they have conquered, or reduced to their
ancient ſubjection, if ſtraied from it; and that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than any other accommodate to their own
intereſts, thoſe of the Princes allied with them;
(in a word) that after victory are more ſolicitous
to gather all the fruits that can be derived from
it, and draw all the good conſequences it can
poſſibly afford. Others in proſperity languiſh,
and their induſtry ſtackens after conqueſt, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
rather to enjoy the fruits of their good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
than to make an advantageous uſe of it,
and to loſe the honor and profit of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
actions, then not to repoſe and take breath
at the end of the courſe. Such politicks belong
only to thoſe that have better arms then heads,
and that value not the Priſe ſo much as the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42656:125"/>
Race, nor Crowns and Triumphs as Battails and
Victories; I mean that preferre the way before
the end, and great actions above the felicities
they lead to.</p>
            <p>To the two high advantages I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Politicks, derived from the
great circumſpection that attends them, a third
may be added, which is that whenſoever they
have any deſign in hand, they can ſo ſecretly
give it maturity, that nothing is diſcovered of it
till at once it ſurpriſes and aſhoniſhes. They
work under ground, and with much care that
nothing of their deſign takes vent, leaſt which
may be diſcovered by their meen &amp; countenance
they counterfeit ſleep when moſt awake, at Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and ready to diſcharge, and (though at other
times very jealous of reputation) are not then
diſpleaſed to have their power decried, nor to
be accuſed of weakneſs, that ſuch erroneous
judgment may cauſe their enemies ſo much to
neglect ſtanding on their Gard, they may take
them unprovided and overthrow thoſe that think
them to be in a condition neither to attacque, nor
defend themſelves. Shadowed by ſuch ſecreſie,
and ſecured by ſuch artifice, they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
very ſodainly advanced, and paſſing by
the conqueſt of all <hi>Sicilia,</hi> it is known that in
our daies they have ſucceſsfully done this, and
when leaſt apprehended appeared before <hi>Tarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
and <hi>Lerida</hi> with more forces then they were
thought to be Maſters of. In a word they have
ever been ſecret to admiration and ſo excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practiſed in that politick diſſimulation, ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42656:125"/>
in governing, and that can ſo well aid it
ſelf with diſguiſe, that they have often by it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
ſuch effects, as by force they could never
have arrived at. And when theſe little Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
fail of ſucceſs in warr, they have recourſe
to Treaties and Conferences, where they ſo
dexterouſly make uſe of them, that in one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or other they gain all advantages can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from them. On account of which I muſt
needs take notice, that they obtain the better
in Negotiations, by means alone of that flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and extraordinary patience, that tires and
quenches the heat of other people, leading
them about through ſo many labyrinths, that at
laſt weary of conferring ſo long, and concluding
nothing, they comply with part of what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
and perhaps in concluſion yield to the reſt,
ſo to purchaſe that repoſe <hi>Spain</hi> ſeems ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to grant them, becauſe ſenſible of their
weakneſs, and that they purſue with impatience
whatſoever they have once hoped for.</p>
            <p>Thus by a judicious obſtinacy they oftentimes
overcome the greateſt oppoſition againſt what
they deſign, and by compliance poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of what they cannot obtain by conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But to ſtay no longer on conſideration of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies
that have within themſelves turnings and
windings very particular, I will only add that it
is conceived ſomething might be amended in
their Catholicon, I mean in that exceſs of zeal,
real or pretended, they make appear in matters
of Religion. It is very evident that this fire
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42656:126"/>
ſometimes warms <hi>Spain</hi> to its prejudice, and may
ſooner conſume her, than convince thoſe ſhe
would by it win to her intereſts: And no leſs
known that the Popes are not kinder to her on
this account, but ſuſpect her paſſion for the
Church of an humane infirmity, that ſtretches
toward heaven only to grow higher upon earth:
and that ſhe gains no friends intirely, but a
ſhare only of their inclinations, by thoſe wayes
that make her real enemies, that have a perfect
hatred and averſion for her. In a word her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
deſigne, and to which ſhe ſeems engaged
as by oath not to ſuffer Proteſtants in her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and to perſecute them in their own, is
a ſtate ſecret that hath been ſo well examined
by Catholicks, that its true price and value is
ſufficiently underſtood by them, and no leſs by
thoſe againſt whom it is directed, which cauſes
them to apprehend, that on ſuch ſpecious
principles, ſhe engages to their ruine, to ſatisfie
her ambition, and that high aim of which ſhe
is accuſed, by uniting in one body ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Dominions, to become head of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
In the mean time the preſent compoſure
of <hi>Europe,</hi> and form of the eſtabliſhment of
Chriſtianity conſidered, ſhe ought to caſt off this
thought, and recollect that the two parties into
which it is divided, are almoſt equal, and if they
ſhould come to a ſhock with the Body of their
Forces, victory would a long time hover incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
which ſide to take, and perhaps not hers,
though ſeconded by all the Roman Legions.
She ought to underſtand her <hi>Catholicon</hi> to be but
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42656:126"/>
a thin viſard to her <hi>Ragione di ſtato</hi> that it hath
often diſcovered the ſecret, which hath been
known every where; and to examine how ſmall
the advantages are of following Maxims that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate
one party, and gain not the other. My
meaning, is ſhe ſhould confine her ſelf within the
limits of temporal intereſt, without mixing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
with it, which deſcended not from heaven
to deſtroy Society, and that it will nothing avail
her to make ſo many ſignes of the croſs, againſt
Proteſtants. Let her therefore permit them to
live, and living with them make them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
ſhe hath abſolved her ſelf from that vow
(at leaſt if there were any ſuch) which obliged
her on all occaſions to endeavour their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and that of their Church. From ſuch a
change of conduct ſhe would derive two great
advantages, for ſhe would be more conſiderable
at <hi>Rome</hi> by ſeeming leſs attached to the intereſts
of that Court, and more redoubted by <hi>France,</hi>
by diverting part of the inclination of thoſe of
the Reformed Religion, which it believes it ſelf
alone poſſeſſes, with excluſion of all other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Princes, never giving teſtimonies of open
hatred, nor perſecuting with fire and fagot, that
which ought to be the object only of prayer and
perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>Having drawn ſome lines of the nature and
qualities of the Spaniſh policies, it remains that I
give ſuch a draught of thoſe of the French, as
may diſcover part of their extent and Forces, that
by comparing them we may judge which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to get the better of its rival: The later are
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42656:127"/>
ſo variable, and of a form ſo tranſient, that
hours and moments, which ever fly, have no
ſwifter revolution; and the former are as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and appropriated to fixation; it is very
difficult to paint the one becauſe of the rapidity
of its courſe, and no leſs ſo to determine which
of the two is more potent, by reaſon of the
continual conflict they have ſo long ſtrugled in,
without yielding on either ſide. One would
think they had divided between them all the
skill of the Fencing-ſchool, and that the one
comes on with better grace, and hath its arm
more ſupple, but that the other reaches farther,
and makes its thruſt more home: Thus Heaven
to preſerve the power of theſe Nations near an
equality, hath oppoſed to the vivacity and ſpirit
of one of them the prudence and conſtancy of
the other, that what the laſt comes ſhort in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility,
may be recompenſed by its attention to
all it undertakes; and what the firſt wants of
circumſpection and patience may be ſupplied by
incredible diligence.</p>
            <p>It is yet probable that the <hi>French</hi> fire ſo allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as not to daſle the judgment, produces grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
effects than the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eam, how conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſoever. It is capable of all that is Heroick
even to miracle, it forces an alteration in the
face of affairs, and chains fortune and victory to
attend its banners; when they ſeem inclining to
forſake it. It is as quick in diſcovering and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
miſchiefs as in applying remedies to
thoſe that ſurpriſe it. Its eye, hand, and heart
are continually directed to what may help or
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42656:127"/>
hurt it; the firſt is uſefull to embrace or avoid,
the ſecond to ſeiſe whatever is advantagious, and
repel all that may be fatal, whilſt the laſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
to ſupport all burthens, and often attains
what its ſtrength could not extend to, whilſt
with all three it on one ſide levels a way for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
and baniſhes it, and on the other opens
a door to ſucceſs and meets it: Whereas the
profound intellect of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by means of
froſty irreſolution and tedious deliberation, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the fruits of its beſt Enterpriſes to be nipt in
the bloſſom, becauſe not ſo diligent to execute
as ſubtle to invent them. I could draw examples
from our preſent times concluſive enough of this
truth, if I were not deſirous to make an end. I
will therefore only add that that I am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible,
that the <hi>French</hi> airineſs often cauſes
their deſignes to miſcarry, that their diligence
is not alwayes joyned with prudence, and that
it ſometimes haſtens with ſo little diſcourſe and
reflexion, it obſerves nothing, and as if it had
no other members but hands and feet, violently
plunges into confuſion, and falls headlong into
misfortune, by reaſon of that precipitation which
often aſtoniſhes, and puts it beſides it ſelf, ſo
much that its great courage abandoning it, it
retreats in diſorder. The reproach of this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
much out of date, by reaſon of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
modern great and couragious actions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes,
where it hath made appear a diligence
in executions, as little deſtitute of judgement
as courage.</p>
            <p>This was long ago, when experience had not
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42656:128"/>
purified their fire, nor moderated that exceſs
of it which made them begin well and end ill,
on which account all they did was attributed to
furie and a blind tranſport, that after the firſt
attempt was changed into fear: but they are
no more the ſame men, neither, after going on
like Lions, do they come off like Hares; and
when their enterpriſes fail of ſucceſs, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times retreat with honor, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
And certainly the greateſt promptitude
when accompanied by reaſon and judgement is
as often the Mother as Stepdame of good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
<hi>Alexander</hi> conquered all becauſe he would
leave nothing for the morrow; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
but a moment between deliberation and
action, apprehending that either the greatneſs
of the deſign might diſcourage it, or the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
be paſſed if he took time to examine it:
but as the celerity of theſe two Heroes was ever
fortunate, by reaſon of their prodigious Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
in all they undertook, and the circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and delays of <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> and the
great <hi>Gonſalvo</hi> re-eſtabliſhed Empire, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered

Nations, according as their predominant humor
is allaied by prudence, and illuminated by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
can diſgeſt the tougheſt morſels, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culteſt

<hi>Auguſtus</hi> had felt the pulſe of both of them
when he pronounced his <hi>Feſtina lente:</hi> and we
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42656:128"/>
may infallibly conclude that a third Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
participating of the <hi>French</hi> promptitude and
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſolidity, were alone capable not only
of conquering the World but governing it. And
a great and wiſe Frenchman having owned

<hi>England</hi> purſuing her true intereſt will become
a third Power, equal to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> (and
this meant in regard of her ſcituation &amp; ſtrength
alone) I think I may modeſtly enough add, that
the equality and harmony of her temper (which
neither heavily ſlumbers away opportunities,
nor raſhly ſnatches at them before maturity)
conſidered, did not ſome miſtaken principles,
introduced by a fond doting on ſuch a liberty as
is inconſiſtent with Government, make the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate

is the ſupreme power) too weak to produce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and vigorous motions in them, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

his conduct be able to make a farther progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
towards giving laws to mankind than any
