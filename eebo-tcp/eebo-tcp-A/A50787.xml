            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AWay, I am aſham'd of your proceedings, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly you have in this one act overthrown the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the world held of your wiſdom.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Beau.</speaker>
                  <p>Can you not ſee your error? that having buried ſo good a wife not a moneth ſince; one that, to ſpeak the truth, had all thoſe excellencies which our books have onely feign'd to make a compleat Wife, moſt exactly in her in practice, and to marry a Girl of fifteen; one bred up i'th Court, that by all conſonancy of reaſon, is like to croſs your eſtate: why, one new Gown of hers when 'tis paid for, will eat you out the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a bountiful <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> I am aſham'd of you, for you ſhall make too dear a proof of it, I fear; that in the election of a Wife, as in a project of War, to erre but once, is to be undone for ever.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>Good my Lord, I do beſeech you let your better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment go along with your reprehenſion.</p>

                  <speaker>Beau.</speaker>
                  <p>So it does, and can finde nought to extenuate your fault, but your dotage: you are a man well ſunck in years, and to graft ſuch a yong bloſſom into your Stock, is the next way to make every carnal eye beſpeak your injury. Troth I pity her too, ſhe was not made to wither and go out by painted fires, that yields her no more heat, then to be lodg'd in ſome bleak Banquetting-houſe i'th dead of Winter, and what follows then? your ſhame, and the ruine of your children, and there's the end of a raſh bargain.</p>

I confeſs ſhe was bred at Court, but ſo retiredly, that (as ſtill the beſt in ſome place is to be learnt there) ſo her life did rectifie it ſelf more by the Court Chappel, then by the Office of the Revels: beſt of all vertues are
<pb facs="tcp:55284:4"/>
to be found at Court, and where you meet with writings contrary to this known truth, they are framed by men that never were ſo happy to be planted there to know it: for the difference between her youth and mine, if you will read a Matrons ſober ſtaidneſs in her eye, and all the other grave demeanor fitting the Governeſs of a Houſe, you'l then confeſs there's no diſparity between us.</p>

Oh remember there is a malediction denounc't againſt it in Holy Writ: will you for her pleaſure, the Inheritance of <hi>Deſolation</hi> leave to your poſterity? think how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate the creatures of the field that onely live on the wilde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of <hi>Nature,</hi> are unto their yong ones; think likewiſe you may have more children by this woman, and by this act you undo them too: 'tis a ſtrange preſident this, to ſee an obedient ſon laboring good counſel to the father! But know Sir, that the ſpirits of my Great-Grandfather and your Father moves at this preſent in me, and what they bequeath'd you, on your Death-bed they charge you not to give away in the dalliance of a womans bed: Good Sir, let it not be thought preſumption in me, that I have continued my ſpeech unto this length, the cauſe ſir, is urgent, and believe it you ſhall finde her Beauty as malevolent unto you, as a red morning
