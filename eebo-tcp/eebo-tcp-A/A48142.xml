         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THe particulars are too many to be related at this
time concerning this last nights Ingagement with the
Enemy at <hi>Maidstone,</hi> which in brief was such as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was since these wars began: This Army strugled with so
much difficulty, to overcome a stubborn and resolute Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
The fight begun about 7 of the clock at night, about a
mile from Maidstone, and before we could hear them from
hedge to hedge, and get in at the Barracado's, it was past nine,
after we had entred the town, we disputed every street and
turning; they having 8 pieces of Canon, which they dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
above 20 times upon our men in the streets, &amp; by Gods
mighty help and assistance, we overcame them between 12.
and one of the clock at night, being every minute in all that
time firing upon their horse and foot, and they upon us, we
took about 400. prisoners, and near as many Horse, our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
hope of horse gave the red Standard of horse as gallant
a charge as ever was seen, which is said to be Gen. <hi>Hales</hi> his
Troop. The reason why the Ingagement began so soon, the
Train and Rear of the Army being three miles off (and not
come up) was, that the Forlorn of horse and Foot being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in viewing the town before it was dark, came off safe,
The Enemy being with their wh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">

which was very difficult for us to have done; they sent in a

There were in all, as we guess, 200. then slain in and about
the town, and Capt. <hi>Price</hi> a very honest and stout Gentleman
Col. <hi>Hewsons</hi> Captain Lieutenant, was also slain, and about
30. more of our men, most falling at the mouth of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
with case-shot; we took 8 pieces, six Iron and two Brass
abundance of arms, having been up all night, and want of
time cannot send more particulars at present: Only I desire
God to let you see, how the old quarrell is revived by the
same party, with greater violence then at first. You will
shortly understand what Earls, Lords, and other persons of
quality appeared in this businesse. His Excellency from the
first minute of Ingagement to the last; could not be drawne

Lanes Barracado'd with trees and other things which were
thrown in the ways, and the hedges loyn'd with Musqueteers,
yet after some time spent, (with great difficulty) we beat
them from one place to another, till we had driven them
back into the very town, and at the bridge we found little
opposition, but the streets were strongest fortified, and the
stou<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

unhappy wars, their ordinance loaded with case shot did us
some mischief before we could get under their shot the rain
was more disadvantage to us then unto them; for they shot
out of windowes and at doors, but in this service the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks
were of great use unto us. From the time we had begun
the fight till we had gotten the town was six or seven hours,
In the first action I cannot but observe unto you the gallantry
of a party of about sixty of our horse, which charged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
party of theirs, where ours gave them a through charge,
and did that evecution upon them, that it is thought, there
was not a man of the Enemies party that was not slain or
wounded. In this town were above 2000 men, amongst
which were few of the Kentish Country men, but Sea-men,
Water-men, and such as came to them from London, which

for the present put into Maidstone Church: our horse are
gone forth in parties towards Rochester, to discover the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies

and in the wild of Kent, and I pray God that all other Towns
and places may avoid the bringing of that ruine upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

travel and much watching, therefore I take my leave and
