            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the Practice of former Ages, when they met in
Parliaments, to examine the Causes of the Kings Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
and to make those that were not Faithfull in
their Offices to Relieve the King, as they did by <hi>Hugo
de Burgo,</hi> and the Accomptants of the Revenue in
<hi>HENRY</hi> the thirds time. <hi>King JAMES</hi> and <hi>King
CHARLES</hi> the first (of ever Blessed Memory) were
both Large-Hearted, and (as Princes naturally are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
very Bountiful. <hi>Q. ELIZABETH</hi> left a
Plentiful Revenue to the Crown of <hi>England: King JAMES,</hi> in Favour of the
People, sold most of the Lands in <hi>Fee-Farm;</hi> An Invention found out to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
an Act of Resumption. The Flowers of the Crown ever since have been gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by those that gave the King onely the Stalks, which brought the King into many
great Debts, that stand Charged upon the Revenue left unsold. And it so happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I became Intituled to a Considerable part of the Mony, and in Prosecution of the
said Debt, by Administring upon some Estate, I was Involved with a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Creditors, that were likewise Concerned for divers Summs of Mony, which
Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pinder</hi> had lent to the King: This gave me
Occasion to look into the Revenue of the Crown, and to make several Applications to
Committees (in the Violent and Distempred times) for satisfaction of the said Debts,<note place="margin">Damages is 346000l. concerned in it, are sixty four Persons of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but I could have no other Tearms offered, then Allowances as Debentures towards
purchasing Crown Lands, Bishops Lands, or Delinquents Lands, (so called)
which I utterly refused. Since his Majesties Restauration, the Creditors have been
more earnest upon me; some crying out I should appeal to the King, The Mirrour
of Justice: Others to the Hierarchy of the Church, and perswade them to render
that Part of the Revenue (due to the King) improved to their hands with the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
money by those Men that obstructed the Payment of the Kings Debts: Others
to the Lords, that have a great Sence of the Kings Honour, and the <hi>Regalia</hi> he lately
parted withall: Others to the Commons that hold the Purse-strings of the Nation, &amp;
have been pardoned great Arrears and Accompts which should have satisfied the
Creditors Demands. Being so divided in their Judgements and Opinions, they
brought me several Papers of perplext Notions concerning the Revenue of <hi>First
Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Tenths</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> belonging to the <hi>King</hi> for his <hi>Supream pastoral
Charge</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> with several <hi>Observations</hi> on that,
and the rest of the <hi>Revenues;</hi> shewing how the King was made insolvent in those
times. All which I have according to my promise (avoiding <hi>Prolixity</hi>) put into some
kind of <hi>Method,</hi> under several <hi>Titles,</hi> describing the several <hi>Tempers</hi> of such <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
as are guilty of defrauding the Crown: I have been true to my own <hi>Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and dealt <hi>impartially</hi> with all Men, as the Creditors desired. I did also according
to their Request before, Apply my self to his <hi>Majesty</hi> at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where I found
many <hi>Petitioners,</hi> some <hi>craving Reward,</hi> others begging <hi>Relief for Sufferings</hi> and
<hi>Services</hi> done, both to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and His <hi>Royal Father, (of ever Glorious
Memory)</hi> neither of them minding how the King should now support himself in his
<hi>Imperial Estate</hi> answerably to the <hi>Majesty</hi> of so great a <hi>Prince,</hi> and the Honour of
so great a <hi>Nation:</hi> I then cast about me to find out some expedient whereby I might
be rather Serviceable to the King, than Burthensome or Grievous to the People, and
yet satisfie my self. In order thereunto I presented these Petitions following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their several Dates: Whereupon there have been some Proceedings, but
nothing finally determined. All which rest under the Consideration of his <hi>Majesty</hi> and
his most <hi>Honourable Councel</hi> in <hi>Parliament.</hi> I have contracted all things into as
narrow a compass as I could of so much matter, not doubting, but that it may find
Room amongst other Weighty Affairs. I leave it therefore at the <hi>Parliament-Dore</hi>
for them to do what in Honour and Equity the Merits of the Cause require.</p>

others, of several Men upon Bonds.</p>
               <p>That many of those Persons are since deceased,<note place="margin">By the last general Pardon, the Clergy were forgiven 50000. pounds, which was due to the King upon Bonds, for First-Fruits and Tenths.

Clergy of late times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>TO</hi> this they Answer; That the First-Fruits, and Tenths, were paid in the <hi>Saxons</hi> times, as
appears by <hi>Beda</hi>'s Ecclesiastical History:<note place="margin">As the King was to the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> and have so continued ever since in <hi>England</hi> to this very day;

            <p>And that all Accompts,<note place="margin">Article 32.</note> and Declarations of Accompts, which then were in the said dissolved Courts of

the Treasurer of the said Court should appoint.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, and lastly, The said Clerk of the Pipe, claimeth to have the custody of the said Accompts, by
vertue of his late Majesties Letters-Patents, under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> bearing date the xv<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
in the Eighth Year of his Reign, they being granted unto him by the said Letters-Patents, under
these words: <hi>Nec-non officium omnium &amp; omnimodum Comporum Ministrorum Receptorum &amp; aliorum

            </p>
            <p>And as to the Inconveniencies which have risen to the <hi>Crown,</hi> or otherwise by the <hi>Auditors</hi> detaining
of those Accompts.</p>
            <p>We have not yet seen any of the Accompts remaining with the Auditors, and therefore we cannot so fully
set forth the Inconveniencies which have accrued to the <hi>Crown</hi> and People, by the Auditors detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the aforesaid Accompts, as otherwise, peradventure, we might. But those Inconveniencies
which we have observed, touching those Affairs, are as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, By the Auditors, diverting the course of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> Receivers and Bayliffs have not been,
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lled <hi>ad computandum,</hi> nor returned to Issues, as they ought, when they declared their Accompts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, By the Receivers not appearing in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> to be sworn to their Accompts, as they
ought, they were left at liberty to account onely for what themselves pleased, and to pay it when they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, The Debts, and <hi>Supers</hi> in the Accompts of the Receivers, and Ministers, were not put in demand,
by the process of the Court, as they should have been, but slept in the Accompts of the Ministers, and
Receivers, sometimes 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and sometimes 80 years together, and was then bolted forth
by parcels, when the Acquittances were oftentimes lost, the parties that paid the money dead, and the Lands
thereunto lyable oftentimes sold, to no small vexation of the Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, There could be no Controll had over the Accompts by any of the chief Ministerial Officers
of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> as by the course of the Court they ought, neither could Process issue out.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Undue, and unsafe Allowances, were made to the Accomptants of their Payments, by Tallies,
being never rejoyned, as the Law requireth: through the neglect of which duty, great Inconveniencies
have sundry times risen in like Cases: Witness <hi>Philips,</hi> and <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts,</hi> and many more.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, The Receivers, and Ministers, finding there was no Controll, had over their Accompts, and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
were greatly imboldned by such unwarrantable proceedings, to set those good Rents in <hi>Super,</hi>
which they might have commanded at their pleasure, respiting the Recepts of them, till their Years Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts
were elapsed, that so they might pay the present, with the precedent Years Rent.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, It also imboldened them to return that in <hi>Super,</hi> upon the King's Tenants, which they had
long time before received, and to continue it so, until the Parties were dead, and the Acquittances lost, <hi>ut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly, The Crown hath sustained great damage by Auditors, and their Deputies, certifying sundry
unwarrantable Re-prises upon the Particulars, which they made forth for the sale of the Crown-Lands, to
pass in Fee-Farm, and in Fee-simple, reducing the Yearly value from 40. <hi>li.</hi> to 6 <hi>li.</hi> &amp;c. Witness the Records
of <hi>M. 4. Jac. Ro. 248. ex parte Rem. R.</hi> touching <hi>Fisher</hi> Deputy-Auditor, who being fined 2000 <hi>Marks</hi>
for such Frauds, acknowledged he had done no otherwise, then the rest of the Auditors were wont to do.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly, By the Auditors not delivering over the Accompts into the Pipe, the Clerk of the Pipe hath
been ever since 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> obstructed in the execution of his Office, there being some thousands of Rents now
due to the Crown, reserved out of Crown-Lands, upon Letters-Patents granted in Fee, since 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
payable to the Bayliffs, and Receivers of the Premises, accomptable onely before the Auditors,
which though not answered for many years last past, could not with safety be put in process, without great
hazard of grievance to the People, until a full view was had of the Receivers, and Ministers Accompts, now
detained by the Auditors, whether the same Rents be therein charged, or discharged.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Tenthly, The Auditors of the Revenue, have omitted to charge the Receiver-General in his declared
Accompts, with all the whole Fee-Farm, and Farm-Rents, within their respective Collections, but still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
them in the way of Ministerial Accompts, although there can be no just or reasonable cause for it;
charging the Receivers with part thereof onely, and making therein sundry great Yearly Allowances, and
Defalcations, with other Discharges; and suffering many great Debts and <hi>Supers</hi> to remain therein, so
long as themselves please: So as in truth, the true state of the whole Charge, and Discharge of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40838:6"/>
of no one County, is at any time presented by the Receivers Accompts, to the view of the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, ☜
or any other that shall take the same; and herein will appear a great Mystery.</p>
            <p>Divers Accompts depending before some of the Auditors, wherein great sums of Money was due to the
Crown, were kept privately sleeping by them for many years together, until both the Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ompts, and
Debts, were pardoned.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Some of the Auditors have been imboldned to neglect the declaring the Receivers, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
and Collectors Accompts, after that they have been ingrossed: And thus it fared with the Accompts
of the Dutchy of <hi>Cornwall</hi> for divers years, in the time of King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the First.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, Some of the Auditors have neglected, for divers years together, to ingross the Receivers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
Ministers, and Collectors Accompts; and yet nevertheless have given those Receivers, Ministers,
and Collectors, pretended Yearly Discharges for the same, as if the said Accompts had been duly
declared. And thus it hath hapned in the Revenue of the Dutchy of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> for divers years together,
in the time of King <hi>Ch.</hi> the 1. And the Accompts of the <hi>Tenths</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> for 20, or 30 years together;
and in divers other Accompts of the New Impositions, taken by the late Auditors of the Impost: And
hereof they have appropriated to themselves the several Offices, Trusts, Employment, and Fees of the Lord
Treasurer, Chancellour, Under-Treasurer, Chamberlains, Barons, both Remembrancers, Clerk of the Pipe,
and Comptroller, and their respective Clerks, making themselves all in all, when, in truth, no one Officer
of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> whatsoever, ought, by the course of the said Court, to be solely intrusted with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of the Crown.</p>
            <p>Now the Conveniencies which will arise to the King, and the People, in case these Obstructions be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
are briefly, the taking away, and preventing of all the several Inconveniencies, before particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed: For if the Accompts of the Receivers, and Ministers, be Yearly Ingrossed, declared,
Entred wth the <hi>Remembrancers;</hi> and their Payments by <hi>Tallies</hi> re-joyned, approved by the <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains,</hi>
then their <hi>Accompts,</hi> and <hi>Tallies,</hi> will be delivered into the Pipe, where the <hi>Receipts,</hi> and
<hi>Payments,</hi> in the <hi>Accompts,</hi> will be controlled, the <hi>Debts</hi> and <hi>Supers</hi> therein be Yearly charged, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and levyed, and paid to the King's use; for which, both <hi>Accomptants,</hi> and <hi>Debtors,</hi> shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their lawful Discharge. And furthermore, the sleeping <hi>Rents</hi> due to the Crown (not yet in
charge) will be thereby received, and the Clerk of the Pipe will be hereafter, enabled the better to
perform the Duty of his Office.</p>
            <closer>All which is humbly offered to Consideration.

the said Service, and to continue their old practices: who tendred a new Warrant to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
for their Approbation, That the Lord Treasurer might sign for Messengers; A strange kind
of confidence to frame their own designs, and conclude the Barons Opinions, before they made any
report to the Reference upon the former Petition, and Proposals upon the reference concerning the

There were several Auditors and Receivers, appointed
to bring in the Kings Revenue which was then, very great and troublesom, to collect out of several
Demisable Lands, Profits of Courts, Wood-sales, &amp;c. which are since reduced to certainties of Fee-Farms
and Tenths, being such dry Rents, that neither rise nor fall: Yet (to the wonder of the
World (as Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> observes) although the cause be taken away, the effect continues. And
notwithstanding the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ings Revenue (in all Counties of <hi>England</hi>) is brought from one shilling to a

                  <hi>ANCIENTLY</hi> The Sheriff of every County was accountable for the Kings Rents,<note place="margin">By return of Clothiers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would conduce much to the Kings benefit, and common good of the Subject, if it were reduced into

That the Kings great Rents, should be payd to a Receiver, and he to pay them afterwards into the

left it for the <hi>Barons</hi> to report. And on the 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1661. Calling for their report,
the <hi>Barons</hi> desired an information of the benefit intended to His Majestie in the said Collection,
some of them having forgotten the perticulars, and also the discoverie of the mis-carriages, and
inconveniencies, which had happened by the default of the Receivers, Collectours, and other
Officers, relating to the said accounts. Whereupon it was breifly answered by the Petitioners,
that in their proposals (concerning the said Collection) left with Mr. <hi>Paine,</hi> they had offered
first, that they would observe such a methode in every County, that the rents should be duly
answered without the charge of Poundage, which the receivers had, besides the Collectours fees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Secondly, without the charge of 2s. upon every account, which the Auditours Clerks, were
allowed for ingrossing the accounts. Thirdly, that they would give good Security to render
a perfect Account yearly upon Oath, and return the <hi>supers,</hi> and upon whom depending, that
process may Issue duly out to avoid the charge of Messengers. Fourthly, they would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE observed in reading the Acts of <hi>Councils,</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi>
held by the KINGS of <hi>England?</hi> That they have Supported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
repaired their Estates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and payd their Debts, by improving the
Revenue of the Crown, and lessening the charge of supernumerary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
belonging to the Exchequer. And although the King hath an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Sovereign power in himself to do it without <hi>Parliaments;</hi> yet he
hath usually condescended, in such cases, to advise with the <hi>Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
and <hi>Temporal,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> assembled in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
The <hi>State</hi> held it most just, in the seventh year of <hi>King Henry</hi> the fourth, to help the <hi>King</hi>
out of his own, rather then burthen the People, and improved his Lands, although in Lease.
And also in <hi>Henry</hi> the sixths time, the <hi>King</hi> was induced by his <hi>Council,</hi> to Convey to the
<hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and others, all Profits of Wards, Escheats, and Forfeitures,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> towards the defraying the charge of his House, to prevent the immoderate Requests of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
Suiters. <hi>May it please your Grace,</hi> The Creditors that are concerned in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
for the improvement of <hi>First Fruits</hi> and <hi>Tenths,</hi> of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> are many and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome,

Rights and Proportions due to the <hi>King</hi> from the <hi>Clergie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as the Rights and Dignities
due to the <hi>Clergie</hi> from the People. Yet I understand the whole scope (of their Grievances)
is to be relieved out of the late improvements of <hi>Bishops, Deans, Non-Residents, Pluralists
sine Curas,</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> whose Livings are worth above a hundred pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> The
Method they intend to propose, I doubt not but may please your <hi>Grace,</hi> since they drive so much
at the Benefit of the poore <hi>Clergie,</hi> and to annex certaine <hi>Augmentations</hi> for ever to
such Livings, and <hi>Vicaridges</hi> that yeild not sufficient Maintenance, and Encouragement to
them that serve the Cure. My Lord, I have a double <hi>Obligation</hi> upon me to honour the
<hi>Clergie,</hi> above all other <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Dignities,</hi> therefore desired Moderation, and added
some thing of my own short <hi>Observations,</hi> to the advantage of the whole Hierarchy of the
Church (onely consistent with the old and sure Foundations of good <hi>Government</hi>) in the English

               <p>THE Church is that in which men hope for Salvation (united under a visible Government)
here, and triumphant in Glory hereafter, going under divers elogies, both in Heaven, and
Earth. That several Ministerial Officers subservient in the Church militant, were ever allowed
a sufficient, and Honourable Maintenance, according to their order: In <hi>England,</hi> before the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment
of parochial right to Tythes; Barons layed foundations of Churches at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
claiming onely a right to the Advouson, and upon lapse to the King as Patron Paramount,

Arch-Deacon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inducts. He then claiming a free liberty to perswade the People (by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
to Faith, and repentance, obedience to Princes, and love one to another, which is the fulfilling
of the Law, and by the ordinance of God and man, he so becomes intitutled to Tythes, as his
free-hold, for Administring the word and Sacraments to the People. Yet the unworthiness
of Ministers doth not make the word unprofitable, or the ordinances uneffectuall: they may
convert others, yet be themselves Reprobates; and by Coveting more then their owne, they have
lost a great part of that which was their due by Divine right. What Kings have endowed the
Bishops, and Dignitaries of the Church withall, they receive in a double Capacity, both as Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,<note place="margin">

Debts to Orphans and Widows: They received the Kings Revenue, and built large Houses

what is come to the Hand of the Clergy out of such improvements, beyond the ordinary and
usuall Tenths, Fines, and ancient Rents, being divided between the King and these poor Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,

would give a great satisfaction to all moderate Men; otherwise people will say, That Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
is great Idolatry, and if it be in the House of God, what will not the Wicked do,
those Examples being brought in to Presidents.</p>
               <p>If some Tenants have forfeited their right of improvement, for want of Allegiance to the
King, or that they have, under a force, purchased to preserve their Possession, or otherwise
justly offended God, and displeased the Clergy, and lost their Tenant-right; these poor Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors

CONSIDERATIONS
Of the CREDITORS
OFFERED
(To the Lords, and Commons Assembled in PARLIAMENT)
Concerning the KING'S Revenue, and the Debts
OF THE CROWN.</head>
            <p>1. A Business wherein all men are equally concerned, seldom any man makes it his particular care to follow, which
hath been the cause that so often good purposes fall to the ground; most men minding their own private
interest before the publick good of their Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ts of the World; by managing those affairs which may advantage the King in his
revennue, or the people in their trade.</p>
            <p>3. When the Kings present wants are considered, the greatness of his debts, and the complaints of so many grants,
it may not be unseasonable to enquire if some men were not executors in their own wrong, and that divers have built
upon other mens Foundations, to the great grievance of these which have suffered, through Violence, and Oppression.</p>
            <p>4. Those riches, and honours fall not out of the clouds (but are acquired by honest art, ingenuity, and fidelity,

To the KINGS most excellent MAIESTY, and the LORDS of His most

CONCERNING
The Island of BARBADOS, and the Ship Bona Esperanza, taken by the Dutch, Anno 1643.</head>
            <p>TO relate all the services, and good offices done (to the Crown, and People of <hi>England</hi>) by Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pinder</hi>
were to write Volums in their praises. And to shew what Honour they did the <hi>English</hi> Nation abroad, what advantages they brought
to the King, and Subjects at Home, what encouragements they gave to <hi>Seamen,</hi> and <hi>Merchants</hi> for encrease of Shipping, and Trade; were a
just reprehension to some, and a recrimination to others, that by indirect practises, have brought great Miseries both upon the Families, and
Creditors, of those two worthy Patriots of their Country.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1626. Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> sent <hi>Captain Henry Powel,</hi> Commander of the good Ship called the <hi>William</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
with six and fourty Men of several Handycraft Trades, to plant and possess the Island of <hi>Barbados,</hi> which was not before inhabited by
any person whatsoever, either native, or others. The said <hi>Captain Powel</hi> having landed his Men, and taken possession of the Island for Sir
<hi>William Courten,</hi> continued with them upon the <hi>Island,</hi> the space of a fortnight, in which time they cut down some Woods, and built some
small Houses for their present conveniencies; He then left them provisions, and sailed to the Main upon the Coast of <hi>Guyana,</hi> and furnished
himself with roots, plants, fowles, Tobacco-seeds, sugar-canes, potatoes, and other materials, and brought along with him thirty two <hi>Indians,</hi>
which he placed upon the said <hi>Island,</hi> who taught the <hi>English</hi> to plant the said roots, seeds, &amp;c. (the first that ever was planted there.) Sir
<hi>William Courten</hi> sent another <hi>Ship</hi> called the <hi>Peter,</hi> with a Pinnace called the <hi>Tomasine,</hi> commanded by <hi>John Powel,</hi> wherein were threescore
and ten Men and Women, with several materials also for planting the said <hi>Island</hi> for Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> aforesaid, who were all landed there
before <hi>Captain Henry Powel</hi> returned for <hi>England,</hi> and had built a <hi>Fort</hi> called the plantation <hi>Fort;</hi> That in the Year 1627 Sir <hi>William
Courten</hi> set up the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Colours, placed a Governour, made Constitutions, and Ordinances there, according to the Laws of
<hi>England,</hi> having procured a Patent, from King <hi>Charles</hi> the first under the great Seal, in the name of <hi>Philip Earl</hi> of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> in trust, to
countenance the said Government, and Plantation. And before the Year 1628 they had built three Forts, 100 Houses, began five plantations,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Corn Plantation, the <hi>Indian</hi> bridg, the fort, the <hi>Indian East,</hi> and <hi>Powels</hi> plantation, all which was done at the proper Cost of Sir <hi>William
Courten:</hi> that about the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1628, the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> having a patent of the Charebe <hi>Islands,</hi> sent a letter, directed to Captain <hi>John
Powel,</hi> and Captain <hi>William Deane</hi> in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and to others there, entreating them to give entertainment and respect unto Captain <hi>Charles
Wolverstone,</hi> whom he had sent thither with several men from <hi>London,</hi> hearing it was a hopeful Plantation, and to joyn with them in it. The
<hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Carlisle</hi> engaging himself upon his Honour in the said Letter, that the said <hi>Wolverstone</hi> and his men should not give them any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ion
of offence or trouble in their said plantation; not suspecting any prejudice from English-men, coming from a person of Honour, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
<hi>Wolverstone</hi> and fourty men or thereabouts with him: who seduced the people, under pretence, of greater privileges in the said
<hi>Island,</hi> and seized the forts, and took Captain <hi>John Powel</hi> Prisoner, and others that would not adhere to them. Then <hi>Wolverstone</hi> declared that
he was there as Governour of the said <hi>Island</hi> for the Earl of <hi>Carlisle.</hi> That in the Year 1629 Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> sent Captain <hi>Henry Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
again in the good Ship called the <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> with a 100 men well provided with Arms, who took the forts, released <hi>John Powel</hi> and
the rest of the Prisoners, and brought the said <hi>Wolverstone</hi> away Prisoner to <hi>London,</hi> by virtue of a Warrant under the hand and seal of the
said Earl of <hi>Pembroke.</hi> The said <hi>John Powel</hi> and his Company afterwards continued in the quiet possession of the said <hi>Island</hi> six Months
or thereabouts; and then one <hi>Henery Hawley</hi> arrived at the said <hi>Island</hi> in a Ship called the <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and invited the said <hi>John Powel</hi> with
others to an entertainment on Ship-board, who seized them and carried them away Prisoners to St. <hi>Christophers,</hi> and sent a company of leud
persons from thence, and daily supplies from other Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> who usurped the whole <hi>Island,</hi> and Government from Sir <hi>William
Courten</hi> and his Company, contrary to the Law of God, and Nations. That several persons who refused to joyn with the Earl of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> or
those that pretended to have the Power under him were stigmatized, whipt, imprisoned, and shot to death: And then several men of mean
quality, understanding the condition of the <hi>Island,</hi> took advantage of the times, and went over with a company of loose and idle persons
who possessed themselves of the said Island, and plantations, and out of the vast expence and charges of Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> and his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
they have gotten great estates, but have yielded no satisfaction, either to Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> or his assigns, notwithstanding the said Sir
<hi>William Courten</hi> had two several Judgments against the Earl of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and <hi>Wolverstone,</hi> upon trials in the Court of Admiralty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the propriety of the said Island. The Power of the said <hi>Earl</hi> of Carlisle being greater at the Council table then Sir <hi>William Courten</hi>
or his interest, the complaint was suspended, and the Dammages, which were then thirty thousand pounds and upwards, wholly detained by
those that intruded and disseized the said Sir <hi>William,</hi> and his servants of the said Island, and plantations.</p>
            <p>About five Years after Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> died, and left several Factories, in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> to <hi>William Courten</hi> his onely son and heir, and his
sole Executor, who took upon him the execution of his Fathers Will, and joyning with <hi>Mr. Thomas Kennistone,</hi> and others, sent several ships, with
Merchandizes to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> for supplies to the rest, and in the Year 1642 the good ship <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> being fraughted by the said
<hi>William Courten</hi> and his Compartners, making a trading Voiage between <hi>Goa,</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and <hi>Macco</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> in the month of <hi>June</hi> 1643
the said ship was set upon by two <hi>Dutch</hi>-men belonging to the states of the low Countrys, and the <hi>East-India</hi> company of <hi>Holland,</hi> and after
the loss of the said Master of the said ship, and several seamen slain out-right, with eleven more wounded in the defence thereof, the said ship
with all her Merchandize, was then taken and disposed of by the said two <hi>Dutch</hi>-ships of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> whereby the said <hi>William Courten</hi> &amp;c.
were damnified to the value of threescore and fifteen thousand pounds and upwards, besides the great loss and utter ruin of several men,
women, and children, whose husbands and Fathers were killed in the said service, all which is sufficiently proved, upon record, under se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
testimonies, of authentick witnesses taken upon Oath in the Court of Admiralty; since which time there hath been applications made
to the <hi>East-India</hi> Company of <hi>Holland</hi> for satisfaction, but they being so powerful in their own Courts, and by their influences in others, that there
hath been no restitution as yet made for the loss and dammages of the ship, Life, or goods to the said <hi>W. Courten,</hi> or his Compartners aforesaid.</p>
            <p>And for as much as Sir <hi>Paul Pinder,</hi> and two other Persons of Honour, became bound for the said <hi>William Courten</hi> for 126000 pounds, and
furnished him with several considerable sums of money to keep up his credit, and expected certain returns also from the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> for
their satisfaction, having his partes assigned to them for Counter-security, which are wholly disappointed whereby it is evident by this, and diverse
other former sad examples, that many of this Nation have been distroyed by such like attempts of the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The premises considered, and for as much as Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pinder</hi> were such memorable Merchants, so good servants and
Subjects to the Crown of England, so great Benefactours to the Church, and such instruments in the Common-Wealth, and that it hath been
already a great reflection upon the Honour of the Nation, and a great discouragment to others in following their Examples, for being so slighted;
it is therefore the humble request of all the Creditors, that since these and other sad misfortunes have befallen the Heirs, and Executors of Sir
<hi>William Courten,</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pinder,</hi> by the violence of these last 20 Years at home, and their great losses sustained by Violence abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Debts due from the Crown; that for the relief of many hundred poor Men, Women, and Children, Your Majesty would be greciously
pleased to take the same into your most pious consideration, that a select <hi>Committee</hi> of twelve Lords, and Commons in <hi>Parliament</hi> may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to examine the whole matters of fact, and make a report thereof to Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> and Your m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <head>EPILOGUE.</head>
            <p>TO reflect upon the late Distractions of the Nation, The great Debts of the Crown, or the sadsufferings
of the Creditors, were to Arraign all mens Actions: that transgressed the rules of Law, and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
In the <hi>English Monarchy</hi> (a Government comming the nearest to Perfection in this Transitory
World) The <hi>KING</hi> in his Politick Capacity is not improperly likened to <hi>God,</hi> for Justice, and
Immortality; its observed therefore that he neither dies, nor does any Wrong, and that from the <hi>KING</hi>
the Fountain of Honour, and Justice the Laws like Streams are conducted by the Judges, and dispersed to the
people, and the sacred Ordinances, by the Ministers of the Church, to their several Cures, so essentially
springing from that Bottom, the two main Pillars of good Government, Religion, and Law, the two insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
supporters of <hi>Regal</hi> Authority: The Currents were stopt by defect in the Pipes. The Fountain, was not
dry, nor the Streams, but the aquaducts failing, when they plunged themselves, and others into a <hi>Deluge</hi> of
Miseries, and disorders; living upon the spoils of the Crown with so many hundred hands in the <hi>Kings</hi>
Purse, that minded not the support of his royal Estate, nor the ordinary protection of the People; which
brought those Persons into extream wants that supplyed the <hi>King</hi> with Money for his necessary occasions.
The Wits and Inventions of other Men were chiefly taken up about riches, and Possessions ef the World,
streaching some things beyond their latitude, and depressing others from their Force, and Power, which
caused the Oppression of ehe <hi>Kings</hi> Creditors (which now lies under Considerations of <hi>Parliament</hi>) either
to be satisfied by a general Contribution, of the Nation, or by improvement of what they have Proposed to
the <hi>King,</hi> or by the revennue in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> chargeable with their Debts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>KING CHARLES</hi> the first (of ever blessed Memory) asserted the due Honour of the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
the Rites, and Government of the Church, and his other praerogatives also (which were not granted by
the People that were reserved to himself, when the positive Law of Nations was first Established) he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with Zeal, and Constancy to the last. Affirming that no Man could be exempted from Obedience,
and Subjection under the Government of <hi>Kings</hi> any more then Children from the Obedience they owed
to their Parents, by the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi> And that in the Estimation of right understanding
Men.</p>
            <p>They are very vnworthy, and vngrateful to their Prince that seeks to defraud him in any perquisite or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennue
of the Crown, who studies daily at Court how to preserve them in Peace, and Prosperity from Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
at home, and abroad, He that takes the value of a shilling from any Mans person upon the Road, dies
without Mercy, and he that Counterfeits a single Penny suffers Death by the Law; yet he that robs <hi>God,</hi> and
the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> goes unpunished for Offences of <hi>Fraud,</hi> and <hi>Sacrilege</hi> which hath brought
all the sad Calamities both upon Church, and State.</p>
            <p>If by this indigested Discourse (being straitned of Time) I have incurred the Displeasure of some, or
the hard Censure of others, I can justly answer them both, that it was neither prejudice, nor intrest that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
me, but Zeal to my <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Countrey,</hi> and the miserable deplored Condition of several <hi>Orphans,</hi>
and <hi>Widdows</hi> that daily called upon me as administrator to seek some seasonable Releif after so many
Years sufferings, and forbearance of their Debts; And by this way of improvement: I fear not but their
Cause will finde Patrons, and Advocates, if they consider rightly the Benefit, and convenience that all
Estates may reap, where the whole Design looks towards the Glory, of <hi>God,</hi> the Honour of the <hi>King,</hi> the
Advantage of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the prosperity of the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> to which all Men should subscribe.</p>
