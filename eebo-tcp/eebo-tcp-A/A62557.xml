            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
AGAINST
Transubstantiation.</head>
            <p>COncerning the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
one of the two great positive Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Christian Religion, there are
two main Points of difference between <hi>Vs</hi>
and the Church of <hi>Rome. One,</hi> about the
Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> in which they think,
but are not certain, that they have the Scripture and
the words of our Saviour on their side: The <hi>other,</hi>
about the administration of this Sacrament to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in both kinds; in which we are sure that we have
the Scripture and our Saviour's Institution on our side;
and that so plainly, that our Adversaries themselves
do not deny it.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>first</hi> of these I shall now treat, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to shew against the Church of <hi>Rome, That in this
Sacrament there is no substantial change made of the
Elements of Bread and Wine into the natural Body and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98037:3"/>
Bloud of Christ;</hi> that <hi>Body</hi> which was born of the
<hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and suffered upon the Cross; for so they
explain that hard word <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I engage in this Argument, I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
what an unreasonable task we are put upon, by
the bold confidence of our Adversaries, to dispute a
matter of Sense; which is one of those things about
which <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath long since pronounc'd there ought
to be no dispute.</p>
            <p>It might well seem strange if any man should write
a Book, to prove that an <hi>Egg</hi> is not an <hi>Elephant,</hi> and
that a <hi>Musket-Bullet</hi> is not a <hi>Pike:</hi> It is every whit
as hard a case, to be put to maintain by a long Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
that what we see and handle and taste to be
<hi>Bread</hi> is <hi>Bread,</hi> and not the <hi>Body of a man;</hi> and what
we see and taste to be <hi>Wine</hi> is <hi>Wine,</hi> and not <hi>Bloud:</hi>
And if this evidence may not pass for sufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any farther proof, I do not see why any man, that
hath confidence enough to do so, may not deny any
thing to be what all the World sees it is, or affirm any
thing to be what all the World sees it is not; and this
without all possibility of being farther confuted. So
that the business of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is not a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
of Scripture against Scripture, or of Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Reason, but of downright Impudence against
the plain meaning of Scripture, and all the Sense and
Reason of Mankind.</p>
            <p>It is a most Self-evident Falsehood; and there is no
Doctrine or Proposition in the World that is of it self
more evidently true, than <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is evidently
false: And yet if it were possible to be true, it would
be the most ill-natur'd and pernicious truth in the
World, because it would suffer nothing else to be true;
it is like the <hi>Roman-Catholique</hi> Church, which will
needs be the whole Christian Church, and will allow
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98037:3"/>
no other Society of Christians to be any part of it:
So <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> if it be true at all, it is all truth;
for it cannot be true unless our Senses and the Senses
of all mankind be deceived about their proper objects;
and if this be true and certain, then nothing else can
be so; for if we be not certain of what we see, we can
be certain of nothing.</p>
            <p>And yet notwithstanding all this, there is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of men in the World so abandon'd and given up
by God to the efficacy of delusion as in good earnest to
believe this gross and palpable Errour, and to impose
the belief of it upon the Christian World under no less
penalties than of temporal death and Eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therefore to undeceive, if possible, these
deluded Souls, it will be necessary to examine the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
grounds of so false a Doctrine, and to lay open
the monstrous absurdity of it.</p>
            <p>And in the handling of this Argument, I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in this plain method.</p>
            <p>I. I shall consider the pretended grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>II. I shall produce our <hi>Objections</hi> against <hi>it.</hi> And if
I can shew that there is no tolerable ground for it, and
that there are invincible Objections against it, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man is not onely in reason excused from believing
this Doctrine, but hath great cause to believe the contrary.</p>
            <p>FIRST, I will consider the pretended grounds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
and reasons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for this Doctrine.
Which must be one or more of these <hi>five.</hi> Either 1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi>
The Authority of Scripture. Or 2<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> The perpetual
belief of this Doctrine in the Christian Church, as an
evidence that they always understood and interpreted
our Saviour's words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> in this sense. Or
3<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> The authority of the present Church to make and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98037:4"/>
declare new Articles of Faith. Or 4<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> The absolute
necessity of such a change as this in the Sacrament to
the comfort and benefit of those who receive this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
Or 5<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> To magnify the power of the Priest
in being able to work so great a Miracle.</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> They pretend for this Doctrine the Authority
of Scripture in those words of our Saviour, <hi>This is my
body.</hi> Now to shew the insufficiency of this pretence,
I shall endeavour to make good these <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>1. That there is no necessity of understanding
those words of our Saviour in the sense of <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That there is a great deal of reason to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That there is no necessity to understand those
words of our Saviour in the sense of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
If there be any, it must be from one of these two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Either because there are no figurative expressions
in Scripture, which I think no man ever yet said: or
else, because a Sacrament admits of no figures; which
would be very absurd for any man to say, since it is
of the very nature of a Sacrament to represent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite
some invisible grace and benefit by an outward
sign and figure: And especially since it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
but that in the institution of this very Sacrament
our Saviour useth figurative expressions and several
words which cannot be taken strictly and literally.
When he gave the Cup he said, <hi>This Cup is the new
Testament in my bloud, which is shed for you and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for the remission of Sins.</hi> Where first, the <hi>Cup</hi> is put
for <hi>Wine</hi> contained in the Cup; or else if the words
be literally taken, so as to signify a substantial change,
it is not of the <hi>Wine</hi> but of the <hi>Cup;</hi> and that, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>bloud of Christ</hi> but into the <hi>new Testament</hi> or <hi>new
Covenant</hi> in his bloud. Besides, that his bloud is said
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98037:4"/>
               <hi>then</hi> to be shed, and his body to be broken, which
was not till his Passion, which followed the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and first celebration of this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>But that there is no necessity to understand our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
words in the sense of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> I will
take the plain concession of a great number of the most
learned Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.

for the other Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation,

               <hi>Gabriel Biel,</hi>

freely declares, that <hi>as to any thing express'd in the

of Bread and Wine doth remain after Consecration:</hi>
and therefore he resolves the belief of <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
into some other Revelation, besides Scripture,
which he supposeth the Church had about it. Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

               <hi>Cajetan</hi> confesseth that <hi>the Gospel doth no where

that we have this from the authority of the Church:</hi> nay,
he goes farther, , <hi>that there is nothing in the Gospel
which enforceth any man to understand these words of

Christ,</hi> this is my body, <hi>in a proper and not a metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
sense; but the Church having understood them in

               <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> one of the best and most judicious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that Church ever had, reckon this Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those <hi>which are not so expresly found in Scripture.</hi>
I will add but one more, of great authority in the
Church, and a reputed Martyr,<note n="m" place="margin">contra captiv. Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. c. 10. n. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Fisher</hi> Bishop of

of the Institution <hi>there is not one word from whence the
true presence of the flesh and bloud of Christ in our Mass
can be proved:</hi> So that we need not much contend
that this Doctrine hath no certain foundation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when this is so fully and frankly acknowledged
by our Adversaries themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If there be no necessity of understanding our
Saviour's words in the sense of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> I am
sure there is a great deal of reason to understand them
otherwise. Whether we consider the like expressions
in Scripture; as where our Saviour says he is <hi>the
door,</hi> and <hi>the true Vine</hi> (which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
would mightily have triumph'd in, had it been said,
<hi>this is my true body)</hi> And so likewise where the Church
is said to be <hi>Christ's body;</hi> and the <hi>Rock</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the <hi>Israelites</hi> to be <hi>Christ, 1. Cor. 10. 4. They
drank of that rock which followed them,</hi> and <hi>that rock
was Christ:</hi> All which and innumerable more like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
in Scripture every man understands in a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
and not in a strictly literal and absurd sense.
And it is very well known, that in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
things are commonly said to be that which they
do signify and represent; and there is not in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
a more proper and usual way of expressing a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98037:5"/>
thing to signify so and so, than to say that it is so and
so. Thus <hi>Joseph</hi> expounding <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> dream to him,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 26. Says, <hi>the seven good kine are seven years,</hi>
and <hi>the seven good ears of corn are seven years,</hi>
that is, they signified or represented seven years of
plenty; and so <hi>Pharaoh</hi> understood him, and so would
any man of sense understand the like expressions; nor
do I beleive that any sensible man, who had never
heard of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> being grounded upon these
words of our Saviour, <hi>this is my body,</hi> would upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the institution of the Sacrament in the Gospel
ever have imagin'd any such thing to be meant by our
Saviour in those words; but would have understood
his meaning to have been, <hi>this Bread</hi> signifies my <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
this <hi>Cup</hi> signifies my <hi>Bloud;</hi> and this which you
see me now do, do ye hereafter for a <hi>Memorial</hi> of me:
But surely it would never have enter'd into any man's
mind to have thought that our Saviour did literally hold
himself in his hand, and give away himself from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with his own hands.</p>
            <p>Or whether we compare these words of our Saviour
with the ancient Form of the Passover used by the <hi>Jews</hi>
from <hi>Ezra's</hi> time, as<note n="n" place="margin">Dialog. cuus <hi>Tryph.</hi> p. 297. Edit. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> tells us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>this
Passover is our Saviour and our refuge:</hi> not that they
believed the Paschal Lamb to be substantially changed
either into God their Saviour who delivered them out
of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or into the <hi>Messias</hi> the Saviour
whom they expected and who was signified by it:
But this Lamb which they did eat did represent to
them and put them in mind of that Salvation which
God wrought for their Fathers in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when by the
slaying of a Lamb and sprinkling the bloud of it upon
their doors their first-born were passed over and spared;
and did likewise foreshew the Salvation of the <hi>Messias,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98037:6"/>
the Lamb of God that was to take away the Sins of the world.</p>
            <p>And nothing is more common in all Languages than
to give the name of the thing signified to the Sign.
As the delivery of a Deed or Writing under hand and
Seal is call'd a Conveyance or making over of such an
Estate, and it is really so; not the delivery of mere
wax and parchment, but the conveyance of a real
Estate; as truly and really to all effects and purposes of
Law, as if the very material houses and lands themselves
could be and were actually delivered into my hands:
In like manner the names of the things themselves
made over to us in the new Covenant of the Gospel
between God and man, are given to the Signs or Seals
of that Covenant. By <hi>Baptism</hi> Christians are said to
be <hi>made partakers of the Holy Ghost, Heb.</hi> 6. 4. And
by the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper we are said to
<hi>communicate</hi> or to be made partakers <hi>of the Body of
Christ</hi> which was broken, and of his Bloud which was
shed for us, that is, of the real benefits of his death
and passion. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16. The cup of blessing which we bless,
is it not the communion of the bloud of Christ? the bread
which we break, is it not the communion of the body of
Christ?</hi> But still it is bread, and he still calls it so,
v. 17. <hi>For we being many are one bread and one body;
for we are partakers of that one bread.</hi> The Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> might, if they pleased, as well argue from
hence that all Christians are substantially changed first
into Bread, and then into the natural Body of Christ
by their participation of the Sacrament, because they
are said thereby to be <hi>one bread</hi> and <hi>one body.</hi> And
the same Apostle in the next <hi>chapter,</hi> after he had
spoken of the consecration of the Elements still calls
them the <hi>bread and the Cup,</hi> in three <hi>verses</hi> together,
<hi>As often as ye eat this bread and drink this Cup,</hi> v. 26.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98037:6"/>
               <hi>Whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the
Lord unworthily,</hi> v. 27. <hi>But let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that
cup,</hi> v. 28. And our Saviour himself when he had said,
<hi>this is my bloud of the new Testament,</hi> immediately adds,
<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 26. 29.</note> 
               <hi>but I say unto you, I will not henceforth drink of this
fruit of the Vine, untill I drink it new with you in my
Father's Kingdom,</hi> that is, not till after his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was the first slep<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of his exaltation into the
Kingdom given him by his Father; when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
tells us he did eat and drink with his Disciples.
But that which I observe from our Saviour's words is,
that after the consecration of the <hi>Cup</hi> and the delivering
of it to his Disciples to drink of it, he tells them that
he would thenceforth drink no more of the fruit of the
Vine, which he had now drank with them, till after
his Resurrection. From whence it is plain that it was
the fruit of the Vine, real wine, which our Saviour
drank of and communicated to his Disciples in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
            <p>Besides, if we consider that he celebrated this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before his Passion, it is impossible these words
should be understood literally of the natural body
and bloud of Christ; because it was <hi>his body broken</hi>
and <hi>his bloud shed</hi> which he gave to his Disciples, which
if we understand literally of his natural body broken
and his bloud shed, then these words, <hi>this is my body
which is broken, and this is my bloud which is shed,</hi>
could not be true, because his Body was then whole
and unbroken, and his Bloud not then shed; nor could
it be a <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> (as they affirm this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
to be) unless they will say that propitiation
was made before Christ suffer'd: And it is likewise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that the Disciples should understand these
words literally, because they not onely plainly saw
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98037:7"/>
that what he gave them was <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> but
they saw likewise as plainly that it was not his Body
which was given, but his Body which gave that
which was given; not his body <hi>broken</hi> and his bloud
<hi>shed,</hi> because they saw him alive at that very time
and beheld his body whole and unpierc'd; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could not understand these words literally:
If they had, can we imagine that the Disciples, who
upon all other occasions were so full of questions and
objections, should make no difficulty of this matter?
nor so much as ask our Saviour, <hi>how</hi> can these things
be? that they should not tell him, we see this to be
Bread and that to be Wine, and we see thy Body to be
distinct from both; we see thy Body not broken, and
thy Bloud not shed.</p>
            <p>From all which it must needs be very evident, to
any man that will impartially consider things, how
little reason there is to understand those words of our
Saviour, <hi>this is my body,</hi> and <hi>this is my bloud,</hi> in the
sense of <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> nay on the contrary, that
there is very great reason and an evident necessity to
understand them otherwise. I proceed to shew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> That this Doctrine is not grounded upon the
<hi>perpetual belief of the Christian Church,</hi> which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vainly pretends as an evidence that
the Church did always understand and interpret our
Saviour's words in this sense.</p>
            <p>To manifest the groundlesness of this pretence, I
shall, 1. shew by plain testimony of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in
several Ages, that this Doctrine was not the belief of
the ancient Christian Church. 2. I shall shew the
time and occasion of its coming in, and by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
it grew up and was establish'd in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church. 3. I shall answer their great pretended
Demonstration that this always was and must have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98037:7"/>
been the constant belief of the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>1. I shall shew by plain Testimonies of the <hi>Fathers</hi>
in several Ages, for above five hundred years after
Christ that this Doctrine was not the <hi>belief of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Christian Church.</hi> I deny not but that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
do, and that with great reason, very much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
the wonderfull mystery and efficacy of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and frequently speak of a great Supernatural
change made by the divine benediction; which we
also readily acknowledge. They say indeed, that the
Elements of Bread and Wine do by the divine blessing
become to us the Body and Bloud of Christ: But they
likewise say that the names of the things signified are
given to the Signs; that the Bread and Wine do still
remain in their proper nature and substance, and that
they are turn'd into the substance of our Bodies; that
the Body of Christ in the Sacrament is not his natural
Body, but the sign and figure of it; not that Body
which was crucified, nor that Bloud which was shed
upon the Cross; and that it is impious to understand
the <hi>eating of the flesh of the Son of man</hi> and <hi>drinking
his bloud</hi> literally: all which are directly opposite to
the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with it. I will select but some few Testimonies
of many which I might bring to this purpose.</p>
            <p>I begin with <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> who says expressly,
that<note n="*" place="margin">Apol. 2. p. 98. edit. <hi>Paris.</hi> 1636.</note> 
               <hi>our bloud</hi> and <hi>Flesh are nourished</hi> by the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<hi>of that food</hi> which we receive in the <hi>Eucharist:</hi>
But <hi>that</hi> cannot be the natural body and bloud of
Christ, for no man will say that <hi>that</hi> is converted into
the nourishment of our bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Second <hi>is</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">lib. 4. c. 34.</note> Irenaeus, <hi>who speaking of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
says, that the</hi> bread which is from the earth
receiving the divine invocation is now no longer common
bread, but the Eucharist <hi>(or Sacrament)</hi> consisting of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98037:8"/>
two things, the one earthy, the other heavenly. <hi>He
says it is no longer common bread, but after invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or consecration it becomes the Sacrament, that is,
bread sanctified, consisting of two things an earthly
and a heavenly; the earthly thing is bread, and the
heavenly is the divine blessing which by the invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or consecration is added to it. And</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">lib. 5. c. 2.</note> 
               <hi>elsewhere he
hath this passage,</hi> when therefore the cup that is mix'd
<hi>(that is, of Wine and Water)</hi> and the bread that is
broken receives the word of God, it becomes the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
of the bloud and body of Christ, of which the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of our flesh is increased and consists: <hi>but if that
which we receive in the Sacrament do nourish our
bodies, it must be bread and wine, and not the natural
body and bloud of Christ. There is another remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Testimony of</hi> Irenaeus, <hi>which though it be not now
extant in those</hi> works <hi>of his which remain, yet hath
been preserv'd by</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin"> Comment. in 1, <hi>Pet. c.</hi> 3.</note> Oecumenius, <hi>and it is this; when
(says he)</hi> the Greeks had taken some Servants, of the
Christian Catechumeni <hi>(that is, such as had not been
admitted to the Sacrament)</hi> and afterwards urged them
by violence to tell them some of the secrets of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
these Servants having nothing to say that might
gratify those who offered violence to them, except onely
that they had heard from their Masters that the divine
Communion was the bloud and body of Christ, they think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it was really bloud and flesh, declar'd as much
to those that questioned them. The Greeks taking this
as if it were really done by the Christians, discovered it
to others of the Greeks; who hereupon put <hi>Sanctus</hi> and
<hi>Blandina</hi> to the torture to make them confess it. To
whom <hi>Blandina</hi> boldly answered, How would they endure
to do this, who by way of exercise <hi>(or abstinence)</hi> do
not eat that flesh which may lawfully be eaten? <hi>By
which it appears that this which they would have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98037:8"/>
charg'd upon</hi> Christians, <hi>as if they had literally eaten the
flesh and bloud of Christ in the Sacrament, was a false
accusation which these Martyrs denied, saying they
were so far from that that they for their part did not
eat any flesh at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next is <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who proves against <hi>Marcion</hi>
the Heretique that the Body of our Saviour was not a
mere phantasm and appearance, but a real Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Sacrament is a figure and image of his Body;
and if there be an image of his body he must have a
real body, otherwise the Sacrament would be an
image of an image. His words are these,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Advers.</hi> Marcionem <hi>l. 4. p. 571. Edit.</hi> Rigalt. Paris. 1634.</note> 
               <hi>the bread
which our Saviour took and distributed to his Disciples
he made his own body, saying this is my body, that is,
the image or figure of my body. But it could not have been
the figure of his body, if there had not been a true and
real body.</hi> And arguing against the <hi>Scepticks</hi> who denied
the certainty of sense he useth this Argument: That
if we question our senses we may doubt whether our
Blessed Saviour were not deceived in what he heard,
and saw, and touched.<note n="*" place="margin">lib. de Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ p. 319.</note> 
               <hi>He might</hi> (says he) <hi>be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the voice from heaven, in the smell of the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with which he was anointed against his burial;
and in tho taste of the wine which he consecrated in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his bloud.</hi> So that it seems we are to
trust our senses, even in the matter of the Sacrament;
and if that be true, the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>
is certainly false.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> in his<note n="*" place="margin">Edit. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etii.</note> Comment on <hi>Matth.</hi> 15, speaking of
the Sacrament hath this passage, <hi>That food which is
sanctified by the word of God and prayer, as to that of it
which is material, goeth into the belly and is cast out into
the draught,</hi> which none surely will say of the Body
of Christ. And afterwards he adds by way of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>it is not the matter of the bread, but the word
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98037:9"/>
which is spoken over it, which profiteth him that worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eateth the Lord; and this</hi> (he says) <hi>he had spoken
concerning the typical and Symbolical body.</hi> So that the
matter of bread remaineth in the Sacrament, and this
<hi>Origen</hi> calls the <hi>typical and Symbolical</hi> body of Christ;
and it is not the natural body of Christ which is there
eaten, for the food eaten in the Sacrament, as to that
of it which is material, goeth into the belly and is cast
out into the draught. This testimony is so very plain
in the Cause that <hi>Sextus Senensis</hi> suspects this place of
<hi>Origen</hi> was depraved by the Heretiques. <hi>Cardinal
Perron</hi> is contented to allow it to be <hi>Origen's,</hi> but rejects
his testimony because he was accused of Heresie
by some of the Fathers, and says he talks like a
Heretique in this place. So that with much adoe this
testimony is yielded to us. The same <hi>Father</hi> in his
<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Homilies</hi> upon <hi>Leviticus</hi> speaks thus, <hi>There is also in
the New Testament a letter which kills him who doth not
Spiritually understand those things which are said; for
if we take according to the Letter that which is said,
EXCEPT YE EAT MY FLESH AND DRINK MY
BLOVD, this Letter kills.</hi> And this also is a killing
Testimony, and not to be answered but in Cardinal
<hi>Perron</hi>'s way, by saying <hi>he talks like a Heretique.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>hath a whole Epistle</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ep. 63.</note> 
               <hi>to</hi> Cecilius, <hi>against
those who gave the Communion in Water onely without
Wine mingled with it; and his main argument against
them is this, that</hi> the bloud of Christ with which we are
redeemed and quickned cannot seem to be in the Cup when
there is no Wine in the Cup by which the Bloud of Christ
is represented: <hi>and afterwards he says, that</hi> contrary
to the Evangelical and Apostolical Doctrine water was in
some places <hi>offer'd (or given)</hi> in the Lord's Cup, which
<hi>(says he)</hi> alone cannot express <hi>(or represent)</hi> the bloud of
Christ. <hi>And lastly he tells us, that</hi> by water <hi>the people
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98037:9"/>
is understood,</hi> by Wine the bloud of Christ is shewn <hi>(or
represented)</hi> but when in the Cup water is mingled with
Wine the people is united to Christ. <hi>So that according
to this Argument</hi> Wine <hi>in the Sacramental</hi> Cup <hi>is no
otherwise chang'd into the</hi> bloud of Christ than the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>mixed with it is changed into the</hi> People, <hi>which
are said to be</hi> united to Christ.</p>
            <p>I omit many others, and pass to St. <hi>Austin</hi> in the
<hi>fourth Age</hi> after Christ. And I the rather insist upon
his Testimony, because of his eminent esteem and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church; and he also calls the
<hi>Elements</hi> of the Sacrament the <hi>figure and Sign of
Christ's body and bloud.</hi> In his Book against <hi>Adiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
the <hi>Manichee</hi> we have this expression,<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>our Lord
did not doubt to say, this is my Body, when he gave the
Sign of his Body.</hi> And in his explication of the third
<hi>Psalm,</hi> speaking of <hi>Judas</hi> whom our Lord admitted to
<hi>his</hi> last Supper, <hi>in which</hi> (says he)<note n="†" place="margin">Enarrat. in <hi>Psal.</hi> Tom. 8. p. 16.</note> 
               <hi>he commended and
delivered to his Disciples the figure of his Body;</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
which would now be censur'd for Heresie in the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Indeed he was never <hi>accus'd of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi>
as Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> says <hi>Origen</hi> was, but <hi>he talks
as like</hi> one as <hi>Origen</hi> himself. And in his <hi>Comment</hi> on
the 98 <hi>Psalm</hi> speaking of the offence which the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
took at that saying of our Saviour, <hi>except ye eat
the flesh of the Son of man and drink his bloud, &amp;c.</hi> he
brings in our Saviour speaking thus to them,<note n="‖" place="margin">Id. Tom. 9. p. 1105.</note> 
               <hi>ye must
understand Spiritually what I have said unto you; ye are
not to eat this body which ye see, and to drink that bloud
which shall be shed by those that shall crucifyme. I have
commended a certain Sacrament to you, which being Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
understood will give you life.</hi> What more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> than that
the Disciples were not to eat that Body of Christ which
they saw, nor to drink that bloud which was shed upon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98037:10"/>
the Cross, but that all this was to be understood spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
and according to the nature of a Sacrament?
For <hi>that body</hi> he tells us is not here but in heaven, in
his Comment upon these words, <hi>me ye have not always.</hi>

               <hi>He speaks</hi> (says he) <hi>of the presence of his body; ye

               <note n="†" place="margin">Id. Tom. 2. p. 93.</note> if the Sacrament <hi>(says he)</hi> had
not some resemblance of those things whereof they are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
they would not be Sacraments at all; but from
this resemblance they take for the most part the names
of the things which they represent. Therefore as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the body of Christ is in some manner or sense
Christ's body, and the Sacrament of his bloud is the
bloud of Christ; So the Sacrament of faith <hi>(meaning</hi>
Baptism) is faith. <hi>Upon which words of St.</hi> Austin
<hi>there is this remarkable</hi> Gloss <hi>in their own</hi> Canon Law;
<note n="‖" place="margin">de Consecr. dist. 2. Hoc est.</note> the heavenly Sacrament which truly represents the flesh
of Christ is called the body of Christ; but improperly:
whence it is said, that after a manner, but not according
to the truth of the thing but the mystery of the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified;
So that the meaning is, it is called the body of
Christ, that is, it signifies the body of Christ: <hi>And if
this be St.</hi> Austin's <hi>meaning, I am sure no</hi> Protestant
<hi>can speak more plainly against</hi> Transubstantiation. <hi>And
in the ancient</hi> Canon <hi>of the</hi> Mass, <hi>before it was chang'd
in complyance with this new Doctrine, it is expresly
call'd</hi> a Sacrament, a Sign, an Image and a figure of
Christ's body. <hi>To which I will add that remarkable
passage of St.</hi> Austin <hi>cited by</hi>

            <p>I will mention but one Testimony more of this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
but so clear a one as it is impossible any man in his

               <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 3. Tom. 1 8. p. 53.</note> 
               <hi>de Doctrina Christiana;</hi>
where laying down several Rules for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of Scripture, he gives this for one. If (says
he) <hi>the speech be a precept forbidding some heinous wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
or crime, or commanding us to do good, it is not
figurative; but if it seem to command any heinous wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
or crime, or to forbid that which is profitable and
beneficial to others, it is figurative. For example, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his bloud,
ye have no life in you: This seems to command a heinous
wickedness and crime, therefore it is a figure; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
us to communicate of the passion of our Lord, and
with delight and advantage to lay up in our memory that
his flesh was crucified and wounded for us.</hi> So that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to St. <hi>Austin's</hi> best skill in interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the <hi>literal eating</hi> of the flesh of Christ and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his bloud would have been a great impiety; and
therefore the expression is to be understood <hi>figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
not as Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> would have it, onely in
opposition to the eating of his flesh and bloud in the
gross appearance of flesh and bloud, but to the real
eating of his natural body and bloud under any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
whatsoever: For St. <hi>Austin</hi> doth not say, this is
a Figurative speech wherein we are commanded really
to feed upon the natural body and bloud of Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>species</hi> of bread and wine, as the <hi>Cardinal</hi>
would understand him; for then the speech would be
literal and not figurative: But he says, this is a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98037:11"/>
speech wherein we are commanded Spiritually
to feed upon the remembrance of his Passion.</p>
            <p>To these I will add but <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Testimonies
more in the <hi>two</hi> following Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first shall be of</hi> Theodoret, <hi>who speaking of that</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 49. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Prophecy of</hi> Jacob <hi>concerning our Saviour,</hi> he washed
his garments in Wine and his clothes in the bloud of
grapes, <hi>hath these words,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Dialog. 1.</note> as we call the mystical fruit
of the Vine <hi>(that is, the Wine in the Sacrament)</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
consecration the bloud of the Lord, so he (viz. Jacob)
calls the bloud of the true Vine <hi>(viz. of Christ)</hi> the
bloud of the grape: <hi>but the bloud of Christ is not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and properly but onely figuratively the bloud of
the grape, in the same sense as he is said to be the true
Vine; and therefore the Wine in the Sacrament after
consecration is in like manner not literally and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but figuratively the bloud of Christ. And he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
this afterwards, saying, that</hi> our Saviour changed
the names, and gave to his Body the name of the Symbol
or Sign, and to the Symbol or Sign the name of his Body;
thus when he had call'd himself the Vine, he call'd the
Symbol or Sign his bloud; <hi>so that in the same sense that
he call'd himself the Vine, he call'd the Wine, which
is the Symbol of his bloud, his bloud:</hi> For, <hi>says he,</hi>
he would have those who partake of the divine mysteries
not to attend to the nature of the things which are seen,
but by the change of names to believe the change which is
made by grace; for he who call'd that which by nature is
a body wheat and bread, and again likewise call'd himself
the Vine, he honour'd the Symbols with the name of his
body and bloud: not changing nature but adding grace to
nature. <hi>Where you see he says expresly, that when he
call'd the</hi> Symbols <hi>or Elements of the Sacrament, viz.</hi>
bread and Wine, <hi>his</hi> Body and Bloud, <hi>he made no change
in the nature of the things, onely added grace to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98037:11"/>
that is, by the Divine grace and blessing he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them to a Spiritual and Supernatural vertue and
efficacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is of the same <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his second Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue
between a <hi>Catholique,</hi> under the name of <hi>Orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and an <hi>Heretique</hi> under the name of <hi>Eranistes;</hi>
who maintaining that the Humanity of Christ was
chang'd into the substance of the Divinity (which was
the Heresie of <hi>Eutyches)</hi> he illustrates the matter by
this Similitude, <hi>As,</hi> says he, <hi>the Symbols of the Lord's
body and bloud are one thing before the invocation of the
Priest, but after the invocation are changed and become
another thing; So the body of our Lord after his ascension
is changed into the divine substance.</hi> But what says the
Catholique <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> to this? why, he talks just like
one of Cardinal <hi>Perron's</hi> Heretiques, <hi>Thou art,</hi> says he,
<hi>caught in thy own net: because the mystical Symbols after
consecration do not pass out of their own nature; for they
remain in their former substance, figure and appearance
and may be seen and handled even as before.</hi> He does
not onely deny the outward figure and appearance of
the Symbols to be chang'd, but the nature and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of them, even in the proper and strictest sense
of the word substance; and it was necessary so to do,
otherwise he had not given a pertinent answer to the
similitude urg'd against him.</p>
            <p>The next is one of their own Popes, <hi>Gelasius,</hi> who

says he, <hi>the Sacraments which we receive of the body

it ceaseth not to be the substance or nature of bread and

                  </gap>ans,</hi> who held
that tho body of Christ upon his ascension ceas'd and
was chang'd into the substance of his Divinity, it was
necessary to deny that there was any substantial
change in the Sacrament of the bread and wine into
the body and bloud of Christ. So that here is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
authority, one of their own Popes expresly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The last Testimony I shall produce is of</hi> Facundus <hi>an</hi>
African <hi>Bishop, who lived in the</hi> 6th. <hi>Century. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion of justifying an expression of one who had
said that</hi> Christ also received the adoption of Sons, <hi>he
reasons thus.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Facund. <hi>p. 144. edit.</hi> Paris. 1676.</note> Christ vouchsafed to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of adoption both when he was circumcised and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized:
And the Sacrament of Adoption may be called
adoption, as the Sacrament of his body and bloud, which
is in the consecrated bread and cup, is by us called his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and bloud: not that the bread, <hi>says he,</hi> is properly
his body and the cup his bloud, but because they contain
in them the mysteries of his body and bloud; hence also
our Lord himself called the blessed bread and cup which
he gave to his Disciples his body and bloud. <hi>Can any
man after this believe, that it was then, and had ever
been, the universal and received Doctrine of the
Christian Church, that the bread and wine in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
are substantially changed into the proper and
natural body and bloud of Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these plain Testimonies which I have produced,
and I might have brought a great many more to the

that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> hath not been <hi>the perpetual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

               <hi>Alphonsus a Castro</hi> says plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that <hi>concerning the Transubstantiation of the bread
into the body of Christ, there is seldom any mention in
the ancient Writers.</hi> And who can imagine that these
learned men would have granted the ancient Church
and Fathers to have been so much Strangers to this
Doctrine, had they thought it to have been the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
belief of the Church? I shall now in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, give an account of the <hi>particular time
and occasion of the coming in of this Doctrine,</hi> and by what
steps and degrees it grew up and was advanced into
an <hi>Article</hi> of Faith in the <hi>Romish Church.</hi> The Doctrine
of the <hi>corporal presence of Christ</hi> was first started upon
occasion of the Dispute about the <hi>Worship of Images,</hi>
in opposition whereto the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> about
the year DCCL did argue thus, That our Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left us no other image of himself but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which the substance of bread is the image of
his body, we ought to make no other image of our
Lord. In answer to this Argument the second <hi>Council
of Nice</hi> in the year DCCLXXXVII did declare, that
the Sacrament after Consecration <hi>is not the image and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98037:13"/>
antitype</hi> of Christ's body and bloud, but is <hi>properly</hi> his
body and bloud. So that the <hi>corporal presence of Christ
in the Sacrament</hi> was first brought <hi>in to support the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
worship of Images:</hi> And indeed it could never have
come in upon a more proper occasion, nor have been
applied to a fitter purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And here I cannot but take notice how well this
agrees with</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">de Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist. l. 1. c. 1.</note> Bellarmine's <hi>Observation, that</hi> none of the
Ancients who wrote of Heresies, hath put this errour
<hi>(viz. of denying</hi> Transubstantiation) in his Catalogue;
nor did any of the Ancients dispute against this errour
for the first 600 years. <hi>Which is very true, because
there could be no occasion then to dispute against those
who denied</hi> Transubstantiation; <hi>since, as I have shewn,
this Doctrine was not in being, unless amongst the</hi>
Eutychian <hi>Heretiques, for the first 600 years and more.
But</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note> Bellarmine <hi>goes on and tells us, that the</hi> first who
call'd in question the truth of the body of the Lord in the
Eucharist were the ICONOMACHI <hi>(the opposers of
Images)</hi> after the year <hi>DCC</hi> in the Council of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;
for these said there was one image of Christ insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by Christ himself, <hi>viz.</hi> the bread and wine in the
Eucharist, which represents the body and bloud of Christ:
Wherefore from that time the Greek Writers often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
us that the Eucharist is not the figure or image of
the body of the Lord, but his true body, as appears from
the <hi>VIIth.</hi> Synod; <hi>which agrees most exactly with the
account which I have given of the first rise of this
Doctrine, which began with the</hi> corporal presence of
Christ <hi>in the Sacrament, and afterwards proceeded to</hi>
Transubstantiation.</p>
            <p>And as this was the first occasion of introducing
this <hi>Doctrine</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> so in the <hi>Latin</hi> or
<hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>Paschasius Radbertus,</hi> first a <hi>Monk,</hi> and
afterwards <hi>Abbat</hi> of <hi>Corbey,</hi> was the first broacher of it
in the year DCCCXVIII.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:98037:13"/>
And for this, besides the Evidence of History, we
have the acknowledgment of <hi>two</hi> very Eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the Church of <hi>Rome, Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Sirmondus,</hi>
who do in effect confess that this <hi>Paschasius</hi> was the first
who wrote to purpose upon this Argument.<note n="*" place="margin">de Scriptor. Eccles.</note> 
               <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
in these words, <hi>This Authour was the first who
hath seriously and copiously written concerning the truth
of Christ's body and bloud in the Eucharist:</hi> And<note n="†" place="margin">in vita <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </note> 
               <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondus</hi>
in these, <hi>he so first explained the genuine sense
of the Catholique Church, that he opened the way to the
rest who afterwards in great numbers wrote upon the same
Argument:</hi> But though <hi>Sirmondus</hi> is pleased to say that
he onely first explain'd the sense of the Catholique
Church in this Point, yet it is very plain from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of that Age which are left to us, that this was the
first time that this Doctrine was broached in the <hi>Latin</hi>
Church; and it met with great opposition in that Age,
as I shall have occasion hereafter to shew. For <hi>Raba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Maurus</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> about the year
DCCCXLVII reciting the very words of <hi>Paschasius</hi>
wherein he had deliver'd this Doctrine, hath this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
passage concerning the novelty of it;<note n="‖" place="margin">Epist. ad <hi>Heribaldum.</hi> c. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Some,</hi>
says he, <hi>of late, not having a right opinion concerning
the Sacrament of the body and bloud of our Lord, have
said that this is the body and bloud of our Lord which was
born of the Virgin Mary, and in which our Lord suffered
upon the Cross and rose from the dead: which errour,</hi>
says he, <hi>we have oppos'd with all our might.</hi> From
whence it is plain, by the Testimony of one of the
greatest and most learned Bishops of that Age, and of
eminent reputation for Piety, that what is now the
very Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the
Sacrament, was then esteem'd an Errour broach'd by
some particular Persons, but was far from being the
generally receiv'd Doctrine of that Age. Can any
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98037:14"/>
one think it possible, that so eminent a Person in the
Church both for piety and learning, could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
this Doctrine as an Errour and a Novelty, had
it been the general Doctrine of the Christian Church,
not onely in that but in all former Ages; and no cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
pass'd upon him for that which is now <hi>the great
burning Article</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and esteemed by
them one of the greatest and most pernicious Heresies?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Afterwards in the year MLIX, when</hi> Berengarius
<hi>in</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Germany <hi>had rais'd a fresh opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Doctrine, he was compell'd to recant it by
Pope</hi> Nicholas <hi>and the</hi> Council at Rome, <hi>in these words,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">

after the consecration are not onely the Sacrament, but
the true body and bloud of our Lord Jesus Christ; and
are sensibly, not onely in the Sacrament but in truth,
handled and broken by the hands of the Priest, and
ground or bruised by the teeth of the faithfull. <hi>But it
seems the</hi> Pope <hi>and his</hi> Council <hi>were not then skilfull
enough to express themselves rightly in this matter;
for the</hi> Gloss <hi>upon the</hi> Canon Law <hi>says expresly,</hi>

unless we understand these words of BERENGARIVS
<hi>(that is in truth of the</hi> Pope and his Council) in a sound
sense, we shall fall into a greater Heresie than that of
BERENGARIVS; for we do not make parts of the
body of Christ. <hi>The meaning of which</hi> Gloss <hi>I cannot
imagine, unless it be this, that the</hi> Body of Christ,
<hi>though it be in truth</hi> broken, <hi>yet it is not</hi> broken into
parts (for we do not make parts of the body of Christ,)
<hi>but into</hi> wholes: <hi>Now this new way of</hi> breaking a Body,
<hi>not into</hi> parts <hi>but into</hi> wholes <hi>(which in good earnest is
the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Rome) <hi>though to them
that are able to believe</hi> Transubstantiation <hi>it may for any
thing I know appear to be</hi> sound sense, <hi>yet to us that
cannot believe so it appears to be</hi> solid non-sense.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98037:14"/>
               <hi>About XX years after, in the year MLXXIX Pope</hi>
Gregory <hi>the VII<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> began to be sensible of this absurdity;
and therefore in another</hi> Council <hi>at</hi> Rome <hi>made</hi> Berengari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
<hi>to recant in another</hi> Form, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Waldens. Tom. 2. c. 13.</note> that the bread and
wine which are placed upon the Altar are substantially
changed into the true and proper and quickning flesh and
bloud of our Lord Jesus Christ, and after consecration
are the true body of Christ, which was born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and which being offered for the Salvation of the
World did hang upon the Cross, and sits on the right
hand of the Father.</p>
            <p>So that from the first starting of this Doctrine in
the <hi>second Council of Nice</hi> in the year DCCLXXXVII,
till the <hi>Council</hi> under <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the VII<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> in the
year MLXXIX, it was almost three hundred years
that this Doctrine was contested, and before this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen
<hi>Monster of Transubstantiation could be lick'd</hi> into
that Form in which it is now setled and establish'd in
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Here then is a plain account of
the first rise of this Doctrine, and of the several steps
whereby it was advanced by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> into
an <hi>Article of Faith.</hi> I come now in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> place, to answer the great pretended <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi>
of the <hi>impossibility that this Doctrine, if it had
been new, should ever have come in, in any Age, and
been received in the Church; and consequently it must of
necessity have been the perpetual belief of the Church in
all Ages:</hi> For if it had not always been the Doctrine
of the Church, when ever it had attempted first to
come in there would have been a great stir and bustle
about it, and the whole Christian World would have
rose up in opposition to it. But <hi>we</hi> can shew no such
time when it first came in, and when any such oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
was made to it, and therefore it was always the
Doctrine of the Church. This <hi>Demonstration</hi> Monsieur

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> we do assign a punctual and very likely time
of the first rise of this Doctrine, about the beginning
of the <hi>ninth</hi> Age; though it did not take firm root
nor was fully setled and establish'd till towards the end
of the <hi>eleventh.</hi> And this was the most likely time
of all other, from the beginning of Christianity, for
so gross an Errour to appear; it being, by the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and consent of their own <hi>Historians,</hi> the most
dark and dismal time that ever happened to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church, both for <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> and
<hi>Vice.</hi> It came in together with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and was
made use of to support it: A sit prop and companion
for it. And indeed what <hi>tares</hi> might not the Enemy
have <hi>sown</hi> in so dark and long a <hi>Night;</hi> when so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
a part of the Christian World was lull'd asleep
in profound Ignorance and Superstition? And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
very well with the account which our <hi>Saviour</hi>
himself gives in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Tares,</hi> of the spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of Errours and Corruptions in the Field of the
Church.<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 13. 24.</note> 
               <hi>While the men slept</hi> the Enemy did his work
in the Night, so that when they were awake they
wondered how and whence the <hi>tares</hi> came; but being
sure they were there, and that they were not sown
at first, they concluded <hi>the Enemy had done it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have shewn likewise that there was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
opposition</hi> made to this <hi>Errour</hi> at its first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in. The general Ignorance and gross Superstition
of that Age rendered the generality of people more
quiet and secure, and disposed them to receive any
thing that came under a pretence of mystery in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and of greater reverence and devotion to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and that seemed any way to countenance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98037:15"/>
the worship of <hi>Images,</hi> for which at that time they
were zealously concern'd. But notwithstanding the
security and passive temper of the People, the men
most eminent for piety and learning in that Time
made great resistance against it. I have already na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Rabanus</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who oppos'd it
as an Errour lately sprung up and which had then
gained but upon some few persons. To whom I may
add <hi>Heribaldus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Auxerres</hi> in <hi>France, Io. Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Erigena,</hi> and <hi>Ratramnus</hi> commonly known by the
name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> who at the same time were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald</hi> to oppose this
growing Errour, and wrote learnedly against it. And
these were the eminent men for learning in that time.
And because Monsieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> will not be satisfied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
there were some stir and bustle about it, <hi>Bertram</hi>
in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his Book tells us, that they <hi>who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their several opinions talked differently about
the mystery of Christ's body and bloud were divided by no
small Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though for a more clear and satisfactory
answer to this pretended <hi>Demonstration</hi> I have been
contented to untie this knot, yet I could without all
these pains have cut it. For suppose this Doctrine had
silently come in and without opposition, so that we
could not assign the particular time and occasion of
its first Rise; yet if it be evident from the Records of
former Ages, for above D. years together, that this was
not the ancient belief of the Church; and plain also,
that this Doctrine was afterwards received in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church, though we could not tell how and when
it came in, yet it would be the wildest and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
thing in the world to set up a pretended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of Reason against plain Experience and
matter of Fact. This is just <hi>Zeno's</hi> Demonstration of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98037:16"/>
the impossibility of motion against <hi>Diogenes</hi> walking
before his Eyes. For this is to undertake to prove
that impossible to have been, which most certainly
was. Just thus the <hi>Servants</hi> in the <hi>Parable</hi> might
have demonstrated that the <hi>tares</hi> were <hi>wheat,</hi> because
they were sure none but good seed was sown at first,
and no man could give any account of the punctual
time when any <hi>tares</hi> were sown, or by whom; and
if an Enemy had come to do it, he must needs have
met with great resistance and opposition; but no such
resistance was made, and therefore there could be no
<hi>tares</hi> in the <hi>field,</hi> but that which they call'd <hi>tares</hi> was
certainly <hi>good wheat.</hi> At the same rate a man might
demonstrate that <hi>our King,</hi> his <hi>Majesty of great Britain,</hi>
is not return'd into <hi>England,</hi> nor restor'd to his Crown;
because there being so great and powerfull an Army
possess'd of his Lands, and therefore obliged by interest
to keep him out, it was impossible He should ever
come in without a great deal of fighting and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
but there was no such thing, therefore he is not
return'd and restor'd to his Crown. And by the like
kind of Demonstration one might prove that the
<hi>Turk</hi> did not invade <hi>Christendom</hi> last year, and besiege
<hi>Vienna;</hi> because if he had, the most <hi>Christian King,</hi>
who had the greatest Army in <hi>Christendom</hi> in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
would certainly have employed it against him;
but Monsieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> certainly knows, no such thing
was done: And therefore according to his way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
the <hi>matter of fact,</hi> so commonly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and believed, concerning the <hi>Turks Invasion of
Christendom</hi> and <hi>besieging Vienna</hi> last year, was a
perfect mistake. But a man may demonstrate till his
head and heart ake, before he shall ever be able to
prove that which certainly is, or was, never to have
been. For of all sorts of impossibles nothing is more
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98037:16"/>
evidently so, than to make that which hath been not
to have been. All the reason in the world is too weak
to cope with so tough and obstinate a difficulty. And
I have often wonder'd how a man of Monsieur <hi>Arnauld</hi>'s
great wit and sharp Judgment could prevail with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to engage in so bad and baffled a Cause; or could
think to defend it with so <hi>wooden a Dagger</hi> as his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi>
of <hi>Reason</hi> against certain <hi>Experience</hi> and
<hi>matter of Fact:</hi> A thing, if it be possible, of equal ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
with what he pretends to demonstrate, <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi>
it self. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> pretended Ground of this Doctrine of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation;</hi>
and that is, <hi>The infallible Authority of
the present Church to make and declare new Articles of
Faith.</hi> And this in truth is the ground into which
the most of the learned men of their Church did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
and many do still resolve their belief of this
Doctrine: And, as I have already shewn, do plainly
say that they see no sufficient reason, either from <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
or <hi>Tradition,</hi> for the belief of it: And that they
should have believed the contrary had not the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Church obliged them otherwise.</p>
            <p>But if this Doctrine be obtruded upon the world
merely by virtue of the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, and the Declaration of the <hi>Council</hi> under
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> or of the <hi>Lateran Council</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Innocent</hi> the III. then it is a plain Innovation in
the Christian Doctrine, and a new Article of Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon the Christian world. And if any Church
hath this power, the Christian Faith may be enlarged
and changed as often as men please; and that which is
no part of our Saviour's Doctrine, nay, any thing
though never so absurd and unreasonable, may become
an Article of Faith obliging all Christians to the belief
of it, whenever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> shall think fit to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98037:17"/>
stamp her Authority upon it: which would make
Christianity a most uncertain and endless thing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> pretended ground of this Doctrine is,
<hi>the necessity of such a change as this in the Sacrament to
the comfort and benefit of those who receive it.</hi> But
there is no colour for this, if the thing be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd:
Because the comfort and benefit of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
depends upon the blessing annexed to the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And as <hi>Water</hi> in <hi>Baptism,</hi> without any substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
change made in that Element, may be the Divine
blessing accompanying the Institution be effectual to
the washing away of Sin, and Spiritual Regeneration;
So there can no reason in the world be given why the
Elements of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> may
not, by the same Divine blessing accompanying this
Institution, make the worthy receivers partakers of all
the Spiritual comfort and benefit designed to us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
without any substantial change made in those Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
since our Lord hath told us, that <hi>verily the
flesh profiteth nothing.</hi> So that if we could do so odd
and strange a thing as to eat the very natural flesh and
drink the bloud of our Lord, I do not see of what
greater advantage it would be to us than what we may
have by partaking of the Symbols of his body and
bloud as he hath appointed <hi>in remembrance of him.</hi>
For the Spiritual efficacy of the Sacrament doth not
depend upon the nature of the thing received, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
we receive what our Lord appointed, and receive
it with a right preparation and disposition of mind,
but upon the supernatural blessing that goes along with
it, and makes it effectual to those Spiritual ends for
which it was appointed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> and last pretended ground of this Doctrine
is, <hi>to magnify the power of the Priest in being able to
work so great a Miracle.</hi> And this with great pride and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98037:17"/>
pomp is often urg'd by them as a transcendent instance
of the Divine wisedom, to find out so admirable a way
to raise the power and reverence of the Priest; that
he should be able every day, and as often as he pleases,
by repeating a few words to work so miraculous a
change, and (as they love most absurdly and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
to speak) <hi>to make God himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is to pretend to a power above that of God
himself, for he did not, nor cannot make himself, nor
do any thing that implies a contradiction, as <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>
evidently does in their pretending <hi>to make
God.</hi> For to make that which already is, and to make
that <hi>now</hi> which <hi>always</hi> was, is not onely vain and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
if it could be done, but impossible because it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a contradiction.</p>
            <p>And what if after all <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> if it were
possible and actually wrought by the Priest, would
yet be no Miracle? For there are two things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to a Miracle, that there be a supernatural effect
wrought, and that this effect be evident to sense. So
that though a supernatural effect be wrought, yet if
it be not evident to sense it is to all the ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of a Miracle as if it were not; and can be no
testimony or proof of any thing, because it self stands
in need of another Miracle to give testimony to it and
to prove that it was wrought. And neither in Scripture,
nor in profane Authours, nor in common use of speech,
is any thing call'd a Miracle but what falls under the
notice of our senses: A <hi>Miracle</hi> being nothing else but
<hi>a supernatural effect evident to sense,</hi> the great end and
design whereof is to be a sensible proof and conviction
to us of something that we do not see.</p>
            <p>And for want of this Condition, <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi>
if it were true, would be no Miracle. It would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
be very <hi>supernatural,</hi> but for all that it would
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98037:18"/>
not be a <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Miracle:</hi> For a Sign or Miracle is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a thing sensible, otherwise it could be no Sign.
Now that such a change as is pretended in <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>
should really be wrought, and yet there
should be no sign and appearance of it, is a thing very
wonderfull, but not to sense; for our senses perceive
no change, the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament to all
our senses remaining just as they were before: And
that a thing should remain to all appearance just as it
was, hath nothing at all of wonder in it: we wonder
indeed when we see a strange thing done, but no man
wonders when he sees nothing done. So that <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi>
if they will needs have it a Miracle, is such
a Miracle as any man may work that hath but the
confidence to face men down that he works it, and
the fortune to be believed: And though the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> may magnify their Priests upon account of this
Miracle, which they say they can work every day
and every hour, yet I cannot understand the reason of
it; for when this great work (as they call it) is done,
there is nothing more appears to be done than if there
were no Miracle: Now such a Miracle as to all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is no Miracle I see no reason why a Protestant
Minister, as well as a Popish Priest, may not work as
often as he pleases; or if he can but have the patience
to let it alone, it will work it self. For surely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the world is easier than to let a thing be as it
is, and by speaking a few words over it to make it just
what it was before. Every man, every day, may
work ten thousand such Miracles.</p>
            <p>And thus I have dispatch'd the <hi>First</hi> part of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which was to consider the pretended grounds
and <hi>Reasons</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for this Doctrine,
and to shew the weakness and insufficiency of them.
I come in the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98037:18"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> SECOND place, to produce our <hi>Objections</hi> against
it. Which will be of so much the greater force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have already shewn this Doctrine to be desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of all Divine warrant and authority, and of any
other sort of Ground sufficient in reason to justify it.
So that I do not now object against a Doctrine which
hath a fair probability of Divine Revelation on its side,
for that would weigh down all objections which did
not plainly overthrow the probability and credit of
its Divine Revelation: But I object against a Doctrine
by the mere will and Tyranny of men impos'd upon
the belief of Christians, without <hi>any</hi> evidence of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and against <hi>all</hi> the evidence of <hi>Reason</hi> and
<hi>Sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Objections I shall reduce to these <hi>two</hi> Heads.
<hi>First,</hi> the infinite scandal of this Doctrine to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> the monstrous and insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
absurdity of it.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>The infinite scandal of this Doctrine to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion.</hi> And that upon these <hi>four</hi> accounts. 1. Of
the stupidity of this Doctrine. 2. The real barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Sacrament and Rite of our Religion upon
supposition of the truth of this Doctrine. 3. Of the
cruel and bloudy consequences of it. 4. Of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Idolatry; which they are certainly guilty of,
if this Doctrine be not true.</p>
            <p>1. Upon account of <hi>the stupidity of this Doctrine.</hi>
I remember that <hi>Tully,</hi> who was a man of very good
sense, instanceth in the conceit of <hi>eating God</hi> as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of madness, and so stupid an apprehension as
he thought no man was ever guilty of.<note n="*" place="margin">De Nat. D<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum l. 3.</note> 
               <hi>When we call,</hi>
says he, <hi>the fruits of the earth Ceres, and wine Bacchus,
we use but the common language; but do you think any
man so mad as to believe that which he eats to be God?</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:98037:19"/>
It seems he could not believe that so extravagant a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had ever entred into the mind of man. It is a very
severe saying of <hi>Averroes</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> Philosopher
(who lived after this Doctrine was entertained among
<hi>Christians)</hi> and ought to make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
blush, if she can;<note n="*" place="margin">Dionys. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus. <hi>in 4. dist. 10. art.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>I have travell'd,</hi> says he, <hi>over the
world, and have found divers</hi> Sects; <hi>but so sottish a</hi>
Sect <hi>or Law I never found, as is the</hi> Sect <hi>of the</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
<hi>because with their own teeth they devour their God
whom they worship.</hi> It was great stupidity in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Israel</hi> to say, <hi>come let us make us Gods;</hi> but it
was civilly said of them, <hi>Let us make us Gods that may
go before us,</hi> in comparison of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
who say, <hi>Let us make a God that we may eat him.</hi> So
that upon the whole matter I cannot but wonder that
they should chuse thus to expose Faith to the contempt
of all that are endued with Reason. And to speak the
plain truth, the Christian Religion was never so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly
exposed to the scorn of Atheists and Infidels, as
it hath been by this most absurd and senseless Doctrine.
But thus it was foretold that<note n="†" place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>the Man of Sin</hi> should
come <hi>with power and Signs and Lying Miracles, and
with all deceivableness of unrighteousness,</hi> with all the
<hi>Legerdemain</hi> and <hi>jugling</hi> tricks of falsehood and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture;
amongst which this of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi>
which they call a <hi>Miracle,</hi> and we a <hi>Cheat,</hi> is one of
the cheif: And in all probability those common <hi>jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
words of <hi>hocus pocus</hi> are nothing else but a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>hoc est corpus,</hi> by way of ridiculous imitation of
the Priests of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in their <hi>trick</hi> of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi>
Into such contempt by this foolish
Doctrine and pretended Miracle of theirs have they
brought the most sacred and venerable Mystery of our
Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:98037:19"/>
2. It is very scandalous likewise upon account of
the real <hi>barbarousness</hi> of this Sacrament and Rite of our
Religion, upon supposition of the truth of this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
Literally to <hi>eat the flesh of the Son of man and
to drink his bloud.</hi> St. <hi>Austin,</hi> as I have shewed before,
declares to be a great <hi>Impiety.</hi> And the impiety and
barbarousness of the thing is not in truth extenuated,
but onely the appearance of it, by its being done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Species of Bread and Wine:</hi> For the thing they
acknowledge is really done, and they believe that they
verily eat and drink the natural flesh and bloud of
Christ. And what can any man do more unworthily
towards his Friend? How can he possibly use him more
barbarously, than to feast upon his living flesh and
bloud? It is one of the greatest wonders in the world,
that it should ever enter into the minds of men to put
upon our Saviour's words, so easily capable of a more
convenient sense and so necessarily requiring it, a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
so plainly contrary to Reason, and sense, and even
to Humanity it self. Had the ancient Christians ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
any such Doctrine, we should have heard of it
from the Adversaries of our Religion in every page
of their Writings; and they would have desired no
greater advantage against the Christians than to have
been able to hit them in the teeth with their feasting
upon the natural flesh and bloud of their Lord, and
their God, and their best Friend. What endless tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
would they have made upon this Subject?
And with what confidence would they have set the
cruelty used by Christians in their <hi>Sacrament,</hi> against
their God <hi>Saturn</hi>'s eating his own Children, and all
the cruel and bloudy Rites of their Idolatry? But that
no such thing was then objected by the <hi>Heathens</hi> to
the <hi>Christians,</hi> is to a wise man instead of a thousand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
that no such Doctrine was then believed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98037:20"/>
3. It is scandalous also upon account of the <hi>cruel and
bloudy consequences</hi> of this Doctrine; so contrary to the
plain Laws of Christianity, and to one great end and
design of this Sacrament, which is to unite Christians
in the most perfect love and charity to one another:
Whereas this Doctrine hath been the occasion of the
most barbarous and bloudy Tragedies that ever were
acted in the world. For this hath been in the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> the great <hi>burning Article;</hi> and as absurd and
unreasonable as it is, more Christians have been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
for the denial of it than perhaps for all the other
Articles of their Religion. And I think it may gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
pass for a true observation that all Sects are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
most hot and furious for those things for which
there is least Reason; for what men want of Reason
for their opinions they usually supply and make up in
Rage. And it was no more than needed to use this
severity upon this occasion; for nothing but the cruel
fear of death could in probability have driven so great
a part of mankind into the acknowledgment of so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and senseless a Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O blessed Saviour!</hi> thou best Friend and greatest
lover of mankind, who can imagine thou didst ever
intend that men should kill one another for not being
able to believe contrary to their senses; for being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to think, that thou shouldst make one of the
most horrid and barbarous things that can be imagin'd
a main Duty and principal Mystery of thy Religion;
for not flattering the pride and presumption of the
Priest who says he can make God, and for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with the folly and stupidity of the People who
believe that they can eat him?</p>
            <p>4. Upon account of the danger of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> which
they are certainly guilty of if this Doctrine be not true,
and such a change as they pretend be not made in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98037:20"/>
Sacrament; for if it be not, then they worship a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
instead of the Creatour God blessed for ever. But
such a change I have shewn to be impossible; or if it
could be, yet they can never be certain that it is, and
consequently are always in danger of Idolatry: And
that they can never be certain that such a change is
made, is evident; because, according to the express
determination of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that depends
upon the mind and <hi>intention of the Priest,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
certainly be known but by Revelation, which is
not pretended in this case. And if they be mistaken
about this change, through the knavery or crosness of
the Priest who will not <hi>make God</hi> but when he thinks
fit, they must not think to excuse themselves from
Idolatry because they intended to worship God and
not a Creature; for so the <hi>Persians</hi> might be excus'd
from Idolatry in worshipping the <hi>Sun,</hi> because they
intend to worship God and not a Creature; and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we may excuse all the Idolatry that ever was in
the world, which is nothing else but a mistake of the
Deity, and upon that mistake a worshipping of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as God which is not God.</p>
            <p>II. Besides the infinite scandal of this Doctrine upon
the accounts I have mentioned, <hi>the monstrous absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of it make it insupportable to any Religion. I am
very well assured of the grounds of Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and of the Christian Religion in particular; and
yet I cannot see that the foundations of any revealed
Religion are strong enough to bear the weight of so
many and so great absurdities as this Doctrine of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi>
would load it withall. And to make this
evident, I shall not insist upon those gross contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of the same Body being in so many several places
at once; of our Saviour's giving away himself with his
own hands to every one of his Disciples, and yet still
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98037:21"/>
keeping himself to himself; and a thousand more of
the like nature: But to shew the absurdity of this
Doctrine I shall onely ask these few Questions.</p>
            <p>1. Whether any man have, or ever had greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the truth of any Divine Revelation than eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man hath of the falshood of <hi>Transubstantiation?</hi>
Infidelity were hardly possible to men, if all men had
the same evidence for the Christian Religion which
they have against <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> that is, the clear
and irresistible evidence of sense. He that can once
be brought to contradict or deny his senses, is at an
end of certainty; for what can a man be certain of if
he be not certain of what he sees? In some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
our senses may deceive us, but no Faculty deceives
us so little and so seldom: And when our senses do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us, even that errour is not to be corrected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of our senses.</p>
            <p>2. Supposing this Doctrine had been delivered in
Scripture in the very same words that it is decreed in
the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> by what clearer evidence or
stronger Argument could any man prove to me that
such words were in the Bible than I can prove to him
that bread and wine after consecration are bread and
wine still? He could but appeal to my eyes to prove
such words to be in the Bible, and with the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and justice might I appeal to several of his senses
to prove to him that the bread and wine after conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
are bread and wine still.</p>
            <p>3. Whether it be reasonable to imagine that God
should make that a part of the Christian Religion
which shakes the main external evidence and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the whole? I mean the Miracles which were
wrought by our Saviour and his Apostles, the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
whereof did at first depend upon the certainty
of sense. For if the senses of those who say they saw
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98037:21"/>
them were deceived then there might be no Miracles
wrought; and consequently it may justly be doubted
whether that kind of confirmation which God hath
given to the Christian Religion would be strong enough
to prove it, supposing <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to be a part of
it: Because every man hath as great evidence that
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is false, as he hath that the Christian
Religion is true. Suppose then <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to
be part of the Christian Doctrine, it must have the
same confirmation with the whole, and that is Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
But of all Doctrines in the world it is peculiarly
incapable of being proved by a Miracle. For if a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
were wrought for the proof of it, the very same
assurance which any man hath of the truth of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
he hath of the falsehood of the Doctrine, that is,
the clear evidence of his senses. For that there is a
Miracle wrought to prove <hi>that what he sees in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
is not bread but the body of Christ,</hi> there is
onely the evidence of sense; and there is the very
same evidence to prove <hi>that what he sees in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not the body of Christ but bread.</hi> So that here
would arise a new Controversie, whether a man should
rather believe his senses giving testimony against the
Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> or bearing witness to a
Miracle wrought to confirm that Doctrine; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the very same evidence against the truth of the
Doctrine, which there is for the truth of the Miracle:
And then the Argument for <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and the
Objection against it would just balance one another;
and consequently <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is not to be proved
by a Miracle, because that would be, <hi>to prove to a
man by some thing that he sees, that he does not see
what he sees.</hi> And if there were no other evidence
that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is no part of the Christian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
this would be sufficient, that what proves the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98037:22"/>
one doth as much overthrow the other; and that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
which are certainly the best and highest exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
proof of Christianity are the worst proof in the
world of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> unless a man can renounce
his senses at the same time that he relies upon them.
For a man cannot believe a Miracle without relying
upon sense, nor <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> without renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it. So that never were any two things so ill
coupled together as the Doctrine of Christianity and
that of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> because they draw several
ways and are ready to strangle one another; because
the main evidence of the Christian Doctrine, which is
Miracles, is resolved into the certainty of sense, but
this evidence is clear and point-blank against <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> I would ask what we are to think
of the Argument which our Saviour used to convince
his Disciples after his Resurrection that his Body was
really risen, and that they were not deluded by a
Ghost or Apparition? Is it a necessary and conclusive
Argument or not?<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 24. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 39.</note> 
               <hi>And he said unto them, why are
ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my self; for
a Spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</hi>
But now if we suppose with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the
Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to be true, and that he
had instructed his Disciples in it just before his death,
strange thoughts might justly have risen in their hearts,
and they might have said to him; Lord, it is but a
few days ago since thou didst teach us not to believe
our senses, but directly contrary to what we saw,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the bread which thou gavest us in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
though we saw it and handled it and tasted
it to be bread, yet was not bread but thine own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
body; and now thou appealest to our senses to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98037:22"/>
prove that this is thy body which we now see. If
seeing and handling be an unquestionable evidence
that things are what they appear to our senses, then
we were deceived before in the Sacrament; and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
they be not, then we are not sure now that this is
thy body which we now see and handle, but it may
be perhaps bread under the appearance of flesh and
bones, just as in the Sacrament, that which we saw
and handled and tasted to be bread was thy flesh and
bones under the form and appearance of bread. Now
upon this supposition, it would have been a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to have quieted the thoughts of the Disciples: For
if the Argument which our Saviour used did certainly
prove to them that what they saw and handled was
his body, his very natural flesh and bones, because
they saw and handled them, (which it were impious
to deny) it would as strongly prove that what they
saw and received before in the Sacrament was not the
natural body and bloud of Christ, but real bread and
wine: And consequently, that according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
arguing after his Resurrection they had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> before. For that very
Argument by which our Saviour proves the reality of
his body after his Resurrection doth as strongly prove
the reality of bread and wine after Consecration. But
our Saviour's Argument was most infallibly good and
true, and therefore the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>
is undoubtedly false.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter I shall onely say this,
that some other Points between us and the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> are managed with some kind of wit and
subtilty, but this of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is carried
out by mere dint of impudence and facing down of
Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:98037:23"/>
And of this the more discerning persons of that
Church are of late grown so sensible that they would
now be glad to be rid of this odious and ridiculous
Doctrine. But the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath fasten'd it to
their Religion and made it a necessary and essential
Point of their Belief, and they cannot now part with
it if they would; it is like a Millstone hung about the
neck of Popery which will sink it at the last.</p>
            <p>And though some of their greatest Wits, as Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Perron,</hi> and of late Monsieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the defence of it in great Volumes; yet it is an
absurdity of that monstrous and massy weight, that
no humane authority or wit are able to support it: It
will make the very Pillars of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s crack, and
requires more Volumes to make it good than would
fill the <hi>Vatican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I would apply my self to the poor delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
People of that Church, if they were either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by their Priests or durst venture without their
leave to look into their Religion and to examine the
Doctrines of it. <hi>Consider, and shew your selves men.</hi>
Do not suffer your selves any longer to be led blindfold,
and by an implicit Faith in your Priests, into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of non-sense and contradiction. Think it enough
and too much to let them rook you of your money
for pretended Pardons and counterfeit Reliques, but
let not the Authority of any Priest or Church per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
you out of your senses. Credulity is certainly
a fault as well as Infidelity: and he who said, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are they <hi>that have not seen and yet have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
hath no where said, <hi>blessed are they that have
seen and yet have not believed,</hi> much less, <hi>blessed are
they that believe directly contrary to what they
see.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98037:23"/>
To conclude this Discourse. By what hath been
said upon this Argument it will appear, with how
little truth, and reason, and regard to the interest of
our common Christianity it is so often said by our
Adversaries, that there are as good arguments for
the belief of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> as of the Doctrine of
the <hi>Trinity:</hi> When they themselves do acknowledge
with us that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is grounded
upon the Scriptures, and that according to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of them by the consent of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
But their Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> I have
plainly shewn to have no such ground, and that this
is acknowledged by very many learned men of their
own Church. And this Doctrine of theirs being
first plainly proved by us to be destitute of all Divine
warrant and Authority, our Objections against it
from the manifold contradictions of it to Reason and
Sense are so many Demonstrations of the falsehood of
it. Against all which they have nothing to put in
the opposite Scale but the Infallibility of their Church,
for which there is even less colour of proof from
Scripture than for <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> it self. But so
fond are they of their own Innovations and Errours,
that rather than the Dictates of their Church, how
groundless and absurd soever, should be call'd in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
rather than not have their will of us in imposing
upon us what they please, they will overthrow any
Article of the Christian Faith, and shake the very
foundations of our common Religion: A clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Mother,
since she can be so well contented that Christianity
should be destroyed rather than the Point in question
should be decided against her.</p>
