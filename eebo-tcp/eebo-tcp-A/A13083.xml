         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of <hi>happinesse;</hi> and when God presenteth
the <hi>chiefe good,</hi> then Sathan presseth to turne
it into our chiefe ill.</p>
            <p>Of all things on earth only mans Soule keepeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
correspondence with God, because it is onely
capable of his instructions and inspirations; and able to
give him a meeting in affection and action. And yet in
the matter of true happinesse it was most miserable. For
though God made Adam happie, yet by his fall, losing
happinesse, he had neither conscience of miserie, nor
care of recovering what he had lost. And which is to be
lamented, all mankinde (except the handfull of the
Church) for more than three thousand yeares lived
in the brutish opinion of the soules mortalitie.<note place="margin">Aug. Civit. 18. 25.</note> Then
Thales, in the daies of Manasseh and Numa, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
exactly the heavens motion, raised this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
<hi>That mans soule which could observe those
things, had a greater respect to heaven, than to gaze upon it;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14215:3"/>
which could be no other but to dwell in it: whereupon
he inferred the soules immortalitie. Thereafter the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osophers
layd clearer grounds, and raised clearer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions:
and thereupon began to thinke of true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for an immortall soule. But though they resolved
that happinesse is the fruit of the union of the soul with
the eternall God, yet they fell foule both in the conceit
of their Gods, and of happinesse it selfe. Their carriage
to their gods was insolent: They tyrannized over them,<note place="margin">Tertull. Apol. Arnob. contra Gentes, Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius. <hi>Lactantius</hi>
               </note>
and served themselves of them rather than served them.
They <hi>made</hi> them; they <hi>casheered them:</hi> They <hi>ingaged</hi>
them for money, and exposed them to a <hi>licitation</hi> or ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in the market. And if they were not so rid of
them, they cast them as blockes to the backes of their
fires. And all the honour they gave to the things those
blocks represented, was to finde libertie to sinning. For
they honoured seditious Iupiter, contentious Mars,
drunken Bacchus, licentious Venus, &amp;c. that they might
finde a patrocinie of their sinnes in themselves,<note place="margin">Scurrilatis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius quam divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis officia. <hi>Aug. Civit.</hi>
               </note> and yet
they never sought true happinesse of any of them; for
the offices which they assigned to their <hi>select gods were
rather scurrilitie than divinitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner they erred both in the matter of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
and the way of acquiring it. As for happinesse,
though Saint Augustine multiply their opinions to 288.<note place="margin">Civit. 19. 1.</note>
yet they neither agreed among themselves, neither any
one of them apart with himselfe; and none of them all
found the truth. If we looke to them joyntly, they are
like blinde <hi>Andabats</hi> smiting other.<note place="margin">Aug. contra. Acad, 3. 7.</note> If severally, they
are like <hi>Bedlemits,</hi> every one feeding himself in his own
fancie, pretending a confidence that hee had found the
truth, but within full of restlesnesse. Cicero presenting
all these sects, sheweth that there was none of them
who tooke not prioritie to themselves. The Socraticks
seemed to come neere by their maxime.<note n="a" place="margin">Nihil se mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le qu√†m virum <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:14215:3"/>
S. Augustine asked a Pagan Philosopher, what was that
way to be good? He got no other answer, but that men
should be <hi>purged by sacrifices, and reconciled to God by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
of the lesser gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Plato over-reached them all, affirming,<note n="a" place="margin">In cognitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne &amp; imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Dei. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 8. 8.</note> 
               <hi>That true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
consisted in the knowledge and imitation of God.</hi>
He went also further to his purifications, ayming at the
reall change of the person, which Porphyre long after
him did purifie more: But they were nothing but the
evanishing of fleshly minds. Aristotle envying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Divinitie, turned him unto nature, and disputed
much of vertue; but proved miserable in his life, and
with the rest<note n="b" place="margin">Manciparunt virtutem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptati. <hi>Aug. Civit. 5. 19.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>mancipated vertue unto pleasure.</hi> And
though Epicurus by some abstract Maximes (gathered
by Seneca) would mitigate his brutish opinion; yet it
is sure hee pleaded all for base pleasure, and measured
happinesse as grosly as he did <hi>the Sun, whose diameter he
alledged was but two foot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they blinded both the world and themselves,
and for keeping their own credit, made men think there
were many happinesses,<note n="a" place="margin">Erant tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum multi er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rores erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, &amp; non multa summa bona. <hi>Aug. lib. arb. 2. 10.</hi>

               <hi>which were only errors, and
not many chief goods,</hi> And the best of them, when they

conversing with God, the exercise of his worship un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the law, and the preaching of the Prophets made it
to shine clearly long ere Thales advertised the world of
immortalitie. And yet when the Iewes would bee like
the Gentiles, they obscured that doctrine: And the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
brought into their Church Epicurus opinion of
the mortalitie of the soule. But Christ refuted their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and positively designed in one sentence more than
they all.<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 3. <hi>Aug. de mor.</hi> Ecc. 18.</note>

                  <bibl>PSAL. 27. VERS. 4.</bibl>
                  <q>One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek
after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
the dayes of my life, to behold the beautie of the
Lord, and to enquire in his temple.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His verse containeth the prophets choice
of <hi>true happinesse,</hi> and it is set down in <hi>foure</hi>
things. First <hi>indefinitely,</hi> that it is <hi>one
thing.</hi> Next, from whom he seeketh it, it is
from the <hi>Lord Jehovah.</hi> Thirdly, how he seeketh it:
and that is in two, for the time present he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
it; next for the time to come he will enquire it
constantly. The fourth is happinesse it self, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
described in foure points: First, what it is; A
<hi>dwelling.</hi> Next where; In the <hi>house of God.</hi> Thirdly,
the time how long; <hi>All the dayes of his life.</hi> Fourthly,
the end of that long dwelling is in two: The one to
<hi>behold</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> the beautie of the Lord: The other
<hi>to enquire in his temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first thing then is his choice,<note place="margin">Happinesse is but one thing.</note> summarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the word (<hi>one thing:</hi>) So Christ confirmeth
the prophets word,<note place="margin">Luke 10. 42.</note> while he called <hi>Maries</hi> choice
<hi>one thing.</hi> And that for these three reasons: First,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14215:6"/>
because it is not a common, but a chief good. If
there be any good above it,<note place="margin">Summo bono nihil est me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, aut su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perius, semper eodem modo se habens, semper sui simile est. <hi>Aug. de mor. Manich. cap. 1.</hi>
                  </note> it is not the chief good,
and if there be any good equall unto it, it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
But the chief good properly excludeth both a
superiour and an equall good, and therefore is one.
Next, because it is the <hi>last end</hi> which we minde eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to enjoy: If there be any end beyond it, it is not
the last, but amids, and a degree to it: All mids and
ends are used for it, but it is sought for it self, and
therefore must be but one. Thirdly, it is a <hi>center,</hi>
whereunto all reasonable spirits draw. As all lines
from a circle meet in the center, so every one that
seeketh happinesse aright meeteth in the chief good,
as the only thing which they intend, and therefore
must be one.</p>
               <p>But some may think,<note place="margin">And not moe.</note> that happinesse is in <hi>many</hi>
things,<note place="margin">Psal. 32. 1.</note> because scripture sometime sayes, <hi>Blessed is
the man whose sins are pardoned:</hi> and again, <hi>Blessed is
he that feareth the Lord:</hi> and in the beginning of the
first psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 1. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed is the man, &amp;c.</hi> the first text hath
in the plurall number <hi>be atitudines,</hi> the blessednesses
or happinesses of the man:<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> And Christ Jesus in his
sermon upon the mount reckoneth out many beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
or blessings. But I answer, that all these are but
divers respects or parts of one happinesse. As when
we say, that a man hath a whole hand, or a whole
leg, we make not many healths, but many parts of
one health. Happinesse is the soveraigne cure of our
miserie, and our miserie hath many parts, as the want
of knowledge, of faith, of peace, of uprightnesse, &amp;c.
And on the other part the presence of many evils, as
of sin originall and actuall, &amp;c. And with all these
sathan hath swadled us up in senslesnesse of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14215:6"/>
and carelesnesse of a remedie: Therefore Christ
beginneth in the doctrine of happinesse to loose us
out of these, and pronounceth the first blessing on
<hi>spirituall povertie,</hi> that is on the feeling of our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
And the second on our <hi>mourning</hi> for that felt
miserie; and the third on our <hi>hunger and thirst,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
us to seek and receive the remedie. So all these
particular blessings are but parts of one happinesse,
when God our chief good taketh away all our evil,
and imparteth his good to our happinesse. Neither
is the two-fold prayer of the wise man contrary to
the unitie of happinesse,<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Two things I have required
of thee:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Natura cogit animam unum quaerere, &amp; multitudo non sinit. <hi>Aug. de Ord. 1. 1.</hi>
                  </note> It is but a deprecation of the two extremes,
<hi>povertie and superfluitie,</hi> and but one prayer for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie
as the mids; Therefore this chief good is
only (One) <hi>Nature maketh our soul to seek one thing,
but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ultitude suffereth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this one thing is all good,<note place="margin">1. It is one for excellencie.</note> and beside it all
things are nothing, and though it be all and better
than all, yet it is called one, and that for <hi>excellencie,
sufficiencie, integritie,</hi> and <hi>efficacie. Excellencie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the best of all goods. Every good hath the
own degrees, as <hi>riches, beautie, honour,</hi> &amp;c. and these
degrees rise to the height of that kinde, and all these
highest degrees of all goods meet in this chiefest
good. This excellencie is seen in <hi>originall communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
preservation,</hi> and <hi>reduction.</hi> For <hi>originall,</hi> it is the
first good,<note place="margin">Bonum sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex omnis boni bonum, &amp; bonum quo cuncta bona sunt &amp; √† quo cuncta bona sunt. <hi>August. in hunc locum</hi>
                  </note> for if it be of any other, it is not the first,
but a secondarie good. It is good in it self, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it self; not by qualification, but by its own es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
<hi>It is a simple good, and the good of all good;
a good whereby all things are good, and from which
all good things are.</hi> For <hi>communication,</hi> because that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14215:7"/>
chief good keepeth not it self within it self, but
communicateth it to others; there is nothing in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or earth which partaketh not of Gods goodnes,
the reasonlesse creature hath his footsteps, and the
reasonable his image. This is the proper notion of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grace, when this chief good freely gives good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to the Elect, both finding &amp; fetching the reason
of that communication from its own goodnesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly for <hi>preservation,</hi> because it is a preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
goodnesse, keeping the good that it communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth,
and that either by a common providence, as
in common blessings, or else by a speciall preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
maintaining in the elect his saving goodnesse;
for if they fully or finally lose it, as they would be
the more miserable, so it were a sort of crossing the
greatest contentment of this goodnesse. The <hi>redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
is both in prosperitie and adversitie: in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
we consider temporall blessings as the good
gifts of God, yet we stand not there, but ascend to
spirituall blessings as better: And in spirituall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
we finde the common gifts of the Spirit, as
prophesie, knowledge, &amp;c. to be good; but we ascend
to the saving graces of the Spirit, as faith, hope, love,
&amp;c. as better. Neither stand we still there, but ascend
to the <hi>giving grace,</hi> even Gods free favour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
these <hi>given</hi> graces proceed: And from that
his free favour we ascend to himself who is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it self,<note place="margin">Non participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ullius bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni sed essentia. <hi>Aug. Mor. Man. 4.</hi>
                  </note> not by participation of any good, but
by his essence. But because in our prosperitie we are
slow to make this graduall ascension to God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he teacheth us a more harsh reduction in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie,
for when we are any wayes afflicted in the
blessings of God, we finde no rest till we return to
our chief good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:14215:7"/>
Secondly for <hi>sufficiencie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. One for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie.</note> and that both of <hi>furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>supply.</hi> Of furniture, because it sufficeth all;
for all persons, of whatsoever sex, qualitie, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for all places both in heaven and earth;<note place="margin">Omnibus omnia est, qui omnia administrat. <hi>Bernard.</hi> 124. 2.</note> for
all times both in this life and after it. It is ever the
same, and maketh us ever the same: it hath no change
in it self, but the communication of it groweth in
us, and what is now grace, shall be glorie in heaven.
If it could decay or lose, it were no happinesse but
miserie. It is for all <hi>necessities</hi> both of soul and
bodie, that one good is all-sufficient, there is none
beside it, and we need no other for happinesse. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is for all the powers of soul and bodie, to hold
them in their pleasant exercise and give them rest:
It busieth our faith to apprehend it, our hope to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it, our love to adhere to it, our joy to enjoy it,
our fear to eschew the losse of it, &amp;c. It hath also
the sufficiencie of <hi>supply.</hi> For God exerciseth his
children greatly about other blessings: either he
holdeth from us the thing we desire, or taketh from
us the thing we love, or spoileth it in our possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Therefore we have need of some biding sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to supply these losses, and this is God alone:
for if we finde him present, we can easily bear with
any losse.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Elkanah</hi> said to <hi>Hannah, Am I not worth

to countervail the losse of a thousand blessings.
If a merchant have his stock of some hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
secured on the land, he is not greatly grieved
though he lose a little by sea.</p>
               <p>Thirdly for <hi>integritie,</hi> because it is a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
thing.<note place="margin">3. One for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie.</note> The chief good cannot be divided, but is
as indivisible as infinite: as unitie in number exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

multitude, so in essence it excludeth division,
and the mistaking of this division made first <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi>
and then <hi>Plato</hi> to evanish in their mysticall
numbers, though some with more charitie than veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
have laboured to smooth it: We partake not God
by parts, but wholly, for he who hath him hath all
and is wholly possessed of him. When Christ saith,
<hi>Come to me all ye that are wearie and laden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 28.</note> he offereth
all happinesse to all, and it is possessed alike of all and
of every one.<note place="margin">Pariter ab om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus totum, &amp; √† singulis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidetur. <hi>Aug. de Verb. Dom. ser.</hi> 18. fol. 47. col. 4.</note> As every one heareth the whole word
when it is preached. For the kingdome of God is not
diminished by the increase of possessours, because it
is not divided, and everyone hath that entirely which
many possesse in concord. There is no matter of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,
because it is sufficient for all,<note place="margin">Simul omnes plen√® integre<expan>

Christs disciples envied other in the beginning, but
when they were filled with the holy Ghost they did
not so. Envie reigneth in carnall men about tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
things, they are so small in themselves that they
cannot suffice all, and so proper in their possession
that what one hath another wants: But if God dwell
in us, his fulnesse excludeth occasion of envie, and
his goodnesse excludeth the possibilitie of it:<note place="margin">Non est socialis <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>For God

                  <hi>It is not a sociall happinesse that envieth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Fourthly for the <hi>efficacie:</hi> It is an <hi>uniting</hi> good,<note place="margin">4. One for effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie.</note> and
bindeth all in one who partake it. That participation
is an union and adherence, and by vertue of that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with it they are unite to other, the goodnesse they
receive is a band among themselves as well as to it:
God is that fountain-goodnesse and hath summed
up all in himself, they are all of one originally, in one
by sustaining, and to one finally. The foure elements
concurre to make one body, the body and soul make
up one man, &amp; many men make up one citie or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or armie: But spiritually it is more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
how many gifts, graces, and powers make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
man, and many renewed men make up one
mysticall body of Christ,<note place="margin">

                  </note> all of them are one in that
head, and with that head they are all one with God.
<hi>I in them and thou in me, that they may be one as we are

union with the Father, the one is <hi>consubstantiall, but
ours is consentible:</hi> That is in <hi>substance,</hi> but this is in <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
for we are one spirit with God;<note place="margin">Acts 4. 32.</note> that is, <hi>native,</hi> but
this is <hi>factitious</hi> or wrought by grace: That is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an union in unitie, but this is only in <hi>unition.</hi> In like
manner he uniteth us among our selves,<note place="margin">Omnes in eo unum sunt qui vident eandem faciem divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam. <hi>Confess.</hi> 10. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>the multitude
of the faithfull were of one heart, and of one minde,</hi>
because who ever see and love the divine face are
one. He is as a center and sendeth out his divine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
<hi>and sheddeth abroad his love in the hearts of his
own,</hi>

                  </note> and all these hearts meet in him again. So the
faith &amp; love of <hi>Abraham</hi> meeteth with our faith and
love in him. Thus then he tieth us to himself when he
is our chief good, and worketh the good in us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to him: <hi>As for me it is good to adhere to the Lord.</hi>
He adhereth to the Lord, who being beloved of God
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14215:9"/>
sucketh God in himself again by love: So when God
and man inhere mutually in other,<note place="margin">Mut<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> and are <hi>enbowelled
by mutuall love,</hi> then God is in man, and man in God:
This is our happie adherence to our chief good. It is
our first and greatest and chiefest good to abide in
him.</p>
               <p>Finally, this unitie is seen in the order, degrees, and
cession: Order, because all order is from one to
one. Degrees, because there is an ascension of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to one God in whom all good things are most
only one, for truth, wisedome, power, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
diversly, and work divers affections and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in us, are all one in him: and our straitnesse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him communicate them to us but partially, as
his knowledge to help our ignorance, his wisedome
to cure our folly, his power our weaknesse. Cession,
because everie good thing naturally yeeldeth to a
better good, as the body yeelds to the soul, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to reason, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Hereof we may learn,<note place="margin">Happinesse is not in many things.</note> first that happinesse is not
in many things: The multitude think otherwise, for
they are led by sense, and must have their eye filled
with a multitude of things; riches, honour, wealth,
and these increased, and multiplied are their choice.
<hi>Many things import not perfection, but weaknesse, and
the necessitie of their number proveth the infirmitie of
their worth.</hi> If one sufficed, there were no need of
moe, but when a number serveth not necessitie, all are
proven to be weak. They feel a bodily and present
necessitie, but not a spirituall, and therefore seek a
sufficient supply of some bodily thing, but cannot
finde it. As a man falling in water grippeth sticks,
or straw that swim beside him for help, but he and all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14215:9"/>
go to the ground together: and as a man in fever
changeth many places to finde rest, but in stead of
rest, increaseth restlesnesse: So every one that seeketh
happines in other things beside God, findeth nought
but an increase of miserie. Besides, these things bring
not contentment, but rather with their increase aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their desire. The skin of a boy is sound, but
when he commeth to age it is full of wrinkles, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for more flesh and bones: So in the infancie of
our lot we are most content; but in its greatnesse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov. 30. 15.</hi> Abundantia laboriosa &amp; copiosaegestas. <hi>Aug. ver. Rel. 21.</hi>
                  </note>
and old age our inflamed desires cry with the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leach,
Give, give. This is their <hi>painfull abundance,
and abundant povertie, while they seek one thing after
another, and nothing remaineth, but in end they
conquish vanitie of vanities.</hi> Many have been better
content when they had but one attendant, than when
they are thronged with a great train: and some have
thought themselves richer with a small estate, than
when it is multiplied an hundred fold: The love of
money groweth ever with money. Gods blessings
are good indeed, yet none of them the chief good;
they are but as pettie goods, and a small shadow of
the true good, and as a drop of water out of that
great fountain and ocean God himself. They go on
their kindes, degrees, and numbers; but God hath
none of these, he is his own number, and his own
measure; he only <hi>is,</hi> and calleth himself by the name
<hi>I am:</hi> and to <hi>be,</hi> to <hi>live,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. confess. 3.</note> and to <hi>live happily,</hi> are not
divers things, because he is his own blessednesse.</p>
               <p>To close this first point, our dutie is to take God
for this one thing; that he be most in our <hi>minde</hi> to
know him, most in our <hi>heart</hi> to love him, most in our
<hi>mouth</hi> to honour, and most in our <hi>life</hi> to obey and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14215:10"/>
imitate him;<note place="margin">Cum te Deum meum quaero, beatam vitam quaero. <hi>Aug. Psal. 16. 5.</hi> Idem de mor. <hi>Ecc. 8.</hi>
                  </note> that as bees hyve upon a branch, so all
the powers of our soul adhere unto him. So the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
glorieth in it, <hi>The Lord is my portion:</hi> for God
is the summe of all our good, he is our chief good.
<hi>We ought not run down-ward, neither forward to seek
another; for the one is dangerous, the other wicked.</hi>
If we seek any thing beside God,<note place="margin">Confess. 5. 1.</note> we will lose him,
for he will not daigne to be possessed with another
chief good, for he loveth God lesse who loveth any
thing beside him, which he loveth not for him.</p>
               <p>A question here ariseth,<note place="margin">There is no chief ill.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether there be a chief
Ill as there is a chief good?</hi> And some have made two
eternall principles, one good, and one ill, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheans.
They taught also, that everie man had two
souls, one from the authour of good, and the other
from the authour of evill. But I answer plainly, that
<hi>there is not a chief ill in that sense as there is a chief
good.</hi> A chief ill implies contradiction, as we would
say, Being no-being, highest-lowest, perfection-annihilation.
For the chief good is a substance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
in goodnesse, and eternall in durance. But ill
is no substance, but a fault in substance, it hath no
subsisting in it self but in another, as a sicknesse that
is thrust on an whole body. Neither is ill <hi>infinite</hi> as
goodnesse, but only <hi>potentially</hi> as number, because
there are innumerable Ills; or respectively in deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
because sin deserveth infinite punishment: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it eternall, but came after the creation, for
God looked on all his creatures, and they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
good: but ill came afterward by the falling
of angels and men,<note n="a" place="margin">Oculus crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus bonus est, accessit caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas. <hi>Basil. 181. Aug. ver. Rel. 23.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The created eye was good, but
blindnesse came afterward.</hi> The vice of the soul is not
the nature of it, but contrarie to nature, wherefore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14215:10"/>
no Nature, nor substance, nor essence are ill.</p>
               <p>Men fell on that opinion of two chief principles
upon three speciall grounds.<note place="margin">The grounds of that error.</note> One that they looked
not to the <hi>universall cause,</hi> but to particular causes
of particular effects. The other, because they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
apart particular <hi>contrarie actions</hi> of good
and ill, and reduced them not to a common cause.
Thirdly, they were ignorant of the <hi>degrees of good
and ill;</hi> for when they saw in good there was good,
and better, and so an ascending to best of all, the
chief good; so seeing in ill there was ill and worse,
they thought there were degrees ascending to some
chief ill. But it is contrarie, for the degrees of good
<hi>ascend to a biding terme,</hi> and the greatest degree is
the best nature: But the degrees of ill are <hi>descending,</hi>
&amp; go not to a <hi>biding terme,</hi> but to annihilation, &amp; the
greater ill the lesse good or being, and the greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of ill is not highest but lowest; so that if there
could be a chief ill it would destroy it self,<note n="b" place="margin">Si contra se facit, ipsum esse sibi admit. <hi>Aug. Mor. Man.</hi> 2.</note> Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
maketh against it self, destroyeth it self, and what
ever becometh lesse than it was is ill, not in so farre
as it is, but in so farre as it becometh lesse, and
so tendeth to death. Sinne hath a motion, but it is
<hi>a defective motion,</hi> because it is a falling from God:
But good hath a <hi>perfective motion,</hi> because it is an
approaching to God.</p>
               <p>But if we speak popularly,<note place="margin">Foure things come under that name.</note> four things come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of the chief ill: <hi>A principle</hi> or <hi>root:</hi>
a <hi>fruit:</hi> the <hi>punishment:</hi> and a <hi>substance</hi> in whom
these three do meet. The root or principle of all
ill is free-will in angels and men,<note place="margin">Ill root.</note> for when God had
made all good, and his work stood in perfect beautie,
Sathan brought in the first ill; not of any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14215:11"/>
without, nor corruption within, but of his own
free-will. He would not be subject to God, but
would set himself in a sort of <hi>dominion.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he tempted man, who without either necessitie
in his lot, or corruption in his soul upon the bait of
equalitie with God, of his own <hi>free-will</hi> would break
the command.<note place="margin">Ill fruit.</note> The <hi>worst fruit</hi> is sin, for Sathans sin
was great, because in a great angel, and directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God; and his will keepeth the stamp of his
first defection, so that he cannot repent, because he
will not, yea he will not so much as wish a will or
power to repent: and mans sins likewise are great,
because they flow from that same free-will which
now is a slave to sin.<note place="margin">Ill punishment</note> The <hi>worst punishment</hi> is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
because the just reward of the worst fruit
from the worst root, and an eternall torment of soul
and bodie.<note place="margin">Ill nature, or substance.</note> And the <hi>worst natures</hi> in whom these do
meet, are evil angels and men, and Sathan the worst
of them all, because his worst will hath greatest
sin, and shall finde greatest punishment. In a word,
the worst ill in man is sin, and the punishment. <hi>That
is a willing defection from the chief good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. ver. Rel. c. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
labour among extreme evils.</hi> Which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we may call libertie from Justice, and a flavery

               <p>Two uses rise of this question. The first is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that good is greater than ill;<note place="margin">Good is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ill.</note> for good is in God
and God himself, and ill is nothing but the losse of
good, and falling of creatures from him. Therefore
when our conscience checketh us for the greatnesse
of our sin, we should remember there is greater
goodnes in God than ill in us: And the <hi>sin against the
holy Ghost</hi> is not called unpardonable, as though
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14215:11"/>
Gods goodnesse could not pardon it, but because the
guiltie will not repent, for the very nature of that
sin standeth in a malitious oppugning, and hating
of God and his grace.</p>
               <p>The second use is our warning concerning ill,<note place="margin">The least ill is great.</note> that
albeit there be not a chief ill, <hi>yet every ill is great.</hi>
There is some ill comparatively lesse than another,
as fornication is lesse than adulterie, and an offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
lye is lesse than a pernicious; yet there is no ill
properly little, but the least ill is great enough to
cut us off from the chief good. For were a sin never
so little in the sight of the world, yet if we live and
dye in it without repentance, it shall prove a bar to
hold us out of heaven, and a weight to pull us down
to hell.</p>

is clear, both by the properties of a fountain, and
some instances. The properties of the fountain of
happines are three: That it be <hi>happy</hi> it self; that it
<hi>impart happinesse</hi> to other without diminishing it
self; and that it <hi>preserve</hi> that happines it imparteth.
These three are proper to God alone, for he is the<note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 5. 4. 16.</note>

therefore the apostle crieth out,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> O the <hi>deepnesse of the

not impare it, but it abideth ever the same fulnes.

either <hi>diminishing</hi> or <hi>augmenting.</hi>

but left to our own free-will, and that free-will
overthrew us: we were like a fair lock without the

                  <p>Three instances prove the same: The first is from
reasonlesse creatures,<note place="margin">Three instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> the lion roareth for meat, the
dog howleth, the ox loweth for fodder, &amp;c. these
creatures have no sense of God, but of their own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14215:12"/>
the authour of nature for help.<note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 145. 15</note> 
                     <hi>The eyes of all
things wait on thee.</hi> The second is in children, who
being either afraid suddenly or provoked, cry on
God. Though then they be neither sensible of the
work of reason nor of grace, yet God giveth them
these beginnings of amore resolute seeking to him,
while they call to him as the fountain of their safety.
The third instance is of men come to age, and these
either hypocrites or atheists, for I need not speak
of the godly who openly professe him the fountain
of their happines. The fashioned prayers of the
hypocrite, though they be without his heart, proves
God to be this fountain: and the forced prayers of
the atheist in his necessitie, telleth likewise that he is
the fountain of happines.</p>
                  <p>From this ground we have first some errours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute,
and then our dutie to learn. The errours about
the fountain of happines are dangerous.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Pagans sought happines of themselves.</note> the <hi>Pagans</hi> made themselves the authours of
it in thinking they had a <hi>sufficiencie by nature to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and work their own happinesse.</hi> They knew not
that man was made good in <hi>Adam,</hi> that he fell, and
is now corrupt, and hath need of regeneration: But
they thought he was never better than he is now, and
that he may be better by the right use of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sufficiencie. This was Sathans craft, for he knew
that man had a naturall notion of happines, and a
care to finde it, therefore he set both these wrong, and
made man think he needed not go out of himself for
happines. This was not in the grosser sort only,
who placed happines in <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>bodily things,</hi>
but even in these <hi>Philosophers</hi> who placed it in the
gifts of the <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>vertuous actions,</hi> they were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14215:13"/>
puffed up with pride of their own strength both to
work these actions, and to ingage their gods to give
them happines, as the just fruit and consequent of
their vertue: So they ascribed not things to their <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,</hi>
but to <hi>nature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non authori attribuebant, sed naturae, autsuae industriae. <hi>Ber. Cant. 6. &amp; 22.</hi>
                     </note> or their own <hi>industrie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
And yet in vain they either disputed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
of vertues which they had not without him:
<hi>So they could finde no true happinesse, because they
sought their own happinesse, and they had no true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
who had not the Lord of vertues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned their gods.</note> But Sathan led them on farther to <hi>contemne their
gods in the matter of happinesse:</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Non invene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt felicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem veram, quia suam vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luerunt felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem. <hi>Aug. epist. 48.</hi>
                     </note> for they sought
it not from any of them; and it was long ere felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was made a goddesse, and being made, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
assigned her a place without the ports. If they
had worshipped her according to her name, they
might have neglected all other gods beside her. It is
a wonder how godlesse they were about the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of their gods; for they imployed their <hi>select
gods</hi> in base offices, for <hi>begetting, bringing forth,</hi> and
<hi>nourishing of children,</hi> for their food and trifling bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines,
whereas they neglected <hi>Mens</hi> (of whom they
held the soundnes and goodnes of their minde) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of <hi>Venus, Ceres and Bacohus;</hi> in all which they
testified they were more brutish than reasonable.
And lastly to tell the conceit they had of their own
felicitie, they gave to their greatest gods (<hi>Jupiter and
Juno</hi>) their names from <hi>helping</hi> only, as though they
had power to do their own turn, and lacked nothing
but some small and accessorie help of the gods.
They took the greatest part of the work to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and the greatest praise, and so made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
their own gods, and gave no other respect to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14215:13"/>
the gods but of servants without any relation to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines.
They sought trifles from their greatest gods,
and greatest things from their triviall and basest
gods, but <hi>sought happinesse from none of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same errour Sathan brought in the church by
<hi>Pelagius,</hi> he is the father of that spirituall pride,<note place="margin">Pelagius the father of that pride.</note> that
naturall man is able to purchase happines, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not grace for <hi>efficacie,</hi> but for <hi>facilitie</hi> of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And that he is so sufficiently disposed to receive
grace, that he needeth no more but a generall offer.
After that Sathan for three ages had laboured to
make the Godhead <hi>contemptible</hi> by innumerable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
he turned him to exalt and deifie humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by Pelagianisme, and put such a trick upon the
church, that he turned mans free-will in a <hi>seat of war</hi>
against the grace of Christ, and the<note n="m" place="margin">Radix pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati libertas. Basil, 128.</note> 
                     <hi>root of all our
miserie</hi> in the <hi>root of merit,</hi> and the cause of our first
and perpetuall falling in the cause of <hi>happinesse.</hi> He
was craftie in his choice, for it is the strongest power
of the soul, and hath a naturall indifferencie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
things, and a libertie in working, and therefore
the most fit power either to present as a <hi>counterfeit</hi>
of grace, or to imploy as opposite to grace.</p>
                  <p>The papists have followed both:<note place="margin">Popish pride.</note> They are busie
with many gods, and though they seem to imploy
them about happines, yet they take more of the work

grace, and not conferring it, and ascribe to him
but a help without a principall and effectuall work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But they make their own will mistresse of her
actions, and not subordinate to the will of God, nor
taking influxe nor determination from grace, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
it self as a naturall principle which they
have of <hi>Adam:</hi> And whereas sometime they were
content to call the will a power partly <hi>passive,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>active,</hi> now since they are Jesuited they will have
it with <hi>Pelagius</hi> a meere active power as another
principle, beside God which properly is a pure act.
Herein they usurpe upon the grace of God, even as
the Pope did upon principalitie; for as he (void of
civil power in himself) begged some of it from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and in end overthrew them: So they who craved
at the beginning some power to free-will, make it
now an usurper against grace. They are <hi>ingrate to
grace, giving it no thanks</hi> for its work, and exalt
their own nature as sufficient of it self without grace
to salvation; They take the glory of the work to
themselves, and are not content with the glory that
God worketh. They make him only a witnesse to
their work, and ingage him to recompense their
pride with salvation, which deserveth to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14215:14"/>
God,</hi> or when he altogether contemneth
himself in comparison of God. But if he please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the perverse imitation of God while he will
enjoy his own power, then he is so much the lesse as
he desires to be great. For while the will turneth
from the common good to the particular, it is sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from it, when it will be of its own power.</p>
                  <p>This is pride, the beginning of all sin,<note place="margin">Aug. Lib. Arb. 2. 19. <hi>Happinesse is Gods gift.</hi>
                     </note> and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

<hi>Frank-arbitrians</hi> pride. I touch this not for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in controversies, but to shew that their question
of free-will is of no lesse moment that <hi>Whether God
in Christ, or we be the causes of our happinesse; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are saved by the good will of God or our own
free-will.</hi> Therefore God in wisedome made <hi>Luther</hi>
to clear these two joyntly. Our happinesse in the
grace of Christ, and our miserie in our naturall will,
which justly according to scripture and pure anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
he called it <hi>slavish-will,</hi> and affirmed that the

                  <p>Another errour about the fountain of happinesse
is in the multitude: They <hi>seek it by ghesse,</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 4. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Who will
let us see good?</hi> All is here uncertain, an unknown
happines, wished with a wandring desire from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
authour. If Sathan came in their way who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14215:15"/>
all the kingdomes of the earth to Christ, they
would soon agree with him: And some go so far on
as to covenant with him expresly for to satisfie their
wicked desires of riches, honour, revenge, pleasure,
&amp;c. They are the <hi>shame of men and Sathans mocking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocks,</hi>
who first inflaming them with excessive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
blindeth them both with imaginary satisfaction,
and the price of it: they value a shadow at no lesse
price than the losse of soul and body eternally.
There be also many who seek happinesse of him,
though not in so expresse a bargain, they care not to
loose their credit, honestie, and conscience to come
to their desire, and to oppresse or deceive their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to make themselves great. They bargain with
Satan as well as the other, and there is no difference
between them, but that the first expresly covenanteth
with him, and the second serveth him without a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Both seek happines by the meanes of sin, &amp; shall
have the same punishment in hell, except they repent.</p>
                  <p>Others again as the <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> make the

And though we lost it, yet still he runneth over more
abundantly to us in Christ, and a part of this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
is his grace, making us to seek happines: We
have a confused notion of it by nature, but he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it by his word and spirit, and it is the work of his
speciall grace, that maketh us both seek and finde it

                     <hi>The instruction wherewith he dealeth
with us to seek God, floweth from the fountain it self.</hi>
But this is an unspeakable goodnes, that rather than
we receive not grace, he will send his own Son in our
nature, and turn that our nature, which he assumed
to a personall union with the word, in a conduit to
convey grace unto us: <hi>The humane nature of Christ
is as a chanell between this fountain and the faithfull for
the influence of grace.</hi> It is sayd to the Godhead by
a personall union, &amp; to the heart of every beleever
by a spiritual union. God and we were more distant
than heaven and hell: and how should that fountain
communicate its goodnes to us, but by that chanell
of our own nature? in Christ we receive it both kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and largely: He is the fountain of grace, as God
one with his Father: he hath deserved it by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and dispenseth it to us as<note n="h" place="margin">Est Deus qu√≤ itur, est ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo qu√† itur. Au. Civ. 11. 1. <hi>Gen. 29. 2, 20.</hi>

                  <p>This is the sweet respect that this fountain of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> difficulty of this <hi>inquiry is</hi> first <hi>from the nature
of happinesse: It is hid</hi> manna, the eye hath not seen it,
nor the eare heard it, &amp;c. And this <hi>our life</hi> is hid with
Christ in God. Next from the multitude of false
happinesses that deceive us: For Satan hath filled
the way of our inquiry with sundry baits to divert
us from the right, that on them we may stick as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the chief good, <hi>and embrace</hi> our own fancies.
Thirdly from our own disposition we are all born
with a desire of happines, and every life in it own
kinde desires to be better. If we ask any man though
he were a fool, <hi>would you be happy?</hi> He would answer
<hi>I would:</hi> For <hi>every being is desirous of</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">Ipsa est vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta beata quam omnes volunt, &amp; omnino qui nolit eam nemo est. Aug. Conf. 10. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>goodnesse or
well being:</hi> The desire of meat, drink, raiment are no
more rooted in us than that desire of happines, and
these smallest desires serve the greatest: The <hi>appetite
of the wills sacietie</hi> (which the schools call happines)
is common, but few know the reason of that saciety,
so that many labouring to choose a particular hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
which their common appetite desired, have
chosen misery for happines: It is as hard to finde out
true happines as it is easie to have the common desire
of it the one hath need of a supernaturall grace, as the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14215:17"/>
other floweth from a naturall power. Fourthly, the
<hi>practice</hi> of all ages proveth this difficultie: for of the
many millions that sought out happines, none did
finde it out except those whom God assisted by a
speciall grace. The Philosophers travelled painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but brought out the winde; they were confident
that they had found it, and yet found it not: But that
confidence was double miserie, both in missing true
happines, and then in resting upon their own deceit.
They neither agreed with the truth, nor among
themselves, nor any one of them with himself. If
we look to the universall desire, rising from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
notion, we shal be forced to say, There is a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines:
if we look on their diversitie, and contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
we shall wonder at Sathans craft, abusing mans
wit to erre so fouly about happines. And Solomon
himself thought this task both worthy of him, and
hard for him to finde out, <hi>what was that good or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
of the sons of men?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 3.</note> Wee must think it an hard
task, whereon so many Philosophers have lost their
labour, their time, and themselves.</p>
                  <p>The search it self goeth in two: the <hi>refusing</hi> of ill,
and <hi>choosing</hi> of good.<note place="margin">3. The forme of the search.</note> The ill of sin must simply
be refused, whether it be <hi>originall or actuall, inherent
or adherent guiltinesse.</hi> It is the cause of our misery,
and contrarie to good; it cannot enter in happines,
but stayes it in us. Our miserie began at it, and our
happines beginneth in turning from it. Adam was
tried by the tree of knowledge of good and ill, which
told him that so long as hee stood, hee had a <hi>known
good,</hi> and was free from an <hi>unknown ill:</hi> But when
he fell, he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>o und experimentall knowledge of a <hi>lost
good</hi> and <hi>purchased ill:</hi> That tree is yet our triall, if
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14215:18"/>
we will eschew the ill of sin, and follow the good of
happines. There can be no happines in ill, neither
can any man desire or love ill as ill, and <hi>sathan</hi> (whose
malice is fed with it) <hi>doth not love it as ill, but as a
good, as a satisfaction of his malitious will;</hi> And those
men are most like to him, who seek their happines in
ill. They make it their happines when they boast of
it, as Lamech of his tyrannie, and Doeg of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
and politicks, that they can plot mischief,
and bring it to passe. Who ever glorieth in sin, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
that he counteth it his happines.</p>
                  <p>It may here be demanded:<note place="margin">Afflicton stayeth not happinesse.</note> 
                     <hi>If affliction can stand
with happines?</hi> The name of it is miserable to the
worldly; <hi>but that name hurteth not, where miserie is
absent</hi>

                     </note>. I answer, it can: for it is not the ill of sin, or
of the fault, but the ill of punishment; and there is
more miserie in the least sin than in the greatest
crosse:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 10.</note> and the Apostle called not himselfe misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

of his will against the law of his spirit,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> hee
cryes out, <hi>Miserable man that I am.</hi> Gods love is the
ground of our happines,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> and affliction can stand well
with it, <hi>for whom he loveth, he chasteneth.</hi> Sin wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the soul and bodie, and wasteth the conscience,
but affliction purgeth all, and maketh Gods grace
more sharp, and lively. Sin can admit no qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but must either be simply pardoned or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but affliction is qualified with grace to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and furthereth them to happines; so that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
pronounceth them <hi>happie that are chastened of the
Lord:</hi> Our happines is in no externall good, but in
Gods favour, and the state of our person qualified
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14215:18"/>
with his grace and image in us: But affliction,
though it spill externall blessings, yet it neither sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
us from his favour, neither destroyeth his
grace, but augmenteth it. It can make us no more
miserable, than prosperitie maketh the wicked hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
We need not now compare Lazarus in heaven
with the rich man in hell:<note place="margin">Luke <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </note> Even in this life, <hi>Lazarus

<hi>The best souldiers are set on hardest service,</hi> and none
of them going out exponeth it as their Generals
base account of them; but rather, that he esteemeth
highly of their valour. God keepeth us from more
miserie in making us repent former sin, and keeping
us from sin that we might commit, than all the ill
that affliction bringeth on us. Our daily crosses
chase us daily to God who is our happines: and the
godly count more of grace than of goods.<note place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> Job, after

                  </p>
                  <p>The second respect is to good,<note place="margin">Choise of the best good.</note> that we <hi>choose</hi> it; and
that not every good, but the best: for wee are not
now inquiring everie good, but the chief. Herein
we must climb in two ascensions, the one in our self,
the other in goods. For our self, we must not bide in
our bodily senses, which are evill Judges of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
but we must ascend from our body to our <hi>spirit,</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:14215:19"/>
from our <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>will</hi> to our <hi>reason,</hi> and from
that to the <hi>eternall law</hi> the rule of reason, and from
that to <hi>eternall veritie</hi> the informer of reason in that
law: So we must rise to the <hi>inlightned minde</hi> in Jesus
Christ, that we may be inabled to make this search
aright.</p>
                  <p>Next we must ascend by the <hi>degrees of goodnesse</hi> in
the things themselves;<note place="margin">And that by degrees.</note> for every creature of God is
good, but not the chief good: Though we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it as good in the own kinde and degree, yet we
may not rest on it for happinesse. As a man that
seeketh a lost jewell in a house, casteth by all that
cometh to hand till he finde it: Or as one in a well
furnished shop seeking rare stuffe, though the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
put many in his hand after other, yet he layeth
them all by, till he finde that he desires: So in this
search of happinesse, what ever good come in our
way, we must shift it till we come to the chief good.
If we ascend to the height of a <hi>minde inlightned by
God,</hi> nothing will content us till we come to himself:
<hi>As his own light</hi> discovereth him, so his own <hi>love
shed abroad in our heart</hi> cannot rest on any good till
it come to him. <hi>The dove sent out by Noah</hi>

                     <hi>found no
rest till she returned to the ark, so the inquiring minde</hi>
findeth no rest in the creature till it come to God in
the covenant of grace. <hi>Spirituall</hi> things are better
then <hi>temporall,</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> things better then <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and in spirituall things we must ascend from <hi>gifts</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14215:19"/>
                     <hi>giving</hi> grace, that maketh us acceptable: And from

                  <p>Reason it self craveth this,<note place="margin">God is the best good.</note> for we ought to seek

who made them: They have their goodnesse of
him, which is infinitely lesse then his goodnesse, as a
drop of water compared to the sea: They are both
better and greater in him then in themselves, and
more truly also, as the originall is better then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.
All goodnesse is both originally and eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in him, and more perfect then in creatures, because
what is in them a shadow, in him is truth: If we love
<hi>riches, true riches is in his favour;</hi> If we love <hi>honour,

it is in his peace.</hi> The authour of things is better

                     <hi>hatred and love:</hi> Of <hi>hatred,</hi> that we hate all ill abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.
There are degrees of ill, some lesse and some
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14215:20"/>
greater, and answerably we should hate them all, but
we may not love any degree of ill: this is our separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from it; for though it subsist in our substance
&amp; flesh, yet if it be not in our affection, but we abhor
it, then God will assist us against it. It may lessen the
degrees of our happinesse, but cannot destroy it: In
like manner, there are <hi>degrees of good,</hi> and we should
love every good according to the degree, till we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the chief good, and love him with all our
heart, and all our soul. These <hi>affections qualifie our
person,</hi> for the hatred of ill divideth us from that ill
we hate, and the love of good maketh us like that
good we love; And our love to the degrees of good,
maketh us grow in goodnesse and grace. The wicked
keep neither this <hi>order</hi> nor <hi>aseending:</hi> They pervert
all, and chuse for their happinesse a lesser good then
they refuse, as worldly goods in place of heavenly.
That is both a transposing of their heart and a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending,
and so they prove <hi>the sons of Belial,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Hebrew, because they <hi>neither ascend in
the Lords mountaine,</hi> but are unthrifts; neither take
on them the <hi>Lords yoak,</hi> and it is their naughtinesse or
knaverie, according to the Latines, that they turn
themselves to nothing; <hi>for knaverie is the death of the
life, so called because it turneth to nothing</hi>

                  <p>But we must further <hi>distinguish these affections,</hi> for
though we should hate all sinfull ill, yet we may not

                  <p>Moreover all these idols of the world are cut off
from happinesse, because they are common as well
to the wicked as to the godly, which cannot fall in

                     <hi>they love them better then God,</hi> and from

make not. It is truly said that they who love, fain
dreams to themselves; The wretch thinketh that
riches cry on him, saying, <hi>Come to me, I shall make
thee happy:</hi> The ambitious man thinketh honour
cryes so to him, so the epicure dreameth of pleasure,

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14215:21"/>
the errour of their fansie turned into a strong
desire, maketh them father such promises on these

is our reproch that we beleeve things that neither
promise nor can perform, and hazzard our eternall
happinesse on that credulitie: But when God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
who is both truth and omnipotencie, wee
meet his word with infidelitie: If these things could
speake, they would chide their lovers as the angels
did the woman seeking Christ in the grave, <hi>Why seek
yee the living among the dead? Why seek ye happinesse
in us who have it not, but are worse then your selves?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some again who seem more perfect,<note place="margin">Happinesse is not in the gifts of the minde.</note> seek happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the <hi>gifts of the minde,</hi> as <hi>learning, vertue,
wisedome,</hi> &amp;c. These are better than the former, and
yet come not to true happinsse; for these gifts are
common, and many wicked men have excelled in
them, and yet perished. They are as the light to the
eye without seeing, a furnishing to seek it without
fruit: The Philosophers who excelled most in these
things were most miserable: The fleshly villanies of
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle <hi>equalled and exceeded
their morall vertues.</hi> Solomon found not happinesse
in these morall vertues, but in the fear and obedience
of God.</p>
                  <p>All these erred foully in their search,<note place="margin">The godly surpasse the world.</note> yet not alike.
The world is as a great mans house, to whom many
resort: Some stay in the lower roomes with their
companions; but some go to the hall, and yet stand
there gazing on pictures, or rich hangings, but the
wiser sort passe all these, and stay not till they finde
him in his cabinet. So all men are busie for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14215:22"/>
but the most part remain below on riches and
pleasure: Other that seem of greater spirits, climb up
to honour, and are bewitched with the painted hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of worldly glorie, or adore the gifts of their
own minde: But the godly pittie these men in their
errours, who are intised with such trifles. They
know that they are not called to a worldly felicitie,
but to a heavenly; they passe from one good to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and urge pensively their inquirie, till they
come to God himself. So the church in her search
could not stay, <hi>till she found him whom her soul loved.
God is above all, whom if we follow we learn well; if we
apprehend, we learn both well and blessedly: his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

So in the search of happinesse, the more labour the

                  <p>But the experience of the Saints, will clear this

his consultations ending in just sentences: His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell-house
for this inquirie was his heart, I said in my
heart:</hi> where gathering all his thoughts in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, he pondered things deeply. Next he
proponeth the purpose for consultation, <hi>that he
might see what was that good for the sons of men, which
they should do uuder the heaven all the dayes of their
life.</hi> Thereafter he bringeth in all these common
places of worldly happinesse, as <hi>riches, honours, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
possessions, &amp;c.</hi> and sentenceth every one of
them: <hi>This also is vanitie and vexation of spirit.</hi>

gathereth Paradoxes, adjudging rather happinesse
to the contrary of these things, than to themselves.<note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 6. 4. &amp; 10.</note>

of all,<note n="*" place="margin">Eccl. 12. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>that to fear God and keep his commandments, is

discourse,<note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie,</hi> it is like
a program affixed on the entrie of a citie, to tell that
all things in the world are but vanitie: vanitie in their

vanitie in their <hi>work,</hi> because they work not that
good we expect; and vanitie in their <hi>durance,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they perish in using: The first is a <hi>vacuitie;</hi> the
second is a <hi>weaknesse;</hi> and the third an <hi>evanishing.</hi>
And his conclusion is to set us upon that chief good,
to wit God, and his worship.</p>
                  <p>The second practice is in the Apostle,<note place="margin">S. Pauls expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note> who had
many priviledges; he was a Jew<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 22.</note>, brought up at the
feet of Gamaliel, profited greatly in learning, and so
zealous of the law, that he<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 9. 2.</note> sought commissions to
persecute the Gospell: But when he compareth all
these things with the excellent knowledge of
Christ, he counteth them but<note n="*" place="margin">Philip. 3. 8.</note> losse and doung, and
setteth down his choice of true happinesse in termes,
that after long inquirie,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>he had judged and decreed
to know nothing but Christ and him crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two errours in the inquirie of happinesse are here
to be condemned:<note place="margin">Not to search is brutish.</note> The first <hi>seeketh not at all;</hi> they
think happinesse is easily found, and will fall to them
as rype fruit: And because they look easily up to
heaven, they think it as easie to go up thither; But
they should remember, that though naturally the
way be broader, because it is from the center to the
circle, yet spiritually it is straiter, because God is
our center, and we upon the earth are in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14215:24"/>
They are as grosse as beasts, who have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>foresight, consultation,</hi> nor <hi>election,</hi> and are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
only with the sway of appetite, which is not
much different from the weight of a stone: These
men say in their heart,<note place="margin">Psal. 14. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>that there is not a God;</hi> and
though the common notions of nature tell them
there is one,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>they hold that righteousnesse of God in
unrighteousnesse;</hi> but in the matter of happinesse,
though they have a naturall appetite of it, yet they
take no paines to seek it out. Herein they carrie their
conviction in their bosome: for in all other matters
they use consultation, as in contracts of marriage,
plees for their inheritance: But in the matter of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
how few dare say, that in all their life time
<hi>they have taken one houre to advise ripely, how to come
to it?</hi> We have all time and leisure enough for other
matters, but little or none for happinesse. I know
that every one cannot make that painfull inquirie
like Solomon and Paul. God was to imploy them
to teach others, and therefore tooke more paines on
them; yet every one in some measure should make

                  <p>Of all that is spoken of this search,<note place="margin">The godly are happie in their search.</note> we gather three
things: The happinesse of the godly man in his
search; The distinction of mankind; And our duty.
The <hi>happinesse of the godly,</hi> in that they are not left to
themselves, but are guided therein by a divine wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and justice: In <hi>wisedome,</hi> because they passe by
all other things, till they come to God: They count
of other goods as becommeth, but not as the chief
good, they are lesser goods, but not prime, <hi>they follow
happinesse, but lead not to it</hi>

                     <hi>They love that, that
cannot be taken from them:</hi> none can take God from
them. Many of the Ancients make these three equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent,
<hi>Wisedome, Veritie,</hi> and <hi>Happinesse,</hi> because it
is truth that directeth to happinesse, and wisedome
that findeth it out, and this is true wisedome to chuse
the best, and the thing that will not be taken from us.
It was Maries wisedome, that she chused the thing
that would not be taken from her.</p>
                  <p>Next they are guided by divine <hi>Iustice,</hi>

things rightly, and their pure affections follow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,

‚ÄîMankind hath many divisions, but this is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

                     <hi>Many
say who will let us see good things? But Lord lift up
above me the light of thy countenance.</hi> This is not like
Martha and Marie:<note place="margin">Aug. de Verb. Dom. serm. 26. 27.</note> These two sisters choice were
both good, for Marthaes businesse was commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but Maries was better: The one was busie in the

Marie, who neglected his body, to feed her owne
soul, than of Martha, who neglected her owne soul,
to feed his bodie: <hi>He was fed in spirit by her, whose
spirit he did feed:</hi> This was a work of the same love,
that made him neglect himself to save us; he came to
do divine things, and to suffer humane miseries for
us, and so to be hungrie and eat: He subjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be a guest in mans houses, who is preparing

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iacob and Esau</hi> do more represent these parties, the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14215:27"/>
one in pietie waiting on God, and injoying the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
The other profanely contemning the blessing,
and following his fleshly delights. Sometimes the
godly will follow the common errour, and chuse
the world, as<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 13. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Lot inticed with the fatnesse of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
chused to dwell in Sodome; but that folly cost
him deare, for beside the societie of Abraham, he
lost his wife, and all his goods: <hi>There is no other cure
of their folly, but the losse of that their choice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Herein the godly and the wicked,<note place="margin">The godly and the wicked have concord and discord.</note> have both a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi>
and <hi>discord</hi> in their choices: They agree in the
matter, in that they chuse contrary things, the godly
chuse God for their happinesse, and the wicked, the
trifles of the world: They cannot encroach one on
another, for the <hi>choice</hi> of the one is the refuse of the
other, and the <hi>refuse</hi> of the one, is the choice of the
other: And yet they discord, because these contrary
courses flow from contrary dispositions, which
breaketh out in enmity in the wicked; for though
they be content, that the godlies choice leave the
trifles of the world to them, yet they are angrie at it,
because it proveth them fools, who chuse that
which the godly refuse: And Sathan augmenteth
this discord, to avenge his double quarrell upon the
godly: The one, in disdaining his baits, whereby he
allureth the wicked, the other, for loving of God,
whom he abhorreth: <hi>Yea the wicked mocke the godly
as fools, for their refusing of the world, and chusing of
God</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Aug. lib. Arb. 3. 5.</note>. <hi>But it is like Ismaels mocking of Isaac,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 21. 9.</note>, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as foolish children, mocking the prudence of
the ancient, which they can neither chuse nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
But the godly indure that ignorant censure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
as wise men do either contemne or neglect
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14215:28"/>
the ignorance of babes, or else bear with them, till
they come to riper judgement.</p>
                  <p>This expresseth that which God did by <hi>chusing
his owne out of the corrupt masse:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eternall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and temporall.</note> Albeit they were
borne twins as Jacob and Esau, yet they are divided
at their birth, and setting their backs to other, the
one runneth to God, the other to the world: The one
as <hi>right-handed men</hi> follow good: The other as
<hi>left-handed men</hi> follow ill: This is that Solomon
telleth us,<note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 10. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>That the heart of a wise man is at his right
hand, but the heart of a foole is at his left hand,</hi> that is,
not in situation, but in use: For God hath given our
soul many strong and sweet powers toward good,
as <hi>love,</hi> to love it; to <hi>desire</hi> it; to <hi>hope</hi> before we get
it; and <hi>rejoyce,</hi> when we have found it: These are as
the souls right hand, which in their worke to good,
carrieth her self dexterously. But ill is set at our left
hand, and God hath armed us against it, with <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
Feare</hi> ere it come, and <hi>Sorrow</hi> when it is come;
which serve to rebate and keep us in separation from
it: Therefore when the wicked set their soul for the
seeking and embracing of ill, they turne left-handed
like the Benjamites, who with their left-handed
skill,<note place="margin">Judg. 20. 16.</note> were foreward and able to defend a villanie;<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 144. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Their right hand is a right hand of iniquitie, because

                  <p>This furnisheth also to the godly a resolution, for

<hi>For no soul can chuse God for its portion, but that soul
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14215:28"/>
that is chosen of God,</hi> and our chusing of him is his
work in us, meeting that his eternall election in the

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state.</note> For if wee love
God sincerely, wee may be sure wee are beloved of
him, if we seek him: we are first sought of him; if we
finde him, we are first found of him in mercie: If we
desire him, we are the <hi>men of his desire,</hi> as<note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 10. 11.</note> Daniel
was: If we delight in him, we are the children of his
delight, &amp;c. For all these works of the soul neither
breed in us, neither begin at us, but he preveeneth us
in them all, and worketh that meeting to himselfe.
Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 Of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture state.</note> of our <hi>estate to come;</hi> For if wee be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed

                  <p>In the order it is to be marked,<note place="margin">Prayer and practice should be joyned.</note> that <hi>seeking</hi> of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
and <hi>praying</hi> for it, are well joyned together:
for if they be separate they are unprofitable. Some
<hi>pray only</hi> without labour, as the old <hi>Euchites.</hi> But
they should remember, that God who giveth us a
heart, and a tongue to pray, giveth us also hands and

                     <hi>Balaams warsh
wishing,</hi> his desires were so weak, that they pearced
not his heart, how could they pearce the heaven?
He put not his hand to labour, how should God
open his hand to blesse? They had no strength to
banish or mitigate his avarice or pride: The fleshly
heart cannot conceave the birth of true happinesse,
nor admit the love of it, and these weake wishes are
more forced on it from outward occassions, than
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14215:29"/>
bred in it, at least they are soon strangled by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
love of some vanitie.</p>
                  <p>Others take great paines to finde out happinesse,
but pray not to God for it, so the Philosophers
thought by their <hi>labour, and good use of naturall abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to attaine it, and would not pray for it</hi>

upon their grounds of a <hi>self-sufficiencie,</hi> they
needed not pray to him. Therefore we must joyne
them together. Labouring in faith is Gods presence
with us as his instruments, working that in us that
wee pray for: In prayer, wee crave that he would
worke happinesse in us: In labour, we strive that he
would worke with us: The successe of our labours
dependeth<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>on his blessing,</hi> and that blessing is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by prayer. This is a compleat seeking of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
when both go together: There is no happinesse
without <hi>fruition,</hi> and no fruition without <hi>Vnion,</hi> and
no union without <hi>endevouring</hi> for obtaining: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>light</hi> discovereth it, <hi>faith</hi> apprehendeth it, and
<hi>love</hi> feeleth it. Therefore we must labour diligently
for the increase of discovering light, of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
faith, and feeling love, that wee may grow in
that fruition, and rejoyce in the conscience of that
growth.</p>
                  <p>In the word of his prayer,<note place="margin">Prayer hath 1 A conscience of want.</note> we shall first consider
the prayer it selfe, and then the properties of it inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
therein. In the prayer it selfe three things are
offered: The <hi>conscience of want</hi> going before; The
<hi>desire to have;</hi> And the <hi>hope of obtaining.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
preceding is of a double want, both of <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse</hi>
it selfe, and of <hi>merite</hi> or worth to purchase it.
If we had it in our selves, we needed not seeke it, and
if we had merite to deserve it, we needed not suit it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14215:30"/>
of God: But wee have none of those, and therefore
wee must aske it. Wee have set times to pray, both
publick and privat; but are often coldrife therein,
and doe it more of custome than conscience. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God sharpneth our conscience with a felt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
and want, as a whetstone, to make our
prayers fervent. When Seth called his son<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 4. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Enosh,</hi>
that is, <hi>miserable or calamitous, then men began to call
upon the name of the Lord:</hi> So that name expressed
that they were sensible of their miserie, and that felt
miserie maketh men religious.</p>
                  <p>Next commeth <hi>the desire to have</hi> that thing which
we want,<note place="margin">2 A desire to obtaine it.</note> and that is the prayer it self: For a ground,
we looke to Gods mercie; and for price, we looke to
Christs merite. Herein is the worke of faith, to make
the prayer <hi>faithfull,</hi> as the preceding conscience
maketh it <hi>fervent:</hi> It specifieth our desire, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it supernaturall; for it is the hand of our soul,
meeting Gods hand, who offereth his blessings to us
in the promise: as a lively childe, taketh the pap of
his mother greedily, and sucketh milk out of it
largely: So the faithfull soul opening wide the
mouth of the desire taketh in the promise, and suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the blessing of God out of it. <hi>We present his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
as his owne handwrit and obligation: And he

                     <hi>why cryest thou?</hi> His mouth was close,
but his heart was crying to the Lord, he was grieved
to see the peoples danger, and yet beleeved God,
who promised to deliver them, and was challenging
God in his heart to keepe his promise: Therefore
one saith, <hi>That the people cried, but God heard them

And the reason is cleare, because the crie of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was in murmuring and fleshly reason, which
God misregardeth, but the secret and heart-cries of
Moses, were the language of the holy Spirit: And
the Apostle seemeth to point at this, when he telleth
the worke of the spirit helping us to pray, bringeth
forth<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>sighes and groans, which cannot be uttered. We

                  <p>Light cares can speake,<note place="margin">Groanes are good prayers.</note> but great cares doe stupifie
with silence: Weak desires are easily expressed, but
excessive desires cannot be equalled by speech. A
rod serveth a man in a small worke, but in a greater
he casteth it away, and taketh him to stronger instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
So the tongue is a sufficient interpreter in
other things; but here wee leave it, and take us to
groans and sighs, the best language of the heart.
Men may be neere and not heare us, and yet our
groans be heard in the heaven of heavens: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bide in our selves, but would be at God, and yet
cannot win to him as we would, therefore we groan
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14215:31"/>
under that restraint. Gods suggestion to our heart
is by <hi>inspiration</hi> of heavenly power, making us cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of grace: And by <hi>infusion,</hi> powring in that
grace he offereth. So our best speach to him is by

to him as the<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 42. 1.</note>

                  <p>This excessive desire of God is wrought in the

                     </gap>elf, and
a desire of him, that he may make it sensible of both:
The more it is full of him, it desireth him the more,
and the more it powreth out it selfe in that desire, it
is satiat the more, and the more the desire increaseth:
And in this heavenly inebriation, <hi>satiety provoketh
our thirst.</hi> The more we have of God, we thirst him
the more, and are inflamed with new desires. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
worshippers thinke by their prayers, as
charmes, to devocat and draw God out of heaven.
And the Idolater thinketh to command him, but
both separate themselves from him: But the godly
seek him in their heart, and thrust their heart on him.
It is also a touch of that<note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 2. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>sicknesse of love,</hi> when the
soul burneth in a desire of God, and that sicknesse is
the health of the soul, and God sensibly filling the
heart, is the cure of that sicknesse. This prayer then
is nothing else, but a laying of his desirous heart,
open to the fountaine to drinke in happinesse. <hi>Who
so hath receaved this affectuous devotion, and devout
affection to God, hath already conceaved the birth of
happinesse, and shall travell therewith now painfully,

                  <p>Thirdly, hope of obtaining happinesse followeth
our faithfull prayers, for what faith beleeveth, that
hope expecteth: It is as soone in our hope, as it is in
our faithfull desire, and long before it be in our
hand; and yet as sure as it were in our hand, though

                     <hi>And the hope of the godly shall not perish.</hi>
Our hope is greatly confirmed, by the tastes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
we finde in prayer: We may more firmely
expect that, that we finde begun already, and these
first fruits assure us of the fulnesse in due time: Such
faithfull desires powred out with a delightfull free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
are not only the Lords harbengers in our
heart, to tell that he is comming, but the ushers of
his entrie, and tokens that he is already come. He is
in that heart that earnestly desireth him, and with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
powreth it selfe out on him.</p>
                  <p>Moreover this word containeth three properties
of his prayer:<note place="margin">Prayer should be, 1 In humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> 
                     <hi>Humilitie, Absolutenesse,</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi>
Humilitie, because it is an humble asking, and not
a proud exacting, and so excludeth mans merite,
which cannot stand with the humilitie of prayer: If
he had <hi>merit for happinesse,</hi> he would not beg it as a
gift, but exact it as a debt. The Apostle cleareth this,
for when he hath said,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>The wages of sinne is death,</hi>
if he had followed the rules of Logick, he would
have said, that the reward of righteousnesse is life
eternall: But he knew that could not stand with
Gods mercie, and Christs merite, therefore he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>life eternall, the free gift of God.</hi> And to this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14215:32"/>
truth God provided himselfe a witnesse even among
the Cardinals: <hi>The Apostle</hi> (saith he) <hi>saith not that
the wages of righteousnesse are life eternall, but the gift
of God is life eternall: That we may understand, that
we obtaine eternall life, not by our merits, but by the free
gift of God.</hi> Therefore he subjoynes <hi>(In Christ Iesus
our Lord.) Behold the merit, behold the righteousnesse,
whose wages life eternall is: But to us it is a free gift
through Iesus Christ</hi>

                  <p>Reason also proveth this: For all the good wee
have, whether naturall or spirituall is his gift. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
goodnesse commeth by his providence, both in
it selfe, and the right use. And though they were
both of our selves, they have no proportion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
any grace: No good deserveth another, but
farre lesse doeth naturall good deserve happinesse:
And all supernaturall goodnesse is his gift also, and
every degree of it is a native growth of his dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without the respects of <hi>merit or reward;</hi> for
that same mercie that giveth the beginning, giveth
also the increase and perfection of grace. Our state
also goes in two; first we are <hi>miserable in our selves,
and then happy in God;</hi> and what good can be in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie
to deserve the least happinesse? While we are
in miserie, we can deserve no happinesse, and when
God beginneth happinesse in us, that beginning is
neither a reward of any preceding merit, neither a
merit of any following goodnesse: But all is the
worke and gift of grace. Againe, both the name and

                     <note place="margin">2 It is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.</note>
and not <hi>conditionall,</hi> and that because happinesse is
absolutely necessary.<note n="b" place="margin">Non oramus ut divitiae &amp; honores adve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niant, sed ut ea quae bonos &amp; beatos efficiunt. Aug. Ord. 2. 20.</note> We crave common blessings
with this condition, <hi>if God thinke it expedient,</hi> as
health, libertie, wealth, &amp;c. But when we pray for
<hi>remission of sins, life eternall, and happinesse,</hi> we seeke
them absolutely. All things that we aske go in three
ranks. The first are <hi>good in themselves,</hi> and yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
us not, as riches and honour, &amp;c. because they
qualifie not our person with any good change: The
second are <hi>god in themselves, and make us better,</hi> but

cannot beatifie us; as learning, wisedome, prudence,
&amp;c. The third is both good, maketh us better, and
beatifieth us, and therefore is simply to bee craved
of God: This distinction setleth the godly in a
great doubt, they pray oft and earnestly for some
things, and yet are not heard, and therefore thinke
that God hath cast them off. But here is a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for God neglecteth not their prayers, but hath
them written before they utter them. And his refuse
is not in anger, but because he thinketh it not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient:
and though he refuse one thing, it is to give us
a better; as he refused to stay Sathans buffering to

                     <hi>yet gave him sufficient grace to indure

                  <p>Our will that leadeth us in rebellion against his
Commandments,<note place="margin">We should not stick to our owne will.</note> should not rule his hearing of our
prayers. For oftentimes God giveth us blessings
that wee never sought, and holdeth from us in that
same mercie, many things that we seeke:<note place="margin">Bernard. de Quadr. ser. 6.</note> As a wise

hath a more absolute course;<note place="margin">Aug. in hunc locum.</note> for God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it absolutely for his owne: he hath promised
it absolutely, and what ever condition is required of
faith or repentance, he worketh it in us. Christ hath
purchased it, and prayed for it absolutely, and upon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14215:34"/>
these grounds absolutely we seeke it of God; <hi>Rachel</hi>
said to Jacob<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 30. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Give me children, or else I die.</hi> How
much more reason have we to crave of God, that he
would give us happinesse to conceave Jesus Christ
by faith, or else we perish?</p>
                  <p>The third propertie of this prayer is <hi>Constancie:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3 It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</note>
For faithfull prayer knowes no end but obtaining of
that it seeketh, and this is both in constant <hi>love</hi> of
the chiefe good, and constant <hi>seeking</hi> of it:<note place="margin">1 In love to the chief good.</note> The love
we have to chiefe good changeth not, but increaseth
daily: Worldly happinesse giveth not this constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
Men seek one thing to day, and another to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
they burne even now in a desire of honour, and
at once in greed of riches, as occasion offereth, or
possibilitie of obtaining appeareth, they change
both their object and course: But the godly who
chuse true happinesse, neither repent their choice,
nor change their course, but grow in the like of their
choice and love of happinesse: They can change the
place of their dwelling, their complexion, their diet
and contentment in common goods, but not in the
chiefe good: These things are but for the <hi>way,</hi> and
for a short time, but the other for <hi>eternitie,</hi> and in the
current of changes upon other things, he holdeth
ever fast his love to happinesse: The more he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, the more he loveth it, and blesseth God who
hath directed him in that choice. Herein he is not so
much active as passive, and that both willingly, &amp; in
a sort of sweet violence, captivated with the delights
of his most beloved and desired good. <hi>It possesseth
him rather, than he doeth it, and he is more in it, than
in himselfe:</hi> The sweetnesse he findeth in it, suffereth
him not to change for any other: God may blesse
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14215:34"/>
him with many other goods, and Sathan may turne
them as baites to withdraw, or divert him from the
chief good, but he never changeth his first love: The
first impression of the joyes of happinesse are so
deepe in his heart, that no contentment of lesser
goods can either divert it by change, or diminish it
by equalitie. <hi>And though God from heaven would bid
him make a new search of happinesse, he would still fall
upon his first choice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other is in his prayer,<note place="margin">2 In his prayer.</note> he will not leave seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
till he obtaine happinesse: It is not at our hand,
nor found at the first, but we must pray often for it:
We faint if we be not heard at the first, but that is
our fleshlinesse, who would have God subject to us:
The gift is his owne, and he knoweth his time, and it
is our part patiently to wait on: So David,<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 40. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>I waited
patiently on the Lord:</hi> And Jeremie,<note n="*" place="margin">Lam. 3. 24. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord is my
portion, saith my soul, therefore will I hope in him: It
is good that a man should both hope, and quietly wait
for the salvation of the Lord.</hi> And Christ giveth us
the parable of the<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 18. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>poore widow,</hi> who importuned
the judge, till she was heard: It is counted a courtesie
among men, to take with the first refuse, but with
God, it is no courtesie, but infidelitie; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give him greater rest, than to importune him
with our desires of happinesse: And the<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 25. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Canaani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
woman</hi> is commended for it, that shee cried out,
till she was heard. So should wee doe in praying for
happinesse: and that the more, because we get it not
here in the fulnesse, but in the degrees, which should
strengthen our patience, because they are oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on Gods part. His <hi>purpose</hi> is in himselfe, and
his <hi>promise</hi> is knowen and beleeved of us, and if <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:14215:35"/>
begin to performe them both, it is a sort of
engaging of him who is <hi>libertie,</hi> (if wee may <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o
speake) to performe that he hath begun. Gods delay
is in respect of us, but not of himselfe: It is the triall
of our faith, the proofe of our hope, the opening of
our heart in large desires, and a way to sweeten our
delights, when our desire is filled. For the more and
longer we have thirsted, the sweeter shall our satietie
be; and our prayers are not so much in particular
times, as the constant opening of our desires to God,
when our hearts, like emptie vessels, lie at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and like the<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 5. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>man at the poole of Bethesda,</hi> wee

                  <p>This answereth a question which some move,<note place="margin">Devout men want never matter of prayer.</note>
when they heare of some who are oft and long at
their private devotion: <hi>They aske, what purpose they
had to be so oft, and long with God?</hi> But if we be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of our miserie, wee will never want purpose to
pray to God, though it were to crave againe, and
againe this true happinesse; we get it not at the first,
nor at once, but by degrees: and though the matter
were one, yet we have need of a new affection of that
same matter; and when that affection decayes, wee
have need to have it repeated. The Apostle biddeth
us<note n="*" place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>pray continually:</hi> which is not so to be taken, as
though we should ever be on our knees, in the action
of prayer, because he hath commanded us to labour
in our particular callings; but of our constant <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
our habituall <hi>desire,</hi> and continuall <hi>disposition,</hi>
for seeking of God, which most shew themselves in
the frequent action of prayer, though not in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:14215:35"/>
Out of this I raise three things: First our <hi>dutie:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Happinesse is not our desert.</note>
That if we would obtaine true happinesse, wee aske
it of God by prayer. Wee are every way <hi>craving
and begging creatures,</hi> because wee are ever necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.
Though our grave have the name from cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
yet from our conception to our grave, wee are
craving continually. In the womb wee crave nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
and then libertie by birth; and at our
birth, our weeping is a craving, to testifie, that a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
and indigent creature is come into the
world. Though there be some reason of the first
weeping, because we are come from a warme lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a colder, yet the maine reason of it is, because
we are entring into the valley of miserie, &amp; the fittest
saluting of it, is by teares: And all our time in this
life is nothing but a world of necessities, after other,
of rayment, food, physick, &amp;c. But among all, wee
care least for this <hi>one thing.</hi> Our body is sensible of
the owne wants, and seeketh for them, but our soule
is senselesse, and in the multitude of prayers, scarcely
have we one about true happinesse: But wee owe
to that chiefe good our greatest love, the greatest
care to obtaine, and so the most frequent and fervent
prayers. Christ taught us this by expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 6. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>Seeke first the kingdome of God, and these
things shall be cast to you:</hi> So that comparatively
other things are scarce to be sought; but a promise
made, that they<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 6. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>shall be cast to us.</hi> And in his prayer
he perswadeth the same order: First, to pray, that
God may be glorified in the <hi>hallowing of his name,</hi>
and so our glorification will follow his glorie.
Next, that his <hi>kingdome may come,</hi> both insubduing
his enemies, and ruling us by his grace, to our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14215:36"/>
Thirdly, that as his revealed <hi>will</hi> directing us,
should be done by us, so the secret <hi>will</hi> of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
may be performed on us, in our happinesse.
Likewise the petition for <hi>remission of sinnes</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the other for escaping tentation to sinnes,
that might be committed: Of all these petitions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one is for <hi>daily bread,</hi> or temporall things, and
that cast in the mids, where is least, either <hi>attention</hi>
or <hi>intention.</hi> So Christ hath put the matter of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
in that prayer, that wee may daily aske this
one necessarie thing of God, though the most part
rehearse the words, without thinking on that matter.</p>
                  <p>Next we may inferre, <hi>that our praying for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is a worke of happinesse in us:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prayer for happinesse is happinesse.</note> That chiefe good
communicateth it selfe to us diversly, according to
our necessities: As sinne originall is not a <hi>single sin,</hi>
but a <hi>multitude</hi> and <hi>masse</hi> of corruptions, defiling all
our powers, like a pulpous or chairie root, which in
one containeth many severall roots, as in garlick, or
such like: So that naturall vitiousnesse containeth
<hi>ignorance, senselesnesse, infidelitie, pride,</hi> and all other
corruptions in us: Even so the chiefe good hath all
goods in it, and sendeth out it selfe to men to cure
these miseries: It is <hi>light,</hi> to inlighten our ignorance;
It is <hi>life,</hi> to quicken our senselesnesse; It is <hi>mercie,</hi> to
pardon our sinne, and strength, to keepe us from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
It is <hi>good,</hi> to allure us, and a prevening <hi>power,</hi>
to stirre us up to pray for it, so that our very praying
for it, is its prevening worke. This is all of God, who
worketh powerfully, and abundantly in us;<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 81. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>He
bidd<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th us open our mouth wide, and promiseth to fill it.</hi>
And he himselfe openeth the mouth in moving our
desire. As Physitians force up the mouths of some
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14215:36"/>
patients, under their convulsions, and then powre in
some cordials to refresh them: So God, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
of our conscience, openeth our hearts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and then giveth us the happinesse that we desire.
Thus the chiefe good giveth it selfe to us in this life,
by parts and degrees, but in heaven<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

cryes also to God, and he heareth it, though wee
know it not; Yea before wee were, and before our
necessitie was in us, it cryed to his commiseration
from eternall, and his bowels were moved toward
us:<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ</hi> also prayeth for us, that the fruit of his
obedience may be applied to us: The <hi>covenant</hi> also
supplicateth for us, and casteth it selfe open before
him, intreating him, to accomplish all that he hath
promised to us: And his owne <hi>name</hi> and glorie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for us,<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 36. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>For my owne names sake I will doe this.</hi>
Besides these, his justice intercedeth for us:<note n="*" place="margin">1. Joh. 1. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>If wee
confesse our sinne, he is faithfull and just to forgive us.</hi>
It is as native to justice to absolve the innocent, as to
punish the guiltie; And wee are cleane before him,
when we are clad with Christ<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 23. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</hi>
It is as just to pardon the faithfull penitent,
as to punish the faithlesse impenitent: So when
Christ hath applied to us the fruit of his obedience,
Gods justice pleadeth for happinesse to us. It is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14215:37"/>
mercie enough in God to heare us when we call, but

finde remission, and so peace with God:<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified

expresse the sweetnesse of it: And God hath
wisely so provided, that he shaketh the conscience
with some feare and terrour, ere he powre this peace
into it, and that not only as a fruit of our sin, but for
two other ends: The one, to make the <hi>change more
sensible</hi> to us: For if we be translated from nature to
grace, without any griefe for sin, or feare of wrath,
wee could not so well know our translating; but
when wee are even now swallowed up in sorrow
and feare: and repenting, and beleeving in Christ,
feele our selves perswaded of remission: and the
tormenting conscience turning a comforter, and the
joyes of the spirit filling the heart in the sense of that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14215:38"/>
peace, then wee are sensible of a change. The next
cause is for <hi>proportion,</hi> that as the measure of our
griefe is, so shall the measure of our peace and joy
be; so that they who are most grieved at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
afterward are usually acquainted with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
joyes. What ever our condition be in the world,
wee are but miserable without this peace, but what

                  <p>This peace of God hath two fruits: Peace with our
selves,<note place="margin">Peace with our selves.</note> and with the creatures: Peace with our selves
floweth from Gods peace. So soone as God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with our sinnes, and setteth us against him, as

The conscience terrified of God, doth terrifie us,

with the terrours of the Lord, that it may come to
the peace of God. But the sight of a reconciled
God in Christ, changeth all to the contrary; the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
of conscience is stronger in her <hi>judiciall
acts,</hi> than in other: For when God is <hi>directing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming,</hi>
and simply <hi>proponing</hi> things, she hath but a
weake testimonie, but when God judicially dealeth
with us, <hi>accusing, reproving,</hi> and <hi>terrifying,</hi> her te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
is strong; because the hand of God is
powerfull in it; and therefore, there is no denying
of her accusation, no shifting of her torture: On the
other part, her comforting is as certaine, when shee
assureth us of Gods pardon, because the hand of
God is in her to comfort us, and in us, to be as sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>The combat betwixt the <hi>flesh and the spirit</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to trouble this peace,<note place="margin">The spirituall combat trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth not our peace.</note> and consequently our
happinesse; but it doeth rather confirme, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it: For it is not a power of God pursuing us,
but our owne corruption molesting us. The parties
are <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>spirit, nature</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> the <hi>new</hi> and the
<hi>old</hi> man: And though it be grievous that we have
corruption either passively, to receave Sathans
temptations by consent: or actively, of it selfe to
breed the worke of sinne: Yet this is joyfull, that we
have a partie within us against Sathan: And that
not only a <hi>conscience</hi> or <hi>reason,</hi> or <hi>care of publick ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14215:39"/>
&amp;c.</hi> which are in the wicked, but the <hi>new

The Apostle finding that combat, cried out;<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

                     <hi>to
finde the two children strive in her belly;</hi> yet she was
glad for having children. This spirituall combat, is
a seal that we are at peace with God, and our selves,
so long as wee abhorre our flesh, strive against, and
<note n="*" place="margin">Habac. 1. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>complaine to God of violence,</hi> and implore his helpe

                  <p>Our <hi>peace with the creatures</hi> commeth not so neere
to our happinesse:<note place="margin">Peace with the creatures.</note> God hath the fabrick of the world
in his hand, as a mounter; so long as we please him,
he maketh all creatures go in their order; but when

<note n="*" place="margin">Job 5. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>he maketh the stone of the field at covenant with us.</hi>
But we are to inquire of the peace of the reasonable
creature. The good <hi>angels</hi> are ever at peace with us,
for though sometimes God giveth them hard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
of punishment against us, yet they love us
still: The evill angels will never be at peace with us,
but their warre is our peace: Better to have Sathan
without us, than within us; and to have him tempting
us to sinne, rather than tormenting us for sinne. If we

and we are free of his tyrannie: He troubleth none of

barketh at none of the houshold, but at strangers; and
Sathans tentations are not against his owne, but the

                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:14215:39"/>
As for men,<note place="margin">Peace with men.</note> their peace is various: We should not
looke for peace at the hand of the wicked, for wee
are called out of the world, therefore the<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 15. 19.</note>

us;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note> and the old denounced warre betwixt the
woman and the serpent, hath neither truce nor peace;
therefore their injuries are our peace. But the wrongs
wee receave from the godly are more grievous, for
Gods grace in them coloureth their cause, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexeth
our minde more, than the wrongs of the
wicked: And Sathan craftily setteth the godly
against the godly,<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 4.</note> as Jacobs sonnes against Joseph,
and Davids brethren against him, &amp;c.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 17. 28.</note> But though
<hi>these things may trouble the peace of our body, yet they
should not trouble the peace of our breast.</hi> The <hi>equitie</hi>
of our cause; Our patience in suffering; No desire
of revenge, but seeking occasions to do good to our
injurers, and that neither of hypocrisie, nor policie,
nor a naturall softnesse, but a conscience, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God commandeth it: Christ hath done so, and
commandeth us to follow him. These worke grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
peace than injuries can make trouble:<note place="margin">Gen. 50. 19.</note> Joseph re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
more in Gods grace, making him meek and

power he had so to doe: In the second, he overcame
them, but in the first, he overcame himselfe.</p>
                  <p>The second part of this habitation is <hi>Rest,</hi>

                     <hi>the most
desireable end of our appetites,</hi> and that of resolution,
refreshment, and securitie. The rest of <hi>Resolution,</hi>
keepeth us at home with God: For when wee are
searching what is happinesse, where, and how it is to
be found, perplexitie holdeth us from home; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
resolved that all is in God, that as<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 1. 41.</note> Andrew said
to Peter, <hi>We have found the Messias,</hi> so that we may
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14215:40"/>
say, We <hi>have found</hi> happinesse in God, we rest from
these first perplexities. Our labours after that
(though painfull) are sweet and pleasant, because
they are about the chiefe good; yea we have not such
rest in any thing, as when we are most busied about
happinesse: These very labours are our rest, and we
goe to bed most contentedly that night, when wee
have spent the day most painfully with God about
happinesse.</p>
                  <p>Next the <hi>Rest of refreshment,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Rest of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment.</note> when God refresheth
with his grace in that habitation. So the Church
calleth to Christ;<note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Tell me where thou feedest, where

<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 23. 2. 3.</note> That <hi>God led him by the still waters, and

provided convenient meanes for every life, and the
spirituall as excellent in the actions, as in the kinde, is
ever set on the grace of Christ, as the only conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
food. The body turneth food to the owne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
but the food of our soule turneth us to its

and burneth up our earthly thoughts,</hi> and turneth
them into heavenly. There is no dwelling like this,
and it hath the owne convenient diet; the house of
God hath its owne <hi>fat things,</hi> wherewith the godly
are fed abundantly.</p>
                  <p>The third is the <hi>Rest of securitie:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. Rest of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> For what avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
quiet and refreshment, if the next houre wee

like the<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 23. 37.</note>

                     <hi>by his power to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall

of this securitie, when as wee know the certaintie of
the <hi>matter</hi> in him, so wee finde the <hi>confidence</hi> of it in
our selves. He hath promised to preserve<note n="*" place="margin">John 13. 1.</note> us to the
end; and when wee feele our selves to beleeve that
promise, our confidence of security riseth. So the
faithfull soule concludeth the owne securitie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally;

the conscience of faith it assumeth; <hi>I will say unto the

as things, which we can neither preserve from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
nor rebellion, from sinne and fearefull acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
&amp;c. and lay them over in his hand to bee
preserved to the last day, with expresse indenting for
restitution; we cannot but be sensible of such a work,
and confident both of his taking us in keeping, and of
his restoring of us in the last day:<note place="margin">Arrhae perditae damnum pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur. Chrysost. hom. 1. 2. Col.</note>

This dwelling in God is our spirituall sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing,
the type of the eternall: wee prescribe no
measure to God, but thirst the fulnesse; but with the
casting in of the bucket of our desires, let us cast in
our heart also in the fountaine. The outbreaking of
the fountaine is according to our straitnesse, and not
according to the fulnesse it selfe. <hi>God hath made us to
himselfe, and our heart is restlesse, till it rest on him:</hi>
For if wee shall go through the world, wee shall not
finde a sure place to our soule but in him: Things
naturall are carried to their place by their weight:

they are so called from his <hi>presence</hi> and <hi>delight.</hi> His
<hi>presence,</hi> because as his providence is manifest eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where in ruling the World in temporall things,
he would also have some houses set apart for <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and eternall salvation:</hi> So that albeit he be in
every house, yet that his being in them may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an absence, comparatively to his presence in the
Church. His <hi>delight</hi> also is great in Churches:<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 232. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>This
is my rest, here I delight to dwell.</hi> And to make it prove
his house, he decoreth it with greater beautie than
all the houses in the world: which made David to
choose the house of the Lord, though he had stately
and royall palaces to dwell in, as we shal heare (God
willing) hereafter; for this cause one calleth him,<note place="margin">Aug. tract. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>an
aspiring Lover of life eternall, who sought that one
thing to dwell in the house of God.</hi> There are also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
considerations of the Church mysticall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall.
Mysticall, is the Church of the <hi>Elect,</hi> to
whom he imparteth this happinesse: Individuall, to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14215:43"/>
speak so, is every elect person, a lively member of the
Church of the Elect, because they are the Temples
of the holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Hereof three things arise: First, Gods great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
who notwithstanding our grievous sinnes,<note place="margin">They are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods mercy to man.</note> hath
erected his houses every where in the world for our
happinesse. Man could not ascend to God, therefore
God came down to man, to deale with him openly
in the matter of happinesse. When wee were cast
out of Paradise, Sathan thought we should never be
taken in favour againe, but now he hath appointed
millions of houses for reconciliation. And he hath
appointed his houses eminently for Sathans more
eminent confusion. So Porphyre confessed it as from
Apollo,<note place="margin">Idque maxime in templis, quia Deus hos ibi ludibrio ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit. Aug. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. 19. 23. &amp; 22. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>that the divels abhorred the chief God, and
that most in Churches,</hi> because there hee exposed
them to mockerie. For his house is his <hi>trysting place,</hi>
wherein we deale with him about happinesse: It is
also as a richly furnished <hi>shop,</hi> offered to those <hi>that
have no money</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Isay 55. 1.</note>. It is like unto these <hi>wine-cellars</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 2. 4.</note>,
whereunto Christ taketh his spouse to fill her with
spirituall consolations.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is his open Schoole,<note place="margin">Churches are schooles for happinesse.</note> wherein the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of happinesse is plainly taught. He saw man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
lye flat on the earth; and though the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
seemed to lift mens minds to heavenly things,
yet they erred worse than the former, in so far as <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
is worse than simple <hi>ignorance,</hi> and made peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
erre by <hi>authority,</hi> who before erred only in <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie:</hi>
for among them all, there was neither truth
nor concord. For this cause, sometimes Gods
house is put for Christ, <hi>as he is opposed to the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. Confess. 7. 18. &amp; 20.</note>
because in him only is happines to be found.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14215:44"/>
Therefore God pitying man, opened his schooles of
the Church in the doctrine of happinesse: and there
is more of it in this one sentence, <hi>This is life eternall</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 17. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>to know thee to be the only God, and whom thou hast
sent Iesus Christ;</hi> than in all the writs of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
from the beginning. And God doth this in the
sight of the World, because his works are good, and
seeke the light. Sathan stealeth away man in his
works of darknesse; but he will have them publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
returning to honour him, and shame Sathan.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">And the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of a Nation.</note> the happinesse of a Nation where God
hath houses,<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 50. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Sion the perfection of beautie.</hi> And
more,<note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 48. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Sion the joy of the whole earth,</hi> and the Citie
of the great King. Many count his house a burden,
and wrangle miserably in the provision of pastors,
like the <hi>Gadarens,</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 8. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>who thrust Christ away for their
swine:</hi> or like the Polonians, who having embraced
Christianitie, and finding the maintenance of it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
than Paganisme, resolved to turne to Paganism
again. However, it bideth sure, that Gods presence
in a Land is their happinesse and glorie. The world
thinketh, that Monarchies are the glorie of a nation,
but God gave more to the Jewes in the Temple and
Synagogues, than to the <hi>Assyrians, Persians, Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Romans</hi> in their flourishing Monarchies. He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to other nations without the Church, great
naturall and politick gifts, but they are nothing to
the sanctuarie. Albeit they excell the Sain<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>s in these
common gifts, yet the spirituall gifts are infinitely
better. For as the <hi>waxing</hi> power is stronger in plants
than in beasts. because in them it is eminent, but in
the other subject to the sensitive power: and in beasts
the <hi>sensitive</hi> power is stronger than in man, in whom
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14215:44"/>
it is subject to <hi>reason;</hi> so among men, they who have
nothing but Nature, it is eminent in them, as in the
own sphere. Without the Church many have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
in common gifts for mankinds civill perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and because they had no other purpose to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their spirit. But the Saints are taken up in things
<hi>supernaturall,</hi> and so are weaker in the naturall. And
this is a fruit of Gods dwelling among them, when
their soules runne out on things supernaturall, rather
than naturall.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our duty in two things: First, that wee
frequent the house of God in reverence:<note place="margin">Churches are to be frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> for <hi>God is
there in a singular maner,</hi> and our salvation and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
is proponed there. Therefore since he keepeth
both time and place of trysting, let us not be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
as not to meet with him. Many in opinion of
greater spirituall profit in private, abstain from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
but let them remember, that David was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and laden with revelations: yet in the statute
times of worship, hee chose to bee in the Sanctuarie
rather than in private. For albeit God bid us wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him privately, lest we be found hypocrites; yet
he wil have us honour the publike meetings, because
larger grace descendeth from God, and more groans
ascend to him. Moreover, when we come to the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie,
let us remember, that we are come to get
happinesse, which is proponed there. For, to passe
by <hi>humanitie</hi> and <hi>ph<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>losophie</hi> (which treat not of
happinesse) and come to the <hi>schooles of divinitie,</hi>
Happinesse is not there so clearly proponed as in
Churches. For there truth is almost <hi>lost by jangling:</hi>
Happinesse is rather obscured than cleared, new
questions augmented, and all more for the glorie of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14215:45"/>
the disputer, than edification of the hearer, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of <hi>heart or conscience.</hi> But in the Churches,
happines is clearly proponed.<note place="margin">Aug. Tract. 28. fol. 177. 1, 2.</note> Here a man shall bee
convinced of <hi>his own miserie, he shall heare many are
blessed whom the world count miserable for their cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and that many are miserable, whom they count hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
for their prosperitie.</hi> And that the best have need
to look to the deceit of their heart, that they steale
not Gods glorie, ascribing his gifts to them.

                        </gap>ol. 1.</note> and of these two great
places, God hath set the earth under our feet, and
the heaven above our head; and given our bodie a
straight stature,<note place="margin">Prosper. 4. 6. 8.</note> to tell we should tread on the earth,
and aspire to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Next,<note place="margin">We should be the temples of the holy Spirit.</note> that we try if we be the <hi>Temples of the holy

thing signified: They represented Christ to us, and
that wee should sacrifice our selves upon that great
altar. If we be so, that <hi>unction</hi>

hearts to the love of it, that we may enjoy it: Hee
maketh us also conscious and sensible of this work,

hours are as dayes, dayes as moneths, and moneths
as years. Hereof commeth the wearinesse of the
profane, for the shortest houre of worship tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them: Their fleshly passions are bound in stocks,
they know not God, and the signes of his presence
are terrible to them. And yet these same men count
whole daies but short for their drunkennesse in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes;
and in brothels they joyne nights to daies,
and daies to nights, as though all time were too
short to measure out their vanitie. But this will bee
the end of all, when at death wee looke backe to our
time, wee shall have most comfort of these dayes
wee have spent in the Sanctuarie, in seeking happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and shall put these chiefly in our Almanack:

                  <p>THis is the <hi>end</hi> why hee desireth to dwell in the

Gods goodnesse, and <hi>continuance</hi> in that fruition;
wherein consisteth the happinesse he desireth. This
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14215:47"/>
fruition is <hi>to behold the beauty of the Lord:</hi> wherein
are two things, the <hi>beautie it selfe,</hi> and <hi>beholding.</hi> For
the knowledge of this beautie, we shall first remove
two false Glosses, and then follow the truth.</p>
                  <p>The first is of some Papists,<note place="margin">The beautie of the Sanctuarie is not in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> who place this beautie
in the <hi>stately and costly building</hi> of their Temple.
Herein they follow the Jewes, devoted to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
showes, their religion is all for them; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they cannot fill the hearts of people with the
power of doctrine, they will fill their eyes with
stately buildings,<note place="margin">Concilium Cardinalium.</note> and pompous ceremonies. So their
Cardinals advised Paul 3. <hi>that in the decay of their
authoritie they would make the world admire them, by
building and busking stately temples.</hi> The stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the temple of Jerusalem was extraordinary,
both because it was in the time of a carnall service,
and a type of the Church under Christ, the beautie
whereof was not in gold and silver (as <hi>Malachie</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth)
but in that the <hi>desire</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Hag. 2. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>of all nations came
therein.</hi> But some faile on the other extreme, and
have no more care to the houses of God, than to
common houses; yea, it may be seene, that many
barns and stables are more stately in the Parish, than
Gods house. This argueth a brutish mis-regard of
God, and of his worship, which is justly fruitlesse
in them. Churches ought indeed to bee comely, as
houses set apart to God. But that necessarie come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
is not this beautie of the Lord,<note place="margin">Putchritudo domus non est in marmore. <hi>Jerom.</hi>
                     </note> that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
<hi>the beautie of houses is not in marble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second is worse, and placeth this beautie in
Images:<note place="margin">Neither in i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magerie.</note> So the Fathers of the second Nicene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
(such a Councel, &amp; such Fathers) thought them
the beautie of the Sanctuarie. But the Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14215:47"/>
images abominations, and the shame of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie:
And when the Jewes brought the <hi>Idols of
Israel,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ezech. 8. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>and Thammuz, or Osiris the God of Egypt, in
their temple.</hi> God departed from them. When the
Pagans charged the Christians of the first ages, that
their Oratories had no images; Origen, and other
Apologists, tooke with the challenge, and gave the
reason, that God whom they worshipped, was <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and infinite,</hi> and therefore, neither could nor
would be represented by images. From the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
time till images were brought in the Church,
there was a sufficient body of doctrine, though with
some declination, but after that, the Cleargy turned
more blockish and ignorant than images. Let them
be called the <hi>bookes of the Laicks,</hi> but such as turne
the Laicks in stockes and stones, because they are
the teachers of <hi>lies and vanities</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Habac. 2. 18.</note>, for they leave
their mindes in as base estimation of the thing they
represent,<note place="margin">Jer. 10. 8.</note> as of themselves.</p>
                  <p>The beautie of the Lord in the Sanctuarie,<note place="margin">1. The prime beautie is God himselfe.</note> is to be
taken first, of God himselfe, and then of his worke
with his people. God is the beautie of beauties, and
all these things, which we call <hi>beautifull, excellent,
glorious, perfect, &amp;c.</hi> in the creatures are but names
and shadowes of the truth of these things that are
in him. He alone is being without beginning, and
giveth being to all, and sustaineth them in that being:
He is life it selfe without inliving, and yet quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and inliving all: What ever wee consider to be
excellent, as wisedome, puritie, goodnesse, power,
&amp;c. are all in him primely, perfectly, and unitely,
howsoever to our mindes and experience, they be
diverse: He is great without quantitie, good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14215:48"/>
qualitie<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Every where, but included in no place,
without localitie, and yet excluded no place. A
fountaine without a veine, but running out in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
source; communicating substance, life, indue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of both to all creatures, in such plenty, as
proveth his riches; and in such diversitie, to make up
the beautie of the creature, that hee the Authour
thereof may be seene most bountifull: How beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
is that Unitie in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity!
The Father begetting, the Sonne begotten, and the
holy Spirit proceeding from both; the Father the
beginning, working all in the Sonne, and that by the
holy Spirit: a mysterie to be adored, but not sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
beleeved by faith, but not discussed by reason.</p>
                  <p>Herein Christ Jesus the <hi>fairest among men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gods beautie is seene in Christ.</note> is to be
considered; in whom the Church taketh boldnesse
to seeke her happinesse with God: he is that <hi>eternall
Sonne, of the eternall Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 14.</note> and came downe full of
grace and truth to save us: As God he is equall with
the Father and the Spirit; As man he is most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
of all creatures.<note place="margin">Coloss. 2. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>In him dwelleth all fulnesse,
even the fulnesse of the Godhead bodily:</hi> and because
of the personall union, his humane nature exalted
above all principalities and powers, is adored by
them.<note place="margin">Bern. Cant. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>He is most beautifull, because of wisedome in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching:
righteousnesse in remission of sinnes: Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in conversing with sinners:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Redemption in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for sinners.</hi> And because through him only
we take boldnesse to approch to God: for who durst
commit himselfe to so great a Majestie without his
mediation?<note place="margin">Cum de Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto loquimur deficimus non sufficimus. Aug. Ioh. tract. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>But while we speake of him we faile; and
suffice not.</hi> But most of all he is the <hi>beautie of beauties,</hi>
if wee consider him in his <hi>passion:</hi> For though the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14215:48"/>
world contemne him in that state, yet he is our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
because he suffered these things for us. This
then is the first thing that we should doe, when wee
enter into the Sanctuarie, to take up with the light
of a purified minde this glorious God, as the prime
beautie of the Sanctuarie, and the only object of our
religious worship, wherein true Christians excell
all other people, who worship not this true God.</p>
                  <p>Religious worship in the Sanctuarie,<note place="margin">Of religious worship.</note> is the greatest
worke we act in this life, because we seeke happinesse
in the union with that we worship; For therein three
things go together: First our highest <hi>estimation</hi> of
it, as chiefe good in it selfe, and so communicative
of that goodnesse to our happinesse. Next our
highest <hi>affection,</hi> loving it above all: And these are
the two maine parts of inward worship. The third
is a religious reverence, arising of them, manifesting
it selfe in the acts of outward worship, to pray to
him, and praise him. According to the object wee
worship, so is our fruit: For if wee worship the true
God alone, then wee come to happinesse, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our <hi>estimation, affection,</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> are
right placed. And more, because thereby he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth
himselfe to us, even to our conformitie
with him: for our due <hi>estimation</hi> of him is our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie,
that maketh<note n="*" place="margin">Philip. 3. 8.</note> us misprise all things beside,
and seeke him alone. Our due <hi>affection</hi> to him, is our
union with him, and a partaking of his divine nature;
in that we loath all things beside, and adhere to him
as our only happinesse. Thirdly, our religious <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
holdeth him ever in our eye, as the paterne, to
the which wee conforme our selves. So thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
wee attaine true happinesse: But if wee
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14215:49"/>
worship any thing beside, we make our selves more
and more miserable; Though wee should worship
Angels and Martyrs, neither can they communicate
goodnesse to make us happy; and their worship is
impious, and idolatrous, and separateth us from
God.</p>
                  <p>The pretended cause, why Julian forbad Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
children the use of secular learning,<note place="margin">Socrates lib. 3. c. 10.</note> was, lest
they being armed therewith, might more dextrously
refute the Pagans: But the secret cause was, lest by
reading the fables and histories of the Gods, they
should finde just matter of mocking and insulting
over them;<note place="margin">Aug. Civit. 7. 34.</note> As the old Senat burnt Numaes books,
because they expressed the secrets of their religion.
For their owne histories maketh them the worst
men of their time, yea monsters rather than men,
and yet after their death, the world seeking a colour
to their owne wickednesse, made them gods; And
the devils (the promoters of their worship, for their
owne behoofe) made the world thinke that adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
murther, drunkennesse, and such were good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to them. If <hi>Iupiter, Mars, Apollo, Bacchus,</hi> were
now living, as they were at their best in their life
time, they would be abhorred as pests, and cast out
of the common-wealth. This then is our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that wee worship that God alone who made
the heaven and the earth; and finding him, that all
the parts of religious worship begin in him, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
and abide in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. This beautie is in Gods worke.</note> the beautie of God in the Sanctuarie is
in his <hi>working</hi> with his people for happinesse; which
wee consider in three: First, as it proceedeth <hi>from</hi>
him. Secondly, the worke of his grace in the people
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14215:49"/>
                     <hi>meeting</hi> him. Thirdly, the worke of <hi>pastours</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
both. Gods worke toward his people, goeth in
foure: First, his <hi>offering</hi> of happinesse. Secondly,
his <hi>exacting</hi> of service. Thirdly, his <hi>conferring,</hi> or
giving the grace, that he offereth to them. Fourthly,
his <hi>accepting</hi> of his worke in them, as if it were theirs
only.</p>
                  <p>The first is his <hi>offer</hi> of salvation and happinesse:<note place="margin">1. His offering of happinesse.</note>
At the first it is thought, that wee come to offer to
him, but indeed he bringeth us to his house to offer
to us: Here a great change; God whome wee have
made our <hi>enemie,</hi> is our best <hi>friend:</hi> Our <hi>Iudge,</hi> who
may plague us for our sinne, turneth our <hi>repledger,</hi>
by his mercy rescuing us from Justice. Our <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
turneth our <hi>Pardoner;</hi> and while hee might
powre out all his wrath upon us, he is to reconcile
us to him: And under this name our reconciliation
goeth, because he worketh the worke, whereof wee
are at first both ignorant and uncapable: So in
Scripture every where he calleth on us:<note n="a" place="margin">Isai. 1. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Come let us
count together.</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Come to mee yee that are wearie, and
laden, and I will ease you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next in the Sanctuarie he exacteth service of us,<note place="margin">2. Exacting of our service.</note>
and that for our owne good only; that seeing he is
applying to us his happinesse purchased by his Son,
he craved of us preparations and dispositions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it. So he craveth that wee lay up his word in
our heart; That wee repent our sinne unfainedly;
that we beleeve in him; that wee love him with all
our heart, and all our soule, and that we honour him
in keeping his Commandements: for even while he
promiseth to ease us of our owne yoake, he biddeth
us take his yoake upon us; That we pray to him for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14215:50"/>
blessings wee have need of, and that wee praise him
for every blessing we receive.<note place="margin">Nihil enim Deus jubet quod sibi profit, sed illi cui ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet. Aug. Ep. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>For God commandeth
no man any thing for his owne profit, but for his profit
whom he commandeth:</hi> And all the businesse of our
sacrifice under the Gospell is not for him, but for
our more profitable exercise in piety.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. He giveth what he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</note> he <hi>conferreth</hi> upon us, and giveth the
things that he both offereth and exacteth; so hee
worketh faith in us, opening our hearts, as hee did
<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>the heart of Lydia:</hi> and while he biddeth us, <hi>Come
to his Sonne, he draweth us to him,</hi> both by alluring us
with his excellencie, and bowing of our wils to him:
He craveth of us, that we understand his word, and
giveth us hearts to understand it, when<note n="*" place="margin">Deuter. 30. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>he circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth
our eare and heart,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 31. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>and writeth his Law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
As he commandeth, that we love him with all
our heart; so he sheddeth abroad his love in our
heart, making all our heart powre it selfe out on
him. As he craveth obedience of us, so he giveth the
spirit of obedience,<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 32. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>putting his feare in our heart,</hi>
and causing us to walke in his Law. His craving or
exacting is not <hi>Legall,</hi> but <hi>Evangelick;</hi> for the legall
is, <hi>Doe, and thou shalt live;</hi> and yet gave no helpe to
doe the thing that was commanded; but the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick
exacting giveth us power to doe the thing
that it commandeth, giving us to know, to will, and
to doe. And their obedience differeth as well as the
exaction; for the legall obedience was to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and salvation, (if they could attaine it,) but the
Evangelick obedience is for gratitude and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to God, for that happinesse, which hee hath
both purchased, and applies to them freely.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Accepteth our service.</note> as a gracious <hi>Acceptor,</hi> of that wee are
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14215:50"/>
able to doe by his grace; which goeth in two: First,
though it be his, he <hi>counteth</hi> it ours; for <hi>wee are not
able of our</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>selves, as of our selves to thinke any good,
but all our sufficiencie is of him.</hi> He giveth us the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
of faith, of repentance, and bringeth their acts
out of them. And though formally, beleeving, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,
&amp;c. be our worke, because our wils, moved
by grace, doe move themselves, and so specifieth the
acts of these habits, yet the power and furniture
whereby wee beleeve is of God. Next, these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
acts being pure as they come of him, yet they
have some blemish in them, because of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
as water from a pure fountaine doeth taste of
the brasen or myrie channell, through which it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth;
For <hi>our very righteousnesse is as a filthy clout</hi>

<hi>grace,</hi> and for a sufficient preparation to fill us with
<hi>grace;</hi> yea, and the <hi>desire</hi> of a <hi>desire</hi> is as welcome to
him, as though it were a greater degree: We would
not take so little of our neighbour, no not of our

Sometimes the heart will be so moved when Gods
hand toucheth it, that it cannot containe it selfe, but
will breake forth into teares of sorrow and joy; but
prudence commandeth us to convoy these things in
publick, as modestly as we can: Our chambers, or

must be turned into groanes; and these groanes must
be suppressed, and turned into ejaculations; and
these brought to a soul-speech with God, admiring
our vilenesse, and his goodnesse, that taketh such
paines on us: Praising him where we finde his grace
hath kept us in obedience, resolving, promising, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14215:52"/>
vowing better obedience in time to come: That is the
joy of our heart, when as it can poure out it selfe
wholly on God in spirituall affections. Affection
hath the own voice, whereby it is known of God:
Sometimes it requireth no other expression, but is
content with sighs; and these sighs will breake out,
not only when we will, but also when we know not.</p>

                  <p>THe beautie of the sanctuarie in respect of Pastors
is,<note place="margin">Pastors a part of this beauty.</note> in their <hi>calling and work.</hi> Their calling is to
stand <hi>betwixt God and man:</hi> They are Gods mouth
to the people in doctrine, and the peoples mouth to
him in prayer and praise. This is the onely calling
that teacheth man true happinesse, that openeth the
heaven, and leadeth him to it. All the body of the
heavens is pure, yet the stars are most pure parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
light from the sunne, and rendring it to the
world:<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 14.</note> So are Pastors among men, the light of the
world, starres receiving light from God, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
it to others: They are<note n="*" place="margin">Job 33. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>as one of a thousand,</hi> to

man, than either by himselfe, or by Angels: for man
can peaceably receive instruction of man, but the

It is likewise mans <hi>triall,</hi> and the commendation of

our obedience to Gods ordinance. Pastors then are a

                  <p>The beautie in respect of their work,<note place="margin">2 In their work.</note> is as the mouth
of God to the people, and their mouth to him: They
are Gods mouth in preaching, the beautie whereof

and happines in him: That it be <hi>sound</hi> without error
or heresie; and <hi>divine,</hi> according to Scripture.
Mans minde enquireth a reason of all humane veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but when it heareth divine veritie, it neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
nor examineth, but at the first resteth upon
it with a divine faith. Therefore the Ancients in
their sermons were exceeding sparing of humane
testimonies, and contented them with Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they knew, to doe otherwise was to confound
divine and humane faith in the hearer: As now the
Papists, who have equalled traditions with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
have brought their people, that they know no
difference betweene divine and humane truth, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
divine and humane faith, respecting both.
<hi>When any thing is spoken beside Scripture, the minde

                  </p>
                  <p>The second beautie of their doctrine is in the <hi>form,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 In the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall forme.</note>
that <hi>holy things be delivered holily.</hi> As every science
hath the owne proper matter, so hath it the owne

the owne<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 13</note> 
                     <hi>paterne of wholesome words,</hi> wherein it
should be delivered. If therefore we propone it as
Oratours in the schoole, or Lawyers, wee spill the
native beautie of the word. And this is it which the
Apostle calleth, the<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>demonstration of spirit and
power:</hi> which is not so much to be expounded of an
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14215:54"/>
                     <hi>exact forme</hi> of reasoning, as with a <hi>manifesting<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and
kything of a spirituall power in doctrine.</hi> Doctrine
commeth of foure speciall grounds: 1 Naturall
<hi>quicknesse: 2. Art and learning: 3. Diligence</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie,
hearing, reading, collecting: and by <hi>grace</hi>
in the inward teaching and inspiration of the Spirit.
Now publick doctrine is a kything how many of
these, or what of them are in us. For a judicious
hearer can well discerne from which of these, one,
or moe, or all, it floweth. And though we could rub
the itching eare wonderfully, with the first, or the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
or the third, or all three of them together, yet
if the fourth be lacking, it is not the Apostles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of the spirit and power, but of nature
and industrie. This commeth of the concurrence
of the spirit, who is first effectuall in them by sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and then effectuall by them in a heavenly
doctrine in the hearts of people.<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 132. 19</note> 
                     <hi>Then his Priests

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>beautie</hi> of Pastors doctrine is in the
diversitie of their gifts: Gods house hath people of
all complexions, and his word hath a sufficiencie to
every mans condition. So wife Pastors propone it
<hi>as</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>milk for the weaker,</hi> and as strong food for the

                     </note>. God is

                     <hi>gift of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14215:54"/>
and Wisedome. The first is <hi>doctrinall</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
preserving the puritie of doctrine in the
Church<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> The other is <hi>pastorall</hi> wisedome, dividing
the bread of life aright, and applying it to the
hearts of people; which Saint Austine <hi>preferreth
to the other, as farre as the Sunne is above the moone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This commeth not only by ordinarie teaching of
men,<note place="margin">Affliction schooleth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</note> and that measure of Instruction which the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
giveth to every one, but likewise by exercise <hi>of the
crosse and experience.</hi> For God schooleth some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
greatly in affliction, and that not only for their
personall sinnes; (which they have as great as any)
but also to make them fitter instruments to instruct
and comfort others. For this cause <hi>Luther</hi> said, <hi>That
a Theologue of affliction was a Theologue of light:</hi> and
though it be no part of our Church trials of intrant
Pastors, yet the consideration were profitable.<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>For
whether we be afflicted, it is for you, &amp;c.</hi> For when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
all humane means without, or labour within,
they are taught of God to know the vilenesse of
their own sinne, the deceit of their owne heart, the
weight of Gods wrath for both, the terrours of an
accusing conscience in all three, the horrours of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
desertion, the desolation and widowhood of
the soule in such a case, &amp;c. And on the other part,
the freenesse of Gods mercie pardoning sinne, the
sweetnesse of the peace of conscience under that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
and joyes of the holy Ghost, the sense of
Gods favour shed abroad in our hearts<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 63. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>better than
life,</hi> and the complete happinesse of the soule, under
sense of the presence of a reconciled God. With
this furniture they are made the more sufficient in
those practick points (wherein the life of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14215:55"/>
standeth) to speake as men, who have learned
by exercise and experience.</p>
                  <p>This experience bringeth three things:<note place="margin">Pastors should communicate their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note> First, a sort
of <hi>obligement</hi> to communicate it according to our
calling. Secondly, a <hi>lively speech.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
in both. Obligement, because wee get not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
for our own private use, but to make others
better thereby.<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 34. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Come children, I will teach you the
feare of the Lord:</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 66. 16.</note> And, <hi>Come, I will tell you what
God hath done to my soule.</hi> Let men<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 107. 8.</note>

that he<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 40. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>hid not Gods goodnesse from the great congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi>
Such communication of experienced men
is profitable, for thereby <hi>people come easily to the
knowledge of that which otherwise they could not learn
without great exercise</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Ab expertis pastoribus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit populus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil√®, quod ipsi periculos√® ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periri volunt. <hi>Aug. Epist. 5.</hi>
                     </note>. And among other causes
why God afflicteth Pastors grievously, this is one,
both to furnish them with a body of experimentall
doctrine, and to bring the people easily to it by their
communication.</p>
                  <p>Next,<note place="margin">2 Their speech powerfull.</note> it furnisheth them with a powerfull speech.
Our language is the daughter of our reason, and our
stile floweth from our <hi>complexion, education, and
gift:</hi> and the gift is laboured by experience. The
<hi>spirit</hi> createth the <hi>species</hi> in us, the <hi>species</hi> give the

                     <hi>spirituall with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall;</hi>
and fitly to expresse divine matters in a divine
stile, is his gift. If we conceive things only by the
minde, we may speake <hi>properly,</hi> but not <hi>affectuously,</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:14215:55"/>
nor <hi>effectually:</hi> But if we take them in our affection,
our stile will be emphatick. No purpose hath need
to be more pertinently expressed than happinesse; if
it be coldly and warshly proponed, it wakeneth not
the affection: But if they speak who have found the
sweetnesse of it, their words are vive lineaments,
both of their affection, and the thing that hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

                  <p>The Apostle condemneth humane eloquence, and

Conscience and Confidence: <hi>Conscience</hi> of their
<hi>calling</hi> from God; of some competent <hi>furniture</hi> for
the worke, and of his <hi>presence</hi> with them in doing
the worke. <hi>Confidence</hi> of the warrant of their word
from Scripture, and from experience that they finde
the power of it in their souls in private:<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 116. 10</note> 
                     <hi>We beleeve,

uttering their very heart in their speech.
Their heart is in their words, which go out with the
weight of affection: They are moved themselves
with that they say, when they feele the power of it
renewed in them in publicke, which they felt in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.
But when a purpose (though both sound and
divine) is rehearsed either from reading, hearing, or
superficiall thinking, there is not such union of the
heart with the tongue, or the word with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and so oft times as little union betwixt the
word spoken, and the heart of the hearer. If any
man would move his hearer, he must be moved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
otherwise, how can they think that hee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the thing he speaketh. Preachers are lights, and
fires: they must have light and heat, if they would
warme and lighten others: So then this experience
of Gods working, is his speech to their heart; and
when he maketh them expresse it powerfully, they
speak to the hearts of the hearers. <hi>When they speake

                  <p>The ministration of Sacraments, is a part of this
beautie: The first giveth us the <hi>life</hi> of God, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

                     <hi>nourisheth</hi> that life in us: The first meeteth us
with provision at our entrie in the valley of teares:
The second strengtheneth us for temptations in it.
Baptisme is our first Sacrament,<note place="margin">1. Of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> and scarcely are we
borne <hi>naturally,</hi> when we are borne againe <hi>spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
Gods grace prevening our <hi>wit,</hi> our <hi>will,</hi> and our
<hi>worth,</hi> and sealing us before wee be sensible. It is a
prevening of sathans malice, to marke us with the
seale of the covenant, ere he can abuse us to any
actuall sinne. Therein great workes are acted with
little shew; the <hi>death, buriall, aud resurrection of
Christ,</hi> is there represented: <hi>Our Iustification, death,
buriall, and resurrection with him, are there acted.</hi>
Therein the sonnes of Adam are made the sonnes of
God: The children of wrath are made heires of the
kingdome of heaven. What grace from eternall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
us, prevening grace as a midwife bringeth
out. By our first birth we increase the number of
<hi>mankinde:</hi> By our second birth wee increase the
<hi>Church.</hi> The grace of election griped us in eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
the grace of Baptisme gripeth us in time, by the
beginnings, and the grace of effectuall calling, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us fully to God. As elect children receive the
seeds of grace in Baptisme, so in time they break out
fully in them. In our election, though wee were <hi>in
God,</hi> yet we were neither <hi>in our selves,</hi> nor sensible of
that his choising grip: In our Baptisme we are in our
selves, but <hi>not sensible</hi> of his working. In our calling
both wee are, and are sensible of the worke of his
grace in us.</p>
                  <p>The Sacrament of the <hi>Lords supper</hi> is another part
of this beautie:<note place="margin">2. Of the Lords supper.</note> He gave us life in Baptisme, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it conveniently in the Supper, as a life for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14215:57"/>
He is both our life and the food of it: Neither
can that life live without him, neither can any thing
beside him nourish it. It is a precious food, and
dearely prepared. He prepared it on the crosse, when
he suffered the punishment for our sinnes, and giveth
it to us in that Sacrament, as that <hi>Manna</hi> that tasteth
to every man, according to his desire. He is with
these mysteries, both <hi>sacramentally and spiritually,</hi>
and with us spiritually, to make us one with him; <hi>not
by mixture of substances, but by union of spirits; for
our eating of him is our biding in him</hi>

his heart sendeth out that love that pierced it before

of our desire into his wounds, &amp; drinke largely out of
them: The mother suffereth not her deare babe
more lovingly to lay the mouth to her pap, than he
suffereth us to lay our heart to his: We see his heart
more gladned for the glorie of God in our salvation,
than grieved for the wounds, and therein the love

In prayer all adore God as the fountaine of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:

wherein wee be more sensible of the Trinitie: The

us with that disposition, meeteth us with the

                  <p>It is most profitable even in this; that by our
prayers <hi>we partake of all the prayers of the godly,</hi> that
have beene made from the beginning: God hath
them all in register, and they are a treasure of the
Church; but above all, the prayer<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 17.</note> of Christ, that
gives life unto them: If therefore we put in our mite
in this treasure, we have a right to the whole. Some
have questioned of what thing men made most
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14215:59"/>
gaine, as twentie, fourtie, fiftie in the hundreth, but
prayer exceedeth all, for we gaine a million for one:
Neither let us be discouraged if sometimes we finde
our prayers but faint, few words, no order, weake
desires, and no satisfying of our selves therein. For
as a mother will sooner heare her sicke babe in the
cradle, and run to him if he begin to weepe, than a
stronger boy that cryes strongly; so God is more
neere and ready to helpe, when we can scarcely cry,
than when wee finde greater freedome. Wee please
God best, when wee please our selves least, and we
please him worst, when wee please our selves best:
<hi>our cutted and broken desires are our voice</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Desiderium est vox. Bern. 172. 2. 3. 147. 1. 2.</note>, <hi>and these
desires are as acceptable to him, as our long prayers.</hi>
Oftentimes wee come to prayer with a trembling
and withered heart, but continuing therein, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
grace is suddenly infused, the heart is filled
with joy, and we finde the libertie we crave.</p>
                  <p>Praise is the other part of this beautie:<note place="margin">Praise our joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full returning to God.</note> The floods
returne to the sea, so should we give thankes to God,
<hi>our Maker in creation, our Benefactour in providence,
our Redeemer in Christ, our Rewarder in crowning his
owne mercies in us. That affection is dead that powreth
not out it selfe wholly in thanksgiving:</hi> Therein peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with heart and voice render him thanks: And
with prayer it maketh up the sweet respect betwixt
God and man; for in the first wee pull downe <hi>grace
for grace,</hi> in the second we send up <hi>praise for prayers.</hi>
In the first the sense of our miserie filling the heart
with griefe, openeth it with a desire of reliefe; In
the second the sense of mercie, filling the heart with
joy, maketh it with an unspeakable delight, to thrust
it selfe upon God. That heavenly thanksgiving, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14215:59"/>
closeth Gods service, is some token, that people
have gotten what they sought, and that God sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them away in peace with his blessing, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon them, as a seale thereof: It is the peoples
triumph over sathan, who is more grieved with the
Saints praising, than with all the charmes of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats.</p>
                  <p>Some have thought strange,<note place="margin">How we should pray and praise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</note> why wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

                     <note n="*" place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 16. 17.</note>:
But that continuall is not, as though we
should be ever in the action of prayer, or praise,
which is impossible, but of our disposition and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
rising therefrom: That as we have rooted in
us the affections of <hi>griefe and joy,</hi> so when God sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
grievous things, wee should pray, and when he
sendeth joyfull things, we should praise. They stand
well with our mixed state here, for there is no man
who wanteth his owne daily miseries, and so hath
need to pray continually; and none wanteth his
owne daily blessings, and so hath cause to praise
continually. Even our <hi>affliction is a secret cause of
praise,</hi> for as it telleth Gods love, and foretelleth the
happie fruit, so God leaveth ever better behind him,
than he taketh from us: For if he take away our
health, or fame, &amp;c. yet if he leave remission of sins,
peace of conscience, &amp;c. they are better than the
blessings removed. Lastly, these two are <hi>mutuall
causes</hi> to other, for when our heart is soaped with
sorrow, and teares run downe our face, wee have
cause to rejoyce in that disposition, as a speciall
worke of grace so bruising our heart. And in our
greatest joy wee have cause of sorrow: For while
God is filling our heart with joy, yet at that time
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14215:60"/>
we will be grieved, because that joy will bide but
shortly, and that on our default. For we can no more
keepe it, than a riven lanterne can keepe a candle in a
storme, or a cold hearth a sparkle of fire.</p>
                  <p>This is the <hi>sett debt</hi> which the Church acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,<note place="margin">Praise a sweet de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

different from all other: Civill debts op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
men, but this relieveth them: And the debt
of sinne maketh us wearie and laden, but this easeth
us. We owe a heavie debt to Gods justice: It is first

justice to punish us, and we lye under a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
burthen of sinne and punishment, whereof Christ
biddeth us pray for pardon: <hi>Forgive us our debts.</hi> But
this is a debt to Gods mercie, because it ingageth us
by blessings, so with new grace it helpeth us to pay
that contracted debt: In other debts, <hi>the more wee
pay, the lesse is to pay;</hi> but in this, the more wee pay,
the more we owe, because the thing that we pay is a

for matter, because <hi>Evangelicall,</hi> not Legall: New
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14215:60"/>
for the <hi>forme,</hi> because all joy without mixture of
griefe:<note place="margin">Congregations are most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull meetings.</note> And new for <hi>Indurance,</hi> because eternall.</p>
                  <p>Of this beautie of the sanctuarie we may gather:
First, that when the Saints are met with God in the
sanctuarie, they are the most beautifull congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of mankinde: Other meetings, as triumphs, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronations,
&amp;c. have their owne shew and glorie, but
nothing to this: Their expectation is more than
their being, and their being evanisheth at the height.
God is also in other meetings, but not so as in the
sanctuarie. For there he is as Creatour ruling all
things for this present life: But here he is as Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
working true happinesse in his children, that
we may justly say, <hi>That his presence elsewhere, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
is a desertion to his presence in the sanctuarie.</hi>
His worke in the sanctuarie is the kernell, and his
providence in all things is the husk and the shell. He
hath more delight to see a penitent sinner mourne for
sinne, than to looke upon all the glorious shewes in
the world. The good Angels frequent these mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
with joy, as the pleasantest sight they see
among men: And the grieves they have<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 15. 7.</note> to see the
godly offend God, are mitigate, when they see these
same saints in the worke of repentance, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with God. And the evill angels who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
the<note n="*" place="margin">Job 1. 7.</note> earth continually, make a pause, when
they come to these congregations, as at their most
dolefull object: For then they see their labours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
in an houre, when God openeth the eyes
which they have blinded, softneth the heart which
they have hardened, and delivereth them whom
they have kept long in the bands of sinne.<note place="margin">But not idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>all meetings may not claime this,</hi> but such only
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14215:61"/>
as have Gods Word and Worship in puritie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which this beautie is to be exponed. Let Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
therefore consider how far they are from this
beautie. <hi>Gods word</hi> is corrupted among them in such
sort, that it cannot have that efficacie which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
accompanieth it. They serve God in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
language, and know neither what God saith
to them, nor they to him, so that they cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
off from the sweet intercourse of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and the godly soule, wherein reformed
Churches abound. Their idolatrie in praying to
Saints as <hi>helpers,</hi> and <hi>intercessors,</hi> and praising of
them (as their <hi>guardians</hi> and <hi>deliverers</hi>) defile the
sanctuarie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The duty of Pastors.</note> Congregations that seeme reformed
may prejudge themselves of this beautie, if they be
not spiritually disposed; so that both Pastors and

this beautie. Pastours, that they strive to be Pastors

they carry Aarons garment, bearing their people on
the breast-plate of their heart in love, and on their

be taken up with the desire of Gods glorie, and their
peoples happinesse, so that they care not what come
of themselves,<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 28. 12</note> if they obtaine those ends.</p>
                  <p>That they count their peoples <hi>teares their glorie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3 After their labours.</note>
and seek more their mourning, than their applause<note n="d" place="margin">Amo vocem illius Pastoris, qui non sibi plausum, sed mihi planctum, &amp;c. <hi>Bernard.</hi>
                     </note>;
and whatever blessing follows their labours in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
grace in the people, that they take no part of it
to themselves, but ascribe it wholly to God. So the<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 10</note> Apostle, <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all,
yet not I, but the grace of God which is with me.</hi> John
the Baptist rejoyced in Christ, and not in himselfe:
He made difference betwixt him and <hi>man-man, and
betwixt his master, who was Man-God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. tract. 14.</note> He knew that
who will rejoyce in himselfe shall be grieved: and
therefore he took no more to himself, lest he should

lest they glory in the Lords gifts; and not in the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard. Cant. 14.</note>
But if they neglect the rule, and propone novelties
beside, or contrary to Scripture, taking libertie to
preach in publick their private new opinions: if they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14215:62"/>
preach themselves to shew their quicknesse, their
reading, their memorie, and that only for a popular
applause; they are not <hi>beautie, but blots</hi> of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie,
and abominations before God. And though
they be free of these things, they may fal in a worse,
if seeing their labours fruitfull in people, they take
the glorie of it to themselves in any part: then they
steale the glorie of God, procure his desertion to
their future labors, and prejudge themselves of their
owne happinesse. Besides, passionate Pastours are
worse in the sanctuarie than <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 29.</note>
they have no end but revenge, no rule, but splene,
and neither regard GOD, nor reverence man:
There cannot bee a greater blot in the sanctuarie;
thereby God is angred, people are offended, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the Lord is made to stink.</p>
                  <p>Next,<note place="margin">The dutie of people.</note> the peoples duetie is, to keepe their part of
this beautie:<note place="margin">1 In prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> That they count it Gods great mercie
who speaketh to them by Pastors,<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> not for the <hi>helpe
of any Creature (because he is omnipotent) but for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
to their weaknesse:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 5.</note> And it is their great
good, that without their owne labour they are
brought to happinesse by the labour of Pastours. In
their preparation, to be <hi>purified according to the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of the Sanctuarie</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 16. 22.</note>. The measures of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie
were the double of the common measure,
therfore the disposition for private worship must be
doubled for the Church, and the weeke dayes mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
must bee doubled for the Sabbath. Our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
hath the Manna doubled, and is not like the
Jews Sabbath in the wildernesse, theirs was a type
that in heaven wee should need no preaching nor
prayer,<note place="margin">2 In the Church.</note> but ours is of perfect glorie in heaven. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14215:62"/>
then ought to be affected according to the parts
of Gods worship: In <hi>prayer,</hi> that the minde in faith
and zeale, follow the thing that is spoken: In <hi>praise,</hi>
to be sensible of the Psalme they sing; for praying
or praysing with a wandring heart is a mocking of
God in his face: In <hi>doctrine,</hi> that they have their
<hi>cjaculations</hi> for the worke of the spirit, and their
earnest intention for themselves and the Pastors<note n="a" place="margin">Intentio au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditoris, est ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio pro ipsis &amp; Pastore. <hi>Bern. fol. 104.</hi>

That they <hi>mixe</hi>

                     <hi>faith with their hearing,</hi> and bee

                     <hi>be hewen</hi> and wounded with the word of

And above all, let them bee earnest with God, that

but all are not perswaded, save those only to whom God
speaketh inwardly</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Aug. in 1. ep. Iohan. tract. 4.</note>: Lastly, that they take heede

and he be so senselesse that he knew neither if he met

and closed their Treatie: So are the most
part of us, wee come to the Sanctuarie, the Lords

things or no.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, Nations or Cities who have this beautie
of the sanctuarie,<note place="margin">Scotlands dutie in keeping this beautie.</note> should keepe it carefully, for it is

their glorie. And this is our advertisement, that we

                     <hi>hath committed
to us:</hi> For we may affirme, that God hath blessed us
with a bodie of as sound and wholesome divinitie,
as any age or nation since the Apostles time. No
Church is absolutely perfect, yet in this point, wee
may contest with the best. For in former times Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
busied the Church with heresies, as the Ebio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
Marcionits, Sabellians, Arians, Pelagians, &amp;c.
And when these were damned, Antichrist amassed
them all in one under other terms, and making ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the body of his Apostasie, obtruded them to the
Church, under the colours of his authoritie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie.
And when God led his Church by his
Worthies, the Reformers, hee blessed this Nation
with a body of most refined Doctrine. If we keepe
this in puritie, it shall be our happinesse: But if liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of private opinions, turn in a libertie of publick
venting these opinions, and to turne us to Rome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
then altar against altar will deface this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the sanctuarie. <hi>Hold fast that thou hast till I
come, that no man take thy crown</hi>

This seeing is not bodily, but spirituall: For
as the object is, so must the sense bee. There have

                     <hi>God dwelleth in the light inaccessible, whom none

                     <hi>who came out

and the ingraven forme of his petson; and likewise
by the word that hee gave to his Apostles. In like

by his Spirit revealeth to his own in the first fruits,
and earnest. God hath created the new man in his

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14215:64"/>
sight is the minde inlightned with heavenly light,
when God, who <hi>commanded light to shine</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>out of

When he hath created this light in us, <hi>then in his
light we see light</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 36. 9.</note>. This illumination of the mind
turneth in faith, when the things wee simply see by
light, wee assent unto and apply them to us as our
own, and so go forward in the application of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to our selves.</p>
                  <p>No light discovereth the Sunne,<note place="margin">Faith seeth God.</note> but the light that

the light that commeth from him, and that so cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it pulleth the heart to him, and true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in him. Our happinesse is in union with God,
and the maine bands thereof are the <hi>spirit</hi> on his
part, and <hi>faith</hi> on our part. Faith standeth not at
sight, but goeth on to apprehension: our <hi>assent</hi> tyeth
us to him by the mediation of his truth, but our <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension</hi>
gripeth himselfe immediately, as one
who is truth it self, and in whom all things are good

and wee remaine miserable, if wee have no

us, and wee are miserie in our selves without him:
therefore we must be in him, that we may be happie.
And this is by <hi>application,</hi> when as wee know hee is
chiefe good, so wee are perswaded that hee is our

of the Gospel; for he revealeth to us that we
may know, and the first end of knowledge is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
It is also the end of the efficacie of the Spirit,
joyned with the word, not to open our minds onely
to know, but also to apply to us. And shall we think
that the blessings of the Gospel are set before us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and yet this particular application may be found in
them: for as we beleeve the spirituall patrimonie of
the Church in the remission of sinnes, the glorious
resurrection of the body, and life eternall, is it onely
to know that there is such a treasure in the Church
without application to our selves? Or is an heire so

why should not the application of the grace
of the Gospel bee personall also? The nature and
work of conscience proveth the same; for it is a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
in our breast, and all the actions of it are
particular, ending in our person: And it contenteth
not it self generally to say, <hi>We are sinners,</hi> but chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
us in a particular branch of a particular Law;
and that in a particular kinde of sinne, in a particular

<hi>reward:</hi> Our merit, because he loveth that his owne
gift in us, and our reward, because so he followeth
his former mercies in us. It is most pleasant to our
selves, because it maketh the soule to rest sweetly on
a present and eternall good: Even the desire of a
good to come, hath the anxietie of delay, but love
hath it present. It layeth not a part of the heart on
God, but all; for that is his due,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 22. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>Love the Lord with
all thy heart:</hi> neither will the heart rightly affected
with him divide it selfe, but seeing and feeling his
goodnesse as he draweth, so it yeeldeth wholly to
him, and desireth to be out of it selfe, that it may be
in him. <hi>Love is that only motion or affection, whereby
we dare give God a meeting:</hi> If hee be angrie, wee
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14215:67"/>
dare not be angrie at him, but tremble and repent:
If he rebuke, we dare not rebuke him, but deprecat
his wrath: If he judge us, wee dare not judge him,
but justifie him in his judgements. If he command,
we dare not command him, but in all humilitie obey
him. <hi>But it is contrary in love, for when God loveth us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard.</note>
                     <hi>he seeketh that meeting to be loved againe, for he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

                  <p>The second part of this fruition is joy,<note place="margin">2. Of joy in God.</note> when the
soule overjoyed with God rejoyceth in him. It
floweth from love; for when God hath filled our
heart with the infusion of his love, and made it to
powre it selfe on him, by loving him with all our
heart; Of the sense of these two loves, followeth a
new <hi>infusion of joy,</hi> whereby it rejoyceth, that it is
beloved of God, and bestoweth it selfe in loving
him. <hi>Love</hi> is the worke of our soule, in our dearest
chiefe good about happinesse, and <hi>joy</hi> is the fruit of
that worke, and the rest of our soule resting sweetly
in the possession of him whom it loveth: and they are
both mutuall causes and equall. <hi>Mutuall,</hi> because
the more we love God, the more we rejoyce in him;
and the more wee rejoyce in him, the more wee love
him, as the matter of our joy: And they are <hi>equall,</hi>
because in that same measure we rejoyce in him, in
that same we love him. This is a joy<note n="*" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>unspeakeable

lesse than their <hi>thoughts,</hi> and their thoughts lesse
than the <hi>sense</hi> of it, and their sense lesse than it <hi>selfe:</hi>
And therefore their usuall expression is in secret
with God, to powre out their heart in that joy,
which they cannot expresse to man. When God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth

it, the heart cannot comprehend it fully, but
is like a small vessell, filled and overturned with a

it turneth that overrunning on God, and findeth that
the best containing both of it, and that joy, is to be
contained of God. It is also <hi>a glorious joy, or glorified,</hi>

                  <p>Spirituall <hi>Excesse</hi> is,<note place="margin">Spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</note> when God so communicateth
himselfe to the soule, that it exceedeth the wonted
disposition, and is carried out of it selfe to him: The
excellencie of the object, and singular sort of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
maketh this unaccustomed sweetnesse; for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
wee can comprehend our disposition, but
when he transcendeth our ordinary diet, wee must
gather our wits afterward to consider the matter: In
our wonted diet the spirit can bide in it selfe, though
with reference to God, and by the way can move
our body in naturall and civill actions: But when
this excesse commeth, the spirit is pulled out of it
selfe, and the body feebled: So the Apostle <hi>knew not
whether in the body,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>or out of the body, because of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14215:69"/>
excellencie of revelation;</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 10. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>so Daniels body was feebled,
because of the separation of the spirit taken up only with
heavenly things:</hi> For the soule in any degree of that
excesse, doeth not furnish power to the body, but
turneth it in halfe a carcase. It is good that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
finde sometimes this feebling by the vigorous
worke of the spirit, because the vigour of the body,
often feebleth the spirit. Though they both make
up one person, yet they have but a <hi>discording con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi>
and doe not ay agree upon a common joy and
griefe. By this feebling, the body resents its owne
mortalitie, and findeth that verified, That no<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 33. 20.</note> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
man can see God and live; and therefore is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to long for<note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 4.</note> immortalitie, that it may joyfully
brooke the fulnesse of that joy, whose first fruits doe
so affect us.</p>
                  <p>But this is <hi>not oft to be found,</hi> no not in the best:<note place="margin">Fruition is here but in tastes.</note> It
is but as a sunne-blink in the mids of stormes,<note place="margin">Sed heu hora rara! &amp; mora parva! Bern. Cant. ult.</note> that
commeth rarely, and bideth shortly. God offereth
it but rarely as a delicate, lest we should thinke, that
it came of our owne deserving or working; or lest
the frequence of it should take away the sweetnesse
or accompt of it. And he giveth it for two speciall
ends: The one, to <hi>refresh</hi> us after great afflictions or
desertions, when we have beene striving with hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and witherednesse of heart: But so soone as his
spirit rusheth on us, with that holy and heavenly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tietie,
like the <hi>woman delivered of a sonne,</hi> we forget
our former sorrowes, because we have found him
whom our soule loveth. The other is, to strengthen
us for some great temptation, like<note n="*" place="margin">1. King. 19. 2.</note> Eliahs double
supper: But come what tentation may, better to find
that furnishing, than to want it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:14215:69"/>
It hath also a further reach than for the present
time,<note place="margin">But the fruits of it are many.</note> for it leadeth us back to eternitie, and maketh
us feele our selves in Gods <hi>electing</hi> love, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
fruit wee finde in so full infusion of his love.
Next, it leadeth us foreward to <hi>glorification,</hi> and
these joyes assure us, that as now we have these first
fruits,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. 23.</note> so eternally we shall rejoyce with God, for
it is not as the small and warsh taste of the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Christian, as a drop; but the full measure of Gods
children, as the outbreaking of a fountaine. It rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
also to a higher place than the sanctuarie, for
under this satietie we are in <hi>heaven</hi> with God: For
as he boweth downe and kisseth us with the kisses of
inspiration,<note place="margin">Cant. 1. Bernard.</note> infusion, and delight, so wee ascend to
him in heaven, and the soule is more there busied,
than the body in the sanctuarie. This is also to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us of <hi>life eternall,</hi> for God never bringeth any
to heaven, but sometimes in this life he giveth them
a taste of it by some <hi>transfiguration</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 9. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:</hi>
He hath promised it, and Sathan would make
us thinke his promise but winde, therefore he giveth
us such reall beginnings, to assure us of the truth, and
to perswade us of the fulnesse of it in heaven. For it
is not a divided, but a continuat thing, like a chaine
that cannot be broken, so that he which getteth such
beginnings, shall also get the perfection. Lastly, it is
to <hi>destroy the love</hi> of the world, for the world will
never be great in his eyes, who hath seene God; but
the loathing of the world, and the love of God will
grow in his soule by equall degrees.</p>
                  <p>The soule thus filled with love and joy,<note place="margin">To be full of God.</note> is <hi>full of
God,</hi> and under that disposition cannot be wrong
charged to any doing or suffering for him: For the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14215:70"/>
sense of Christs love <hi>maketh his yoak easie</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note>, <hi>&amp; his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
light.</hi> That love<note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>constrained the Apostle to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi>
and the nativenes of it seeketh out wayes to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God. The <hi>Martyrs</hi> were thereby moved to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard
their torments: For as a <hi>drunken man</hi> neither
heareth nor seeth what is done beside him, so when
<hi>their wives and children wept on them, that they
would pitie themselves; they neither heard that diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
neither the paine of the torments.</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
met teares, with<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 21. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>What do yee weeping and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my heart? I am not only content to be bound at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
but also to die for the name of the Lord Iesus.</hi>
On this excesse Moses<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note> desired to be <hi>cut off,</hi> and the
Apostle<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 9. 2.</note> to be <hi>accursed</hi> for his brethren. The love
of God made them forget themselves with an holy
oblivion: But it was their best remembring of
themselves; to hold them fast in straitest union with
God.</p>
                  <p>Hereof foure things arise: 1. The agreement of
sight and fruition.<note place="margin">Sight and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> 2. The compleatnesse of Gods
beautie in the sanctuarie. 3. The difference of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions;
4. And of worshippers in the true religion.
1. <hi>Sight and fruition goe well together,</hi> as the double
spirit of Eliseus, for the illumination of the minde;
and the purging of the affections compleat the man:
for the minde knoweth, and the affections will.
Sight or light without fruition is fruitlesse; and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or affection without light is rash: Light first
wakeneth, and then directeth the affection, to affect
things in that order<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and measure as it directeth: And
the affection followeth to justifie the trueth of that
light. Sight apprehendeth God as distant, but frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
injoyeth him within, and our selves in that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14215:70"/>
union: the minde is more easily inlightned, than the
affection bowed.<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 14. 1.</note> The Disciples knew Christ was
to depart from them, yet they were sorie for it, their
will crossing their minde.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>fruition is better than sight,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fruition better than sight.</note> as<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 48. 19.</note> Ephraim the
younger brother was more fruitfull and mightie
than Manasseh. When God craveth the best of
man, he biddeth him <hi>love him with all his heart:</hi> And
the image of God<note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 24.</note> consisteth most in righteousnesse
and holinesse, which are most in the heart: Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
maketh a sort of <hi>mentall union,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Naked know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.</note> and yet the
heart may hate that same thing it is so united to; but
affection maketh a heartie and strong union, which
cannot be broken. Knowledge is a great gift of God,
but if men stand at it as their happinesse, and advance
not to fruition, they may be as hard in heart, and
profane in life, as the ignorant. Sathan hath his name<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 8. 27.</note> Daemon from knowledge, because being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
spirit, he hath both great knowledge by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and daily augmented by experience: but his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is contrary to his knowledge, for he neither
loveth the good, nor hateth the evill, he knoweth.
We partake more of God by fruition, than by sight.
To dispute of happinesse with a frosen and cold
heart, is great miserie. Goodnesse is a speciall attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of God, expressing that fountaine; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth
it, to make us good and happie in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
and that is more in the conformitie of our will
and affections to him, than of knowledge alone.
If it be true, <hi>that wee know no more of God, than wee
affect him,</hi> then fruition is better than knowledge,
which it both limiteth and exceedeth.<note place="margin">Bern. 97. col. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Instruction
maketh men learned, but affection maketh them wise.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14215:71"/>
It is one thing to know, and another to possesse: It is not
the knowledge of riches, but the possession that maketh
men rich: It is one thing to see God, and another to
feare and love him.</hi> They may justly glorie of their
power in being the sonnes<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 1. 12.</note> of God, in whom this
sonly love burneth, and this affection liveth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the compleat beautie of the sanctuary
is <hi>Gods presence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gods presence the beautie of the Sanctuarie.</note> which maketh up all the parts of it.
It is knowne in his working, wherein wee consider
foure things:<note place="margin">1 The efficacie of it.</note> First, the <hi>efficacie:</hi> Secondly, the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie:</hi>
Thirdly, the <hi>sensiblenesse:</hi> Fourthly, the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning.</hi>
His working in the Saints, is the work of
his omnipotencie, whereby <hi>hee raised</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ from
the dead;</hi> for it is called a<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> new <hi>Creation,</hi> a<note n="*" place="margin">Tit. 3. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi>
and the Hebrewes call comfort the<note n="*" place="margin">Lam. 1. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
of the soule,</hi> as though griefe had thrust it
out of the bodie, but God by comfort brought it
back againe, as a sort of resurrection. And this is
the power that goeth out with the word to make it
conquering.<note place="margin">Esay 55. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>for it returneth not in vain, but worketh
the work wherefore it is sent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 The secrecie of it.</note> the <hi>secrecie</hi> of his worke, which is hid
oft-times to those who have it: <hi>The spirit</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 3. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>bloweth
where it listeth:</hi> yea, oft times we apprehend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie;
for his diet with the godly is to lead them to
heaven by the gates of hell. For many a time hee
plungeth us in fearefull terrors, but his work endeth
in joyfull comforts. So David is mourning in the
beginning of many Psalmes, the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 32. 51. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but in the end, hee is rejoycing, and of a poore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant
for himselfe, is turned an Intercessour for
the Church. The childe in the belly feeleth not his
growing, yet he groweth, and the hand of the horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14215:71"/>
is not seene in the moving, yet when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to an houre, it is manifest that it hath moved.
So the worke of grace hath a growing in us though
hid, and is manifest in some great degree of joy, or
great griefe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 The sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of it.</note> the sensiblenesse of it, for wee are both
the object of his work, and reasonable and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
workers with him: Sometimes wee feele the
work, but know not the Author, <hi>as the disciples go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Luc. 24. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>Emaus felt their hearts burning:</hi> but knew
not it came of Christ. Sometimes we know the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,<note n="*" place="margin">Luc. 1. 41.</note>
as Elizabeth knew the presence of Christ to
be the cause of her joy at the blessed Virgins saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And the fore-runner springing in her belly, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
that he was spiritually sensible of his masters
presence, before he had the use of any bodily sense:
So the new man in us, when he is not oppressed with
senselesnesse, leapeth for joy at the voyce of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the <hi>discerning</hi> of it goeth in three:
First,<note place="margin">4 The discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</note> for <hi>originall:</hi> That it is a divine power; though
it specifie it selfe in our disposition which is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
yet it selfe is meerly divine: Secondly, in the
<hi>force,</hi> for it worketh infallibly in the Elect. Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie
admitteth no resistance, and mans will hath
no losse, when the Creator of it maketh it free from
sinne: no, it is both the glorie and libertie of our will,
that God takes it in his hand, &amp; boweth it what way
he pleaseth. And Gods best children endeavour to
this as a perfection, who have their wils altogether
conformed to the will of God; and that they can
quite their owne will, when they see his will revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in his providence: so farre are they from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their wils to be harmed, when they are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14215:72"/>
of God. They strive to be like Gods who stand
out in the question of free-will against God, and are
blasphemous while they affirm, That God worketh
no more mightily in the elect, than Sathan doth in
the reprobate. But when wee finde his power to bee
such, that neither nature can imitate nor resist, then
we acknowledge it is the finger of God in us. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the <hi>fruits</hi> are a change and calmenes: The <hi>change</hi>
is so sensible, that it argueth a divine power. For it
goeth eyther from contrary to contrary, as from
joy to griefe, or from griefe to joy; or if it abide in
either of them it commeth in a greater degree than
was immediately before. Yea, all in us feeleth that
working; the old man to his wounding, and the new
man to his strengthning. <hi>Calmenesse</hi> of spirit is the
other fruit, whereby with some sweet astonishment,
we rest in his bosome whom our soule loveth: Then
we break out with this, or the like ejaculation,<note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 106. 4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Who
am I that thou remembrest me with the favour of thy
people, and visitest me with thy salvation!</hi> that <hi>thou
makest me see the felicitie of thy chosen,</hi> and rejoyce
with the joy of thy people, and glorie with <hi>thine
inheritance!</hi> Who am I that thou discernest mee,
making me both see and enjoy thee in the sanctuarie,
and so to be a part of the beautie of it! <hi>Who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
himselfe for joy, when he findeth that divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
incline himselfe to his weaknesse, and co<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap> down
to so familiar and sweetest societie</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Non me capio prae laetitia, quod illa maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stas tam fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liari, dulcique consortio. <hi>Ber-Can. 52.</hi>
                     </note>?</p>
                  <p>Hereof commeth the Christian <hi>true contentment.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</note>
The world hath almost talked as much of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(the marrow of happinesse) as of happinesse it
selfe, on these same grounds, in these same errors, &amp;
with the like fruit. For they sought it never in God,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14215:72"/>
but in his gifts: They fastened not their soules up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the chiefe good, but loosed their desires upon
every occasionall good, and so they neither contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their lot, nor were contained of it. But increase
of their lot inflamed their desire, and augmented
their miscontentment: But true contentment is, when
the soule findeth it selfe embraced of God, yea, and
possessed of him; that it may say, <hi>The</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 16. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord is the
portion of my inheritance;</hi> for it findeth it <hi>selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
of God, &amp; is content to be so contained, which is
properly contentment.</hi> As in it selfe it is so contained,
so in all the desires, which runne no wayes out to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things; for it hath a spirituall delicacie, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
full of God, it counteth not greatly of other
things beside. Therefore when the Prophet hath
called God his portion, hee said, his <hi>inheritance was
pleasant to him:</hi> he found such contentment in God,
that hee saw nothing beside, that could so much as
draw his vaging desire to it. <hi>Hee contemneth other
things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">August.</note> 
                     <hi>and that not onely which hee might have, but
what he would have, because these things doe more hurt
being obtained, than desired.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Difference of true and false religions.</note> here is a <hi>difference betwixt the true and
false religion.</hi> True religion presenteth the true God
as an object of worship; an author of working, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pener
of his peoples eyes to see, a mover of their
hearts to love him, and rejoyce in him: So that both
the union is sensible<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and the communion flowing
from it. False religion hath none of these: for ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
hath no true God for the object, neither su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
(the false worship of the true God.) Let
them pretend affection and zeale even to extasie, it
is no better than the furie of the Baalites<note n="*" place="margin">1 Kin. 18. 28</note>. The new
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14215:73"/>
Pelagians also deny any other working of God in
the Elect than in the Reprobate, and grant no more
than a morall suasion generally offering, but never
moving the heart to receive: They hold God and
man ever asunder; for they give man a beginning of
good which he hath not of Christ. In the work, they
make him his owne <hi>discerner,</hi> and in the end <hi>exactour</hi>
of his own due glorie. But wee should consider the
Elect, as they are the lively members of Christ, and
have right to the fulnes of grace that is in that head,
so that when God commeth downe to work in the
Sanctuarie, hee looketh not to the Elect as strangers,
but as to the living members abiding in his Sonne,
and therefore his Spirit communicateth to them both
easily and powerfully, the grace that is in that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
This reall union with Christ is better than their
division: and they who will ever be divided from the
chiefe good cannot intend to have happinesse in
him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">All worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are not alike.</note> this putteth a difference among them,
who are exercised in a true religion. They are not all
alike disposed: some receive happinesse with joy by
that effectuall working: others remaine senselesse in
the hardnesse of their heart, which they have drawn
on with <hi>the deceit of sinne</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note>: Some again contemne
the holy disposition of the godly:<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 14.</note> So Eli (albeit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
a good man) <hi>expounded Hannahs devotion
at the first uncharitably:</hi> But though Eli mock Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs
devotion, and the proud Pharisee disdaine the
teares of the penitent Woman<note n="*" place="margin">Luc. 7. 44.</note>, yet Christ both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
and defendeth her<note n="a" place="margin">Bernard. Cant. 12.</note>. No wonder, for this
work is personall, and known only to them in whom
it is. That <hi>white stone</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 2. 17.</note> hath the name of Elect writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14215:73"/>
on it, and <hi>none can reade it but he that hath it;</hi> none
is conscious of his estate in grace, but himselfe:
Others, who have the like, can judge charitably,
while they, who have not such experience doe carpe
and censure. This vilifying of the grace of God, is
a policie of Sathan; thereby hee hardeneth naturall
men, and presseth to dash Gods children from seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or uttering of that, which is so uncharitably

greatest care about happinesse, to bee <hi>searching

order telleth us, that enquiring followeth behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and none doe more seeke God, and happinesse
in him, than they that see him. Desire of grace
groweth with the growth of it. As the wretch
wretcheth the more he is enriched, so the increase of
grace augmenteth the desire of it. Gods<note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 3. 1.</note> Church
is busie, <hi>running to and fro seeking her beloved,</hi>
when other companies seeke their vanities. That
heavenly affection setteth her on work, and the want
of it made them idle. Peter and John<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 20. 4.</note> were most
forward in running to the sepulchre, because they
loved him most; and Simeon<note n="*" place="margin">Luc. 2. 27.</note> came oftner to the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14215:75"/>
temple, than others in Jerusalem, because he longed
more to see Christ in the flesh. And it is ever seene,
that they who have most knowledge with holinesse,
are busiest to seek the Lord. God is so glorious, and
happinesse is so sweet, that the more wee see them,
the more wee seeke them. And the nature of true
grace is to be so allured; neither is there a better to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the livelinesse of the new man, than to be set
continually to<note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 12. 1.</note> seek his Creatour.</p>
                  <p>The word (<hi>enquire</hi>) in the originall pointeth also
at the <hi>morning,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tymely searching.</note> because the Soule is then most fit

Christ the Sunne of righteousnesse hath brought
a new light into the world after the Evening of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams
fall. Therfore in seeking happinesse, we would
be tymous in the morning of our age, and vigour of
our soule, and not cast off that greatest worke to old
age. God biddeth us haste in the morning, but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
biddeth us delay till the evening of our time:
And he who doth so, what knoweth he, if he shal live
so long? Or, if he doe, he knoweth not, if God will
continue the occasions of happinesse with him: Or,
if they abide, what knoweth hee, if God will blesse
them? No, it is just with God to neglect them in
their old age, who neglected him in their youth.<note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 1. 24, 25</note>

                  <p>This word offereth three things to our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">The best is here imperfect.</note>
1. Our <hi>imperfection.</hi> 2. Our <hi>changeable state.</hi>
3. And the <hi>remedy</hi> of both, in a diligent inquirie.
1. <hi>Imperfection</hi> is in the best, for we are here not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of perfection, because wee have flesh<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> mixed
with the spirit, and are layed open to the continuall
tentations of Sathan: This cannot stand with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse;
for in heaven neither can the sinne of ill <hi>or

imperfection; <hi>Not that I have alreadie attained, or

                     <note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>know but in part,</hi> for where wee
know one thing, millions are hid from us; and that
same that we know is more hid than knowne; and all
our knowledge is <hi>but some thing of all, but nothing of
all, but nothing of the whole:</hi> And the undoubted te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
of greatest knowledge, is the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of ignorance: Take the knowledge of the
best, it is but ignorance, confusion, and full of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie.
Therefore one crieth out justly, <hi>Woe to our
straight knowledge, woe to the povertie of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Vae augustae cognitioni, vae paupertati sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae nostrae. Bernard. de Ascens. serm. 4.</note>.
If wee looke to God, how small is our
knowledge; and though modestly wee may search
his will, but not curiously his Majestie, lest we be
oppressed, we come but short. And in the search of
his will, <hi>if we should study from 16. to an 100. yeere
old, we would daily finde matter of a new searching</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Tanta est profunditas Scripturarum, &amp;c. Aug. Epist. 3.</note>,
albeit there is as much plaine, as to suffice people to
salvation.</p>
                  <p>The conceit of perfection is the greatest imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,<note place="margin">Conceit of perfection dangerous.</note>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:14215:76"/>
and the greatest stay of proceeding: When
men set up these two mountaines in their way, <hi>of
presumption, and vaine glorie,</hi> they leave off to go
forward: For whither shall they go, who thinke
themselves already perfect? The Jewes had this,
and would not submit them to the righteousnesse of
God<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note>. The Papists have it, in their perfection obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or to be obtained, their <hi>merit, supererogation:</hi>
and all vented in the confidence they put in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
They who will not trust in God, will trust in
themselves, and in their righteousnesse; which is a
<hi>non ens,</hi> or rather their greatest sinne. <hi>Pelagius</hi> had
this pride, when he boasted, that there lacked <hi>not one
to doe the things commanded, but one to command
more:</hi> But God hath dauntoned that pride by the
Law: And one hath answered them in the person
of the Jewes: Behold, fulfill the Law, <hi>there lacketh
not one to command, but there lacketh one to obey</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, the imperfect measure we have is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to change; and that because of the spirituall
<hi>combat,</hi> of <hi>decay, defection,</hi> and <hi>desertion. 1.</hi> The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
combat proveth our weaknesse, the flesh <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
rebelling against the spirit, so that the good we
would doe, we cannot doe it, and the evill we would not
doe, we are forced to doe:</hi> For though wee were even
now in some good disposition, yet the flesh, yeelding
to some tentation, casteth us downe further, than we
can arise in many dayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decay</hi> falleth in the best and most wakrife Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:
For the knowledge that the minde hath layed
up,<note place="margin">1. Decay fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the best.</note> the memorie forgetteth; and the softnes and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
of heart decayeth even in them, who labour
on their heart continually: and that not so much by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14215:76"/>
outward provocations, as by the inward deceit, and
native backslyding of the heart it selfe. When a
workman leaveth his worke at evening, he findeth it
in the morning in that same case, wherein he left it:
But if we lye downe, with an heart softned with the
sense of Gods mercies, in the morning wee finde it
oftentimes like a stone; grace is a stranger to us, and
our nature at the best, giveth it but a step-mothers
intreatie: it findeth opposition of our corruption, and
therefore is subject to hourely decayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Defection</hi> stayeth our proceeding in happinesse.
Every sinne is a defection,<note place="margin">2. Defection stayeth us.</note> and a falling from a better
to a worse<note n="a" place="margin">Peccare est deficere, &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus esse. Qui peccant, minus sunt qu√†m erant. Aug. ver. Rel. c. 11. &amp; 14.</note>; for it hath not only the double guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the <hi>blemish,</hi> and <hi>lyablenesse</hi> to punishment,
but likewise crosseth the grace of God in us, as one
contrary doeth another: And as in our youth, our
food hath two workes: One of sustentation, the
other of adding a new substance; so when happinesse
is begun in us, we have need of double labour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
it. Sathan rageth, and the flesh fretteth the
more, therefore wee have need of more diligence to
resist them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Desertion</hi> is most fearfull, when we finde not God
as wee were wont,<note place="margin">3. Desertions fearefull.</note> and under that dreariesome wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood
of our soule, are put to that grievous task
to seek him againe, and to greatest necessitie to finde
him. Sometime it is <hi>procured</hi> by great sinnes, as in
David under his murther and adulterie; sometimes
by our <hi>negligence,</hi> as when we waxe coldri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>e in our
devotion, and in well-doing in our calling: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is <hi>supposed,</hi> as when a mother hiding her
face with a cloth, the loving childe thinketh her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and hath no rest till he see her face againe. So
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14215:77"/>
is it in our supposed desertions: And according to
the degree of Gods presence, is the griefe that wee
conceive of his desertion, which admitteth no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
but the sense of his presence againe. The more
gratious presence we have found, his absence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is the more grievous; for the withdrawing of
the thing that we love, is the increase of our desire:
And the thing <hi>that wee most desire, wee want it with
greatest griefe:</hi> But many of our desertions are more
supposed than reall:<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 20. 14.</note> Marie Magdalen wept, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had taken away the Lord, and yet he was
beside her, and by his vertue made her to seeke him,
till she found him: So many a time we mourne for
the want of God when he is with us, yea, <hi>it is his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
that maketh us feele his absence:</hi> For we should
not thinke our selves without God, when wee finde
him dwelling in our heart by faith: <hi>For he commeth
when he is manifest in his working, and he departeth
when he is hid in his working</hi>

                  <p>The best remedy then of these impediments of
our happinesse is, continually to inquire it,<note place="margin">3. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> which
standeth in three things: The <hi>fixing</hi> of the end;<note place="margin">1. Fixing of the end.</note> The
<hi>forgetting</hi> of things behind; And <hi>advancing</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.<note n="*" place="margin">Philip. 3. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>One thing I doe, forgetting things behind, I
endeavour my selfe to that which is before.</hi> The end is
God himselfe, and our happinesse as the <hi>praise of our
high calling</hi> in his hand; Not that wee love him for
that reward, <hi>but he himselfe is our reward</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Noli diligere Deum propter praemium, ipse fit tibi praemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Aug. tract. 3. Iohan.</note>. This must
be so fixed, as wee neither change with any other,
neither joyne any other to it; but as a marke we must
direct all our thoughts, words, and deeds, respecting
or using things only, as they can further us:<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 20. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yee eat, or yee drinke, doe all to the glorie of God.</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:14215:77"/>
We must intend no other, nor no lesse, than this end,
like the spouse<note n="*" place="margin">Cantic. 1. 1.</note> who craved not to be admitted to
<hi>the kisse of Christs feet, or of his hands, but of his mouth.</hi>
Travellers are knowne by their journying, and the
Jewes knew that Christ<note n="*" place="margin">Luc. 9. 53.</note> was going toward Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<hi>because his face was that way.</hi> So if we minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
heaven, wee must walk through the world as
strangers<note n="*" place="margin">1. Pet. 12. 11.</note>, not resting upon the things of the way.
God in heaven, with the prise of our high calling,
must be so in our eye, and in our heart, as to draw the
course of our conversation toward them, so that all
that looke upon us may say: <hi>That they see our minde
is toward Sion.</hi> Cain built a Citie, <hi>because he sought
his happinesse on earth, but Abel builded none, because
he looked for a biding Citie in heaven.</hi> The vessels of
wrath, and citizens of the earthly citie sticking in
that corrupt masse abide on the earth; But they that
are separate are burgesses in the citie of God: And
though Cain called his citie Enochia, as though he
had found rest;<note place="margin">Aug. Civit. 15. 1. 2. 8.</note> yet he was but a vagabond: For
strong walls are but weake defences against an evill
conscience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a holy <hi>forgetfulnesse</hi> of by-gone degrees
of happinesse;<note place="margin">Forgetfulnesse of by-gones.</note> yea, though they were excesses or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieties,
we must passe them as degrees, and not stand
upon them as perfections: <hi>For so long as we seeke,
not being satiat with the fulnesse of the fountaine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. Epist. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>wee
are not come to our full measure: God giveth us divine
vertues, that here we may live a godly life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. Vit. beat. cap. ult.</note> 
                     <hi>and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
receive full happinesse.</hi> While we are procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the way, we count these degrees perfection
before we come to them; but having attained them,
and comparing them to perfection it selfe, we finde
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14215:78"/>
them as far lesse than it, as they are greater than our
beginnings. A weake spirit sitteth downe upon some
taste of grace with admiration, and thinketh that

pressed to destroy the grace of perseverance, God
let him fall from such grace as he had,<note place="margin">P. Bertius de Apostasia Sanctorum.</note> to turne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
and of a professour of divinitie, to become a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer

                  <p>Our late Libertines mock this doctrine.<note place="margin">Libertines are licentious.</note> They
professe <hi>a perfection in this life,</hi> and so deny the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie

nor hateth sinne in them; That they need not repent
nor mourne for sinne, nor incite themselves to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of God; That they need not pray, but praise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi>
This is a refined extract of Sathan, who as
by the Pelagians he oppugneth grace by nature, so
in them he destroyeth it in the name of grace; And
under a conceit of singular grace, maketh them sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
gracelesse. They have carved to themselves
an easie way to heaven by laughing and mirth,
whereas Gods best children find it a <hi>valley of teares.</hi>
But their pretended perfection is found to be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
colour of libertie to their flesh; for they
are knowne to be more licentious in their wayes,
than they who groan under the sense of their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  <p>The last degree commeth at death:<note place="margin">Happinesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth before death.</note> Not that our
happinesse is suspended till then, for we are here <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
happines,<note place="margin">August.</note> though we cannot possesse it till death.</hi>
Solons speach cannot abide an exact triall, for wee
are called to happinesse even in this life: It is called
a valley of miserie, and craveth some solace by a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
happinesse: And the scripture pronounceth in
the present some men happie.<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 32. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Blessed is he whose
sinnes are forgiven:</hi> And happinesse is here begun
in us; faith gripeth it in the promise, hope waiteth
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14215:80"/>
on it in the fulnesse, our desire longeth for it, and the
beginnings of it selfe begin our profession. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death all shall be perfected. This was the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the wisest Pagans, when they had pleased
themselves with their discourses of happinesse, they
could not indure the thoughts of death, but called it
<hi>of fearfull things the most fearefull.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aristot.</note> They trembled
at that, where they should finde most comfort; and
their thoughts of eternitie were as confused, as their
doctrine of happinesse was false: And therefore
could finde no comfort in their evanishing. But the
truth telleth us, that at death we end the valley of
miserie, and enter in everlasting happinesse.</p>
                  <p>At death then our perfect happinesse beginneth,<note place="margin">1. It shall be a consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ill.</note>
and that in two: First, in <hi>removing all miserie,</hi> or
what ever imperfection; The other in compleating
happinesse in it selfe. Our first miserie is sinne origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
which God cutteth off by perfect <hi>sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
In our effectuall calling, that cutting off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
and goeth on by degrees till death, when
our last breath hath the last act of mortifying grace
in the full abolishing of sinne. Secondly, the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of all guiltinesse whatsoever, that wee may be
presented pure and blamelesse to him. Thirdly, wee
shall be freed from all tempters and tentations: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
shall molest us no more: There shall be no need
of an hedge to Job, neither shall wicked men by their
example pervert us, or by their violence injure us,
neither shall a deceitfull heart deceive us any more.
Fourthly, we shall be freed of all affliction; we shall
not desert God in sinne; and he shall not desert us in
his anger to punish us for sinne:<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 21. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>There shall be no
more sorrow, nor feare, nor crying out, because these first
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14215:80"/>
things shall be ended, and God shall wipe away all teares
from our eyes.</hi> Lastly, the mortalitie of this bodie
shall end: It is so fraile now, that hardly can we fit
it to serve us in actions naturall or spirituall, and is a
daily burthen to us, to keepe it from sickenesse and
inconvenients. And when it is under them, a greater
burthen to make it free: But when it shall be made
a spirituall bodie, these things shall cease: <hi>Christs
death hath killed death,</hi> and his life is our life.</p>
                  <p>This is the consumption of the ills of our miserie:<note place="margin">2. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of all good.</note>
Followeth the consummation of good things, that
perfecteth our happinesse: and these are first the cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the meanes of grace, which are now necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the way; then they shall end, as having neither
further worke, nor use in us. So prophesying shall
cease, and praying shall turne in praise: On our part
<hi>faith</hi> shall end in sight; <hi>hope</hi> in fruition; <hi>desire</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
and the beginnings themselves in their due
perfection. 2. All goodnes shall be perfected in us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our measure: our light perfect without
ignorance or error; our love perfect without slacking;
our will obsequious without rebellion; our affections
straight without perversenes; and righteousnes &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
in our last breath shal be accomplished: and that
last act of our regeneration shall bring forth the new
man, and send him in a glorious libertie to God. And
when our bodies have rested a while in the grave, till
our brethren be perfected, they shal rise glorious, like
the body of Christ. Our souls shal see <hi>God, as they are
seene,</hi> and know him as they are knowne;<note n="*" place="margin">Rev 21. 5, 6.</note> Then we
shall see his face,<note place="margin">Nec aliud qu√†m ipsum exspectamus ab ipso. Bern. Qui habit. serm. 14.</note> and his name shall be on our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.
The full happinesse that wee expect from
God, is of God: neither expect wee any other thing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14215:81"/>
from him but himselfe. God shall fully possesse us;
wee shall be perfect in God; and God shall be all in
all: he shall delight to looke on us his creatures,
whom he hath glorified in mercie, and wee shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in him eternally.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let true religion binde us to the blessed
God,<note place="margin">3. Happinesse commeth by true religion.</note> who is happinesse it selfe, and giveth happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to others, betwixt whom and our mind (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee know him to be happinesse and truth,) no
creature interveneth; and who hath given to some
creatures so much happines as they desire; to others
as much as they can containe: He is that only God,
of whom wee are, from whom wee departed, and to
whom wee were made unlike by our fall, and yet of
his mercie he suffered us not to perish: the beginning,
to the which we returne; the forme that we follow,
the grace whereby wee are reconciled; by whom as
creatour we live, and by whom being reformed, we
live wisely; and by loving and injoying of whom
we live happily: even that true God, of whom are
all, to whom are all; to him be praise
and honour for ever.</p>
