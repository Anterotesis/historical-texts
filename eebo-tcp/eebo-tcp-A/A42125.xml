            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Receiv'd your Letter with ſome <hi>Queries,</hi> but I cannot imagine what made you pitch upon me (when you are acquainted with ſo many Learned men) to Anſwer 'em. But to let you ſee how willing I am to give you the beſt Satisfaction that I can, I have here ſent you the Opinions of ſome of our moſt Celebrated Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal Divines, that out of them you may frame Anſwers to all your <hi>Queries;</hi> And if you are not Satisfied with what I have Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of 'em, you may have recourſe to their Books your ſelf.

of theſe, he or they ſo doing cannot be acquitted from the guilt of Schiſm, unleſs the Corruption in ſome one, or more of theſe be ſo great as to render the Communion ſinful to him who knows it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is meant by the firſt Bond, <hi>Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If a Church hold the Catholick Faith, (tho' her Members<note place="margin">Id.</note> may differ in ſome controverted Points) pure and undefil'd, and impoſe no new Articles of Faith, as terms of her Communion, 'tis Schiſm to break Communion with that Church; but if ſhe does impoſe new Articles of Faith, a Separation from ſuch a Church is not only juſtifiable, but a Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is meant by the ſecond Bond, <hi>Worſhip?</hi>
            </p>

But if on the other ſide, the Worſhip be polluted by Idolatry, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and immoral mixtures, or any other way be made ſuch, as that the Members of the Church cannot Communicate without ſin; Separation from ſuch a Church is not only warrantable, but abſolutely neceſſary, and the Schiſm muſt lie at the door of the Impoſers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is meant by the third Bond, <hi>Government?</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> If the Church of which we are Members, be governed by <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Canonical</hi> Biſhops, and they act according to the Rules of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, then to ſeparate from them is a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sin, and a pernicious Schiſm; 'Tis a denying of Chriſt himſelf, who appointed them to rule the Church in his ſtead: But if they are, either not <hi>Lawful</hi> Biſhops, but <hi>Intruders,</hi> or not <hi>Orthodox</hi> but <hi>Heritical,</hi> then they that Separate are not only not Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, but the true Church, and they that cauſe the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Schiſmaticks.</p>

            <p>Separation is unwarrantable, if Communion with the Church may be without Sin.</p>
            <p>Renouncing Communion, or denying to Communicate with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Church, upon any diſlike, or for any cauſe, <hi>except ſin,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Separation and Schiſm: it is not actually not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with a True Chruch, but renouncing Communion, that we think makes the Schiſmatick.</p>
            <p>Schiſm is directly a Breach of Unity; as that is a Breach of<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> Charity. Refuſing to Communicate with a true Church, when I have opportunity, eſpecially my own Church, is a plain breach of both, whatever my reaſon be, ſhort of <hi>Sin.</hi>

            <p>1 That the Notion of a Church was the ſame with that of a<note place="margin">Miſchief Separ. <hi>p. 29.</hi> Can. Nic. Can. <hi>6. 15. 16. Conſtan. c. 6. Chalced. 17, 20, 26.

Or, <hi>2ly.</hi> That thoſe Presbyters who rejected the Authority of their Biſhop or affected <hi>Separate Meetings,</hi> where no fault could be found with the Doctrine of a Church, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd of Schiſm. So the followers of <hi>Euſtathius Sebaſtenus,</hi> who withdrew from the publick Congregations on pretence of greater Sanctity and Purity, in <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> were condemn'd by the Council at <hi>Gangrae;</hi> So were thoſe who Separated from their Biſhops, tho' otherwiſe never ſo Orthodox, by the Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Council at <hi>Carthage;</hi> wherein before S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had ſo juſtly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the Schiſm of <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> and his Brethren, who, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſome diſorders in the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> had withdrawn to the Mountains; and there laid the foundation of the <hi>Novatian</hi> Schiſm. But when falſe Doctrine was impoſed on Churches, as by the <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops at <hi>Antioch,</hi> then the people were excuſed in their Separation; So at <hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Felix</hi> was made Biſhop; and at <hi>Sirmium</hi> when <hi>Photinus</hi> publiſh'd his Hereſie; but I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member one inſtance in Antiquity, wherein <hi>Separation</hi> from <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Biſhops</hi> and ſetting up <hi>Meetings</hi> without their Authority and againſt their conſent was acquitted from the Sin of <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of what is contain'd in the Anſwer to this Query amounts to this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Biſhops were True and Canonical Biſhops. And the Popiſh Biſhops in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s days Intruders.</p>
            <p>2. That thoſe that adhered to K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Biſhops in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, altho' depriv'd, were the True Church, and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thoſe that forſook their Communion were the Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is true, That they who firſt deſert and forſake the Communion<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>In a word, he that forſakes the Aſſemblies of Catholick Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is a Schiſmatick, not he that goes not to a Church: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſtians, tho' in a Den or Cave of the Earth, worſhip God, in the Unity of the Church, there is the Church of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Schiſmaticks?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes doubtleſs, For they not only ſet up ſeparate Meetings in oppoſition to Biſhops, but renounce all Epiſcopal Authority, and Uſurp the Power of Ordination, which did always belong to the Order of Biſhops.</p>

thing—and I believe, <hi>ſays he,</hi> Our Author himſelf will not ſay that Schiſmatical Presbyters may take this power, or that their Ordinations are valid, if they do. And this is the Caſe between us and the Diſſenters: They ordain in a Schiſm; and tho' neceſſity may make an irregular Act valid, yet Schiſm will not.</p>
            <p>The Novatians <hi>were Epiſcopal and ſo were the</hi> Donatiſts (ſays Mr.<note place="margin">Vindic. of the Prim. Ch. <hi>p. 330.</hi>

            <p>We believe with St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> that the power of Ordaining belongs only to the Biſhop, and your [Diſſenters] Ordinations made by Presbyters are all Void and Null; and, till you can prove the Contrary, we take you for no more but a parcel of Lay-intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into thoſe holy Functions to which you have no right, (thoſe of you only excepted who have been Epiſcopally Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd.)</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I muſt put him in mind, That as no Man<note place="margin">Id. p. <hi>51. Mat. 28. 18. Jo. 2. 21.</hi>

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97457:15"/>
as from God, but he that is authoriz'd by him for that purpoſe. Neither can I ſee any Reaſon, why a Man may not as well be a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, without any Miſſion at all, as by the Miſſion of thoſe perſons who never were ſent themſelves.</p>
            <p>I believe there never was any caſe of <hi>Abſolute Neceſſity</hi> for <hi>Lay-Ordinations;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. p. 53.</note> but if poſſibly ſuch ſhould happen as the Gentleman mentions, [of a Company of Lay-men being caſt upon an Iſland, or remaining in ſome Country, when their Paſtors are all kill'd, or turn'd Hereticks] I am apt to believe that <hi>Biſhops and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters duly ordain'd</hi> might be had from other Countries, and if not, methinks it would be reaſonable and fit, that we ſhould firſt ſee what God would do in ſuch Caſes, before we preſume to do any thing of our ſelves, for which we have no Scripture warrant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baſil</hi> is ſo reſolute upon his prerogative, that he will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure<note place="margin">Vindic. of the Prim. Ch. p. 550.</note> they [<hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi>] ſhould ordain as much as the Inferiour Clergy, as Deacons, Sub-deacons, Readers, and ſeveral others, which the Church of that time reckon'd among the Clergy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent; and if they do, let them know (ſays he) <hi>That whoſoever is admitted without our Conſent, ſhall be reputed but a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> What would he have ſaid if they had pretended to ordain Presbyters or Biſhops in oppoſition to them? The Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England</hi> deſire no more than St. <hi>Baſil</hi> aſſum'd, That none ſhould be reputed Prieſts or Deacons that were ordain'd in their Dioceſes without their Conſent, and that by ſimple Presbyters, who were never <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> or had any Character to diſtinguiſh them from other Presbyters. Therefore the Caſe ought not to be reckon'd ſo hard, as it is Commonly repreſented by the more moderate Nonconformiſts, who pretend this point of Re-ordination the only Bar that keeps them out of the Church, ſince there was never any other Church, not any in Ancient times would have received them upon any other terms: And they muſt have remain'd <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> under <hi>Baſil, Athanaſius</hi> and all the Ancient Biſhops, whoſe names are, and always have been had in Veneration with all Chriſtians; not one of theſe would have ever been perſwaded to own a Paſtor that his Presbyters had ordain'd in oppoſition to him, nay hardly could they have been prevail'd with to admit ſuch as any other Biſhop ſhould ordain within their Dioceſs; So extream punctilious they were in this matter; and there is hardly any one thing that caus'd ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and dangerous contentions between them as the point of Ordination.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> May Orders given in a Schiſm be made afterwards valid?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Tho, as was ſaid above, all Ordinations in Schiſm are<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi>'s Right of the Ch. p. 148.</note> meer Nullities, and tho made by perſons rightly Ordain'd, yet we find ſuch Ordinations made valid, by the meer decree of the Church, without Ordaining a new, as the <hi>Meletians</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the Church Hiſtories; and as Pope <hi>Melchiades,</hi> much commended for it by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> offer'd, to receive all the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in their own ranks, beſides divers others that might be produc'd.</p>
            <p>The only reaſon why ſome things, tho they be ill done, yet<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> are to ſtand good, is, becauſe the power that doth them extends to them, but is ill us'd. So when the power is Uſurp'd, as in all Schiſm, or when that is done, which the Law makes void, it can be to no effect. Therefore when the Act of Schiſm is made valid, it is manifeſt, that the Order of Biſhop and Presbyter, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd in point of <hi>Right,</hi> by the meer conſent of the Church, which by the precedent Ordination was Conferr'd only in point of <hi>Fact,</hi> being a meer Nullity in point of <hi>Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>—It hath been often practis'd by the Church, to receive,<note place="margin">Id. of Forb. p. 69.</note> not only <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> but even <hi>Hereticks</hi> alſo, (that is, Such as had receiv'd orders of thoſe, that parted from the Church, upon an Error of Faith) in their reſpective Orders. But always upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Renouncing</hi> the Cauſe of their Diviſion; whereupon they were to receive the <hi>Bleſſing of the Church, by prayer with Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands.</hi> The reaſon was becauſe neither is Baptiſm in Schiſm effectual to <hi>Salvation,</hi> nor Ordination in Schiſm effectual to <hi>Grace,</hi> by Miniſtry of any Office in Schiſm. But being <hi>Renounc'd,</hi> there remains no cauſe, why their Miniſtry ſhould not be effectual to their People; Their Baptiſm and their Miniſtry to their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſuppoſing it ſincerely renounc'd. Therefore the reaſon why they who are Ordain'd by Presbyters cannot be receiv'd in their reſpective Orders, is peremptory; Becauſe the Schiſm, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in ordaining againſt Authority, cannot be <hi>renounc'd,</hi> unleſs the Ordination be voided. For ſo long as the Miniſtry may be<note place="margin">Rev. of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Hs.

            <p>I can ſee no reaſon why the line of <hi>Ordination</hi> may not paſs thro a <hi>Schiſmatical Church;</hi> for altho by Schiſm people are out of the Church, and while they Continue ſo, cannot enjoy the benefit either of <hi>Ordination</hi> or <hi>Sacraments;</hi> yet to ſay, that both are abſolutely deſtroy'd, and Nullifi'd; ſo that a Schiſmatick loſes the Chracters, and can neither be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> nor a <hi>Biſhop</hi>

            <p>Chriſt has made Schiſm a Damning ſin to give Authority to the Church.</p>
            <p>Separation from the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a Schiſm, and Schiſm is as damning a Sin, as Idolatry, Drunkenneſs or Adultery.</p>
            <p>The Church which is the Schiſmatick, according to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Primitive times, is out of the Catholick Church <hi>Extra Eccleſiam foris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Miniſterial Gifts are for the Edification of Chriſts Body, which ſuppoſes, that their Efficacy, and Influence is confin'd to the Communion of the <hi>Church,</hi> and does not reach the <hi>Conventicles</hi> of Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p>The Increaſe and Edification of Chriſtians is in the Unity of<note place="margin">Id. Ibid.</note> the Church, and Conſiſts in the increaſe of Brotherly Love and Chriſtian Charity, Virtues which cannot be learn'd in a Schiſm. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Schiſmaticks have not the kind Influences of the H. Spirit, whereby the Church is govern'd.
