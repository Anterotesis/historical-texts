            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ACCOUNT of the EXAMINATION OF Capt. Holland, <hi>Before a Committee of Lords,</hi> Upon the Murther of the EARL of <hi>ESSEX.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>AS amongſt the many Deeds of Darkneſs, which Providence in its Good Time will bring to Light, None can be Blacker or more Hideous, than the Murder of this Noble and Innocent Lord; So nothing can be of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Satisfaction, (though of no leſs Horror too,) than the Detection of that Bloody Aſſaſſination; in which, upon the Apprehenſion of Captain</hi> Holland, <hi>the Zealous and Honorable Inquiſitors, into that crying Blood, are now drawing to a Diſcovery. An Account of whoſe Examination, take as follows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Three in the Afternoon, on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> he was carried in a Coach, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and Guarded by ſeveral of Major <hi>Richardſon</hi>'s Men, (himſelf, and Mr. <hi>Clerk,</hi> one of the Keepers of <hi>New-Gate,</hi> going in the Coach with him) to <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>-Houſe in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where the Committee of Lords then Sate. It was obſerved, that he was ſo ſtrangely Melancholy and Dejected, (and indeed has been ſo all along in his Confinement) that he changed not one Word with his Keepers, in the whole way going or coming. Before his Admiſſion to the Lords, he was carried to the <hi>Fountain-Tavern</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where he drank part of a Pint of Sack; from thence, when call'd for, he was conducted to <hi>Bedford-Houſe,</hi> and Twice called in and Examined; where appeared againſt him, Mr. <hi>Bradon, John Salisbury</hi> a Soldier, a Maid-Servant of <hi>Holms,</hi> another Perſon now in <hi>New-Gate,</hi> likewiſe, on the Account of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Murder. At his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before the Lords, he complained he was indiſpoſed; and being ask'd by the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> if he would have a Cordial, he replied, he was only a Cold, and was therefore order'd to have his Cloak put on, and had a Bottle of Sack call'd for him. His whole Ayre and Behaviour, is infinitely changed from that Gayety and Jollity he appeared with, under his former Condemnation in <hi>Newgate,</hi> for the Robery of Dr. <hi>Gattaker,</hi> where at the very Minute of receiving his Sentence, he was obſerved to deport himſelf with that little Face of Concern, as if Death had been the leaſt part of his Apprehenſion. And though his Unfortunate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade <hi>Davis,</hi> was hang'd for the ſame Fact; ſuch a ſhowr of Mercy, and Court Bounty powr'd down upon the Favourite <hi>Holland;</hi> that beſides his Pardon, ſcarce any Priſoner in many Ages before, at leaſt that had ſo little Pretentions to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or Eſtate, to ſupport ſuch Extravagant Expences, was ever known to ſpend ſo high as he: Such a conſtant Affluence of <hi>Guineas</hi> daily flowing in from the Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and openly acknowledged to come from that Honourable Hard, (for what Publick or Private Merit, Time will ſhow) That he half fed the Jayl; and all Caps and Knees were ſo much at his Devotion, that nothing ſo honoured either at the Grate, or the Cellar Bat, as the Noble Captain <hi>Holland;</hi> and all this from the extraordinary Largeſſes of a Generous Jayl-Bird-Patron, the then Secretary of State.</p>
