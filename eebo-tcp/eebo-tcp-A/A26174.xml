            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>HERBERT</hi>'s ACCOUNT EXAMIN'D.</head>
            <p>WEre it not the Reproach of our Times, to have had Men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for other Merits, beſides Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Learning in the Laws of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; it might ſeem a great piece of Vanity in me, to anſwer a Book ſtamp'd with the Name, and Authority of a <hi>Chief Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, perhaps, I might be thought not without cauſe to take this as my more immediate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; having been the firſt of the Profeſſion, who ventur'd in Publick Companies to ſhew, how wofully that innocent Book-Caſe 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. in relation to Sheriffs, has been miſtook, or wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſerve for Colour to that haſty Judgment in Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> his feigned Caſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, how needful ſoever the <hi>Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59332:3"/>
may find it, to make Proteſtations of his <hi>Sincerity</hi>;<note place="margin">Vid. Account, p. 1.</note> this may ſuperſede any ſuch from me. Nor would I willingly call his a Proteſtation contrary to apparent Fact (eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that weakneſs of Judgment manifeſted by this Defence) did he not give too great occaſion for it: 1. From the large Steps which he took, to precipitate, and, as I am well aſſured, to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit that Reſolution. 2. The manner in which he delivered it, widely differing from what he now prints. 3. The unfairneſs of his preſent Quotations: And, 4. The unhappineſs, not to ſay worſe, of thoſe Inſtances which he is pleaſed to give of his Sincerity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not diſpute, or repeat his Lordſhips State of the Caſe: But the Queſtion upon it being, Whether the King may by his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſpenſe with the <hi>Statute</hi> 25 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring all Perſons in any Office under the King to take the <hi>Teſt</hi> againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> I ſhall enquire,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether thoſe Books, which he relies on as Authorities for his Judgment, give any colour to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether, admit they did, they would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Reſolution as he delivered it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether thoſe Inſtances which he offers of his Sincerity, may reaſonably be taken for ſuch.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether he in any meaſure clears himſelf
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59332:3"/>
from the Imputation of being highly criminal.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip, like a Maſter-Diſputant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, as he thinks,<note place="margin">Account, p. 6.</note> with a <hi>Definition</hi> of a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, he ſays, is given by the Lord <hi>Cook:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cook 11 Rep. f. 88.</note> 
               <hi>Diſpenſatio mali prohibiti eſt de jure Domino Regi conceſſa, propter impoſſibilitatem praevidendi de omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus particularibus; &amp; diſpenſatio eſt mali prohibiti provida relaxatio, utilitate, ſeu neceſſitate penſatâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where, I muſt ſay, he very unlearnedly clogs the Definition of a Diſpenſing Power, with the Perſon in whom 'tis ſuppos'd to be lodg'd; nay, and the Reaſon too why it ſhould be ſo, which neither the Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> nor Common Senſe, gives him any Warrant to bring into the Definition. However, it ſeems, according to this, a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Power, in ſome Caſe or other, is veſted in the King; which yet is far from proving any thing to his purpoſe; for either the King may in all Caſes diſpenſe as to particular Perſons, and then his Diſtinction of <hi>malum prohibitum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. p. 7. &amp; 8.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; malum in ſe,</hi> falls to the ground; or elſe it reaches only to thoſe Caſes, in which the Judgment, or Flattery of Judges have aſcrib'd it to him.</p>
            <p>He adds out of the Lord <hi>Cook,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 6. 11 Rep. f. 88.</note> as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement upon what he calls the <hi>Definition:</hi> 
               <q>Inaſmuch as an Act of Parliament, which generally prohibits any thing upon a Penalty that is POPU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAR, OR ONLY GIVEN TO THE
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59332:4"/>
KING, may be inconvenient to divers particular Perſons, in reſpect of Perſon, Time, or Place; for this purpoſe the Law gives a Power to the King to diſpenſe with particular Perſons.</q> Where the <hi>Lord Cook</hi> manifeſtly reſtrains the Penalty, to ſuch as is given the King as Head of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, upon which account only he calls it <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>; nor, indeed, can be thought to take in what is granted to any Subject that will inform, it being mention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

prohibitum</hi>; for before the Statute, Coining Money was lawful, but now it is not ſo, and therefore the King can diſpenſe with it. So if a Man ſhip Wooll in any place but <hi>Calice,</hi> it is <hi>malum prohibitum,</hi> becauſe it is prohibited by Act of Parliament: But that which is <hi>malum in ſe,</hi> the King, nor no other Perſon can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with; as if the King would give a Man power to kill another, or licenſe one to make a Nuſance in a High-way, this were void; and yet the King can pardon theſe things when they are done.</q> Upon this Caſe 'tis obſervable, That the Power of Diſpenſing is here aſſerted in relation to Things, and not Perſons: Wherefore according to this, taken in Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi>'s Latitude, the King may grant Diſpenſations to all in general, where the Matter is only <hi>malum prohibitum</hi>; whereas he himſelf owns <hi>that the nature of a Diſpenſation is particular, and given to particular Perſons by name.</hi>

This came to the Crown by the Diſſolution of Monaſteries, 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. but yet that it was not merg'd thereby, but remain'd as an Inheritance in groſs, without the help of any Statute, was the Opinion of the <hi>Great Hales</hi> then Chief Baron, and of two other Barons, <hi>Windham,</hi> and <hi>Turner.</hi> Part of <hi>Hales</hi> his Words, as I find them excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well reported, and full to this Point, are:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Such Hundreds as were anciently ſevered from the Counties, and come again to the Crown by Eſcheat or Forfeiture, were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but rarely committed to the Sheriff, and rejoyn'd to the County, but for the moſt part kept a diſtinct: <hi>Ret.

            <p>But the ſecond Point rais'd before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,<note place="margin">Second Point 2 H. 7.</note> which occaſioned the main Debate in that Caſe, as appears by the Book, ſhews, That the Reſolution could not be upon the Point of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; for they queſtion'd whether the King could diſpenſe with his own Profit; and all the Judges except <hi>Brian,</hi> and <hi>Catesby,</hi> held, that the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59332:13"/>
Patentee ſhall account for the Green Wax, and other things, notwithſtanding the Clauſe of <hi>abſque reddendo computum</hi>: But the Debate concerning other things ariſing upon that ſecond Point, was adjourn'd; the firſt reſolv'd upon the Grounds above.</p>
            <p>Tho hitherto there is no proof, that any one of Authority in the Law has taken the Book 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. in Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi>'s ſenſe, which yet would be of no moment if they were expreſs, being the Book is to be ſeen, and clearly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; yet he thinks my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> will bear him out, and to this purpoſe he cites two Places; one, where he ſuppoſes that the <hi>Lord Coke</hi> not onely authorizes this ſenſe of the Caſe, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts the Prerogative in <hi>much higher Terms than they would preſume to do</hi>;<note place="margin">Account, p. 13.</note> and by the ſecond he would have it believ'd, that if the <hi>Lord Coke</hi> be a <hi>faithful Reporter,</hi> all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> took that Caſe in the ſame ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the Caſe of Cuſtoms, 24 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which is pregnant with many Objections againſt its being of any force in this Caſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">12 Rep. f. 17.</note>1. The Book is of ſuſpected Authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing printed in the late Times, and what the <hi>Lord Coke</hi> never own'd, or thought fit to print in his Life-time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This comes foiſted in among Caſes in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59332:13"/>
the time of King <hi>James,</hi> without any parallel Caſe which might occaſion the placing of it there.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was when the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> was but a young Reporter,<note place="margin">Was made Sollicitor 16 June, 34 Eliz. Dugd. Cron. Series, f. 99.</note> it being ten Years before he was King's Sollicitor.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is not onely no Point in queſtion rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Caſe where 'tis cited, and ſo extraju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial, but wholly foreign to it: For the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was, Whether Goods ſold before they were landed, were to pay Cuſtom within the Statute 1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 11. Wherefore being barely a <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum</hi> of a young Reporter, no way occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by what went before, it cannot poſſibly have any weight.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fancy'd Reaſon there given why the King may diſpenſe with the Statute of Sheriffs, is none at all; for whereas it ſays,<note place="margin">12 Rep. f. 18.</note> that the King <hi>has a Sovereign Power to command any af his Subjects to ſerve him for the Publick Weal, and this ſolely and inſeparably annex'd to his Perſon; and this Royal Power cannot be reſtrained by any Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; there is no Authority cited for this, but the Caſe 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. which, as appears to any body that reads it, neither has that Reaſon mention'd ſo much as by any one Judge, nor in the leaſt goes upon the Point of the Prerogative. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if the King can command any Subject to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59332:14"/>
ſerve him for the Publick Weal, either he is to be Judge, or the Laws. If the latter, then no Perſon not qualified by Law is oblig'd to act; nor tho' qualified, to do any thing forbid by the Laws. If the former, as the Words imply, then the King's Commands may be pleaded to juſtifie any ill Miniſter who has rendred himſelf obnoxious to the Laws. But that this cannot be, is ſufficiently evinc'd by neceſſary Examples in all Ages. And this, by the way, may ſhew how falſe, as well as pernicious, that Doctrine is, which tells us,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Caſe of Reſiſt. p. 113.</note>

            </p>

            <p>Upon which it is evident, that if any one of the Judges mentioned this, the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> is <hi>a faithful Reporter</hi>; but had he been ſilent as to this matter, no man could ſuppoſe, that ſuch a

            <p>But <hi>Sir Edward Herbert</hi>'s own Eyes might, and ought to have ſatisfied him, that the Judges 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. gave no Determination upon the 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. nor does the Book ſay, that ſo much as any one Perſon ſpoke to that Statute, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd the Reaſon devis'd in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe; <hi>for that the Act could not bar the King of the Service of his Subject, which the Law of Nature did give unto him.</hi> Nor could <hi>Sir Edward</hi> chuſe but know the abſurdity of that Ground; for according to that, all ought to be left in the State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it was before any Law made; ſo that not onely any Perſon might act, tho prohibited by ſubſequent Laws, but he might act any thing forbid by any poſitive Law;<note place="margin">Vid.

            </p>
            <p>Wherefore the Savings in both the Records can be but general Savings, of ſuch Prerogative as the Kings had, whatever it were: Which the Kings, as they began to encroach upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or to be Jealous of their Encroachments, would have inſerted out of abundant Caution, before they would yield to ſeveral Acts. And theſe being Acts of Parliament, which could paſs but as the King conſented, the People were forc'd often to gild the Pills with ſuch Savings; but 'twas otherwiſe of Judgments in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59332:21"/>
to which no Conſent of the King was requiſite.</p>
            <p>Farther yet, Admit the King had a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of diſpenſing with particular Perſons, both as to Aliens, and Proviſions; yet there could no general Rule be taken from thence, becauſe it would onely argue, that the fondneſs for Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, and fear of diſpleaſing the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> had at firſt occaſioned the reſerving the Power of eaſing ſome particular Perſons, without which the Kings would paſs no Act againſt them. However it was, the frequent Complaints of the Commons,<note place="margin">Vid. Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſt.</hi> againſt <hi>Creſſy,</hi> from p. 426. to p. 461.</note> and Acts made againſt both the one and the other, ſhew, that thoſe Laws were little regarded or executed, and yet that the King had not a Prerogative allow'd him, any more for particular Perſons, than for all in general.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward</hi> has five other trivial Inſtances of the Diſpenſing Power, which however I ſhall not omit. One is the Diſpenſing with the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 8 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. which requires,<note place="margin">Account, p. 19.</note> that no Man ſhould go <hi>Judge of Aſſize into his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>: But for this there is onely Practice, which has paſs'd <hi>ſub ſilentio,</hi> and ſo could be of no Authority in Law: Beſides, the Statute is barely Prohibitory, and does not render the Patents void if otherwiſe; yet I cannot ſay but an Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would lie, tho' there were a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59332:21"/>The ſecond is of diſpenſing with the Statute 10 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. which provides,<note place="margin">Account, p. 19.</note> That <hi>whoever has a Pardon of Felony, ſhall find Sureties of the Good Behaviour</hi>: Of which he ſays, as of the other, That it has been <hi>conſtantly diſpens'd with ever ſince it was made.</hi> But if the Practice had been ſo, which he does not prove, it would not avail, unleſs it had come in queſtion judicially, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pardon would be valid to one who had not given, or at leaſt tendred <hi>Sureties.</hi> Indeed there is a Caſe in our Books, where the Court did not require Sureties, becauſe of a particular Clauſe in the Pardon diſpenſing with it:<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Matthew Mints</hi> Caſe, Crook, Car. f. 597.</note> but this was no earlier than 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. the Judges of which time paid ſufficient deference to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; but that Caſe ſeems to be not onely <hi>primae impreſſionis,</hi> and without any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given, but in effect condemn'd by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, as he ſhews that the Court abus'd their Diſcretion, if they had any in the Matter: Twas the Caſe of Sir <hi>Matthew Mints,</hi> who appear'd to be guilty of ſeveral Miſdemeanors, for which he deſerv'd to be bound to the Good Behaviour, <hi>committed after the time to which he was pardon'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third and fourth Inſtances,<note place="margin">Account, p. 31.</note> ſcatter'd from the reſt, are of diſpenſing with <hi>Pluralities,</hi> and <hi>Baſtards entring into Prieſts Orders;</hi> which,<note place="margin">p. 32.</note> if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, will be leſs ſerviceable to him: For,</p>

of the ſaid Manufactures for their Support, and livelihood, to grant to one or more the Importation of ſuch Manufacture, without any Limitation, <hi>non obſtante</hi> the ſaid Act, is a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> and <hi>void.</hi>

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59332:24"/>Now beſides what already has been ſhewn, to diſable theſe three laſt Inſtances urg'd by <hi>Sir Edward</hi>; That they are not <hi>pro bono ſingulorum populi,</hi> as that Rule is vindicated from Miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, may appear, in that neither of them affect all the People in general: As to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men, they can only do injury in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Pariſhes where they are Benefic'd, and the <hi>Welſhman</hi> in that part of <hi>Wales</hi> where he is an Officer; nor beſides, can the Clergy-men be ſuppos'd much to prejudice <hi>the Intereſt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> being the Pluralliſt cannot ſupply his Cure but by one qualified, and the Baſtard might be a good Man, and good Preacher.<note place="margin">L. Vaughan, f. 344, 345, 346, 347.</note> And yet even theſe would fall within <hi>Lord Vaughan</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of his own Rule; for he ſhews, That Laws made for the benefit of but part of the Kingdom, <hi>Artificers,</hi> and <hi>Husbandmen,</hi> cannot be diſpens'd with to any one Perſon, to fruſtrate the Ends of the Statutes.</p>
            <p>This leads to another Flouriſh which he makes with the <hi>Lord Vaughan</hi>'s Authority, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Objection, That the Law was made <hi>pro bono publico,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Account, p. 22.</note> and <hi>was highly neceſſary for the Publick.</hi> Indeed <hi>Lord Vaughan</hi> will have it, that the ſole Reaſon why a Statute cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpens'd with, is not, that the Law was made <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> becauſe all Laws were made for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59332:25"/>
Publick good; and yet Diſpenſations had been allow'd in ſome, nor was the Degree of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good that which alter'd the Caſe; yet he ſhews, that the Extent of it does: and ſeems ſtill to keep to <hi>Lord Cook</hi>'s Rule, Where the People had entruſted the King with the Law, as Head of the <hi>complicated</hi> Body, there the Truſt was entirely in him; but when the Law extended in Intereſt not onely to individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but to a conſiderable part of the Nation, much more when to all, in either of which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Statute is <hi>pro bono</hi> ſingulorum <hi>populi,</hi> in neither of theſe can the King diſpenſe. And that the Statute in queſtion is of the largeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, appears, as the Nation is a Proteſtant Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this the Religion eſtabliſh'd by Law, and theſe Proviſions neceſſary Means to preſerve it; and therefore tho' the Papiſts have no benefit by it, they are not in Law, in this reſpect, any part of the People; for People always is taken for them that have Legal Intereſts. Thus when the Statute provides,<note place="margin">2 Inſt. f. 559.</note> That the People of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall chuſe their Sheriffs, it relates not to all the People in general, but onely to Freeholders.</p>

               </note>Having thus ſhewn, That thoſe Grounds which our Judge pretends to have gone upon, afford no Countenance even to his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of the Judgment, they will appear
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59332:25"/>
much leſs to countenance it as it was deliver'd; which to evince, I ſhall here ſet it down <hi>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſimis verbis,</hi> from that faithful Reporter Mr. <hi>Blaney.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was on that memorable Day when, as another mark of his Sincerity, he directed the willing Jury, and concurr'd in the infamous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt that excellent Author Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>; when the Jury was gone out, the Chief Juſtice took occaſion to inveigh againſt ſpreading of Scandalous Reports about Caſes depending in the Court; and to prevent any thing of that Nature in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> he thought fit to deliver the Opinion of the Judges in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C. J.</hi> 
               <q>In the Caſe of <hi>Godwin</hi> and <hi>Hales,</hi> wherein the Defendant pleads a Diſpenſation from the King, it is doubted, whether or no the King had ſuch a Prerogative? Truly, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Argument before us, it appear'd <hi>as clear a Caſe as ever came before this Court</hi>: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Men fancy I know not what difficulty, when really there is none, we were willing to give ſo much Countenance to the Queſtion in the Caſe, as to take the Advice of all the Judges of <hi>England</hi>: They were all aſſembled at <hi>Serjeants-Inn,</hi> and this Caſe was put them, and <hi>the Great Caſe of the Sheriffs</hi> was put, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59332:26"/>
the Diſpenſation in that Caſe were Legal, becauſe upon that depended the Execution of all the Law of the Nation? And, I muſt tell you, that there were then Ten upon the place, that clearly delivered their Opinions, That the Caſe of the Sheriffs was good Law, and that all the Attainders grounded upon Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments found by Juries return'd by ſuch Sheriffs, were good, and not erroneous; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that Men need not have any Fears or Scruples about that Matter. And, in the next place, they did clearly declare, That there was no imaginable difference between that Caſe, and this, unleſs it were, that this were <hi>the much clearer Caſe of the</hi> two, <hi>and liable to the fewer Exceptions.</hi> My Brother <hi>Powel</hi> ſaid, he was inclin'd to be of the ſame Opinion, but he would rather have ſome more time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it; but he has ſince ſent by my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Holloway,</hi> to let us know, that he does concur with us. To theſe Eleven Judges, there is One Diſſenter, Brother <hi>Street,</hi> who yet continues his Opinion, That the King cannot diſpenſe in this Caſe: But that's the Opinion of One ſingle Judge, againſt the Opinion of Eleven: We were ſatisfied in our own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before, and having the Concurrence of Eleven out of Twelve, we think we may very
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59332:26"/>
well declare the Opinion of the Court to be, That the King may diſpenſe in this Caſe; and the Judges go upon theſe Grounds.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are Sovereign Princes.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>That the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are the King's Laws.<note place="margin">So <hi>Sibthorp,</hi> Ruſhworth vol. 1. p. 422.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <q>That therefore, 'tis an Incident inſeparable Prerogative in the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with Penal Laws in particular Caſes, and upon particular neceſſary Reaſons.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <q>That of thoſe Reaſons, and thoſe Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the King himſelf is ſole Judge: And then, which is conſequent, upon all,</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <q>That this is not a Truſt inveſted in, or granted to the King by the People; but the ancient Remains of the Sovereign Power, and Prerogative of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> which never yet was taken from them, nor can be. And therefore ſuch a Diſpenſation being pleaded by the Defendant in this Caſe, and ſuch a Diſpenſation appearing upon Record to come time enough, to ſave him from the Forfeiture, Judgment ought to be given for the Defendant, <hi>quod querens nil capiat per billam.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis evident, that theſe Propoſitions are very wide from any thing he has, or could have

               <q>deriv'd from the People.</q> But for that we have no occaſion, from any ſo much as pretended Proof of his Aſſertions; nor can any be offer'd but from the Reſolution of the infamous Ship-money-Judges, which ſeems to run parallel to this, but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed far ſhort of it: For tho' they made the King the <hi>ſole Judge</hi> of the Kingdom's <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> yet they ſuppos'd it to be at a time when there

was a real Danger to be prevented by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this Judgment; whereas here it is abus'd to the bringing in what the Parliament labour'd to prevent.</p>
            <p>But I muſt obſerve,<note place="margin">Vid. Account, p. 37.</note> 1.
