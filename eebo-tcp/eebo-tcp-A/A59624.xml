            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He only fixes a Character of <hi>Odium</hi> upon his <hi>Protestant Brethren</hi>; To persecute and oppose these, he calls <hi>a Pious and Blessed work,</hi>

                  </note> and is so far from bewailing the Calamity that is likely to be brought upon them, and upon the whole Nation for the Injuries done to them, that he stirs up All to help it forward, and to joyn with him in this odious and for ever to be abhorred Imployment. All which, though we might ascribe to <hi>Gilbert Shelden,</hi> and make it his personal miscarriage, (of whom we can say, and are ready to prove, That <hi>his too little Learning hath made him thus mad</hi>) yet we will fix this Violence rather, upon (according to his own stile) <hi>Gilbert Cant.</hi> or, (to speak out his Title in words at length) <hi>Gilbert Archbishop of Canterbury</hi>; who being (as such and in that capacity) <hi>not a creature of God's making,</hi> nor any part of a <hi>Divine Ordinance,</hi> must answer the Darkness of his Original, since the same evil Spirit which begets <hi>Pride</hi> in any, doth likewise instil and direct unto <hi>Civility,</hi> by which that Pride may be maintained and upheld.</p>
               <p>Concerning this <hi>Prelates Pride,</hi> besides his <hi>Intolerable Title</hi> (which is no small part of that <hi>Name of Blasphemy,</hi> which is more fully and at large written upon his <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Pope's</hi> forehead) what need w<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> any other Argument to prove it by, than the base and contemptible stile he useth to those, whom (What ever we think of them) yet he owneth as <hi>Ministers of Christ?</hi> The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> calls those he writes to, <hi>Elders,</hi> and himself their <hi>fellow-Elder,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.1. But this Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop being in a higher <hi>elevation,</hi> and transcendent in his Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to any Apostle, looks down with scorn upon his Brethren, the Teachers of the Nation, and <hi>Parsons<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Vicars, Curates</hi> is the best lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he can afford them. We wish those poor despised men (many of whom we hope are only mistaken in their way) would a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what unworthy Bondage they are under, and what vile drudgery is exacted from them; instead of being <hi>Gospel-Preachers,</hi> they must now turn <hi>State-Informers,</hi> and set up an Inquisition to rack and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their innocent Neighbours, whom it should be their business to convert and save: It is indeed pritty (but too thin a covering at this

                  <unclear>time</unclear> of day) to command them <hi>to be careful of their Lives,</hi>

                     <unclear>Paulus</unclear>
                  </hi> did it to prevent <hi>
                     <unclear>Luther's</unclear> Reformation</hi>] and now it is meerly in other words, to desire them to put on <hi>Sheeps cloathing</hi> for a time, that they may play the <hi>Wolves</hi> with the better pretence and greater advantage.</p>
               <p>We may indeed be excused if we seem to wonder, that he did not (at least for forms-sake) desire his <hi>Curates</hi> to preach somewhat more frequently; but we think it prudently forborn: for why should those who are so professedly the <hi>Servants of men,</hi> be exhorted so much to contradict themselves, as to preach <hi>Christ the Lord?</hi> or upon what pretence of Reason, could this <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> require, that from others, which he hath so little care or skill to do himself? Passing by this <hi>Over-sight</hi> therefore (wherein he is rightly <hi>Episcopal</hi>) as carrying a good <hi>decorum</hi> with it, give us leave (<hi>Christian Reader</hi>) to observe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we find him in <hi>open terms,</hi> without any <hi>figure,</hi> to call the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice</hi> and <hi>Hood</hi> a <hi>Priestly habit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Par. 3.</note> enjoyning all <hi>to wear them in the time of officiating at Divine Service, that so by their Ordered performance of so Holy a work, they may give honour to God, and by their own example instruct the People of their Parishes, as they ought to teach them in their Doctrine.</hi> We hope he is serious, and if so, and these things he would indeed have thus highly esteemed; we need no more to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us in our continued refusal, and utter abhorrance of them:</p>
               <p>For, to call any kind of Garments <hi>a Priestly Habit;</hi> to command the wearing of them, as conducing to the honour of God in his Worship; and by these to think to instruct the People (which is to make them not only <hi>
                     <unclear>significant</unclear>,</hi> but <hi>teaching Ceremonies</hi>) This is to introduce the old Antiquated <hi>Iewish Rites</hi> and <hi>Habits,</hi> which were to be disused with their Worship: It is to fill the Church of Christ with as many Inventions, under pretence of <hi>Decency,</hi> as vain men are pleased to devise, and wilful men have power to impose; and lastly, it is to render all <hi>Qualifications</hi> requisite unto the <hi>Ministry,</hi> wholly useless: For, the <hi>Reading Clerk</hi> of every Parish, or the <hi>Publick Cryers,</hi> may do all that our <hi>Arch.</hi> requires, as well as the ablest and most Learned Minister.</p>
               <p>It will be necessary, before we conclude, to wipe off that slander wherewith he reproacheth those that joyn with the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> calling them <hi>Seduced People</hi>;<note place="margin">Par. 5.</note> and their Teachers<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>Seditious,</hi> and <hi>
                     <unclear>self-seeking</unclear>.</hi> In just indignation against which base and unworthy <unclear>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</unclear>, we have this to say, That we stand amazed that one, who enjoys <unclear>for</unclear> his own single share, more than would well maintain an hundred <unclear>able</unclear> Preachers with their Families; and yet never did, nor can do
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57547:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any thing in the Church of Christ to deserve the <unclear>hundredth</unclear> part of it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> should venture to charge any with <hi>self-seeking</hi>: But we know that those, <hi>who persecute the poor through the pride of their countenance,</hi> will never seek nor make any inquiry into their own actions, <hi>Ps<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> 10.2, 4.</p>
               <p>And indeed, How can these Preachers be either <hi>Seditious,</hi> or <hi>self-seeking,</hi> who having often declared, that <hi>Men for their Consciences are not to be imposed upon</hi>; and being under the conviction of that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have quietly suffered the loss of all things, rather than they would deny or forgo it: whereas this unrighteous <unclear>man</unclear>, not content with the full enjoyment of his own <hi>Corruption</hi> rather <unclear>than</unclear> 
                  <hi>Conscience,</hi> will not let his <hi>Brethren</hi> alone; but first procures a Law against them, which he knew before-hand they could not obey, and then seeks to destroy them for not obeying; In which lot we have reason to rejoyce, being used no otherwise than <hi>Daniel</hi> was by those, that for his <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi> envied him: whose Faith, and the gracious dealing of the Lord with him, as it is on record for our <unclear>encouragement</unclear>; so the unprosperous end of those malitious and crafty Contrivers, we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wish might seriously be reflected upon by this their grand Imitator.</p>
               <p>As for the Peoples being <hi>seduced,</hi> it is a Cavil not worth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering: for we appeal to the reason of all unprejudic'd men, whether those, who are commanded to follow the <hi>Laws of the King, and of the Church,</hi> with an <hi>Implicit faith</hi> and <hi>blind obedience</hi> (as this <hi>blind Guide</hi> would have them) are not in much more certain danger of being <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,</hi> than those who are daily exhorted by their Teachers, to <hi>search the Scripture,</hi> and by that unerring Rule to order <unclear>their</unclear> whole Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: Which all that ever heard the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> preach, know to be the sum of their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Par. 5.</note>And now, having thus briefly made our defence, We must (as this <hi>Bishop</hi> saith he doth) <hi>commit the success to God Almighty,</hi> Believing (which we fear he doth not) that our <hi>Lord Christ</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> hath committed to him from the <hi>Father</hi> the Government of the World, as well as of his Church in it, for whose <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>
                     <unclear>Supremacy</unclear>
                  </hi> (according as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> hath stated it <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9, 10.) we are now contending.</p>
               <p>Therefore whilst our Adversaries are directed <unclear>to</unclear> seek unto Men for help against us, and rely upon an <hi>Arm of Flesh</hi>; our confidence is in <hi>the Name of the Lord,</hi> who will in due time <hi>bring forth our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to light</hi>; and then perhaps this very Man, <unclear>who</unclear> now so proudly exalts himself, <hi>shall see it, and be ashamed</hi> at all his envy.
