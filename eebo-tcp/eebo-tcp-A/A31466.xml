            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To Dr.—An Anſwer to his Queries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the COLLEDG of MIDWIVES.</head>
            <p>TO anſwer your Query, Doctor, <hi>Whether ever there were
a Colledg of Midwives in any part of the World?</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my Promiſe made the 12<hi>th</hi> Inſtant, I will now
prove, there was ſome Hundreds, if not Thouſands
of Years before you can prove one of Phyſicians: As appears
both by Sacred and Prophane Hiſtories. I will begin with the
firſt; and deſire you to read the firſt Chapter of <hi>Exodus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. And the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſpake to the Hebrew Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives,
of which the Name of the one was <hi>Shiprah,</hi> and the other
<hi>Puah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. And he ſaid unto them, When ye do the Office of a
Midwife to the Hebrew Women, and ſee them upon the Stooles; if
it be a Son, you ſhall kill him: but if it be a Daughter, then ſhe
ſhall live.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. But the Midwives feared God, and did not as the
King of <hi>Egypt</hi> commanded them, but ſaved the Men Children
alive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. Wherefore God dealt well with the Midwives: and
the People multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. And it came to paſs, becauſe the Midwives feared
God, that he made them Houſes.</p>
            <p>I believe no Rational Perſon will think that theſe two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
could in their own Perſons act as Midwives to all the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of that <hi>mighty People,</hi> who about 100 Years after went up
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46928:2"/>
out of <hi>Egypt</hi> 600000 Fighting Men, beſides Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and a great mixt Multitude, but rather that they were
the Governeſſes and Teachers of other Midwives, which could
not be a few; and as I am informed by a Learned <hi>Rabbi,</hi> now
in Town, their Names ſignify the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> That God built them Houſes, and
bleſſed them.</p>
            <p>Now if it were, as ſome think, that theſe were not <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
but <hi>Egyptians,</hi> appointed Governeſſes over ſuch as ſhould aſſiſt
the Hebrew Women, who by Converſation among them <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the knowledg of the only true God, and fearing him, did not
impoſe thoſe bloody Orders of deſtroying the Males.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then it was plain that the Government of that Art was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
under Superiours, as the <hi>Magi</hi> and Prieſthood of that Nation
was, and muſt have ſome certain place for conſulting in, from
whence they might iſſue their Directions. Which, by your
leave, Doctor, without Abſurdity in the Language of theſe
Times, might well be called <hi>a Colledg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for the Piety of the Ruling Midwives God built them Houſes:</hi>
that is, they were Incorporated into the Body of the Jews, and
reckoned <hi>Honourable Families among them:</hi> As <hi>Rahab</hi> and others
for their ſingular Service to that Nation afterwards were.
<hi>Which Families of the Faithful Midwives,</hi> ſome Hebrews ſay,
<hi>continue in Honour among them at</hi> Theſſalonica <hi>to this Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſuch a favour from God of <hi>building Houſes for them,</hi>
we do not read the Phyſicians ever received; nor was Phyſick
then a regular Study, nor brought under Government in that
Learned Nation of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Herodotus</hi> his time, which put
together, proves the Antiquity of the Midwives Government
ſo much antienter than that of the Doctors.</p>
            <p>For your further Satisfaction be pleaſed to read <hi>Origen</hi> his
11<hi>th</hi> Homily upon <hi>Exodus,</hi> which will inform you, that
<hi>Shiprah</hi> and <hi>Puah</hi> were not only the <hi>Governeſses of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives,</hi>
but alſo Women of Great Learning, and excellently
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46928:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
skill'd in Phyſick, which was then practiſed by Women to
Women.</p>
            <p>And you cannot deny at our laſt Conference, but that <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
ſwears by <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Eſcalapius,</hi> and by <hi>Hygea</hi> and <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi>
the <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddeſſes</hi> of <hi>Phyſick:</hi> And pray, Doctor, who
were the Gods and Goddeſſes of Antiquity, but Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who firſt found out and taught Arts and Myſteries ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to Mankind, as made them think they could not but be
guided by a Divine Spirit to the knowledg of things ſo uſeful
and ſo far above the Vulgar Capacities This? <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is ſo
ingenuous as to confeſs, and doth not part the <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes,</hi>
but had them in equal Veneration, as appears by his
Oath, to which I refer you, becauſe I perceive you have forgot
it; For he ſwears <hi>he will not cut thoſe that have the Stone, but
will leave it to the skilful in that Practice.</hi> But you, tho you
underſtand nothing of it, pretend to teach us an Art much
more difficult <hi>(And which ought to be kept as a Secret amongſt
Women as much as is poſſible.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true among the <hi>ſubtile Athenians,</hi> ſome Phyſicians being
gotten into the Government, and Miſcarriages happening to
ſome Noble Women about that time, they obtain'd a Law,
that for the future no Woman ſhould ſtudy or practiſe any part
of Phyſick on pain of Death. This Law continued ſome time,
during which many Women periſhed both in Child bearing,
and by private Diſeaſes; their Modeſty not permitting them
to admit of Men either to Deliver or Cure them.</p>
            <p>Till God ſtirred up the Spirit of <hi>Agnodicea,</hi> a Noble Maid,
to pity the miſerable condition of her own Sex, and hazard her
Life to help them, which to enable her ſelf to do, ſhe cut off her
Hair, Apparelled her ſelf like a Man, and became the Scholar
of <hi>Hyrophilus</hi> the moſt Famous Phyſician of that Time,
and having learn'd the Art, ſhe found out a Woman that had
long languiſh'd under private Diſeaſes, and made proffer of her
Service to cure her, which the ſick Perſon refuſed, thinking her
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46928:3"/>
to be a Man; but when <hi>Agnodicea</hi> had diſcovered that ſhe was
a Maid, the Woman committed her ſelf into her Hands, who
cured her perfectly: And after her many others with the like
Skill and Induſtry. So that in a ſhort time ſhe became the
Succeſsful and Beloved Phyſician of the whole Sex, none but
ſhe being called to aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p>This ſo incenſed the Phyſicians that they conſpired her
Ruin, ſaying ſhe ſhaved off her Beard to abuſe the Women, who
feigned themſelves Sick to enjoy her Company; <hi>and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Witneſſes to be found then</hi> (as of late Years, that would
ſwear any thing for Money) ſhe was upon their Teſtimony,
condemned to Death for <hi>committing Adultery</hi> with <hi>Agiſilea</hi> one
of the <hi>Areopagites</hi> Wives; it being eaſy to make Old Men,
who had beautiful Wives, believe any thing of ſo young and
handſome a Doctor.</p>
            <p>This forced <hi>Agnodicea</hi> to diſcover her Sex to ſave her Life;
and then the enraged Phyſicians accuſed her of tranſgreſſing
the Law, which forbid Women to Study or Practiſe Phyſick.
And for this Crime ſhe was like to be condemned to Death;
which coming to the Ears of the Noble Women, they ran be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> which were the Chief Magiſtrates, and
the Houſe being encompaſſed by moſt Women of the City,
the Ladies entred before the Judges, and told them they would
no longer account them for Husbands or Friends, but for cruel
Enemies, that condemned her to Death, who reſtored them
to their Healths; proteſting they would all die with her if ſhe
were put to Death.</p>
            <p>This cauſed the Magiſtrates to diſanul that Law, and make
another, which gave Gentlewomen leave to Study and Practiſe
all parts of Phyſick <hi>to their own Sex, giving</hi> large Stipends <hi>to
thoſe that did it well and carefully, and impoſing ſevere Penalties
upon the unskilful and negligent:</hi> And there were many Noble
Women who ſtudied that Practiſe, and taught it publickly in
their Schools as long as <hi>Athens</hi> flouriſhed in Learning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:46928:3"/>
But <hi>Phanarota</hi> the Mother of wiſe <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of great <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Skill, deſerves a particular remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
both for her own, and her Son's ſake;</hi> who, as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by many, was a Martyr, being put to Death for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
there was but <hi>one God,</hi> which Wiſdom himſelf ſaith he
learned of his Mother. Thus, Doctor, it appears, even that
Learned Idolatrous City had in it a <hi>Midwife that knew and
feared the true God:</hi> Tho, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there was an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
therein dedicated to the unknown God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Ambroſe Perre,</hi> Counſellour and Chyrurgion to the
King of <hi>France,</hi> and his Ingenuous Diſciple <hi>Gulielmus,</hi> prove
fully: and that is as far as my ſmall Learning and weak Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
goes. But you, Doctor, may prove it more at large when
you pleaſe, by the <hi>Hebrew, Greek, Latin</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Books,
which treat on theſe Subjects; in which times the three parts
of Phyſick, <hi>Midwifery, Chirurgery,</hi> and <hi>the making up and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring
of Medicines,</hi> were all one, tho the laſt, which was then
the ſervile part, hath now uſurp'd upon the other two; but we
pretend only to the Firſt, as being the <hi>moſt Antient, Honourable
and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Part:</hi> Wherein we deſire you not to concern your
ſelves, until we deſire your Company, which we will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do as often as we have occaſion for your Advice in any thing
<hi>we do not underſtand, or which doth not appertain to our
Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come into our own Country, it is not hard to prove
by antient Britiſh Books and Writings, that before the <hi>Romans</hi>
came hither here were Colledges of Women practiſing Phyſick,
dedicated to ſome of the Female Deities; but whether ſo anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
as the <hi>Bards</hi> I cannot tell, tho ſome old Britiſh Songs
written in praiſe of the <hi>Goddeſs <hi>Trawth,</hi>
               </hi> ſeem to prove it: but
they were in the time of the <hi>Druides,</hi> as appears both by Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
and French Books, and the Name of <hi>Wiſe Women,</hi> by
which <hi>Midwives</hi> are ſtill called in <hi>France,</hi> and moſt of the
Weſtern Parts, as they are by that of <hi>Wiſe Mother</hi> in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46928:4"/>
               <hi>Low-Countries, Germany,</hi> and moſt of the Northern Parts of
the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And here in</hi> London <hi>were Colledges of Women about the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of</hi> Diana, <hi>who was Goddeſs of Midwives here, as well as at</hi>
Epheſus. From whence the Grecians ſay, ſhe was abſent at
Q. <hi>Olympia</hi>'s Labour, who was that Night deliver'd of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the <hi>Great;</hi> where ſhe was ſo fully employed, that ſhe could
not defend her Stately Temple, which was burned down by
<hi>Heroſtrateus</hi> the Shoemaker, to perpetuate his Name.</p>
            <p>Nor did the Biſhops pretend to Licenſe Midwives till
Bp. <hi>Bonner</hi>'s time, who drew up the Form of the firſt Licenſe,
which continued in full force till 1642, and then the
Phyſicians and Chirurgions contending about it, it was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Chyrurgical Operation, and the Midwives were Licenſed
at <hi>Chirurgions-Hall, but not till they had paſſed three Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
before ſix skilful Midwives, and as many Chirurgions expert
in the Art of Midwifery.</hi> Thus it continued until the Act of
Uniformity paſſed, which ſent the Midwives back to <hi>Doctors
Commons,</hi> where they pay their Money, <hi>(take an Oath which is
impoſſible for them to keep)</hi> and return home as skilful as they
went thither.</p>
            <p>I make no Reflections on thoſe learned Gentlemen the Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
but refer the curious for their further ſatisfaction, to the
Yearly Bills of Mortality, from 42 to 62: Collections of which
they may find at <hi>Clerks-Hall:</hi> Which if they pleaſe to compare
with theſe of late Years, they will find there did not then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the eight part of the Caſualties, either to Women or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as do now.</p>
            <p>I hope, Doctor, theſe Conſiderations will deter any of you
from pretending to teach us Midwifery, eſpecially ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<hi>they never delivered Women in their Lives,</hi> and being asked
<hi>What they would do in ſuch a Caſe?</hi> reply <hi>they have not yet ſtudied
it,</hi> but will when occaſion ſerves; <hi>This is ſomething to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
I muſt confeſs, Doctor:</hi> But I doubt it will not ſatisfy the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46928:4"/>
Women of this Age, who are ſo ſenſible and impatient of their
Pain, that few of them will be prevailed with to bear it, in
Complement to the Doctor, <hi>while he fetches his Book, ſtudies the
Caſe, and teaches the Midwife to perform her work,</hi> which ſhe
hopes may be done before he comes.</p>
            <p>I proteſt, Doctor, I have not Power enough with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to hope to prevail with them to be patient in this caſe, and
I think if the Learnedſt of you all ſhould propoſe it <hi>whilſt the
Pains are on,</hi> he would come off with the ſame Applauſe which
<hi>Phormio</hi> had, who having never ſeen a Battel in his Life, read
a Military Lecture to <hi>Hannibal</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let this paſs, Doctor, as I do the Diſcourſes you have
often made to me on this Subject, and I will tell you ſomething
worthy of your moſt ſerious Conſideration: Which is,</p>
            <p>That in <hi>September</hi> laſt, our Gracious Soveraign was pleaſed
to promiſe to unite the Midwives into a Corporation, by His
Royal Charter, and alſo to found a <hi>Cradle-Hoſpital,</hi> to breed
up expoſed Children, to prevent the <hi>many Murders, and the
Executions which attend them;</hi> which pious Deſign will never
want a ſuitable Return from God, who no doubt will fully
reward his Care for preſerving ſo many <hi>Innocents</hi> as would
otherwiſe be loſt.</p>
            <p>And I doubt not but one way will be by giving him a Prince
by his Royal Conſort, who like another <hi>Moſes</hi> may become a
Mighty Captain for the Nation; and lead to Battel the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which the Hoſpital will preſerve for him.</p>
            <p>And now, Doctor, let me put you in mind, that tho you
have often Laughed at me, and ſome Doctors have accounted
me a Mad Woman theſe laſt four Years, for ſaying Her Majeſty
was full of Children, and that the <hi>Bath</hi> would aſſiſt her Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
'Tis now proved ſo true, that I have cauſe to hope my
ſelf may live to praiſe God, not only for a <hi>Prince of Wales, and
a Duke of York,</hi> but for many other Royal Babes by Her; and if
the over Officious will but be pleaſed to let them live, <hi>I hope in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46928:5"/>
a few Years to ſee them Muſter their little Soldiers:</hi> Which Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Sight, I believe, is the hearty Deſire of all Loyal Subjects,
of what Perſuaſion ſoever, as it is the daily and fervent
Prayer of,</p>
