            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Euery one of those considerations, Syr, moue me of right to offer this my late husbands <hi>M. Aschams</hi> worke vnto you. For well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryng how much all good learnyng oweth vnto you for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense therof, as the Vniuersitie of Cambrige, of which my said late husband was a member, haue in chosing you their worthy Chaunceller acknowledged, and how happily you haue spent your time in such studies &amp; caried the vse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the right ende, to the good seruice of the Quenes Maiestie and your contrey to all our benefites, thyrdly how much my sayd husband was many wayes bound vnto you, and how gladly and comfortably he vsed in hys lyfe to recognise and report your goodnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hym, leauyng with me then hys poore widow and a great sort of orphanes a good comfort in the hope of your

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the great plage was at London, the yeare 1563. the Quenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> lay at her Castle of Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore: Where, vpon the 10. day of December, it fortuned, that in Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cicells</hi> chamber, hir Highnesse Principall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie, there dined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither these personages, M. Secretarie him selfe, Syr <hi>William Peter,</hi> Syr <hi>I. Mason,</hi> D. <hi>Wotton,</hi> Syr <hi>Richard Sackuille</hi> Treasurer of the Exchecker, Syr <hi>Walter Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maye</hi> Chauncellor of the Exchecker, M. <hi>Haddon</hi> Master of Requestes, M. <hi>Iohn Astely</hi> Master of the Iewell house, M. <hi>Bernard Hampton,</hi> M. <hi>Nicasius,</hi> and <hi>I.</hi> Of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the most part were of hir Maiesties most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble priuie Counsell, and the reast seruing hir in verie good place. I was glad than, and do reioice yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that my chance was so happie, to be there that day, in the companie of so manie wise &amp; good men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, as hardly than could haue bene piked out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, out of all England beside.</p>
            <p>M. Secretarie hath this accustomed maner, though his head be neuer so full of most weightie affaires of the Realme, yet, at diner time he doth seeme to lay them alwaies aside: and findeth euer fitte occasion to taulke pleasantlie of other matters, but most gladlie of some matter of learning: wherein, he will curteslie heare the minde of the meanest at his Table.</p>
            <p>Not long after our sitting doune, I haue strange newes brought me, sayth M. Secretarie, this morning,
<pb facs="tcp:4597:5"/>
that diuerse Scholers of Eaton, be runne àwaie from the Schole,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi>
               </note> for feare of beating. Whereupon, M. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie tooke occasion, to wishe, that some more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretion were in many Scholemasters, in vsing correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than commonlie there is. Who many times, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe rather, the weakenes of nature, than the fault of the Scholer. Whereby, many Scholers, that might else proue well, be driuen to hate learning, before they knowe, what learning meaneth: and so, are made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forsake their booke, and be glad to be put to any other kinde of liuing.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">M. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </note>M. <hi>Peter,</hi> as one somewhat seuere of nature, said plainlie, that the Rodde onelie, was the sworde, that must keepe, the Schole in obedience, and the Scholer in good order. M. <hi>Wotton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. <hi>Wotton.</hi>
               </note> à man milde of nature, with soft voice, and fewe wordes, inclined to M.

                  <hi>Plato</hi> de Rep. 7.</note> And therefore, if à Rodde carie the feare of à Sworde, it is no maruell, if those that be fearefull of nature, chose rather to forsake the Plaie, than to stand alwaies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the feare of à Sworde in à fonde mans handling.

               </note> after his maner, was verie merie with both parties, pleasantlie playing, both, with the shrew de touches of many courste boyes, and with the small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of many leude Scholemasters.<note place="margin">M. <hi>Haddon.</hi>
               </note> M. <hi>Haddon</hi> was fullie of M. <hi>Peters</hi> opinion, and said, that the best Scholemaster of our time, was the greatest beater, and named the Person.<note place="margin">

               </note> Though, quoth I, it was his good fortune, to send from his Schole, vnto the Vniuersitie, one of the best Scholers in deede of all our time, yet wise men do thinke, that that came so to passe, rather, by the great towardnes of the Scholer, than by the great beating of the Master: and whether this be true or no, you your selfe are best witnes. I said somewhat farder
<pb facs="tcp:4597:5"/>
in the matter, how, and whie, yong children, were soner allured by loue, than driuen by beating, to atteyne good learning: wherein I was the bolder to say my minde, bicause M. Secretarie curteslie prouoked me thereunto: or else, in such à companie, and namelie in his praesence, my wonte is, to be more willing, to vse mine eares, than to occupie my tonge.</p>
            <p>Syr <hi>Walter Mildmaye,</hi> M. <hi>Astley,</hi> and the rest, said verie litle: onelie Syr <hi>Rich. Sackuill,</hi> said nothing at all.

               </note> Syr <hi>Rich.

Where, though I said nothing, yet I gaue as good eare, and do consider as well the taulke, that passed, as any one did there. M. Secretarie said very wisely, and most truely, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yong wittes be driuen to hate learninge, before they know what learninge is. I can be good witnes to this my selfe: For a fond Scholemaster, before I was fullie fourtene yeare olde, draue me so, with feare of beating, from all loue of learninge, as nowe, when I know, what difference it is, to haue learninge, and to haue litle, or none at all, I feele it my greatest greife, and finde it my greatest hurte, that euer came to me, that it was my so ill chance, to light vpon so lewde à Scholemaster. But seing it is but in vain, to lament thinges paste, and also wisdome to looke to thinges to cum, surely, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, if God lend me life, I will make this my mishap, some occasion of good hap, to litle <hi>Robert Sackuile</hi> my sonnes sonne. For whose bringinge vp, I would gladlie, if it so please you, vse speciallie your good aduice. I heare saie, you haue à sonne, moch of his age: we wil

deale thus togither. Point you out à Scholemaster, who by your order, shall teache my sonne and yours, and for all the rest, I will prouide, yea though they three do cost me à couple of hundred poundes by yeare: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, you shall finde me as fast à Frend to you and yours, as perchance any you haue. Which promise, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Ientleman surelie kept with me, vntill his dying daye.</p>

But, sayth he, bicause this place, and this tyme, will not suffer so long taulke, as these good matters require, therefore I pray you, at my request, and at your leysure, put in some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of writing, the cheife pointes of this our taulke, concerning, the right order of teachinge, and honestie of liuing, for the good bringing vp of children &amp; yong men. And surelie, beside contentinge me, you shall both please and profit verie many others. I made some excuse by lacke of habilitie, and weakenes of bodie: well, sayth he, I am not now to learne, what you can do. Our deare frende, good M. <hi>Goodricke,</hi> whose iudgement I could well beleue, did once for all, satisfie me fullie therein. Againe, I heard you say, not long agoe, that you may thanke Syr <hi>Iohn Cheke,</hi> for all the learninge you haue: And I know verie well my selfe, that you did teach the Quene. And therefore seing God did so blesse you,
<pb facs="tcp:4597:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to make you the Scholer of the best Master, and also the Scholemaster of the best Scholer, that euer were in our tyme, surelie, you should please God, benefite your countrie, &amp; honest your owne name, if you would take the paines, to impart to others, what you learned of soch à Master, and how ye taught soch à scholer. And, in vttering the stuffe ye receiued of the one, in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the order ye tooke with the other, ye shall neuer lacke, neither matter, nor maner, what to write, nor how to write in this kinde of Argument.</p>
            <p>I beginning some farther excuse, sodeinlie was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to cum to the Queene. The night following, I slept litle, my head was so full of this our former taulke, and I so mindefull, somewhat to satisfie the honest request of so deare à frend. I thought to praepare some litle trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise for à Newyeares gift that Christmas. But, as it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to busie builders, so, in building thys my poore Scholehouse (the rather bicause the forme of it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what new, and differing from others) the worke rose dailie higher and wider, than I thought it would at the beginninge.</p>
            <p>And though it appeare now, and be in verie deede, but à small cotage, poore for the stuffe, and rude for the workemanship, yet in going forward, I found the site so good, as I was lothe to giue it ouer, but the making so costlie, outreaching my habilitie, as many tymes I wished, that some one of those three, my deare frendes, with full pursses, Syr <hi>Tho.

Whan he was gone, my hart was dead. There was not one, that woare à blacke gowne for him, who caried à heuier hart for him, than I. Whan he was gone, I cast this booke àwaie: I could not looke vpon it, but with weping eyes, in remembring him, who was the onelie setter on, to do it, and would haue bene, not onelie à glad commender of it, but also à sure and certaine comfort, to me and mine, for it. Almost two yeares togither, this booke lay scattered, and neglected, and had bene quite giuen ouer of me, if the goodnesse of one had not giuen me some life and spirite againe.

            <p>Therefore, I trust, good and wise men, will thinke well of this my doing. And of other, that thinke otherwise, I will thinke my selfe, they are but men, to be pardoned for their follie, and pitied for their ignoraunce.</p>
            <p>In writing this booke, I haue had earnest respecte to three speciall pointes, trothe of Religion, honestie in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, right order in learning. In which three waies, I praie God, my poore children may diligently waulke: for whose sake, as nature moued, and reason required, and necessitie also somewhat compelled, I was the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger to take these paines.</p>
            <p>For, seing at my death, I am not like to leaue them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great store of liuing, therefore in my life time, I thought good to bequeath vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in this litle booke, as in my Will and Testament, the right waie to good learning: which if they followe, with the feare of God, they shall verie well cum to sufficiencie of liuinge.</p>
            <p>I wishe also, with all my hart, that yong M. <hi>Rob.

            <p>And one thing I would haue the Reader consider in readinge this booke, that bicause, no Scholemaster hath charge of any childe, before he enter into hys Schole, therefore I leauing all former care, of their good bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp, to wise and good Parentes, as à matter not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing

            <p>Yet if my Scholemaster, for loue he beareth to hys Scholer, shall teach hym somewhat for hys furtherance, and better iudgement in learning, that may serue him seuen yeare after in the Vniuersitie, he doth hys Scholer no more wrong, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth no worse name therby, than he doth in London, who selling silke or cloth vnto his frend, doth giue hym better measure, than either hys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise or bargaine was.</p>

            <p>A childe shall learne of the better of them, that, which an other daie, if he be wise, and cum to iudgement, he must be faine to vnlearne againe.</p>
            <p>There is a waie, touched in the first booke of <hi>Cicero De Oratore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>De Or.</hi>

and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly vsed, would not onely take wholly away this butcherlie feare in making of latines, but would also, with ease and pleasure, and in short time, as I know by good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, worke a true choice and placing of wordes, a right ordering of sentences, an easie vnderstandyng of the tonge, a readines to speake, a facilitie to write, a true iudgement, both of his owne, and other mens doinges, what tonge so euer he doth vse.</p>
            <p>The waie is this. After the thrée Concordances lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as I touched before, let the master read vnto hym the Epistles of <hi>Cicero,</hi> gathered togither and chosen out by <hi>Sturmius,</hi> for the capacitie of children.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The order of teaching.</note>First, let him teach the childe, cherefullie and plainlie, the cause, and matter of the letter: then, let him construe it into Englishe, so oft, as the childe may easilie carie awaie the vnderstanding of it: Lastlie, parse it ouer perfitlie. This done thus, let the childe, by and by, both construe and parse it ouer againe: so, that it may appeare, that the childe dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in nothing, that his master taught him before. After this, the childe must take a paper booke, and sitting in some place, where no man shall prompe him, by him self, let him translate into Englishe his former lesson. Then shewing it to his master,<note place="margin">Two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per bokes.</note> let the master take from him his latin booke, and pausing an houre, at the least, than let the childe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate his owne Englishe into latin againe, in an other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per booke. When the childe bringeth it, turned into latin, the master must compare it with <hi>Tullies</hi> booke, and laie them both togither: and where the childe doth well, either in chosing, or true placing of <hi>Tullies</hi> wordes, let the master praise him,<note place="margin">Children learne by prayse.</note> and saie here ye do well. For I assure you, there is no such whetstone, to sharpen a good witte and encourage a will to learninge, as is praise.</p>
            <p>But if the childe misse, either in forgetting a worde, or in chaunging a good with a worse, or misordering the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, I would not haue the master, either froune, or chide with him, if the childe haue done his diligence, and died no
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4597:11"/>
frewandship therein.<note place="margin">Ientlenes in teaching</note> For I know by good experience, that a childe shall take more profit of two fautes, tentlie warned of, then of foure thinges, rightly hitt. For than, the master shall haue good occasion to saie vnto him. <hi>N. Tullie</hi> would haue vsed such a worde, not this: <hi>Tullie</hi> would haue placed this worde here, not there: would haue vsed this case, this number, this person, this degrée, this gender: he would haue vsed this moode, this tens, this simple, rather than this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound: this aduerbe here, not there: he would haue ended the sentence with this verbe, not with that nowne or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiple. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In these sewe lines, I haue wrapped vp, the most tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of Grammer: and also the ground of almost all the Rewles, that are so busilie taught by the Master, and so hardlie learned by the Scholer, in all common Scholes: which after this sort, the master shall teach without all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and the scholer shall learne without great paine: the master being led by so sure a guide, and the scholer being brought into so plaine and casie a waie. And therefore, we do not contemne Rewles, but we gladlie teach Rewles: and teach them, more plainlie, sensiblie, and orderlie, than they be commonlie taught in common Scholes. For whan the Master shall compare <hi>Tullies</hi> booke with his Scholers tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, let the Master, at the first, lead and teach his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, to ioyne the Rewles of his Grammer booke, with the examples of his present lesson, vntill the Scholer, by him selfe, be hable to fetch out of his Grammer, euerie Rewle, for euerie Example: So, as the Grammer booke be euer in the Scholers hand, and also vsed of him, as a Dictionarie, for euerie present vse. This is a liuely and perfite waie of teaching of Rewles: where the common waie, vsed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Scholes, to read the Grammer alone by it selfe, is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for the Master, hard for the Scholer, colde and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumfortable for them bothe.</p>
            <p>Let your Scholer be neuer afraide, to aske you any dout, but vse discretlie the best allurementes ye can, to encorage
<pb facs="tcp:4597:12"/>
him to the same: lest, his euermoch fearinge of you, driue him to séeke some misorderlie shifte: as, to séeke to be helped by some other booke, or to be prompted by some other Scholer, and so goe aboute to begile you moch, and him selfe more.</p>
            <p>With this waie, of good vnderstanding the mater, plaine construinge, diligent parsinge, dailie translatinge, chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full admonishinge, and héedefull amendinge of faultes: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leauinge behinde iuste praise for well doinge, I would haue the Scholer brought vp withall, till he had red, &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first booke of Epistles chosen out by <hi>Sturmius,</hi> with a good péece of a Comedie of <hi>Terence</hi> also.</p>

               <note place="margin">Latin speakyng.</note>All this while, by mine aduise, the childe shall vse to speake no latine: For, as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in like mater, with like wordes, <hi>loquendo, male loqui discunt.</hi> And, that excellent learned man, <hi>G. Budaeus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> in his Gréeke Commentaries, sore complaineth, that whan he began to learne the latin tonge, vse of speaking latin at the table, and elsewhere, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduisedlie, did bring him to soch an euill choice of wordes, to soch a crooked framing of sentences, that no one thing did hurt or hinder him more, all the daies of his life afterward, both for redinesse in speaking, and also good iudgement in writinge.</p>
            <p>In very déede, if childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were brought vp, in soch a house, or soch a Schole, where the latin tonge were properlie and perfitlie spoken, as <hi>Tib.</hi> and <hi>Ca.

But, now, commonlie, in the best Scholes in England, for wordes, right choice is smallie regarded, true proprietie whollie neglected, confusion is brought in, barbariousnesse is bred vp so in yong wittes, as afterward they be, not onelie marde for speaking, but also corrupted in iudgement: as with moch adoe, or neuer at all, they be brought to right frame againe.</p>
            <p>Yet all men couet to haue their children speake latin:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4597:12"/>
and so do I verie earnestlie too. We bothe, haue one pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: we agrée in desire, we wish one end: but we differ somewhat in order and waie, that leadeth rightlie to that end. Other would haue them speake at all aduentures: and, so they be speakinge, to speake, the Master careth not, the Scholer knoweth not, what. This is, to seeme, and not to bée: except it be, to be bolde without shame, rashe without skill, full of wordes without witte. I wish to haue them speake so, as it may well appeare, that the braine doth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the tonge, and that reason leadeth forth the taulke. <hi>Socrates</hi> doctrine is true in <hi>Plato,</hi>

            <p>If your scholer do misse sometimes,<note place="margin">Ientlenes in teaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>I haue now wished, twise or thrise, this gentle nature, to be in a Scholemaster: And, that I haue done so, neither by chance, nor without some reason, I will now declare at large, why, in mine opinion, loue is fitter then feare,<note place="margin">Loue.</note> ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes better than beating, to bring vp a childe rightlie in learninge.<note place="margin">Feare.</note>
            </p>
            <p>With the common vse of teaching and beating in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon scholes of England,<note place="margin">Common Scholes.</note> I will not greatlie contend: which if I did, it were but a small grammaticall controuersie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belonging to heresie nor treason, nor greatly touching God nor the Prince: although in very deede, in the end, the good or ill bringing vp of children, doth as much serue to the good or ill seruice, of God, our Prince, and our whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, as any one thing doth beside.</p>
            <p>I do gladlie agrée with all good Scholemasters in these pointes: to haue children brought to good perfitnes in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: to all honestie in maners: to haue all fautes rightlie amended: to haue euerie vice seuerelie corrected: but for the order and waie that leadeth rightlie to these pointes, we somewhat differ. For commonlie, many scholemasters, some,<note place="margin">Sharpe Schole<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>masters.</note> as I haue séen, moe, as I haue heard tell, be of so croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a nature, as, when they méete with a hard witted scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, they rather breake him, than bowe him, rather marre him, than mend him. For whan the scholemaster is angrie
<pb facs="tcp:4597:14"/>
with some other matter, then will he sonest faul to beate his scholer: and though he him selfe should be punished for his folie, yet must he beate some scholer for his pleasure: though there be no cause for him to do so, nor yet fault in the scholer to deserue so. These ye will say, be fond scholema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and fewe they be, that be found to be soch. They be fond in deede, but surelie ouermany soch be found euerie where. But this will I say, that euen the wisest of your great beaters,<note place="margin">Nature punished.</note> do as oft punishe nature, as they do correcte faultes. Yea, many times, the better nature, is sorer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: For, if one, by quicknes of witte, take his lesson readelie, an other, by hardnes of witte, taketh it not so spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delie: the first is alwaies commended, the other is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie punished: whan a wise sholemaster, should rather dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretelie consider the right disposition of both their natures, and not so moch wey what either of them is able to do now, as what either of them is likelie to do hereafter.<note place="margin">Quicke wittes for learnyng.</note> For this I know, not onelie by reading of bookes in my studie, but also by experience of life, abrode in the world, that those, which be commonlie the wisest, the best learned, and best men also, when they be olde, were neuer commonlie the quickest of witte, when they were yonge The causes why, amongest other, which be many, that moue me thus to thinke, be these fewe, which I will recken. Quicke wittes commonlie, be apte to take, vnapte to kéepe: soone hote and desirous of this and that: as colde and sone wery of the same againe: more quicke to enter spedelie, than hable to pearse farre: euen like ouer sharpe tooles, whose edges be verie soone turned. Soch wittes delite them selues in easie and pleasant studies, and neuer passe farre forward in hie and hard sciences. And therfore the quickest wittes commonlie may proue the best Poetes, but not the wisest Orators: rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of tonge to speake boldlie, not déepe of iudgement, either for good counsell or wise writing.<note place="margin">Quicke wittes, for maners &amp; lyfe.</note> Also, for maners and life, quicke wittes commonlie, be, in desire, newfangle, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, vnconstant, light to promise any thing, readie to forget
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4597:14"/>
euery thing: both benefite and iniurie: and therby neither fast to frend, nor fearefull to foe: inquisitiue of euery trifle, not secret in greatest affaires: bolde, with any person: busie, in euery matter: sothing, soch as be present: nipping any that is absent: of nature also alwaies, flattering their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, enuying their equals, despising their inferiors: and, by quicknes of witte, verie quicke and readie, to like none so well as them selues.</p>
            <p>Moreouer commonlie, men, very quicke of witte, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, verie light of conditions: and thereby, very readie of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, to be caried ouer quicklie, by any light cumpanie, to any riot and vnthriftines when they be yonge: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seldome, either honest of life, or riche in liuing, when they be olde. For, quicke in witte, and light in maners, be, either seldome troubled, or verie sone wery, in carying a verie heuie purse. Quicke wittes also be, in most part of all their doinges, ouerquicke, hastie, rashe, headie, and brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke. These two last wordes, Headie, and Brainsicke, be fitte and proper wordes, rising naturallie of the matter, and tearmed aptlie by the condition, of ouer moch quickenes of witte. In yougthe also they be, readie scoffers, priuie moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and euer ouer light and mery. In aige, sone testie, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry waspishe, and alwaies ouer miserable: and yet fewe of them cum to any great aige, by reason of their misordered life when they were yong: but a great deale fewer of them cum to shewe any great countenance, or beare any great authoritie abrode in the world, but either liue obscurelie, men know not how, or dye obscurelie, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marke not whan. They be like trées, that shewe forth, faire blossoms &amp; broad leaues in spring time, but bring out small and not long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting fruite in haruest time: and that onelie soch, as fall, and rotte, before they be ripe, and so, neuer, or seldome, cum to any good at all. For this ye shall finde most true by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that amongest a number of quicke wittes in youthe, fewe be found, in the end, either verie fortunate for them selues, or verie profitable to serue the common wealth, but

decay and vanish, men know not which way: except a very fewe, to whom peraduenture blood and happie parentage, may perchance purchace a long standing vpon the stage. The which felicitie, because it commeth by others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, not by their owne deseruinge, and stand by other mens féete, and not by their own, what owtward brag so euer is borne by them, is in déed, of it selfe, and in wise mens eyes, of no great estimation.</p>

            <p>But this ignorance in yougthe,<note place="margin">Innocency in youth.</note> which I spake on, or rather this simplicitie, or most trewlie, this innocencie, is that, which the noble <hi>Persians,</hi> as wise <hi>Xenophon</hi> doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie,
<pb facs="tcp:4597:25"/>
were so carefull, to breede vp their yougth in. But Christian fathers commonlie do not so. And I will tell you a tale, as moch to be misliked, as the <hi>Persians</hi> example is to be folowed.</p>
            <p>This last somer, I was in a Ientlemans house: where a yong childe,<note place="margin">A childe ill brought vp.</note> somwhat past fower yeare olde, cold in no wise frame his tonge, to saie, a litle shorte grace: and yet he could roundlie rap out, so manie vgle othes, and those of the newest facion, as som good man of fourescore yeare olde hath neuer hard named before: and that which was most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable of all,<note place="margin">Ill Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.</note> his father and mother wold laughe at it.

This Childe vsing moche the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of seruinge men, and geuing good care to their taulke, did easelie learne, which he shall hardlie forget, all daies of his life hereafter: So likewise, in the Courte, if a yong Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman will ventur him self into the companie of Ruffians, it is ouer greate a ieoperdie, lest, their facions, maners, thoughtes, taulke, and deedes, will verie sone, be euer like. The confounding of companies,<note place="margin">Ill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</note> bréedeth confusion of good maners both in the Courte, and euerie where else.</p>
            <p>And it maie be a great wonder, but a greater shame, to vs Christian men, to vnderstand, what a heithen writer, <hi>Isocrates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> doth leaue in memorie of writing, concerning the care, that the noble Citie of <hi>Athens</hi> had, to bring vp their yougthe, in honest companie, and vertuous discipline, whose taulke in Greke, is, to this effect, in Englishe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Citie, was not more carefull, to sée their Children well taughte,<note place="margin">

                  </note> than to sée their yong men well gouerned: which they brought to passe, not so much by common lawe, as by priuate discipline. For, they had more regard, that their yougthe, by good order shold not offend, than how, by lawe, they might be punished: And if offense were commit, ted, there was, neither waie to hide it, neither hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for it. Good natures, were not so moche openlie praised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they were secretlie marked, and watchfullie regarded,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4597:25"/>
lest they should lease the goodnes they had. Therefore in scholes of singing and dauncing, and other honest exercises, gouernours were appointed, more diligent to ouersee their good maners, than their masters were, to teach them anie learning. It was som shame to a yong man, to be seene in the open market: and if for businesse, he passed throughe it, he did it, with a meruelous modestie, and bashefull facion. To eate, or drinke in a Tauerne, was not onelie a shame, but also punishable, in a yong man. To contrarie, or to stand in termes with an old man, was more heinous, than in som place, to rebuke and scolde with his owne father: with manie other mo good orders, and faire disciplines, which I referre to their reading, that haue lust to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the description of such a worthie common welthe.</q>

And good cause whie: For the self same noble Citie of Athenes,<note place="margin">Learnyng ioyned with pastures.</note> iustlie commended of me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, did wiselie and vpon great consideration, appoint, the Muses, <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> to be patrones of learning to their yougthe.<note place="margin">

Pointe forth six of the best giuen Ientlemen of this Court, and all they together, shew not so much good will, spend not so much tyme, bestow not so many houres, dayly orderly, &amp; constantly, for the increase of learning &amp; knowledge, as doth the Quéenes Maiestie her selfe. Yea I beleue, that beside her perfit readines, in <hi>Latin, Italian, French,</hi> &amp; <hi>Spanish,</hi> she readeth here now at Windsore more Gréeke euery day, than some Prebendarie of this Chirch doth read <hi>Latin</hi> in a whole wéeke. And that which is most praise worthie of all, within the walles of her priuie chamber, she hath obteyned that excellencie of learnyng, to vnderstand, speake, &amp; write, both wittely with head, and faire with hand, as scarse one or two rare wittes in both the Uniuersities haue in many yeares reached vnto. Amongest all the benefites y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God hath blessed me with all, next the knowledge of Christes true Religion, I counte this the greatest, that it pleased God to call me, to be one poore minister in settyng forward these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent giftes of learnyng in this most excellent Prince. Whose onely example, if the rest of our nobilitie would fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, than might England be, for learnyng and wisedome
<pb facs="tcp:4597:29"/>
in nobilitie,<note place="margin">Ill Exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples haue more force, then good examples.</note> a spectacle to all the world beside. But sée the mishap of men: The best examples haue neuer such forse to moue to any goodnes, as the bad, vaine, light and fond, haue to all ilnes.</p>
            <p>And one example, though out of the compas of learning, yet not out of the order of good maners, was notable in this Courte, not fullie xxiiij. yeares a go, when all the actes of Parlament, many good Proclamations, diuerse strait com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, sore punishment openlie, speciall regarde priuatelie, cold not do so moch to take away one misorder, as the example of one big one of this Courte did, still to kepe vp the same: The memorie whereof, doth yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, in a common prouerbe of Birching lane.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Great men in Court, by their example, make or marre, all other mens maners.</note>Take hede therfore, ye great ones in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court, yea though ye be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest of all, take hede, what ye do, take hede how ye liue. For as you great ones vse to do, so all meane men loue to do. You be in deed, makers or marrers, of all mens maners within the Realme. For though God hath placed yow, to be cheife in making of lawes, to beare greatest au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to commaund all others: yet God doth order, that all your lawes, all your authoritie, all your commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, do not halfe so moch with meane men, as doth your example and maner of liuinge.<note place="margin">Example in Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> And for example euen in the greatest matter, if yow your selues do serue God gladlie and orderlie for conscience sake, not coldlie, and somtyme for maner sake, you carie all the Courte with yow, and the whole Realme beside, earnestlie and orderlie to do the same.

I know, som greate and good ones in Courte, were authors, that honest Citizens of London, should watche at euerie gate, to take misordered persones in apparell. I know, that honest Londoners did so: And I sawe, which I sawe than, &amp; reporte now with som greife, than som Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie men were offended with these good men of London. And that, which greued me most of all, I sawe the verie same tyme, for all theis good orders, commaunded from the Courte and executed in London, I sawe I say, cum out of London,<note place="margin">Masters, Ushers, &amp; Scholers of sense.</note> euen vnto the presence of the Prince, a great ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of meane and light persones, in apparell, for matter, against lawe, for making, against order, for facion, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hose, so without all order, as he thought himselfe most braue, that durst do most in breaking order and was most monsterous in misorder. And for all the great commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, that came out of the Courte, yet this bold misor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was winked at, and borne withall, in the Courte. I thought, it was not well, that som great ones of the Court, durst declare themselues offended, with good men of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for doinge their dewtie, &amp; the good ones of the Courte, would not shew themselues offended, with ill men of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for breaking good order. I fownde thereby a sayinge of <hi>Socrates</hi> to be most trewe that ill men be more hastie, than good men be forwarde, to prosecute their purposes, euen as Christ himselfe saith, of the Children of light and darknes.</p>
            <p>Beside apparell, in all other thinges to, not so moch, good lawes and strait commaundements as the example and maner of liuing of great men, doth carie all meane men euerie where, to like, and loue, &amp; do, as they do.

            <p>I was once in Italie my selfe:<note place="margin">

               </note> was but ix. dayes: And yet I sawe in that litle tyme, in one Citie, more libertie to sinne, than euer I hard tell of in our noble Citie of London in ix. yeare. I sawe, it was there, as frée to sinne, not onelie without all punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but also without any mans marking, as it is free in the Citie of London, to chose, without all blame, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man lust to weare Shee or pantocle. And good cause why: For being vnlike in troth of Religion, they must nedes be vnlike in honestie of liuing. For blessed be Christ, in our Citie of London,<note place="margin">Seruice of God in England.</note> commonlie the commandementes of God, be more diligentlie taught, and the seruice of God more reuerentlie vsed, and that daylie in many priuate mens houses,<note place="margin">Seruice of God in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie.</note> than they be in Italie once a wéeke in their common Chirches: where, masking Ceremonies, to delite the eye, and vaine soundes, to please the eare, do quite thrust out of the Chirches, all seruice of God in spirit and troth.

the bloodie Inquisitors in Italie be in seauen yeare.<note place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors in Italie</note> For, their care and charge is, not to punish sinne, not to amend manners, not to purge doctrine, but onelie to watch and ouersée that Christes trewe Religion set no sure footing, where the Pope hath any Iurisdiction. I learned, when I was at <hi>Venice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie pollicie.</note> that there it is counted good pollicie, when there be foure or fiue brethren of one familie, one, onelie to marie: &amp; all the rest, to waulcer, with as litle shame, in open lecherie, as Swyne do here in the common myre. Yea, there be as fayre houses of Religion, as great prouision, as diligent officers, to kepe vp this misorder, as Bridewell is, and all the Masters there, to kepe downe misorder. And therefore, if the Pope himselfe, do not onelie graunt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons to furder thies wicked purposes abrode in Italie, but also (although this present Pope, in the beginning, made som shewe of misliking thereof) assigne both méede and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to the maintenance of stewes and brothelhouses at home in Rome, than let wise men thinke Italie a safe place for holsom doctrine, and godlie manners, and a fitte schole for yong ientlemen of England to be brought vp in.</p>
            <p>Our Italians bring home with them other faultes from Italie, though not so great as this of Religion, yet a great deale greater, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many good men can well beare. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie they cum home,<note place="margin">Contempt of mariage.</note> common contemners of mariage and readie persuaders of all other to the same: not because they loue virginitie, nor yet because they hate prettie yong virgines, but, being frée in Italie, to go whither so euer lust will cary them, they do not like, that lawe and honestie should be soch a barre to their like libertie at home in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. And yet they be, the greatest makers of loue, the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie daliers, with such pleasant wordes, with such smilyng and secret countenances, with such signes, tokens, wagers, purposed to be lost, before they were purposed to be made, with bargaines of wearing colours, floures, and herbes, to bréede occasion of ofter méeting of him and her, and bolder talking of this and that &amp;c. And although I haue séene some,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4597:37"/>
innocent of all ill, and stayde in all honestie, that haue vsed these thinges without all harme, without all suspicion of harme, yet these knackes were brought first into England by them, that learned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before in <hi>Italie</hi> in <hi>Circes</hi> Court: and how Courtlie curtesses so euer they be counted now, yet, if the meaning and maners of some that do vse them, were somewhat amended, it were no great hurt, neither to them selues, nor to others.</p>
            <p>An other propertie of this our English <hi>Italians</hi> is, to be meruelous singular in all their matters: Singular in knowledge, ignorant of nothyng: So singular in wisedome (in their owne opinion) as scarse they counte the best Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor the Prince hath, comparable with them: Common discoursers of all matters: busie searchers of most secret af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: open flatterers of great men: priuie mislikers of good men: Faire speakers, with smiling countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, and much curtessie openlie to all men. Ready bakbiters, sore nippers, and spitefull reporters priuilie of good men. And beyng brought vp in <hi>Italie,</hi> in some frée Citie, as all Cities be there: where a man may fréelie discourse against what he will, against whom he lust: against any Prince, agaynst any gouernement, yea against God him selfe, and his whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: where he must be, either <hi>Guelphe</hi> or <hi>Gibiline,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spanish:</hi> and alwayes compelled to be of some partie, of some faction, he shall neuer be compelled to be of any Religion: And if he medle not ouer much with Christes true Religion, he shall haue frée libertie to embrace all Religions, and becum, if he lust at once, without any let or punishment, Iewish, Turkish, Papish, and Deuillish.</p>
            <p>A yong Ientleman, thus bred vp in this goodly schole, to learne the next and readie way to sinne, to haue a busie head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a factious hart, a talkatiue tonge: fed with discoursing of factions: led so contemne God and his Religion, shall cum home into England, but verie ill taught, either to be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man him selfe, a quiet subiect to his Prince, or willyng to serue God, vnder the obedience of trewe doctrine, or with

            <p>I know, none will be offended with this my generall writing, but onelie such, as finde them selues giltie priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie therin: who shall haue good leaue to be offended with me, vntill they begin to amende them selues.

I remember, whan I was yong, in the North, they went to the Grammer schole, litle children: they came from thence great lubbers: alwayes learning, and litle profiting: learning without booke, euery thing, vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng with in the booke, litle or nothing: Their whole knowledge, by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without the booke, was tied onely to their tong &amp; lips, and neuer asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vp to the braine &amp; head, and therfore was sone spitte out of the mouth againe: They were, as men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes goyng, but euer out of the way: and why?

            <p>I had once a profe hereof, tried by good experience, by a deare frende of myne, whan I came first from Cambrige, to serue the Quéenes Maiestie, than Ladie <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> lying at worthie Syr <hi>Ant. Denys</hi> in Cheston. <hi>Iohn Whitneye,</hi>

a yong ientleman, was my bedfeloe, who willyng by good nature and prouoked by mine aduise, began to learne the Latin tong, after the order declared in this booke. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan after Christmas: I read vnto him <hi>Tullie de Amicitia,</hi> which he did euerie day twise translate, out of Latin into English, and out of English into Latin agayne. About S. Laurence tyde after, to proue how he proffited, I did chose out <hi>Torquatus</hi> taulke <hi>de Amicitia,</hi> in the later end of the first booke <hi>de finib.</hi> bicause that place was, the same in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, like in wordes and phrases, nigh to the forme and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of sentences, as he had learned before in <hi>de Amicitia.</hi> I did translate it my selfe into plaine English, and gaue it him to turne into Latin: Which he did, so choislie, so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, so without any great misse in the hardest pointes of Grammer, that some, in seuen yeare in Grammer scholes, yea, &amp; some in the Uniuersities to, can not do halfe so well. This worthie yong Ientleman, to my greatest grief, to the great lamentation of that whole house, and speciallie to that most noble Ladie, now Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her selfe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted within few dayes, out of this world.</p>
            <p>And if in any cause, a man may without offence of God speake somewhat vngodlie, surely, it was some grief vnto me, to see him hie so hastlie to God, as he did. A Court, full of soch yong Ientlemen, were rather a Paradise than a Court vpon earth. And though I had neuer Poeticall head, to make any verse, in any tong, yet either loue, or sorow, or both, did wring out of me than, certaine carefull thoughtes of my good will towardes him, which in my murning for him, fell forth, more by chance, than either by skill of vse, into this kinde of misorderlie meter.</p>

               <p>Ye perceiue, how <hi>Plinie</hi> teacheth, that by this exercise of double translating, is learned, easely, sensiblie, by litle and litle, not onelie all the hard congruities of Grammer, the choice of aptest wordes, the right framing of wordes and sentences, cumlines of figures and formes, sitte for euerie matter, and proper for euerie tong, but that which is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter also, in marking dayly, and folowing diligentlie thus, the steppes of the best Autors, like inuention of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, like order in disposition, like vtterance in Elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is easelie gathered vp: whereby your scholer shall be brought not onelie to like eloquence, but also, to all trewe vnderstanding and right iudgement, both for writing and speaking. And where <hi>Dionys. Halicarnassaeus</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten two excellent bookes, the one, <hi>de delectu optimorum ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum,</hi> the which, I feare, is lost, the other, of the right fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of wordes and sentences, which doth remaine yet in Greeke, to the great proffet of all them, that trewlie studie for eloquence, yet this waie of double translating, shall bring the whole proffet of both these bookes to a dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and that easelie and pleasantlie, both for fitte choice of wordes, and apt composition of sentences. And by theis au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and reasons am I moued to thinke, this waie of double translating, either onelie or chieflie, to be fittest, for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4597:42"/>
the spedy and perfit atteyning of any tong. And for spedy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning, I durst venture a good wager, if a scholer, in whom is aptnes, loue, diligence, &amp; constancie, would but translate, after this sorte, one litle booke in <hi>Tullie,</hi> as <hi>de senectute,</hi> with two Epistles, the first <hi>ad Q. fra:</hi> the other <hi>adlentulum,</hi> the last saue one, in the first booke, that scholer, I say, should cum to a better knowledge in the Latin tong, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most part do, that spend foure or fiue yeares, in tossing all the rules of Grammer in common scholes. In déede this one booke with these two Epistles, is not sufficient to affourde all Latin wordes (which is not necessarie for a yong scholer to know) but it is able to furnishe him fully, for all pointes of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, with the right placing ordering, &amp; vse of wordes in all kinde of matter. And why not? for it is read, that <hi>Dion. Prussaeus,</hi> that wise Philosopher, &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t orator of all his tyme, did cum to the great learning &amp; vtterance that was in him, by reading and folowing onelie two bookes, <hi>Phaedon Platonis,</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes</hi> most notable oration <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And a better, and nerer example herein, may be, our most noble Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who neuer toke yet, Gréeke nor Latin Grammer in her hand, after the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of a nowne and a verbe, but onely by this double translating of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Isocrates</hi> dailie without missing euerie forenone, and likewise som part of <hi>Tullie</hi> euery afternone, for the space of a yeare or two, hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned to soch a perfite vnderstanding in both the tonges, and to soch a readie vtterance of the latin, and that wyth soch a iudgement, as they be fewe in nomber in both the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersities, or els where in England, that be, in both tonges, comparable with her Maiestie. And to conclude in a short rowme, the commodities of double translation, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the mynde by dailie marking, first, the cause and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: than, the wordes and phrases: next, the order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: after the reason and argumentes: than the formes and figures of both the tonges: lastelie, the measure and compas of euerie sentence, must nedes, by litle and litle

               <p>He also councelleth all scholers to beware of <hi>Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> except it be, from worse to better, from rude and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to proper and pure latin, and yet no man to exercise that neyther, except soch one, as is alreadie furnished with plentie of learning, and grounded with stedfast iudgement before.</p>
               <p>All theis faultes, that thus manie wise men do finde with the exercise of <hi>Paraphrasis,</hi> in turning the best latin, into other, as good as they can, that is, ye may be sure, into a great deale worse, than it was, both in right choice for proprietie, and trewe placing, for good order is committed also commonlie in all common scholes, by the scholema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, in tossing and trobling yong wittes (as I sayd in the beginning) with that boocherlie feare in making of Latins.</p>
               <p>Therefore, in place, of Latines for yong scholers, and of <hi>Paraphrasis</hi> for the masters, I wold haue double translation specially vsed. For, in double translating a perfite péece of <hi>Tullie</hi> or <hi>Caesar,</hi> neyther the scholer in learning, nor y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in teaching can erre. A true tochstone, a sure met wand lieth before both their eyes. For, all right co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gruitie: proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of wordes: order in sentences: the right imitation, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent good matter, to dispose it in good order, to confirme it with good reason, to expresse any purpose fitlie and orderlie, is learned thus, both easelie &amp; perfitlie: Yea, to misse som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme in this kinde of translation, bringeth more proffet, than to hit right, either in <hi>Paraphrasi</hi> or making of Latins. For though ye say well, in a latin making, or in a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasis,</hi> yet you being but in doute, and vncertayne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye saie well or no, ye gather and lay vp in memorie, no sure frute of learning thereby: But if ye fault in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, ye ar easelie taught, how perfitlie to amende it, and so well warned, how after to exchew, all soch faultes againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paraphrasis</hi> therefore, by myne opinion, is not méete for Grammer scholes: nor yet verie fitte for yong men in the

               <p>There is a kinde of <hi>Paraphrasis,</hi> which may be vsed, without all hurt, to moch proffet: but it serueth onely the Greke and not the latin, nor no other tong, as, to alter <hi>lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guam Ionicam aut Doricam</hi> into <hi>meraui Atticam:</hi> A notable example there is left vnto vs by a notable learned man <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony: Halicarn:</hi> who, in his booke, <gap reason="foreign">

A man, that is exercised in reading, <hi>Thucydides, Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> in vsing to turne, like places of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> after like sorte, shold shortlie cum to soch a knowledge, in vnderstanding, speaking, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Gréeke tong, as fewe or none hath yet atteyned in England. The like exercise out of <hi>Dorica lingua</hi> may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vsed, if a man take that little booke of <hi>Plato, Timaeus Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crus, De Animo et natura,</hi> which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Dorice,</hi> and turne it into soch Gréeke, as <hi>Plato</hi> vseth in other workes. The booke, is but two leaues: and the labor wold be, but two wéekes: but surelie the proffet, for easie vnderstanding, and trewe writing the Greeke tonge, wold conteruaile wyth the toile, that som men taketh, in otherwise coldlie reading that tonge, two yeares.</p>
               <p>And yet, for the latin tonge, and for the exercise of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasis,</hi> in those places of lan, that can not be bettered, if som yong man, excellent of witte, corragious in will, lustie of nature, and desirous to contend euen with the best latin, to better it, if he can, surelie I commend his forwardnesse, and for his better instruction therein, I will set before him, as notable an example of <hi>Paraphrasis,</hi> as is in Record of learning. <hi>Cicero</hi> him selfe, doth contend, in two sondrie places, to expresse one matter, with diuerse wordes: and that is <hi>Paraphrasis,</hi> saith <hi>Quintilian.</hi> The matter I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is taken out of <hi>Panaetius:</hi> and therefore being transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>To compare <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> together, two wonders of nature and arte for witte and eloquence, is most pleasant and profitable, for a man of ripe iudgement. <hi>Platos</hi> turning of <hi>Homer</hi> in this place, doth not ride a loft in Poeticall termes, but goeth low and soft on foote, as prose and <hi>Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris oratio</hi> should do.

               <p>And bicause I euer thought examples to be the best kinde of teaching, I will recite a golden sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce out of that Poete, which is next vnto <hi>Homer,</hi> not onelie in tyme, but also in worthines: which hath bene a paterne for many worthie wittes to follow, by this kind of <hi>Metaphrasis,</hi> but I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my selfe, with foure workemen, two in <hi>Greke,</hi> and two in <hi>Latin,</hi> soch, as in both the tonges, wiser &amp; worthier, can not be looked for.

            <div type="part">
               <head>Epitome.</head>
               <p>This is a way of studie, belonging, rather to matter, than to wordes: to memorie, than to vtterance: to those that be learned alreadie, and hath small place at all amonges yong scholers in Grammer scholes. It may proffet priuately some learned men, but it hath hurt generallie learning it selfe, very moch. For by it haue we lost whole <hi>Trogus,</hi> the best part of <hi>T. Liuius,</hi> the goodlie Dictionarie of <hi>Pompeius festus,</hi> a great deale of the Ciuill lawe, and other many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table bookes, for the which cause, I do the more mislike this exercise, both in old and yong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epitome,</hi> is good priuatelie for himselfe that doth worke it, but ill commonlie for all other that vse other mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor therein: a silie poore kinde of studie, not vnlike to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those poore folke, which neyther till, nor sowe, nor reape themselues, but gleane by stelth, vpon other mens growndes. Soch, haue emptie barnes, for deare yeares.</p>
               <p>Grammer scholes haue fewe <hi>Epitomes</hi> to hurt them, except <hi>Epitheta Textoris,</hi> and such beggarlie gatheringes, as <hi>Horman, whittington,</hi> and other like vulgares for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of latines: yea I do wishe, that all rules for yong scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, were shorter than they be. For without doute, <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matica</hi> it selfe, is sooner and surer learned by examples of good authors, than by the naked rewles of <hi>Grammarians. Epitome</hi> hurteth more, in the vniuersities and studie of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4597:50"/>
but most of all, in diuinitie it selfe.</p>
               <p>In déede bookes of common places be verie necessarie, to induce a man, into an orderlie generall knowledge, how to referre orderlie all that he readeth, <hi>ad certa rerum Capita,</hi> and not wander in studie. And to that end did <hi>P. Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> the master of sentences and <hi>Ph. Melancthon</hi> in our daies, write two notable bookes of common places.</p>
               <p>But to dwell in <hi>Epitomes</hi> and bookes of common places, and not to binde himselfe dailie by orderlie studie, to reade with all diligence, principallie the holyest scripture and withall, the best Doctors, and so to learne to make trewe difference betwixt, the authoritie of the one, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the other, maketh so many séeming, and sonburnt ministers as we haue, whose learning is gotten in a som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer heat, and washed away, with a Christmas snow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: who neuerthelesse, are lesse to be blamed, than those blind bussardes, who in late yeares, of wilfull malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, would neyther learne themselues, nor could teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, any thing at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paraphrasis</hi> hath done lesse hurt to learning, than <hi>Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me:</hi> for no <hi>Paraphrasis,</hi> though there be many, shall neuer take away <hi>Dauids</hi> Psalter. <hi>Erasmus Paraphrasis</hi> being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so good, shall neuer banishe the new Testament. And in an other schole, the <hi>Paraphrasis</hi> of <hi>Brocardus,</hi> or <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucus,</hi> shal neuer take <hi>Aristotles</hi> Rhetoricke, nor <hi>Horace de Arte Poetica,</hi> out of learned mens handes.</p>
               <p>But, as concerning a schole <hi>Epitome,</hi> he that wold haue an example of it, let him read <hi>Lucian</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is the verie <hi>Epitome</hi> of <hi>Isocrates</hi> oration <hi>de laudibus Helenae,</hi> whereby he may learne, at the least, this wise lesson, that a man ought to beware, to be ouer bold, in altering an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent mans worke.</p>
               <p>Neuertheles, some kinde of <hi>Epitome</hi> may be vsed, by men of skilful iudgement, to the great proffet also of others. As if a wise man would take <hi>Halles</hi> Cronicle, where moch good matter is quite marde with Indenture Englishe, and
<pb facs="tcp:4597:51"/>
first change, strange and inkhorne tearmes into proper, and commonlie vsed wordes: next, specially to wede out that, that is superfluous and idle, not onelie where wordes be vainlie heaped one vpon an other, but also where many sentences, of one meaning, be so clowted vp together as though <hi>M. Hall</hi> had bene, not writing the storie of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but varying a sentence in Hitching schole: surelie a wise learned man, by this way of <hi>Epitome,</hi> in cutting away wordes and sentences, and diminishing nothing at all of the matter, shold leaue to mens vse, a storie, halfe as moch as it was in quantitie, but twise as good as it was, both for pleasure and also commoditie.</p>
               <p>An other kinde of <hi>Epitome</hi> may be vsed likewise very well, to moch proffet. Som man either by lustines of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or brought by ill teaching, to a wrong iudgement, is ouer full of words, se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tences, &amp; matter, &amp; yet all his words be proper, apt &amp; well chosen: all his sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces be rownd &amp; trimlie framed: his whole matter grownded vpon good reason, &amp; stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with full argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, for his intent &amp; purpose. Yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his talke shalbe heard, or his writing be red, of soch one, as is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my two dearest frendes, <hi>M. Haddon</hi> at home, or <hi>Iohn Sturmius</hi> in Germanie, that <hi>Nimium</hi> in him, which fooles and vnlearned will most commend, shall eyther of thies two, bite his lippe, or shake his heade at it.</p>
               <p>This fulnes as it is not to be misliked in a yong man, so in farder aige, in greater skill, and weightier affaires, it is to be temperated, or else discretion and iudgement shall seeme to be wanting in him. But if his stile be still ouer rancke and lustie, as some men being neuer so old and spent by yeares, will still be full of youthfull conditions as was Syr <hi>F. Bryan,</hi> and euermore wold haue bene: soch a rancke and full writer, must vse, if he will do wiselie the exercise of a verie good kinde of <hi>Epitome,</hi> and do, as certaine wise men do, that be ouer fat and fleshie: who leauing their owne full and plentifull table, go to soiorne abrode from home for a while, at the temperate diet of some sober man: and so
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4597:51"/>
by litle and litle, cut away the grosnesse that is in them. As for an example: If <hi>Osorius</hi> would leaue of his lustines in striuing against <hi>S. Austen,</hi> and his ouer rancke rayling against poore <hi>Luther,</hi> and the troth of Gods doctrine, and giue his whole studie, not to write any thing of his owne for a while, but to tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slate <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> with so straite, fast, &amp; temperate a style in latine, as he is in Gréeke, he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cume so perfit &amp; pure a writer, I beleue, as hath bene fewe or none sence <hi>Ciceroes</hi> dayes: And so, by doing himself and all learned moch good, do others lesse harme, &amp; Christes doctrine lesse iniury, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth: &amp; with all, wyn vnto himselfe many worthy frends, who agreing with him gladly, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of excellent learning, are sorie to see so worthie a witte, so rare eloquence, wholie spent and consumed, in striuing with God and good men.</p>
               <p>Emonges the rest, no man doth lament him more than I, not onelie for the excellent learning that I sée in him, but also bicause there hath passed priuatelie betwixt him and me, sure tokens of moch good will, and frendlie opinion, the one toward the other. And surelie the distance betwixt London and Lysbon, should not stoppe, any kinde of frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie dewtie, that I could, eyther shew to him, or do to his, if the greatest matter of all did not in certeyne pointes, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our myndes.</p>
               <p>And yet for my parte, both toward him, and diuerse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers here at home, for like cause of excellent learning, great wisdome, and gentle humanitie, which I haue séene in them, and felt at their handes my selfe, where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of difference is mere conscience in a quiet minde inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and not contentious malice with spitefull rayling open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, I can be content to follow this rewle, in misliking some one thing not to hate for anie thing els.</p>
               <p>But as for all the bloodie beastes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 80.</note> as that fat Boore of the wood: or those brauling Bulles of Basan: or any lurking <hi>Dormus,</hi> blinde, not by nature, but by malice, &amp; as may be gathered of their owne tstimonie, giuen ouer to blindnes,
<pb facs="tcp:4597:52"/>
for giuing ouer God &amp; his word: or soch as be so lustie run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negates, as first, runne from God &amp; his trew doctrine, than, from their Lordes, Masters, &amp; all dewtie, next fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues &amp; out of their wittes, lastly from their Prince, contrey, &amp; all dew allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whether they ought rather to be pitied of good men, for their miserie, or contemned of wise men, for their malicious folie, let good and wise men determine.</p>
               <p>And to returne to <hi>Epitome</hi> agayne, some will iudge moch boldnes in me, thus to iudge of <hi>Osorius</hi> style: but wise men do know, that meane lookers on, may trewelie say, for a well made Pictture: This face had bene more cumlie, if that hie redde in the chéeke, were somwhat more pure sanguin than it is: and yet the stander by, can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it himselfe by any way.</p>
               <p>And this is not written to the dispraise but to the great commendation of <hi>Osorius,</hi> because <hi>Tullie</hi> himselfe had the same fulnes in him: and therefore went to <hi>Rodes</hi> to cut it away: and saith himselfe, <hi>recepi me domum prope mutatus, nam quasi referuer at iam oratio.</hi> Which was brought to passe I beleue, not onelie by the teaching of <hi>Molo Appollonius</hi> but also by a good way of <hi>Epitome,</hi> in binding him selfe to translate <hi>meros A<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ticos Oratores,</hi> and so to bring his style, from all lowse grosnesse, to soch firme fastnes in latin, as is in <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in Greeke. And this to be most trew, may easelie be gathered, not onelie of <hi>L. Crassus</hi> talke in 1. <hi>de Or.</hi> but speciallie of <hi>Ciceroes</hi> owne déede in translating <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Aeschines</hi> orations <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ende and purpose.</p>
               <p>And although a man growndlie learned all readie, may take moch proffet him selfe in vsing, by <hi>Epitome,</hi> to draw other mens workes for his owne memorie sake, into shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rowme, as <hi>Conterus</hi> hath done verie well the whole <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> of <hi>Ouid,</hi> &amp; <hi>Dauid Cythraeus</hi> a great deale better, their. Muses of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Melanchthon</hi> in myne opinion, far best of all, the whole storie of Time, not onelie to his owne vse, but to other mens proffet and hys
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4597:52"/>
great prayse, yet, <hi>Epitome</hi> is most necessarie of all in a mans owne writing, as we learne of that noble Poet <hi>Virgill,</hi> who, if <hi>Donatus</hi> say trewe, in writing that perfite worke of the <hi>Georgickes,</hi> vsed dailie, whan he had written 40. or 50. verses, not to cease cutting, paring, and pollishing of them, till he had brought them to the nomber of x. or xy.</p>
               <p>And this exercise, is not more nedefullie done in a great worke, than wiselie done, in your common dailie writing, either of letter, or other thing else, that is to say, to peruse diligentlie, and sée and spie wiselie, what is alwaies more then nedeth: For, twenty to one, offend more, in writing to moch, than to litle: euen as twentie to one, fall into sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, rather by ouer moch fulnes, than by anie lacke or emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse. And therefore is he alwaies the best English Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that best can geue a purgation, that is, by way of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome,</hi> to cut all ouer much away. And surelie mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, be not more full of ill humors, than commonlie mens myndes (if they be yong, lustie, proude, like and loue them selues well, as most men do) be full of fansies, opinions, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and faultes, not onelie in inward inuention, but also in all their vtterance, either by pen or taulke.</p>
               <p>And of all other men, euen those that haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inuentiuest heades, for all purposes, and roundest tonges in all matters and places (except they learne and vse this good lesson of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome</hi>) commit commonlie greater faultes, than dull, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing silent men do. For, quicke inuentors, and faire readie speakers, being boldned with their present habilitie to say more, and perchance better to, at the soden for that present, than any other can do, vse lesse helpe of diligence and studie than they ought to do: and so haue in them commonlie, lesse learning, and weaker iudgement, for all déepe considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than some duller heades, and slower tonges haue.</p>
               <p>And therefore, readie speakers, generallie be not the best, playnest, and wisest writers, nor yet the déepest iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in weightie affaires, bicause they do not tarry to weye and iudge all thinges, as they should: but hauing their
<pb facs="tcp:4597:53"/>
heades ouer full of matter, be like pennes ouer full of incke, which will soner blotte, than make any faire letter at all. Tyme was, whan I had experience of two Ambassadors in one place, the one of a hote head to inuent, and of a hastie hand to write, the other, colde and stayd in both: but what difference of their doinges was made by wise men, is not vnknowne to some persons. The Bishop of Winchester <hi>Steph: Gardiner</hi> had a quicke head, and a readie tong, and yet was not the best writer in England. <hi>Cicero</hi> in <hi>Brutus</hi> doth wiselie note the same in <hi>Serg: Galbo,</hi> and <hi>Q. Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> who were both, hote, lustie, and plaine speakers, but colde, lowse, and rough writers: And <hi>Tullie</hi> telleth the cause why, saying, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they spake, their tong was naturally cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with full tyde &amp; wynde of their witte: whan they wrote their head was solitarie, dull, and caulme, and so their style was blonte, and their writing colde: <hi>Quod vitium,</hi> sayth <hi>Cicero, peringeniosis hominibus ne<expan>

               <p>
                  <hi>Imitation,</hi> is a facultie to expresse liuelie and perfitelie that example: which ye go about to folow. And of it selfe, it is large and wide: for all the workes of nature, in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be examples for arte to folow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:4597:53"/>But to our purpose, all languages, both learned and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tonges, be gotten, and gotten onelie by <hi>Imitation.</hi> For as ye vse to heare, so ye learne to speake: if ye heare no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ye speake not your selfe: and whome ye onelie heare, of them ye onelie learne.</p>
               <p>And therefore, if ye would speake as the best and wisest do, ye must be conuersant, where the best and wisest are: but if yow be borne or brought vp in a rude contrie, ye shall not chose but speake rudelie: the rudest man of all knoweth this to be trewe.</p>
               <p>Yet neuerthelesse, the rudenes of common and mother tonges, is no bar for wise speaking. For in the rudest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and most barbarous mother language, many be found can speake verie wiselie: but in the Gréeke and latin tong, the two onelie learned tonges, which be kept, not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon taulke, but in priuate bookes, we finde alwayes, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and eloquence, good matter and good vtterance, neuer or seldom a sonder. For all soch Authors, as be fullest of good matter and right iudgement in doctrine, be likewise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, most proper in wordes, most apte in sentence, most plaine and pure in vttering the same.</p>
               <p>And contrariwise, in those two tonges, all writers, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Religion, or any sect of Philosophie, who so euer be founde fonde in iudgement of matter, be commonlie found as rude in vttering their mynde. For Stoickes, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes, and Friers: with Epicures, Libertines and Monkes, being most like in learning and life, are no fonder and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious in their opinions, than they be rude and barbarous in their writinges. They be not wise, therefore that say, what care I for a mans wordes and vtterance, if his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and reasons be good. Soch men, say so, not so moch of ignorance, as eyther of some singular pride in themselues, or some speciall malice of other, or for some priuate &amp; perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all matter, either in Religion or other kinde of learning. For good and choice meates, be no more requisite for helthie bodies, than proper and apte wordes be for good matters,
<pb facs="tcp:4597:54"/>
and also plaine and sensible vtterance for the best and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest reasons: in which two pointes standeth perfite elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, one of the fairest and rarest giftes that God doth geue to man.</p>
               <p>Ye know not, what hurt ye do to learning, that care not for wordes, but for matter, and so make a deuorse betwixt the tong and the hart. For marke all aiges: looke vpon the whole course of both the Gréeke and Latin tonge, and ye shall surelie finde, that, whan apte and good wordes began to be neglected, and properties of those two tonges to be confounded, than also began, ill deedes to spring: strange maners to oppresse good orders, newe and fond opinions to striue with olde and trewe doctrine, first in Philosophie: and after in Religion: right iudgement of all thinges to be peruerted, and so vertue with learning is contemned, and studie left of: of ill thoughtes cummeth peruerse iudgement: of ill déedes springeth lewde taulke. Which fower misor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as they mar mans life, so destroy they good learning withall.</p>
               <p>But behold the goodnesse of Gods prouidence for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: all olde authors and sectes of Philosophy, which were fondest in opinion, and rudest in vtterance, as Stoickes and Epicures, first contemned of wise men, and after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of all men, be so consumed by tymes, as they be now, not onelie out of vse, but also out of memorie of man: which thing, I surelie thinke, will shortlie chance, to the whole doctrine and all the bookes of phantasticall Anabaptistes and Friers, and of the beastlie Libertines and Monkes.</p>
               <p>Againe behold on the other side, how Gods wisdome hath wrought, that of <hi>Academici</hi> and <hi>Peripatetici,</hi> those that were wisest in iudgement of matters, and purest in vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their myndes, the first and chiefest, that wrote most and best, in either tong, as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> in Gréeke, <hi>Tullie</hi> in Latin, be so either wholie, or sufficiently left vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to vs, as I neuer knew yet scholer, that gaue himselfe to like, and loue, and folow chieflie those three Authors but he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4597:54"/>
proued, both learned, wise, and also an honest man, if he ioyned with all the trewe doctrine of Gods holie Bible, without the which, the other thrée, be but fine edge tooles in a fole or mad mans hand.</p>
               <p>But to returne to <hi>Imitation</hi> agayne: There be three kindes of it in matters of learning.</p>
               <p>The whole doctrine of Comedies and Tragedies, is a perfite <hi>imitation,</hi> or faire liuelie painted picture of the life of euerie degrée of man. Of this <hi>Imitation</hi> writeth <hi>Plato</hi> at large in 3. <hi>de Rep</hi> but it doth not moch belong at this time to our purpose.</p>
               <p>The second kind of <hi>Imitation,</hi> is to folow for learning of tonges and sciences, the best authors. Here riseth, emonges proude and enuious wittes, a great controuersie, whether, one or many are to be folowed: and if one, who is that one: <hi>Seneca,</hi> or <hi>Cicero: Salust</hi> or <hi>Caesar,</hi> and so forth in Gréeke and Latin.</p>
               <p>The third kinde of <hi>Imitation,</hi> belongeth to the second: as when you be determined, whether ye will folow one or mo, to know perfitlie, and which way to folow that one: in what place: by what meane and order: by what tooles and instrumentes ye shall do it, by what skill and iudgement, ye shall trewelie discerne, whether ye folow rightlie or no.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Imitatio,</hi> is <hi>dissimilis materei similis tractatio:</hi> and also, <hi>similis materei dissimilis tractatio,</hi> as <hi>Virgill</hi> folowed <hi>Homer:</hi> but the Argument to the one was <hi>Vlvsles,</hi> to the other <hi>Aeneas. Tullie</hi> persecuted <hi>Antonie</hi> with the same wepons of eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that <hi>Demostheues</hi> vsed before against <hi>Philippe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horace</hi> foloweth <hi>Pindar,</hi> but either of them his owne Argument and Person: as the one, <hi>Hiero</hi> king of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> the other <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperor: and yet both for like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes, that is, for their coragious stoutnes in warre, and iust gouernment in peace.</p>
               <p>One of the best examples, for right <hi>Imitation</hi> we lacke, and that is <hi>Menander,</hi> whom our <hi>Terence,</hi> (as the matter
<pb facs="tcp:4597:55"/>
required) in like argument, in the same Persons, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall eloquence, foote by foote did folow.</p>
               <p>Som péeces remaine, like broken Iewelles, whereby men may rightlie esteme, and iustlie lament, the losse of the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Erasmus,</hi> the ornament of learning, in our tyme, doth wish that som man of learning and diligence, would take the like paines in <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Tullie,</hi> that <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> hath done in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgill,</hi> that is, to write out and ioyne together, where the one doth imitate the other. <hi>Erasmus,</hi> wishe is good, but surelie, it is not good enough: for <hi>Macrobius</hi> gatherings for the <hi>Aeneodos</hi> out of <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Eobanus Hessus</hi> more diligent gatherings for the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colikes</hi> out of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> as they be not fullie taken out of the whole heape, as they should be, but euen as though they had not sought for them of purpose, but fownd them scatered here and there by chance in their way, euen so, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to point out, and nakedlie to ioyne togither their senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with no farder declaring the maner and way, how the one doth folow the other, were but a colde helpe, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of learning.</p>
               <p>But if a man would take this paine also, whan he hath layd two places, of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgill,</hi> or of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Tullie</hi> togither, to teach plainlie withall, after this sort.

                  </list>
In thies fewe rude English wordes, are
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4597:55"/>
wrapt vp all the necessarie tooles and instrumentes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with trewe <hi>Imitation</hi> is rightlie wrought withall in any tonge. Which tooles, I openlie confesse, be not of myne owne forging, but partlie left vnto me by the cunnigest Master, and one of the worthiest Ientlemen that euer Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land bred, Syr <hi>Iohn Cheke:</hi> partelie borowed by me out of the shoppe of the dearest frende I haue out of England, <hi>Io. St.</hi> And therefore I am the bolder to borow of him, and here to leaue them to other, and namelie to my Children: which tooles, if it please God, that an other day, they may be able to vse rightlie, as I do with and daylie pray, they may do, I shal be more glad, than if I were able to leaue them a great quantitie of land.</p>
               <p>This foresaide order and doctrine of <hi>Imitation,</hi> would bring forth more learning, and bréed vp trewer iudgement, than any other exercise that can be vsed, but not for yong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, bicause they shall not be able to consider dulie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And trewelie, it may be a shame to good studentes who hauing so faire examples to folow, as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Tullie,</hi> do not vse so wise wayes in folowing them for the obteyning of wisdome and learning, as rude ignorant Artificers do, for gayning a small commoditie. For surelie the meanest pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vseth more witte, better arte, greater diligence, in hys shoppe, in folowing the Picture of any meane mans face, than commonlie the best studentes do, euen in the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, for the atteining of learning it selfe.</p>
               <p>Some ignorant, vnlearned, and idle student: or some busie looker vpon this litle poore booke, that hath neither will to do good him selfe, nor skill to iudge right of others, but can lustelie contemne, by pride and ignorance, all painfull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and right order in study, will perchance say, that I am to precise, to curious, in marking and piteling thus about the imitation of others: and that the old worthie Authors did neuer busie their heades and wittes, in folowyng so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciselie, either the matter what other men wrote, or els the maner how other men wrote. They will say, it were a
<pb facs="tcp:4597:56"/>
plaine slauerie, &amp; iniurie to, to shakkle and tye a good witte, and hinder the course of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s good nature with such bondes of seruitude, in folowyng other.</p>
               <p>Except soch men thinke them selues wiser then <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> for teaching of eloquence, they must be content to turne a new leafe.</p>
               <p>The best booke that euer <hi>Tullie</hi> wrote, by all mens iudgement, and by his owne testimonie to, in writyng wherof, he employed most care, studie, learnyng and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is his booke <hi>de Orat. ad Q. F.</hi> Now let vs sée, what he did for the matter, and also for the maner of writing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For the whole booke consisteth in these two pointes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: In good matter, and good handling of the matter. And first, for the matter, it is whole <hi>Aristotles,</hi> what so euer <hi>Antonie</hi> in the second, and <hi>Crassus</hi> in the third doth teach. Trust not me, but beleue <hi>Tullie</hi> him selfe, who writeth so, first, in that goodlie long Epistle <hi>ad P. Lentulum,</hi> and after in diuerse places <hi>ad Atticum.</hi> And in the verie booke it selfe, <hi>Tullie</hi> will not haue it hidden, but both <hi>Catulus</hi> and <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> do oft and pleasantly lay that stelth to <hi>Antonius</hi> charge. Now, for the handling of the matter, was <hi>Tullie</hi> so precise and curious rather to follow an other mans Paterne, than to inuent some new shape him selfe, namelie in that booke, wherin he purposed, to leaue to posteritie, the glorie of his witte? yea forsoth, that he did. And this is not my gessing
and gathering, nor onelie performed by <hi>Tullie</hi> in verie déed, but vttered also by <hi>Tullie</hi> in plaine wordes: to teach other men thereby, what they should do, in taking like matter in hand.</p>
               <p>And that which is specially to be marked, <hi>Tullie</hi> doth vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plainlie his conceit and purpose therein, by the mouth of the wisest man in all that companie: for sayth <hi>Scaeuola</hi> him selfe, <hi>Cur non imitamur, Crasse, Socratemillum, qui est in Phaedro Platonis &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And furder to vnderstand, that <hi>Tullie</hi> did not <hi>obiter</hi> and bichance, but purposelie and mindfullie bend him selfe to a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4597:56"/>
precise and curious Imitation of <hi>Plato,</hi> concernyng the shape and forme of those bookes, marke I pray you, how cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Tullie</hi> is to vtter his purpose and doyng therein, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thus to <hi>Atticus.</hi>

And although <hi>Sturmius</hi> herein doth farre passe all other, yet hath he not so fullie and perfitelie done it, as I do wishe he had, and as I know he could.

He addeth also examples, the best kinde of teaching: wherein he doth well, but not well enough: in déede, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no faulte, but yet, deserueth small praise. He is content with the meane, and followeth not the best: as a man, that would féede vpon Acornes, whan he may eate, as good cheape, the finest wheat bread. He teacheth for example, where and how, two or thrée late <hi>Italian</hi> Poetes do follow <hi>Virgil:</hi> and how <hi>Virgil</hi> him selfe in the storie of <hi>Dido,</hi> doth wholie Imitate <hi>Catullus</hi> in the like matter of <hi>Adriadna:</hi> Wherein I like better his diligence and order of teaching, than his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in choice of examples for <hi>Imitation.</hi> But, if he had done thus: if he had declared where and how, how oft and how many wayes <hi>Virgil</hi> doth folow <hi>Homer,</hi> as for example the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of <hi>Vlysses</hi> to <hi>Alcynous</hi> and <hi>Calypso,</hi>

               <p>If <hi>Riccius</hi> had taken for his exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, where <hi>Tullie</hi> him selfe foloweth either <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> he had shot than at the right marke. But to excuse <hi>Riccius,</hi> somwhat,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4597:58"/>
though I can not fullie defend him, it may be sayd, his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was, to teach onelie the Latin tong, when thys way that I do wish, to ioyne <hi>Virgil</hi> with <hi>Homer,</hi> to read <hi>Tullie</hi> with <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> requireth a cunning and perfite Master in both the tonges. It is my wish in déede, and that by good reason: For who so euer will write well of any matter, must labor to expresse that, that is perfite, and not to stay and content himselfe with the meane: yea, I say farder, though it be not vnposible, yet it is verie rare, and meruelous hard, to proue excellent in the Latin tong, for him that is not also well séene in the Gréeke tong. <hi>Tullie</hi> him selfe, most excellent of nature, most diligent in labor, brought vp from his cradle, in that palce, and in that tyme, where and whan the Latin tong most florished naturallie in euery mans mouth, yet was not his owne tong able it selfe to make him so cunning in his owne tong, as he was in déede: but the knowledge and <hi>Imitation</hi> of the Gréeke tong withall.</p>
               <p>This he confesseth himselfe: this he vttereth in many places, as those can tell best, that vse to read him most.</p>
               <p>Therefore thou, that shotest at perfection in the Latin tong, thinke not thy selfe wiser than <hi>Tullie</hi> was, in choice of the way, that leadeth rightlie to the same: thinke not thy witte better than <hi>Tullies</hi> was, as though that may serue thée that was not sufficient for him. For euen as a hauke flieth not hie with one wing: euen so a man reacheth not to excellency with one tong.</p>
               <p>I haue bene a looker on in the Cokpit of learning thies many yeares: And one Cock onelie haue I knowne, which with one wing, euen at this day, doth passe all other, in myne opinion, that euer I saw in any pitte in England, though they had two winges. Yet neuerthelesse, to flie well with one wing, to runne fast with one leg, be rather, rare Maistreis moch to be merueled at, than sure examples safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be folowed. A Bushop that now liueth, a good man,
<pb facs="tcp:4597:59"/>
whose iudgement in Religion I better like, than his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in perfitnes in other learning, said once vnto me: we haue no nede now of the Gréeke tong, when all thinges be translated into Latin. But the good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnderstood not, that euen the best translation, is, for mere necessitie, but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill imped wing to flie withall, or a heuie stompe leg of wood to go withall: soch, the hier they flie, the sooner they falter and faill: the faster they runne, the ofter they stumble, and sorer they fall. Soch as will nedes so flie, may flie at a Pye, and catch a Dawe: And soch runners, as commonlie, they shoue and sholder to stand formost, yet in the end they cum behind others &amp; deserue but the hopshakles, if the Masters of the game be right iudgers.</p>

                  <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> that learned Bishop. He was a Papist in déede, but would to God, amonges all vs Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts I might once sée but one, that would winne like praise, in doing like good, for the aduauncement of learning and vertue. And yet, though he were a Papist, if any yong man, geuen to new learning (as they termed it went beyond his fellowes, in witte, labor, and towardnes, euen the same, neyther lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, open praise to encorage him, nor priuate exhibition to mainteyne hym, as worthy Syr <hi>I. Cheke,</hi> if he were aliue would beare good witnes and so can many mo. I my selfe one of the meanest of a great number, in that Colledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there appeared in me som small shew of towardnes and diligence, lacked not his fauor to forder me in learning.</p>
               <p>And being a boy, new Bacheler of arte, I chanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges my companions to speake against the Pope: which matter was than in euery mans mouth, bycause <hi>D. Haines</hi> and <hi>D. Skippe</hi> were cum from the Court, to debate the same matter, by preaching and disputation in the vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This hapned the same tyme, when I stoode to be felow there: my taulke came to <hi>D. Medcalfes</hi> eare: I was called before him and the Seniores: and after greuous rebuke, &amp; some punishment, open warning was geuen to all the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, none to be so hardie to geue me his voice at that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. And yet for all those open threates, the good father himselfe priuilie procured, that I should euen than be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen felow. But, the election being done, he made counti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of great discontentation thereat. This good mans goodnes, and fatherlie discretion, vsed towardes me that one day, shall neuer out of my remembrance all the dayes of my life. And for the same cause, haue I put it here, in this small record of learning. For next Gods prouidence, surely that day, was by that good fathers meanes, <hi>Dies natalis,</hi> to me, for the whole foundation of the poore learning I haue, and of all the furderance, that hetherto else where I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned.</p>
               <p>This his goodnes stood not still in one or two, but flowed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4597:61"/>
aboundantlie ouer all that Colledge, and brake out also to norishe good wittes in euery part of that vniuersitie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, at his departing thence, he left soch a companie of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and scholers in <hi>S. Iohnes</hi> Colledge, as can scarse be found now in som whole vniuersitie: which, either for diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, on the one side or other, or for Ciuill seruice to their Prince and contrie, haue bene, and are yet to this day, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ornaments to this whole Realme: Yea <hi>S. Iohnes</hi> did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so florish, as Trinitie college, that Princely house now, at the first erectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was but <hi>Colonia deducta</hi> out of <hi>S. Ihones,</hi> not onelie for their Master, fellowes, and scholers, but also, which is more, for their whole, both order of learning, and discipline of maners: &amp; yet to this day, it neuer tooke Master but such as was bred vp before in <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <hi>S. Iohnes</hi> stoode in this state, vntill those heuie tymes, and that greuous change that chanced. An. 1553. whan mo perfite scholers were dispersed from thence in one moneth, than many yeares can reare vp againe. For, whan <hi>Apor de Sylua</hi> had passed the seas,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 80.</note> and fastned his foote againe in England, not onely the two faire groues of learning in England were eyther cut vp, by the roote, or troden downe to the ground and wholie went to wracke, but the yong spring there, and euerie where else, was pitifullie nipt and ouertroden by very beastes, and also the fairest standers of all, were rooted vp, and cast into the fire, to the great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning euen at this day of Christes Chirch in England, both for Religion and learning.</p>
               <p>And what good could chance than to the vniuersities, whan som of the greatest, though not of the wisest nor best learned, nor best men neither of that side, did labor to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, that ignorance was better than knowledge, which they ment, not for the laitie onelie, but also for the greatest rable of their spiritualtie, what other pretense openlie so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:4597:62"/>
they made: and therefore did som of them at Cambrige (whom I will not name openlie,) cause hedge priestes fette out of the contrie, to be made fellowes in the vniuersitie: saying, in their talke priuilie, and declaring by their deedes openlie, that he was, felow good enough for their tyme, if he could were a gowne and a tipet cumlie, and haue hys crowne shorne faire and roundlie, and could turne his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse and pie readilie: which I speake not to reproue any order either of apparell, or other dewtie, that may be well and indifferentlie vsed, but to note the miserie of that time, whan the benefites prouided for learning were so fowlie misused. And what was the frute of this seade? Uerely, iudgement in doctrine was wholy altered: order in disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline very sore changed: the loue of good learning, began so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to wax cold: the knowledge of the tonges (in spite of some that therein had florished) was manifestly contemned: and so, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way of right studie purposely peruerted: the choice of good authors of mallice confownded. Olde sophistrie (I say not well) not olde, but that new rotten sophistrie began to beard and sholder logicke in her owne tong: yea, I know, that heades were cast together, and counsell deuised, that <hi>Duns,</hi> with all the rable of barbarous questionistes, should haue dispossessed of their place and rowmes, <hi>Aristotle, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Tullie,</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> when good <hi>M. Redman,</hi> and those two worthy starres of that vniuersitie, <hi>M. Cheke,</hi> and <hi>M.

Since which tyme, the yong spring hath shot vp so faire, as now there be in Cambrige againe, many goodly plantes (as did well appeare at the Quéenes Maiesties late being there) which are like to grow to mightie great timber, to the honor of learning, and great good of their-contrie, if they may stand their tyme, as the best plantes there were wont to do: and if som old dotterell trées, with standing ouer nie them, and dropping vpon them, do not either hinder, or crooke their growing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my feare is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lesse, seing so worthie a Iustice of an Oyre hath the present ouersight of that whole chace, who was himselfe somtym, in the fairest spring that euer was there of learning, one of the forwardest yong plantes, in all that worthy College of <hi>S. Ihones:</hi> who now by grace is growne to soch greatnesse as, in the temperate and quiet shade of his wisdome, next the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, and goodnes of one, in theis our daies, <hi>Religio</hi> for sinceritie, <hi>literae</hi> for order and aduauncement, <hi>Respub.</hi> for happie and quiet gouernment, haue to great reioysing of all good men, speciallie reposed them selues.</p>
               <p>Now to returne to that Question, whether one, a few, many or all, are to be folowed, my aunswere shalbe short: All, for him that is desirous to know all: yea, the worst of all, as Questionistes, and all the barbarous nation of schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, helpe for one or other consideration: But in euerie se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate kinde of learnyng and studie, by it selfe, ye must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, choselie a few, and chieflie some one, and that namelie in our schole of eloquence, either for penne or talke. And as in portiacture and paintyng wise men chose not that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that can onelie make a faire hand, or a well facioned legge but soch one, as can furnish vp fullie, all the fetures of of the whole body, of a man, woman and child: and with all is able to, by good skill, to giue to euerie one of these thrée, in their proper kinde, the right forme, the trew figure, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb facs="tcp:4597:63"/>
color, that is fit and dew, to the dignitie of a man, to the bewtie of a woman, to the swéetnes of a yong babe: euen likewise, do we séeke soch one in our schole to folow, who is able alwayes, in all matters, to teach plainlie, to delite pleasantlie, and to cary away by force of wise talke, all that shall heare or read him: and is so excellent in deed, as witte is able, or wishe can hope, to attaine vnto: And this not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to serue in the <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greke</hi> tong, but also in our own English language. But yet, bicause the prouidence of God hath left vnto vs in no other tong, saue onelie in the <hi>Greke</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tong, the trew preceptes, and perfite examples of eloquence, therefore must we séeke in the Authors onelie of those two tonges, the trew Paterne of Eloquence, if in any other mother tong we looke to attaine, either to perfit vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it our selues, or skilfull iudgement of it in others.</p>
               <p>And now to know, what Author doth medle onelie with some one péece and member of eloquence, and who doth perfitelie make vp the whole bodie, I will declare, as I can call to remembrance the goodlie talke, that I haue had oftentymes, of the trew difference of Authors, with that Ientleman of worthie memorie, my dearest frend, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of all the litle poore learning I haue, Syr <hi>Iohn Cheke.</hi>

In one, wherby he looked to wynne his spurres, and whereat many ignorant felowes fast clapped their handes, he began the <hi>Protasis</hi> with <hi>Trochaeijs Octona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rijs:</hi> which kinde of verse, as it is but seldome and rare in Tragedies, so is it neuer vsed, saue onelie in <hi>Epitasi:</hi> whan the Tragedie is hiest and hotest, and full of greatest trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

               <p>Which I thought in this place to touch onelie, not to prosecute at large, bicause, God willyng, in the <hi>Latin</hi> tong, I will fullie handle it, in my booke <hi>de Imitatione.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, to touch more particularlie, which of those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that be now most commonlie in mens handes, will some affourd you some péece of Eloquence, and what maner a péece of eloquence, and what is to be liked and folowed, and what to be misliked and eschewed in them: and how some agayne will furnish you fully withall, rightly, and wisely considered, som what I will write as I haue heard Syr <hi>Ihon Cheke</hi> many tymes say.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4597:65"/>The Latin tong, concerning any part of purenesse of it, from the spring, to the decay of the same, did not endure moch longer, than is the life of a well aged man, scarse one hundred yeares from the tyme of the last <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> and <hi>Laelius,</hi> to the Empire of <hi>Augustus.</hi> And it is notable, that <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> writeth of <hi>Tullie,</hi> how that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of eloquence did so remayne onelie in him and in his time, as before him, were few, which might moch delight a man, or after him any, worthy admiration, but soch as <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> might haue séene, and such as might haue séene <hi>Tullie.</hi> And good cause why: for no perfection is durable. Encrease hath a time, &amp; decay likewise, but all perfit ripenesse remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth but a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: as is plainly séen in fruits, plummes and cherries: but more sensibly in flowers, as Roses &amp; such like, and yet as trewlie in all greater matters. For what natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie, can go no hier, must naturallie yeld &amp; stoupe againe.</p>
               <p>Of this short tyme of any purenesse of the Latin tong, for the first fortie yeare of it, and all the tyme before, we haue no péece of learning left, saue <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> with a litle rude vnperfit pamflet of the elder <hi>Cato.</hi> And as for <hi>Plautus,</hi> except the scholemaster be able to make wise and ware choice, first in proprietie of wordes, than in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Phrases and sentences, and chieflie in choice of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie of matter, your scholer were better to play, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learne all that is in him. But surelie, if iudgement for the tong, and direction for the maners, be wisely ioyned with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent reading of <hi>Plautus,</hi> than trewlie <hi>Plautus,</hi> for that purenesse of the Latin tong in Rome, whan Rome did most florish in well doing, and so thereby, in well speaking also, is soch a plentifull storehose, for common eloquence, in meane matters, and all priuate mens affaires, as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin tong, for that respect, hath not the like agayne. Whan I remember the worthy tyme of Rome, wherein <hi>Plautus</hi> did liue, I must nedes honor the talke of that tyme, which we see <hi>Plautus</hi> doth vse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Terence</hi> is also a storehouse of the same tong, for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

tyme, following soone after, &amp; although he be not so full &amp; plentiful as <hi>Plautus</hi> is, for multitude of matters, &amp; diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of wordes, yet his wordes, be chosen so purelie, placed so orderly, and all his stuffe so néetlie packed vp, and wittely compassed in euerie place, as, by all wise mens iudgement, he is counted the cunninger workeman, and to haue his shop, for the rowme that is in it, more finely appointed, and trimlier ordered, than <hi>Plautus</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Thrée thinges chiefly, both in <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> are to be specially considered The matter, the vtterance, the words, the meter. The matter in both, is altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compasse of the meanest mens maners, and doth not stretch to any thing of any great weight at all, but standeth chiefly in vtteryng the thoughtes and conditions of hard fathers, foolish mothers, vnthrifty yong men, craftie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, sotle bawdes, and wilie harlots, and so, is moch spent, in finding out fine fetches, and packing vp pelting matters, soch as in London commonlie cum to the hearing of the Masters of Bridewell. Here is base stuffe for that scholer, that should be cum hereafter, either a good minister in Religion, or a Ciuill Ientleman in seruice of his Prince and contrie: except the preacher do know soch matters to confute them, whan ignorance surelie in all soch thinges were better for a Ciuill Ientleman, than knowlege. And thus, for matter, both <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> be like meane painters, that worke by halfes, and be cunning onelie, in making the worst part of the picture, as if one were skilfull in painting the bodie of a naked person, from the nauell downward, but nothing else.</p>
               <p>For word and speach, <hi>Plautus</hi> is more plentifull, and <hi>Terence</hi> more pure and proper: And for one respect, <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> is to be embraced aboue all that euer wrote in hys kinde of argument: Bicause it is well known, by good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde of learning, and that by <hi>Ciceroes</hi> owne witnes that some Comedies bearyng <hi>Terence</hi> name, were written by worthy <hi>Scipio,</hi> and wise <hi>Lilius,</hi> and namely <hi>Heauton:</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:4597:66"/>
                  <hi>Adelphi.</hi> And therefore as oft as I reade those Comedies, so oft doth sound in myne eare, the pure fine talke of Rome, which was vsed by the floure of the worthiest nobilitie that euer Rome bred. Let the wisest man, and best learned that liueth, read aduisedlie ouer, the first scene of <hi>Heauton,</hi> and the first scene of <hi>Adelphi,</hi> and let him consideratlie iudge, whether it is the talke of a seruile stranger borne, or rather euen that milde eloquent wise speach, which <hi>Cicero</hi> in <hi>Brutus</hi> doth so liuely expresse in <hi>Laelius.</hi> And yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, in all this good proprietie of wordes, and purenesse of phrases which be in <hi>Terence,</hi> ye must not follow him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in placing of them, bicause for the meter sake, some wordes in him, somtyme, be driuen awrie, which require a straighter placing in plaine prose, if ye will forme, as I would ye should do, your speach and writing, to that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perfitnesse, which was onely in <hi>Tullie,</hi> or onelie in <hi>Tullies</hi> tyme.</p>

                     <hi>Meter in Plautus &amp; Terence.</hi>
                  </note>The meter and verse of <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> be verie meane, and not to be followed: which is not their reproch, but the fault of the tyme, wherein they wrote, whan no kinde of Poetrie, in the Latin tong, was brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as doth well appeare in the fragmentes of <hi>Ennius, Cerilius,</hi> and others, and euidenlie in <hi>Plautus</hi> &amp; <hi>Terence,</hi> if thies in Latin be compared with right skil, with <hi>Homer, Euripides, Aristophanes,</hi> and other in Gréeke of like sort <hi>Cicero</hi> him selfe doth complaine of this vnperfitnes, but more plainly <hi>Quintilian,</hi> saying, <hi>in Comaedia maximè clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamus, et vix leuem consequimur vmbram:</hi> and most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly of all <hi>Horace in Arte Poetica,</hi> which he doth namely <hi>propter carmen Iambicum,</hi> and referreth all good studentes herein to the Imitation of the Gréeke tong, saying.</p>
               <q>Exemplaria Graeca nocturna versate manu, versate diurna.</q>
               <p>This matter maketh me gladly remember, my swéete tyme spent at Cambrige, and the pleasant talke which I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4597:66"/>
had oft with <hi>M. Cheke,</hi> and <hi>M. Watson,</hi> of this fault, not onely in the olde Latin Poets, but also in our new English Rymers at this day. They wished as <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> were not wedded to follow the faultes of former fathers (a shrewd mariage in greater matters) but by right <hi>Imitation</hi> of the perfit Grecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, had brought Poetrie to perfitnesse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the Latin tong, that we Englishmen likewise would acknowledge and vnderstand rightfully our rude beggerly ryming, brought first into Italie by <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Hunnes,</hi> whan all good verses and all good learning to, were destroyd by them: and after caryed into France and Germanie: and at last receyued into England by men of excellent wit in déede, but of small learning, and lesse iudgement in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>But now, when men know the difference, and haue the examples, both of the best, and of the worst, surelie, to follow rather the <hi>Gothes</hi> in Ryming, than the Gréekes in trew versifiyng, were euen to eate ackornes with swyne, when we may fréely eate wheate bread emonges men. In déede, <hi>Chauser, Th. Norton,</hi> of Bristow, my L. of Surrey, <hi>M. Wiat, Th. Phaer,</hi> and other Ientlemen, in translating <hi>Ouide, Palingenius,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> haue gone as farre to their great praise, as the copie they followed could cary them, but, if soch good wittes, and forward diligence, had bene directed to follow the best examples, and not haue bene caryed by tyme and custome, to content themselues with that barbarous and rude Ryming, emonges their other worthy praises, which they haue iustly deserued, this had not bene the least, to be counted emonges men of learning and skill, more like vnto the Grecians, than vnto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, in handling of their verse.</p>
               <p>In déed, our English tong, hauing in vse chiefly, wordes of one syllable which commonly be long, doth not well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the nature of <hi>Carmen Heroicum,</hi> bicause <hi>dastylus,</hi> the aptest foote for that verse, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teining one long &amp; two short, is seldom therefore found in English: and doth also rather
<pb facs="tcp:4597:67"/>
stumble than stand vpon <hi>Monasyllabis. Quintilian</hi> in hys learned Chapiter <hi>de Compositione,</hi> geueth this lesson <hi>de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasyllabis,</hi> before me:<note place="margin">☞</note> and in the same place doth iustlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey against all Ryming, that if there be any, who be angrie with me, for misliking of Ryming, may be angry for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to, with <hi>Quintilian</hi> also, for the same thing: And yet <hi>Quintilian</hi> had not so iust cause to mislike of it than, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue at this day.</p>
               <p>And although <hi>Carmen Exametrum</hi> doth rather trotte and hoble, than runne smothly in our English tong, yet I am sure, our English tong will receiue <hi>carmen Iambicum</hi> as naturallie, as either <hi>Greke</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> But for ignorance, men ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not like, &amp; for idlenes, men will not labor, to cum to any perfitenes at all. For, as the worthie Poetes in <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> were more carefull to satisfie the iudgement of one learned, than rashe in pleasing the humor of a rude mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, euen so if men in England now, had the like reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend regard to learning skill and iudgement, and durst not presume to write, except they came with the like learnyng, and also did vse like diligence, in searchyng out, not onelie iust measure in euerie meter, as euerie ignorant person may easely do, but also trew quantitie in euery foote and sillable, as onelie the learned shalbe able to do, and as the <hi>Grekes</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> were wont to do, surelie than rash ignorant heads, which now can easely recken vp fourten sillabes, and easelie stumble on euery Ryme, either durst not, for lacke of such learnyng: or els would not, in auoyding such labor, be so busie,<note place="margin">☞</note> as euerie where they be: and shoppes in London should not be so full of lewd and rude rymes, as commonlie they are. But now, the ripest of tong, be readiest to write: And many dayly in setting out bookes and balettes make great shew of blossomes and buddes, in whom is neither, roote of learnyng, nor frute of wisedome at all. Some that make <hi>Chaucer</hi> in English and <hi>Petrach</hi> in <hi>Italian,</hi> their Gods in verses, and yet be not able to make trew difference, what is a fault, and what is a iust prayse, in those two wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

More</hi> was wont to do, would nedes be counted lyke vnto him.</p>
               <p>This mislikyng of Ryming, beginneth not now of any newfangle singularitie, but hath bene long misliked of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that of men, of greatest learnyng, and déepest iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And soch, that defend it, do so, either for lacke of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what is best, or els of verie enuie, that any should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that in learnyng, whereunto they, as I sayd before, either for ignorance, can not, or for idlenes will not, labor to attaine vnto.</p>
               <p>And you that prayse this Ryming, bicause ye neither haue reason, why to like it, nor can shew learning to defend it, yet I will helpe you, with the authoritie of the oldest and learnedst tyme. In <hi>Grece,</hi> whan Poetrie was euen as the hiest pitch of perfitnes, one <hi>Simmias Rhodius</hi> of a certaine singularitie wrote a booke in ryming <hi>Greke</hi> verses, naming it <gap reason="foreign">

In déede, they obserue iust number, and euen féete: but here is the fault, that their féete: be feete without ioyntes, that is to say, not distinct by trew quantitie of sillabes: And so, soch féete, be but numme féete: and be, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as vnfitte sor a verse to turne and runne roundly withall, as feete of brasse or wood be vnwéeldie to go well withall.

               <p>This I write, not to reprehend <hi>Tullie,</hi> whom, aboue all other, I like and loue best, but to excuse <hi>Terence,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in his tyme, and a good while after, Poetrie was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer perfited in Latin, vntill by trew <hi>Imitation</hi> of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, it was at length brought to perfection: And also there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to exhorte the goodlie wittes of England, which apte by nature, &amp; willing by desire, geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to Poetrie, that they, rightly vnderstanding the barbarous bringing in of Rymes, would labor, as <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> did in Latin, to make perfit also this point of learning, in our English tong.</p>
               <p>And thus much for <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> for matter, tong, and meter, what is to be followed, and what to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed in them.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> no writing remayneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Tullies</hi> tyme, except a fewe short fragmentes of <hi>L.

               <p>And although the Latin tong did faire blome and blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some in <hi>L. Craslus,</hi> and <hi>M.

               <p>And yet in the same tyme, it began to fade and stoupe, as <hi>Tullie</hi> himselfe, in <hi>Brutus de Claris Oratoribus,</hi> with wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping wordes doth witnesse.</p>
               <p>And bicause, emongs them of that tyme, there was some difference, good reason is, that of them of that tyme, should

He said, that <hi>Salust</hi> was not verie fitte for yong men, to learne out of him, the puritie of the Latin tong: because, he was not the purest in proprietie of wordes, nor choisest in aptnes of phrases, nor the best in framing of sentences: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is his writing, sayd he neyther plaine for the matter, nor sensible for mens vnderstanding. And what is the cause thereof, Syr, quoth I. Uerilie said he, bicause in <hi>Salust</hi> writing, is more Arte than nature, and more labor than Arte: and in his labor also, to moch toyle, as it were, with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4597:71"/>
an vncontented care to write better than he could, a fault common to very many men. And therefore he doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the matter liuely and naturally with common speach as ye sée <hi>Xenophon</hi> doth in Gréeke, but it is caried and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen forth artificiallie, after to learned a sorte, as <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> doth in his orations. And how cummeth it to passe, sayd I, that <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Ciceroes</hi> talke, is so naturall &amp; plaine, and <hi>Salust</hi> writing so artificiall and darke, whan all they thrée liued in one tyme? I will fréelie tell you my fansie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, said he: surely, <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> beside a singular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of naturall eloquence geuen vnto them by God, both two, by vse of life, were daylie orators emonges the common people, and greatest councellers in the Senate house: and therefore gaue themselues to vse soch speach as the meanest should well vnderstand, and the wisest best al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: folowing carefullie that good councell of <hi>Aristotle, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendum vt multi, sapiendum vt pauci. Salust</hi> was no soch man, neyther for will to goodnes, nor skill by learning: but ill geuen by nature, and made worse by bringing vp, spent the most part of his yougth very misorderly in ryot and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. In the company of soch, who, neuer geuing theyr mynde to honest doyng, could neuer inure their tong to wise speaking. But at last cummyng to better yeares, and bying witte at the dearest hand, that is, by long experience of the hurt and shame that cummeth of mischeif, moued, by the councell of them that were wise, and caried by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of soch as were good, first fell to honestie of life, and after to the loue of studie and learning: and so became so new a man, that <hi>Caesar</hi> being dictator, made him Pretor in <hi>Numidia,</hi> where he absent from his contrie, and not inured with the common talke of Rome, but shut vp in his studie, and bent wholy to reading, did write the storie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes. And for the better accomplishing of the same, he red <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Piso</hi> in Latin for gathering of matter and troth: and <hi>Thucydides</hi> in Gréeke for the order of his storie, and furnishing of his style. <hi>Cato</hi> (as his tyme required) had
<pb facs="tcp:4597:72"/>
more troth for the matter, than eloquence for the style. And so <hi>Salust,</hi> by gathering troth out of <hi>Cato,</hi> smelleth moch of the roughnes of his style: euen as a man that eateth garlike for helth, shall cary away with him the sauor of it also, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will or not.<note place="margin">
