         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HIRELING PRIESTS

            <p>
               <hi>GODS</hi> Indignation is greatly kindled againſt you, Oh!
ye ſeed of evil-doers; How can you eſcape the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Hell? How often have you perverted
the right way of the Lord? Gods ſword is drawn
againſt you, and the ſtroke of it is near to fall upon you, you
have long made your ſelves as fat Horſes, with that which you
have got by deceit and fraudelity, that your eyes hath ſtood
out with fatneſs this many years; but now the time of your cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
draws near, wherein you ſhall be fed with Judgement and
wrath from the Almighty, for the curſe ſhall enter into your
houſes, where your ill-gotten goods lieth, and ſhall deſtroy them
with the ſtones thereof, and with the timber thereof, and as
you have laid upon your beds of eaſe long, ſo ſhall you be caſt
upon the bed of endleſs torment, for your abominations hath
reached to Heaven, and hath long grieved the Moſt High, your
wilful tranſgreſſions cannot be numbred, for as troops of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
wait for a man, ſo have you murthered in the way by
conſent, for you have committed much lewdneſs, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
others to do it alſo, that would not; And how many
widows houſes have you devoured? Wo, wo, wo from the Lord
God is gone out againſt you, curſed ſhall you be when you
go forth and when you come in; Oh! how is Gods indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
kindled againſt you, ye generation of vipers, who hath
fed your ſelves and not the flock; Oh! what will you do when
the Lord requires his flock at your hands? What a ravening
and tearing in <hi>England</hi> have you made for your bellies, which is
your God, the like cannot be parallel'd by all the falſe prophets
that ever was heard or read of; Then when this would not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you, you have thirſted after blood it ſelf, therefore ſhall
your cup be filled with it, God will ſmite you with ſhame and
contempt, ſo that you ſhall become a reproach to all that fears
him; The day of the Lord ſhall come upon you as pain upon a
woman in travel; and that light within, which you have ſo
much derided and cried againſt, ſhall be kindled as a fire in your
bowels, and ſhall never be quenched till it have conſumed you
root and branch, for God will not much longer be mocked by
you. Oh! you greedy dumb dogs, who could never be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
Hell and deſtruction hath enlarged her ſelf to receive you,
becauſe you have provoked the Lord and rebelled againſt him
dayes without number, Oh! how have you cauſed his ſervants
and meſſengers to be ſhamefully intreated for declaring unto you
his truth in moſt parts of the Nation? nay, when ſome of the
Rulers would have ſhewed mercy unto them, you have provoked
them to wrath, therefore ſhall you have Judgement without
mercy, who hath ſhewed no mercy; The Lord hath ſhaked his
hand at your diſhoneſt gain, his Soul loaths your ſolemn aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
your ſacrifices are abomination in his ſight, for your hands
are full of blood, your iniquities are come up to Heaven, the
cry of the poor and the complaint of the needy, which you
have grievouſly oppreſſed, hath the Lord heard; your ſheeps co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
which you have hid your ſelves long under, ſhall now be
ript off, and your nakedneſs and ſhame ſhall appear unto all
men, the Lord will diſcover your ſecret parts when you ſhall
not be able to make a covering to hide you, the night of darkneſs
is coming over you, wherein you ſhall ſtumble and be ſnared and
taken, and this is becauſe you have hated the true light, and
cauſed others to hate it, your calamities cannot be numbred.
Oh! how ſad is the cry that I have heard againſt you, you have
turned many from the right way of the Lord, to follow the
imaginations of your corrupt hearts, and when the true light
did break forth to have guided their feet into the way of peace,
you have laboured by all your ſtrength to keep all people from
it, and ſaid all manner of evil againſt it, and for this cauſe
will Gods Judgements be heavy upon you, you have often
taken the ſheaf from the hungry, and hath with-holden water
from the thirſty, therefore ſhall a famine and a drought come
upon you, till you be conſumed, you ſhall be like unto the
graſſe that growes upon the houſe top, whereof the mower can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fill his hand, nor the gatherer of ſheaves his boſom, you
have been ſhameful vine-dreſſers, your vineyards are overgrown
with weeds, netles and thiſtles in the ſight of the whole Nation,
therefore will the curſe come upon you, fear, the pit, and the
ſnare will compaſs you, and it ſhall come to paſs that as many
of you as are not ſlain with fear, ſhall fall in the pit, and as
many as eſcapes the pit ſhall fall into the ſnare; for from under
Gods Protection are you gone, and therefore will he ſuffer him
that you have ſerved ſo long to give you your reward, your end
will be much worſe then ever was your beginning, though it was
Popery; Had you but in any meaſure ſtood in the Counſel of
God, and cauſed his people to have heard his word of faith in
their hearts, they had been turned from the evil of their wayes
long ere now, but you have run and God never ſent you, but
the love of filthy lucre, ſo you were never like to profit the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at all; therefore will the Lord ſmite you with a ſore blow, and
lay all your honour in the duſt, and cloath you with contempt
in the ſight of all that fears him, nay you ſhall proceed not much
further till your folly ſhall be made manifeſt unto all men as
theirs was who trod in your ſteps in former ages; oh howl, howl
and lament for the miſery that is coming upon you, you have
often hated reproof time after time when the Lord would have
done good unto you and have had mercy upon you, for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
you were placed in his vineyard, yet when he ſent his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to look for fruits, you have beaten and ſhamefully intreated
them, and now he having ſent his Son you have ſlain him, what
do you think will the Lord of the vineyard do when he comes to
reckon with you? he will caſt you out of his vineyard and will let it
out to others, who will yield him fruit in due ſeaſon, wo, wo unto
you, for you have ſtood in the way of many &amp; would neither enter
into the Kingdom your ſelves, nor ſuffer them that would, this
have you often done, your long robes (Phariſee like) which you
have long gloried in, ſhall become ragged &amp; torn, and ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you a torment, your powdred hair and ſweet perfumes ſhall be
turned into ſtink, your wives Hoods and vailes, gold and ſilver
Lace, and other gaudy attire which you have ravened from your
Pariſhes, (by which you are maintained) and cauſed to be hung
upon them, ſhal become like them which Gods judgment came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chap. 3. their honour ſhall fade as the flower and go
out as the ſnuff of a candle, and theſe are the words of the Lord
which was given in to me to write unto you when I was in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as to the outward, and who warned me to warn you what
he hath intended againſt you; Therefore if there be any one of
you, that are not guilty of the things aforementioned, whoſe
hearts are not wholly hardened, ſit down in ſackcloth and repent
while you have a little time, leaſt Gods controverſie be ſealed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you all, and you be turned into the pit where there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
