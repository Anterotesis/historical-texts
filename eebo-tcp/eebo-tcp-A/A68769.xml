            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

whole Frame, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved withſtand the blaſts, and rage of Wind, and Weather. This preceding, all things elſe readily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low which any way tend to the perfection, and happineſſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. It is ſo, it is ſo, moſt honor'd Lord: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was never ſeene to goe alone, without alwayes a glorious traine of Vertues to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and (for the moſt part) felicity to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it. I ſay for the moſt part; becauſe though God ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18368:13"/>
his Children the true, ever flouriſhing, internall felicity, yet, hee often ſuffereth even the deareſt in his eyes, to want the fading ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, where Religion doth not waite on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine endeavours, there the whole bodie of their actions is cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There is nothing which ſo much diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth Man, and Beaſt, as Religion; which is diſcovered in us, long before the uſe of our reaſon, it being
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18368:13"/>
ingrafted in us by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as wee reade of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and divers other Saints, who have made cleare, and miraculous demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of their Zeale, even in the narrow compaſſe of the womb. This is a Heavenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative peculiar to man alone; for that the other living creatures are rationall, many have diſputed; but that they are religious, no man was ever ſo ſtupid to maintaine. It is an obſervation infallible throughout all Storie,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18368:14"/>
that the more Noble Nations were ever the more Religious. <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> ſaid to the Romans, that though they regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not their Citty, yet they ſhould ſtand in feare of their Gods: which by their enemies were taken priſoners. It was with this poliſht people a cuſtome as commendable as uſual, that the Conſull, or Pretor, ever offered the richeſt of his ſpoiles to the ſame Gods in the Capitoll, unto whom there firſt hee pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his vowes. In imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18368:14"/>
and emulation of theſe truely brave Heathen, doe you offer up likewiſe the firſt fruits of your noble heart, as a rent due to him that made it. Love with all your ſoule the Creator of it. The cauſe why you love him you muſt make himſelfe, and the meaſure of that love muſt bee without meaſure. Submit your will to his, humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring his direction, and protection in all your wayes, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Let this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance fullie content
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18368:15"/>
you, denying harbour to vaine curioſities, which will diſquiet, not amend your mind. Weary not your ſelfe with Controverſies, and needleſſe nicities in Divinity, but leave them for learneder men, amongſt whom I finde ſome who will not bee ignorant of Gods ſecrets, as if it were a matter of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to bee ſaved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe wee alſo know what God will have unknowne. Thinke that ſufficient which God hath thought
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18368:15"/>
enough for you, and ſeeke to know all that to ſalvation is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not to conteſtation. When <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> have vented, and banded all their ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity each againſt other, many wiſe men will judge it no other then a profound ſcolding. The Iewes proceeding this way infinitely taketh mee, who as often as they fell upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficult place in Scripture, would ſay, <hi>Veniet Elias, &amp; enodabit: wee know that Elias will come, and tell us all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18368:16"/>
things.</hi> Thoſe ſtirring wits that itch to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound acute queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are fitly compared to the Sunne in March, who then exhales humours, but diſſolves them not. And were their poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only frivolous, they were more tollerable, but they commonly end in horrid Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. <hi>Laurentius Valla</hi> hearing a Cardinall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute ſublimely of God, and his ſubordinate Spirits, ſaid to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, <hi>And I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce too ſuch keene Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt my

We have a wicked cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in <hi>England,</hi> of Gentlemens ſtudying the Controverſies for ornament; not taking them to heart, nor hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18368:17"/>
they ought. Doe not you ſo, but love goodneſſe in what Religion ſoever you finde it. Put not your ſickle into the Divines Harveſt, but leave it to thoſe whom God hath marked for his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. Raile at no Sect, for they that delight in wrangling, deſire rather the confuſion then the reformation of him they oppoſe. Much diſputing, it may bee, God loves not, and for certaine, moſt men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre. To this I may adde, that Truth is no
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18368:17"/>
way more involved then by that way ſhee is ſought. Reade you therefore ſuch Bookes as may enflame your zeale, laying aſide thoſe which onely ſatisfie your curioſity. Neither be onely converſant in thoſe workes, which make againſt vice in generall, but enquire after ſuch alſo as treate of thoſe vices, to which you finde your ſelfe moſt prone. Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, after they haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a generall Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, uſe ſuch Medicines as purge <hi>Elective,</hi> that is,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18368:18"/>
take away onely that humour which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. So you muſt not run over onely thoſe Authors which meerly write againſt ſinne, without deſcending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to particulars; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively peruſe, and dwell upon ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt your own 2ſecret ſinnes, onely knowne to God, and your ſelfe. If to any notorious vice you bee inclined (next your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of God) the onely remedy is to ſhunne the cauſe. <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18368:18"/>
objecti naturaliter movet Potentiam: The preſence of the object ſtirres up the Deſire.</hi> To expreſſe my ſelfe more clearely: Fly that thing or that company, from whence your entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes. If in a friend an imperfection appeares, Friendſhip winkes at it: but if a vice, the hate of that makes her loath the thing beloved. Bee not you ſuch as was <hi>Fabius,</hi> a Decemvir, of whom <hi>Livy</hi> ſaith, that hee choſe rather to bee like <hi>Appius</hi> then himſelfe. I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18368:19"/>
am not of <hi>Bions</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that all friends good, or bad, are to be retained, leaſt we either confeſſe our weakenes in converſing with the vicious, or our baſenes in forſaking the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Another maine helpe is the rectifying of your will. The way to ſubjugate this, and render it conformable to the lawes of Reaſon, is a ſecret in the cure of the ſoule, knowen but to a few, and by fewer practiſed. In this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troden path which leads to the Temple of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18368:19"/>
I will with alacrity bee your Lordſhips humble, and happy Guide. <hi>Your underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding muſt often, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly informe your will.</hi> The reaſon why ſome who know enough, commit ſuch groſſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, is, that their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings check not their wils, or, if they do, it is ſo ſeldom, &amp; ſo coldly, that they rather yeeld then conquer. On my faith, this one rule obſerved is able to make you Lord of more perfections then now you are of Akers.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18368:20"/>
That you may obtaine from the Almighty a bleſſing of theſe and all your other endevours, receive often the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Remember him often that never forgets you. Frequen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy of Communion is a great, though not an infallible ſigne of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and promotion in righteouſneſſe. Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> counſelleth the more perfect to receive every day. I adviſe not you to doe ſo, but think it enough if quarterly you faile not to execute this your holy duty.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18368:20"/>
Your manifold affaires will hardly permit you oftener to make a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and devout prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily precede the approaching to this ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Supper. You muſt expel the old man out of your heart, and give up the ſole gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of it to the new, who admittes no Rivall. You muſt not onely ſtrive to cleare your ſelfe of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mortall ſinnes, but of the affection alſo to thoſe which compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively we call veniall.

Thus muſt you doe, excellent Sir, you muſt not with too much thinking whither you are going, forget where you are.

                  <hi>TItus Livius,</hi> the greateſt of all <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Hiſtorians, begins at the foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues it to <hi>Auguſtus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>; but halfe <hi>Livy</hi> is loſt, and therefore where he is wanting, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may bee read. Where he is full hee is enough; unleſſe you would ſee <hi>Dyoniſius Halycarnaſſaeus,</hi> in the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18368:76"/>
firſt times of <hi>Rome</hi> to compare him with <hi>Livy.</hi> His Hiſtorie ends about the diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene the Senat, and the People in <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> his time. There are alſo the five Bookes of <hi>Polybius</hi> from the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> warre to the deſcent of <hi>Hannibal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy.</hi> But that alſo is in <hi>Livy,</hi> and a great part of it tranſcribed out of the excellent <hi>Polybius.</hi> But there where <hi>Livy</hi> is wanting (as namly in thoſe times which are moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to knowe) as the

actions of <hi>Silla, Lucullus</hi> &amp; <hi>Pompey</hi> in the <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daticke</hi> war, thogether with the Civill warre of <hi>Marius,</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> read <hi>Appianus</hi> who is in Greeke, and Latine in a thin folio.

which you need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>Saluſt.</hi> After that <hi>Caeſars Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> will clearely ſhew you the Growth of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> in the North, and the whole diſſention betweene him, and <hi>Pompey</hi> the great.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18368:78"/>
                  <hi>Suetonius</hi>) you may reade <hi>Xiphilinus</hi> a little booke, an abreviation of <hi>Dion of Nice,</hi> which is loſt. He ſpeakes of two and twenty Emperours as low as to the reigne of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> under whom hee lived. Then <hi>Herodian,</hi> a ſhort, but pithy Hiſtorian goes to the time of <hi>Gordianus Caeſar,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of twelve Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and hee begins at the death of <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> Then <hi>Ammia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Marcellinus</hi> ſpeaketh at large of five Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, of which <hi>Iulian</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:18368:78"/>
the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> is one, though his Hiſtorie doth not immediatlie followe.

beſt of the Ancients. The deeds of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi> of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> I hold fitter to be ſung then Storied. Heere I would alſo give you my judgement of the Greeke Storie, but that it would be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe for mee to inſiſt longer upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by reaſon that I ſhall ſhortly write you a peculiar.

I am once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my firſt Miſtreſſe, my Booke, to whom my future Conſtancy ſhall make ſatisfaction for my paſſed diſloyalty. The Night, which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly conſumed in Riot, I now divide betwixt Sleepe, and Cogitation; nor doe I ſhut my Bookes out of Bed, my moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Friends.

ſeemes to mee I ſit in the lappe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. I exclude Luſt, Ambition, and others like, of whom Sloath is the Parent, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the Nurſe.

               <p>It now onely reſteth that in all ſubmiſſion and reverence I begge your Lordſhips Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for with-holding

you from better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying your time with theſe feeble, but affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate Lines, to the writing whereof, two Motives have wonne mee. The firſt is my Zeale to your Good, I having a ſtrong Deſire that you ſhould bee of your truly Great Houſe (though not in Fortune, or Fame) in Vertue the greateſt, and in the Celeſtiall Kingdome, have a Seate above them. And give me leave to tell you, Deareſt Sir, that this is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18368:81"/>
no hard thing for you to Compaſſe, it being onely the adding of Endeavour to your Diſpoſition, which of it ſelfe leadeth to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. In this you have no ſmall advantage of other great ones, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (if the Authoritie of <hi>Seneca</hi> will ſerve) a maine requiſite of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. <hi>Quis nobilis? a Natura ad virtutem bene compoſitus: Who is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Hee whoſe Nature invites him to Vertue.</hi> My ſecond, &amp; leſſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Motive is a feare, not of Death, but that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18368:81"/>
paradventure I might unfortunatly die, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving you a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of my Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for all thoſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Favours which it hath beene your Lordſhips good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to deigne me your unworthy ſervant. My owne indiſpoſition of body, and the dayly ſight of theſe Turve fires, miniſter occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to mee of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the howre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſuming of the Earth, whereof I am made. <hi>Quaelibet res dum in ſua reſolvitur

Principia, tunc apparet qualis revera ſit, &amp; quidnam ſub illa ſpecie latebat: Every thing being reſolved into his firſt Principles, doth then appeare what, indeed, it is, and diſcovereth what lurked under that ſhape.</hi> It is no otherwiſe: I everie day burne as good earth as mine owne, and, if heere I die, it is likely that this, or the next Generation will make fires of mee. But Civillity calles upon mee to make an end. I therefore once more humbly implore

your Lordſhips for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe for detaining you from your more ſerious affaires, with this long Diſcourſe, which hath paſſed the bounds I firſt ſet it downe.
