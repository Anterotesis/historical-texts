            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>MY Design in this Essay is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the singing of Psalms in Families, as a part of their Daily Worship, especially their Sabbath-Worship; an Exercise which (however it be now with other Instances of the warmest Devotion sadly disus'd, yet) was antiently practised by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of serious Christians, who thus turn'd their Houses into Churches, (such Churches as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 2.) by praising God together, and by teaching and admonishing one another in singing of Psalms. If we ask for the good Old Way, we shall f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd this Path in it trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Primitive Christians in the Church's early days; among the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of whose Religion that Learned
<pb facs="tcp:53307:3"/>
Pen, which wrote the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> traceth remarkable Foot-steps of this Family-Exercise, <hi>Part 1. Ch. 9.</hi> The sound of this Melody was not only heard in their Solemn Assemblies, where it appears by many passages (particularly that known Account which <hi>Pliny</hi> gives to <hi>Trajan</hi> of the Christians, <hi>Epist. l. 10.</hi>) to have been a considerable part of their Publick Worship, but in their private Houses also, where it seems to have been the common usage to sing Psalms with their Wives and Children, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at and after their Meals; a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice commended by <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Paedag. lib. 2. c. 4.</hi> by <hi>Chrysostom in Psal. 41.</hi> which made the Psalms so familiar to them, that, as <hi>Jerom</hi> tells us (<hi>Epist. ad Marcel.</hi>) in the place where be liv'd you could not go into the Field but you should bear the Plow men, and the Mowers, and the Vine-dressers thus employ'd: <hi>Sonet Psalmos convivium so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium,</hi> saith <hi>Cyprian. Socrates Hist. Eccles. lib. 7. cap. 22.</hi> speaks of it as the practice of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperor, to rise early every morning to sing Psalms with his Sisters; so that his Palace (saith
<pb facs="tcp:53307:3"/>
 he) was like a Monastery, or Religious House, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> And I have sometimes thought that the Service of the Monasteries in the degenerate Ages of the Church (which is known to have consisted very much in Singing) was but the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Form and Carcass of that Life and Power of Godliness and Religious Worship which had originally reign'd in most Christian Families. That's a good hint of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book <hi>ad Uxorem</hi> (written about the Year 205.) <hi>lib. 2. cap.</hi>— where cautioning Christian Women not to marry with Unbelievers, he urgeth this against it, that those who were so link'd, could not have their Husbands to sing Psalms with them, in their Houses; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, when those in that Relation draw together in the Yoke of Christ, <hi>sonant inter duos Psalmi &amp; Hymni, &amp; mutuo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocant quis melius Deo suo canet</hi>; their only strife then is, which shall be most affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate and serious in singing Psalms. And to come nearer our own day, that is worthyour notice which <hi>Mr. Quick</hi> in the <hi>In roduction</hi> to his <hi>Synodicon</hi> tells us, <hi>Vol. 1. p. 5.</hi> that the singing of Psalms in
<pb facs="tcp:53307:4"/>
Families, even those of the best. Rank, not only at their Morning and Evening Worship, but at their Meals, conduced ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to the strength and growth of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France</hi> in its first and best days. And the <hi>Title page</hi> of our old <hi>English Translation</hi> of the Psalms into Metre, set forth and allowed at the beginning of our Reformation, in <hi>Edw. the 6th's</hi> Time, recommends them to be sung <hi>in private houses for their godly solace and comfort.</hi> And how the houses of the good old Protestants were perfum'd with this Incense daily, especially on Lord's days, we have heard with our Ears, and our Fathers have told us. Gladly therefore would I contribute something towards the revival of this duty in Christian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, which, if they be (as they should be) Nurseries and Seminaries of Piety, would certainly embrace this as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means of instilling Religion betimes into the minds of their little Children, who, as they commonly attend most to this duty, so they will sooner receive the good impressions of it, than of any other; and thus out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings will <hi>praise be perfected,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53307:4"/>
to the glory of God, and <hi>strength ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to the comfort of Families; compare <hi>Mat. 21.16.</hi> with <hi>Psal. 8.2. Austin (Prolog. in Lib. Psalm.)</hi> suggests, that Psalms were written, and the singing of Psalms appointed, very much for the sake of Youth. <hi>Propterea Psalmorum</hi> (saith he) <hi>nobis per modulos aptata sunt Carmina, ut vel aetate Puerili, vel qui Adolescentes sunt moribus, quasi cantilenâ quâdam psallentes delectari videantur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What shall I say then to persuade Masters of Families who have hitherto neglected their duty, to begin it now; Better late than never. The experience of many that make conscience of it will testifie both the sweetness and profit of it. If Psalms were more sung in Families, they would be better sung in Congregations. Let none plead want of time as their excuse; for how can time be spent better than in praising God? And is there not a great deal of our precious hours thrown away every day upon other things that are less to the purpose of a Christian? Nor will there be room for this pretence, if care be taken not to defer Family Worship too late, either morning or evening, so as to crowd
<pb facs="tcp:53307:5"/>
it into a corner (as many do by a thousand impertinences) as likewise so to proportion the other parts of the duty, that they may not justle out this. It is the wisdom of Masters of Families, so to manage their Family Worship, that they may make it, as much as possible, a pleasure, and not a task to their Children and Servants. Nor let want of skill be an excuse; there may be much of acceptable Affection, where there appears but little of Art. Plain Song best befits plain Israelites. A small degree of skill (and that easily attain'd by any that give their minds to it) will suffice to the management of this duty <hi>decently and in order,</hi> and more there needs not; for in private Families the quickest way of singing seems to be most agreeable; such singing as the Great <hi>Athanasius</hi> appointed in the Church of <hi>Alexandria, ut pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciani vicinior esset quàm canenti,</hi> more like reading than singing. So <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, <hi>Confess. lib. 10. cap. 33.</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of it as a good means to preserve that spiritual delight which should be in this Ordinance, from degenerating into a sensitive pleasure, which it is apt to do when Tunes and Notes are over-much
<pb facs="tcp:53307:5"/>
study'd and affected, and the Ear tickled with them.</p>
            <p>Nor let any be afraid that their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours should over-hear them: We serve à Master that we have no reason to be asham'd of, to whom we have engaged, that whatever others do, <hi>we and our houses will serve him</hi>; and whose hold is so great of the Consciences even of bad men, that those whose contempt and reproach you fear, even of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will <hi>be had in honour, 2 Sam. 6.22.</hi> Nay, <hi>your Light</hi> hereby may so <hi>shine before men,</hi> that others may be brought to <hi>glorifie your Father which is in Heaven, Mat. 5.16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any make it an excuse that they are unready in finding out such Psalms, or passages in the Psalms, as are most proper for Family use, such may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps receive some help from this small Collection.</p>
            <p>It is taken out of <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms, and further we seldom need to go for <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> though other Scriptures may, no doubt, be us'd this way much to edification. <hi>Nolite cantare nisi quod legit is esse cantandum,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53307:6"/>
is a good Rule which <hi>Austin</hi> gives <hi>Epist. 109.</hi> This Collection will be the more useful (and it is what I chiefly aim at in it) if every one in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily have a Book, so that the Psalm or Hymn (for the distinction is but nominal) may be sung without reading the Line betwixt, which is the general practice of the Reformed Churches abroad, and renders the duty more pleasant and profitable, and takes up less time, and is practicable enough in a Family, if not in large Congregations.</p>
            <p>The gathering of Verses out of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Psalms, and putting them together, may seem to be a violation of their own native coherence. But I hope it will not give offence to any, since it is no more so, than the joyning of several passages of Scriptures remote from each other, and putting them together in our Prayers and Sermons, which is generally practis'd: Besides that, it is a liberty which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten taken by the Clarks that give out the Psalms in publick; And I think those who dislike it not there, will the rather allow it in private Families. Nay, I am in h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pes that the reference. I have made
<pb facs="tcp:53307:6"/>
all along to the Psalms and Verses, will increase and lead to an acquaintance with the Book of Psalms in general, which I would not that this Essay should at all lessen or supersede.</p>
            <p>I have made use of the best approved Translations, especially <hi>Mr. Patrick's,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Barton's</hi>; as likewise Bishop <hi>King's, Mr. Smith's, Dr. Ford's,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Baxter's,</hi> who have each of them labour'd well in this Province; nor have I neglected the Old Translation, which considering the Age in which it was done, and that it broke the Ice, is not such a contemptible piece us some love to represent it. I have taken that out of each which I judg'd the best and most suitable to my purpose, acting herein not as a Censor, but as a Gleaner. Books are known to have their Fate <hi>ad captum Lectoris,</hi> and therefore I hope my pardon for making this use of the Labours of others will be easily granted, and this general Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will suffice to acquit me from the Charge of Plagiarism. I have not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at any time from my Authors meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for variation sake, yet throughout I
<pb facs="tcp:53307:7"/>
have seen cause very often to alter, and in many places to build a-new (especially where I was willing to contract) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the best of my skill. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance indeed is but very small, yet the Design is honest, and it will be fruit abounding to a good account, if it do but help forward the work of singing Psalms, in which the will of God is done on Earth somewhat like as it is done in Heaven, where singing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to him that sits upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb, is both the everlasting work, and the everlasting felicity of those glorified Beings.</p>
