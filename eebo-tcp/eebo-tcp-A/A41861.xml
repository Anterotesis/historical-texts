            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Great and Glorious News FROM IRELAND.</head>
            <p>Being a Full and Particular Account, of a moſt Terrible and Bloody Fight, which was on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> laſt, <hi>June</hi> 2d. Between the <hi>Royal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> Commanded by His Majeſty, King <hi>William</hi>; and the whole <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, Commanded by the Late King <hi>James,</hi> which hapned on a Plain About Nine Miles from <hi>Dublin</hi>; with the Killing of the Dukes of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> and Six Thouſand more of the Enemy on the Spot; and the Taking of Seven Thouſand Priſoners. With the Manner of King <hi>William</hi>' Taking the City of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Iriſh</hi> having Planted two ſmall Pieces at the Paſs of the River <hi>Boyne,</hi> played very briskly upon our Men, killed five or ſix of them; and of the Shot unhappily Grazed on King <hi>William</hi>'s Shoulder, tearing his Cloaths, <hi>—c.</hi> A particular Account of which, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, you have heard already.</p>
            <p>By Seven of the Clock in the Evening, we raiſed a Battery againſt the Enemies, and continue to ply briskly on them, till it grew dark; during which, we diſmounted one of their Guns: By the next Morning, our Main Body were come up, and were drawn up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral Wings, by the General Officers, and by Eight of the Clock, (thanks be to God) His Majeſty mounted His Horſe; after which, He gave Order to Count <hi>Schonberg,</hi> with ſome Squadrons of Horſe, to Foad the River, which they did forthwith.</p>
            <p>The Iriſh Horſe and Dragoons, which were on the other ſide of the River, diſputed the Paſs for ſome time; but the Body of our Horſe notwithſtanding, forced their way, after which the Iriſh Horſe ran, leaving the Foot to the Mercy of our Forces, who fell in with them pell-mell, ſome of which made one Shot, but the greater number threw down their Arms without Firing, moſt of which were either Killed or taken Priſoners; with their Artiliary and other Plunder very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. A Diſſenter which came into our Crmp, gives an Account, that one Shot made from our Battery (before mentioned) went through King James his own Tent, and Killed Seven Men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe and Dragoons, with what Foot eſcaped, ran to their main Body near <hi>Dunſhauglin,</hi> who were there Poſted on advantagious Ground, by the late King James, and his Generals, the Dukes of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and <hi>Berwick,</hi> Brigadier <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and two <hi>French</hi> Generals, reſolving there to ſtay 'till our Army came up and Fight them. Our whole Army having paſſed the River on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morning, His Majeſty, King <hi>William,</hi> accompanied with the Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Schonberg</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and ſeveral other General Officers, Advanced with His whole Army towards the Enemy, and between Ten and Eleven in the Morning, our Advance Guards diſcovered the Enemy drawn up in Battalia, between <hi>Dunſhauglin</hi> and <hi>Curdiff,</hi> about nine Miles from <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Army made their regular Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es towards the Enemy, the King in Perſon, accompanied with the Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> Commanded the main Body, and about Twelve of the Clock the Fight began, which the Enemy Maitained for ſome time very briskly; but after about three Hours, they having loſt many of the Great Officers, and moſt of the <hi>French,</hi> in the Left Wing, being cut off, their Horſe gave way; which, our Army perceiving, preſſed on them with ſo great Fury, that in a little time they broke their Ranks; for which they immediately Fled, taking their way towards the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> leaving the Foot to the Mercy of our Army, who purſued the Victory with great Slaughter, killing between Six and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Thouſand of the Enemy, and taking great Numbers Priſoners.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other great Officers that were Slain, were found the Dukes of <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Dungan</hi>; and among the Priſoners was Brigadier General <hi>Richard Hamilton,</hi> and other great Officers.</p>
            <p>Care being taken to ſecure the Priſsoners, and Night coming on, our Army ſtayed to refreſh themſelves, and the next Morning ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> where they arrived the ſame Evening, finding no oppoſition; King <hi>James</hi> having a little before drawn out of that City all his Forces to joyn his Army at <hi>Navan,</hi> except Six Hundred, who hearing of the Defeat of their Forces, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of our Army, ran towards the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Wicklow,</hi> doing before hand what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miſchief that little time would permit.</p>
