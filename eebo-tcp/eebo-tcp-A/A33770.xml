            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am bold to entitle theſe Firſt-fruits unto your Lordſhips Favor and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being conſcious how much they need it, to ſhield them from this Cenſorious Age: wherein impotent Men (who ought to learn and become Diſciples, and reap the Fruits of others Labors) uſurp the Chair, and ſit as Judges, moſt ſeverely to cenſure and condemn. A Generation furniſh'd only with Principles deſtructive; to pull down and not to edifie; to except againſt what is Written, and ſuperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly ſmile at the Authors folly (as they have concluded) whil'ſt they are wiſe in their own Conceits, and ſecure themſelves from public Cenſure, by doing nothing that would become a public Spirit: thro deteſtable Ignorance or

Idleneſs, betraying the Truth unto their Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Adverſaries, yielding up a Righteous Cauſe to the Luſts of Men, for want of Zeal or Courage to defend it.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the READER.</head>
            <p>I Make no other Apology (Chriſtian Reader) for my committing theſe Papers to the Preſs, but this: The Love of Truth conſtreined me; and a juſt indignation againſt thoſe Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> who lately ſwarm'd among us, and have not yet, we fear, taken their ſlight, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Law hath baniſh'd them. But the Laws of Princes oblige not them, againſt the Miſſion of their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors: hither they will come, and here they will abide, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Sea and Land to make Proſelytes. They flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (or at leaſt the ſimple) with expectation of great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their Labors. Obſerving our ſad Diviſions, and great Corruptions, they find good Fiſhing in Troubled Waters; and conclude, The general Debauchery of Mens lives, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to entertain a Religion ſuited to their Vitious Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, wherein they may have Indulgencies, and Pardons, and perfect Abſolution upon eaſie terms. They well know, That only our Sins can bring ſuch a Judgment upon this Iſland (which God avert) as to let in Popery; and as they ſee our Iniquities abound, ſo their Hopes and Confidences improve to make us corrupt in our Religion, as in our Lives.</p>
            <p>But we hope better things from a Gracious God, and Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Truth, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhall ſtand againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderminers at home and abroad. Only let ſuch as love the Lord hate evil, and let the Truths of God be more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in our Eyes, then to be Sacrificed unto the Luſts of Men.
<pb facs="tcp:44749:5"/>
And when we ſhall obſerve ſuch Induſtrious Deſigns ſet on foot to bring in Errors: Good God! How earneſtly ſhould we contend to keep them out?</p>
            <p>Formerly we had Stout and Learned Champions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, who put our Adverſaries well-nigh to ſilence by the advantage of their Cauſe, &amp; their indefatigable Induſtry and Piety. But, however it comes to paſs, the Scene is alter'd: The Envious one ſows his Tares, and few appear to weed them out; the Truths of God are contradicted, and we are filent.</p>
            <p>Since a Puritan Faction made the Schiſm, diſturbing the Peace of Church and State; approving themſelves better skil'd at their Weapons then their Arguments; inſtead of Writing againſt their Adverſaries, Fighting againſt their Friends: Since the Venerable Fathers of our Church were driven from their Habitations, bereft of their Libraries and of their Lively-hoods, forc'd to ſeek for ſuccors, many of them, in Foreign Parts: Since the Presbyterian and Independent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains had learn'd the Merchandize of Plundred Books, ſelling whole Libraries upon eaſie terms unto Popiſh Factors: Since our Univerſities were Garriſon'd and Reform'd, All the Fellows and Students of Colleges thruſt out to ſeek their Fortunes; a Generation of Seekers, and puny Diſcipies ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: I ſay, ſince the year 1642. there hath bin a ſad long Vacation in <hi>England</hi> from ſtudious Reading and Writing of Books; and thereout our Adverſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> have ſuck'd no ſmall advantage. They are bold in Challenges and Diſputes, and Controverſial Pamphlets, whereunto the true Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> could not rejoin, for want of neceſſaries and Books; the Presbyterians, for want of Learning.</p>
            <p>Since His Majeſties miraculous and happy Return, The Church hath had time to breath, and all things move in their
<pb facs="tcp:44749:5"/>
own Sphere. But Learning and Judgment come not in <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> the Interciſion of twnety Years is ſadly ſenſible, and to be lamented: Our old Divines, thro deſuetude, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of Age, are indiſpos'd to enter into the Liſt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies; our yong Divines, are unfurniſh'd with Materials. Thirteen Years (ſince His Majeſty warm'd the drooping Genius of this Nation with his nearer Influence and Protection) being too ſhort a term for men to traverſe the Cycle of the Arts and Sciences, to revolve the Learned Volumes of the Fathers, to be vers'd in the Councils and Hiſtories of the Church, and to wind themſelves out of the Labyrinth of the Schools. And there are very few of the middle ſort: <hi>For when the Glory of the Land was departed, and the Virgin Daughter of</hi> Sion <hi>did ſit in the duſt;</hi> our military Schiſmatics committed an horrible Rape upon Religion and Learning, all things were proſtituted to their Intereſts and Luſts, our new model'd Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities ſtudied nothing but Politics and Pamphlets, compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Syſtems of New Philoſophy and Divinity: ſo that the Inſtitution of two or three Years, was more then ſufficient to qualifie them for the Pulpit and the Preſs, and to vent their extemporary Notions to a deluded People.</p>
            <p>The chief point of their Wiſdom, appear'd in the choice of ſuch Pygmies as themſelves to ſight with. The Presbyterian Learning was of a juſt ſize to match Enthuſiaſts and Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics: A Generation hatch'd under their wing, and when they were fledg, they ſerv'd to peck out the Eyes of their Dam, and make Paſt-time to the Spectators with their Puppet like Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Diſputes.</p>
            <p>But our Adverſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> were too ſtrong for them to wreſtle with: or rather indeed, they were their Friends, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording them Principles to juſtifie Rebellion; and Politics, to carry on their Deſign againſt the common Enemy, The genuine
<pb facs="tcp:44749:6"/>
Sons of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nay unto this day (with grief we ſpeak it) they both appear to ſhake hands, and ſet their ſhoulders on both ſides, with all their might to unhinge our Settlement and Security.</p>
            <p>From this ſad Proſpect, you may take the Meaſures of our Diſadvantage: Inſomuch, that if one of a thouſand, againſt the Genius of the Times, did bend his Studies to ſearch after Truth in the Records of Antiquity, to read the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, and furniſh himſelf with Arguments againſt <hi>Romes</hi> Innovations: upon his firſt Adventure to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in public, he is beſet with numerous Adverſaries and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents: Some Writing againſt his Book, and more againſt his Perſon. They take their ſeveral Parts, as their Genius leads them, either unto Contumely or Sophiſtry; deſpairing to give ſatisfaction to his Arguments, they will wound his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and vex his Righteous Soul; entangle the Diſcourſe with Subtleties and Fallacies, that ſo the Reader may be at a loſs in ſuch Miſts which they have caſt about him.</p>
            <p>Now it is great pity they ſhould have ſuch leiſure to ſend forth Legions againſt ſingle Perſons: were all of my mind, we would carve out more work for them. Relying upon Divine Aſſiſtance, and the merits of the Cauſe, let us not fear their numbers, but examin their pretenſions, and we ſhall have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement enough to enter into the Liſts: For Error is weak and indefenſible.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore follow the ſteps of our Fore-fathers, who have brought their deceitful Wares to the Light, and weighed their Motives in the Ballance, and lo! they were as inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as the duſt upon the Ballance They decline very much the Holy Scriptures, becauſe they appear againſt them. They brag of Antiquity, but in thoſe things wherein we differ, fall very ſhort of that account. They build upon the Rock of their
<pb facs="tcp:44749:6"/>
Churches Infallibility; but when we manifeſt their Errors in many Particulars, it will be an accumulative Demonſtration againſt that Fundamental Article.</p>
            <p>Now this is the Deſign in General of this Conference, to bring the Innovations of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> unto the Teſt of Holy Scritpure, and of Venerable Antiquity: and when the Reader ſhall find her ſo much to ſwerve from the Infallible Rule, we will leave him to judg of her Infallible Spirit.</p>
            <p>I have taken <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Motives principally into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe he is eſteemed a Pillar, and doubtleſs ſpeaks the ſence of his Church as fully as any others, and he had a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Cap for the reward of his Polemics. And here I call the great Searcher of Hearts to witneſs, that I have not hitherto, neither hereafter will concele from the Reader any Argument which the Cardinal brings, either in his own Defence, or in oppoſition to his Adverſaries, which I judg material; for I will not prevarieate in the Cauſe of God.</p>
            <p>One Word more, Gentle Reader, touching the form of this Diſcourſe by way of Conference and Dialogue. Deſigning, by Gods help, to profit my Country-men, and keep their feet out of the Snare; to write for the benefit of the Vulgar, rather then of the Learned, who can help themſelves. I have made choice of this familiar way, to inſinuate Truths, and to invite and recompence the Readers patience with the Pleaſure and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement of theſe Interloculories.</p>
            <closer>And ſo I leave thee, by the Bleſſing of God, to reap the Fruit of my Labors.

Are you therefore now at leiſure to give your Friend an account of the ſucceſs?

               <p>The ſame reaſon holds for Praiers and Spiritual Hymns and Benedictions: that the People, who are oblig'd to be preſent, and to hold Communion in the Praiers of the Church, ſhould underſtand them. For S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame Chapter ſaith expreſly: <hi>He that praieth in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue</hi> (that is, unknown to himſelf) <hi>his underſtanding is unfruitful,</hi> ver. 14. and therefore, ſaith he, <hi>I will pray and ſing with the spirit, and with underſtanding alſo,</hi> ver. 15. and he immediatly adds, when <hi>thou ſhalt bleſs with the spirit</hi> (that is, with ſuch a Tongue as the Holy Ghoſt hath by an extraordinary gift enabled thee to ſpeak) how ſhall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned, <hi>ſay Amen at thy giving of thanks, ſeeing he underſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt. For thou verily giveſt thanks well, but the other is not edified,</hi> ver. 16, 17. and therefore he declares, That altho he had the gift of <hi>Tongues more then they all, yet in the Church he had rather ſpeak five words with his underſtanding, that by his voice be might teach others alſo, then ten thouſand words in an unknown Tongue.</hi>

                  <hi>Bellarmine, Tom. 1. Lib. 2. De verbo Dei, cap.</hi> 16. plainly ſhews, That the Apoſtle in this Chapter doth not ſpeak of the common Forms of Praier, and Hymns of praiſe, but of ſome particular Praiers and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions, which by the gift of the Spirit, by immediate Inſpiration, ſome were enabled to ſpeak in a Tongue unknown to moſt of the hearers, and ſomtimes not underſtood by themſelves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>How doth he prove the firſt part of his Anſwer, that the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44749:9"/>
Apoſtle in that Chapter doth not ſpeak of public Praiers and Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reading of the Scriptures. For theſe are his words, <hi>Vera ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia eſt, Apoſtolum hoc loco non agere de divinis Offici is, nec de publica Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturarum Lectione.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>He proves it thus. Becauſe, ſaith he, out of: doubt the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> had the Scriptures read in the Church in Greek, and the Divine Service in the ſame Tongue which they underſtood. <hi>Scripturae ſine dubio legebantur Graece, &amp; Divina Officia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>This we readily grant, and make no more doubt of it then himſelf. <hi>Corinth</hi> was an eminent City in <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Greek was the vulgar Tongue with them, and therefore doubtleſs all their public Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was in that Tongue, underſtood by all. And becauſe the Apoſtle would alwaies have it ſo, in this Chapter he forbids everyone to diſturb that good edifying way of the Church; That none ſhould pray or bleſs in public, or ſpeak in an unknown Tongue, becauſe thereby the People, who did not underſtand the Language, could not be edified. But that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> puts out of all doubt, and we eaſily grant, That the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had their public offices of Praier and reading of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures in Greek, I pray, obſerve well how he proves it. <hi>Graece in Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> therefore they had their Service in Greek, becauſe they were Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. And the Argument concludes alike for every Country, that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had their public Service and Worſhip of God in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: <hi>Graece in Graecia,</hi> and <hi>Anglice in Anglia;</hi> becauſe they were Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, they had theirs in Greek; and becauſe we are Engliſhmen, we have ours in Engliſh: and ſo every Country in their own Tongue. For ſet aſide the reaſon of this Chapter, That S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> requires the public Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhould be in the vulgar Tongue, to the end that all the People may underſtand and be edified, and be able to ſay, Amen, (and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> could never prove what he takes for granted, That the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had their Divine Service in Greek:) by his leave, the Chapter ſhall ſerve our turn as well as theirs; That, according to the Apoſtles general rule, in <hi>England</hi> we ſhould ſerve God in Engliſh.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>But you will find how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> puts a vaſt difference between the firſt Age of Chriſtianity, and thoſe which followed. Chriſtians were then few, and in their. Aſſemblies they ſang Hymns together, and had their parts and mutual reſponds in the Divine Service, and ſo it was then neceſſary that all the People ſhould underſtand the common Service, that they might readily join therein, and make their anſwers. But when the multitude of Believers encreaſed, the Offices were divided, and the Common Praiers and Bymns in the Church were left only to the Prieſt to be perform'd: for ſo run his Words, <hi>Diviſa ſunt Officia, &amp; ſolis Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis relictum eſt, ut communes preces &amp; laudes in Eccleſia peragant. Ib. dever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Dei, c.</hi> 16. And therefore it ſufficeth, that the Prieſt underſtand the public Offices, who preſents the public Praiers unto God as the mouth of all the Congregation.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>It was no fair diviſion between them, when all was left only to the Prieſt. But have the People then no partnor ſhare in the Divine Service and public Praier?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, the Prieſt, as the mouth of the People, praies to God for them, and offereth up the Sacrifice of the Maſs on their behalf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>So he doth for ſuch as are abſent, and for the dead; and therefore why doth the Church ſo ſtrictly oblige every one to be preſent at public Service, more eſpecially at the Maſs, upon every Feſtival, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of Mortal Sin? as we may read in the Caſuiſts, particularly in <hi>Martin Aspilqueta,</hi> the famous Doctor of <hi>Navar,</hi> in his <hi>Enchiridion</hi> or manual of Confeſſion, <hi>chap. 21.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe the People of God have great advantages by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at ſuch public Offices, therefore are they oblig'd by the Precept of the Church to afford their preſence: For many do underſtand the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church; and ſuch as do not, may pray with the Spirit, altho not with their underſtanding.</p>

               <p>But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He will pray with the Spirit, and with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding alſo.</hi> And I know not what you underſtand by your expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of praying with the Spirit, and not with the underſtanding.

He elevates the Hoſt above his head, when the People muſt fall down and worſhip it. And the Reſponſals are ſhort and eaſily learn'd. Nay, thoſe ſecret Praiers, in the Maſs, which the Prieſt is enjoin'd to utter with a ſilent murmur, they conclude alwaies with this clauſe, <hi>Per omnia ſaecula ſaeculorum</hi> (throughout all Ages and Generations) which words the Prieſt muſt pronounce with a loud voice, that the People preſent may ſay, Amen. <hi>Sic finiunt omnes Orationes ſecretas, per omnia ſaecula ſaeculorum; quae quidem verba, licet Orationes ipſae tacito quodam ſilentio fuerint recitatae, altâ voce proferuntur, ut populus aſtans respondere poſſit, Amen.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44749:10"/>
when I cannot join with him in that Confeſſion, becauſe I underſtand not what he ſaith. And for anſwering Amen to Praiers which we underſtand not, the Apoſtle ſaith, we cannot do it, 1 Cor. 14. 16. <hi>How ſhall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned, ſay Amen at thy giving of thanks, ſeeing he underſtandeth not what thou ſaieſt?</hi> And as the People actually join in the Divine Service with the Prieſt, in the Reſponſals, and ſaying, Amen; ſo ſhould they intentionally and cordially accompany him in every Praier and Benediction thro-out the Service. And the Prieſt is enjoin'd often to exhort the People ſo to do, ſaying, <hi>Oremus, Let us pray.</hi> I demand therefore, whether by this Exhortation, <hi>Let us pray,</hi> the Prieſt calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People to join with him in the common Praiers which he then publicly makes to God, or only gives warning to every one preſent to put up his private Petitions to the Almighty, whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But when we ſhall read the Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts upon this Point, and obſerve the general practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we may alter our Judgment. <hi>Navarrus</hi> the famous Caſuiſt before mentioned, determins the caſe, in the 21.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44749:10"/>
are not underſtood, being perform'd in an unknown Tongue. I have ſingled out this great Oracle of his Age, as one for all; who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted about Caſuiſtical Solutions from all parts of the Weſtern-Church, and ſet forth this <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> or Manual of Confeſſors, after many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Editions, reviſed and perfected in the 90<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of his Life, as himſelf declares in his Epiſtle Dedicatory to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. And herèunto exactly ſuits the practice of their Church: The people are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to afford their preſence at Maſs in their ſolemn Feaſts, but it matters not at what diſtance from the High Altar they place themſelves; for if they hear the Praiers, yet generally they underſtand them not, and therefore they apply themſelves, ſome to Auricular Confeſſion in corners of the Temple, unto the Prieſts they have made choice of: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mumble over their bead-role of Praiers which they have bin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd by way of Penance: others, who had not leiſure to pay their Morning Devotions at home, recollect them in the Church, only when the Maſs-Prieſt with a loud voice concludes the Praiers, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to anſwer, Amen; and when he elevates the Hoſt, they have warning given them to Adore and Worſhip.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>They are too general, to be accounted perſonal. And it is evident, the public Service being not underſtood, the great Doctors of the Church judg it reaſonable and charitable to allow the people their private Devotions in the Church; and therefore it is a mockery for the Prieſt to exhort the people to pray with him, when they underſtand not his Praiers, and are permitted to pray by themſelves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhew how the Church gives the occaſion by performing the Service in an unknown Tongue: for if the people muſt join in common Praier with the Prieſt, they muſt underſtand it, that they may devoutly and affectionatly diſcharge the duty together with him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>However, I have ſhewed you before how the Prieſt is the mouth of the people, putting up the common Supplications, and offering up the great Sacrifice of Chriſt unto the Father in the Maſs for them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>And ſo the people are excluded, and in vain invited to join in Praier with the Prieſt; and there is no communion in the Service, which your ſelf, not long before, acknowledg'd to be an abſurdity. And you will find the Primitive Fathers of the Church ſpeaking expreſly to this point, Of the peoples joining with the Prieſt in public Praier, and of the efficacy of ſuch Praiers as more available with God, when the Congregation with one heart and voice did make their common Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſing Praiſes to him. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of his excellent Apology for Chriſtians, reſembles them, when aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in common Praier, <hi>unto an Army, manu facta,</hi> as he ſpeaks,

               <p>This is an Argument of great charity towards Foreigners, and of little regard to Natives: that the Service of the Church ſhould be at home in an unknown Language, in Latine, to the end that Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers when they travel in any Country may underſtand, ſome of them, the Service, and ſo be encouraged to come to Church. And in truth this Argument concludes for us, that public Praier ſhould alwaies be in known and vulgar Tongues; for if Foreigners will not come to Church if they underſtand not the Service, for the ſame reaſon our Country-men will not come to Church, if the Service ſhould be perform'd in an unknown Tongue.</p>

I have likewiſe occaſionally ſhew'd before, how the Latine Tongue was propagated with the Roman Conqueſts by their Colonies, and in time became even vulgarly known in many parts of the Weſtern Empire: but upon the Inundation of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals, &amp;c.</hi> And upon the decay of the Roman Empire, the Roman Tongue every where gave place to the Conqueror, and now there is no Nation or People in the World who generally underſtand it. Now then, ſeeing the Latine Service was in uſe in divers Countries, becauſe it was vulgarly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; and for that reaſon only, as we may well ſuppoſe, the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo apparently alter'd, and no common People now underſtanding the Latine Tongue, it ought in every Country to give place to that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

which is underſtood.

                  <hi>Let every one that hath breath praiſe the Lord, and let every Tongue conſeſs unto him.</hi> And ſo they were in that Senate miraculouſly convinc'd of the Truth now controverted between us, That every Nation ſhould ſerve God, and praiſe him in their own Tongue, even in the public Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Now you cannot deny the Story to be credible, ſeeing your ſelf have made uſe of the firſt part; and it was written by a famous Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, who was afterwards choſen Pope.

And that we do not pretend difficulties, is manifeſt: for your Church is ſo far from allowing the public Service in a known Tongue, that it ſcarce permits any to uſe their own Language in their private Devotions; training up their Proſelytes, Men, Women, and Children, to ſay their <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> the Creed, the Penitential Pſalms, their <hi>Ave Maries</hi> in Latine; and ſo like Parrots, they are taught to ſpeak what they underſtand not in particular; to utter broken Latine, and many Incongruities; the intention of heart and mind all the while being not determin'd to thoſe Petitions which they make with their lips. For altho they have a moral perſwaſion that they ſay the Lords Praier, when they mumble out the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> yet for the diſtinct Petitions they are altogether to ſeek, as I have had occaſion to make the trial. For when a Female Proſelyte of <hi>Rome</hi> gloried, that ſhe could ſay her Praiers in Latine, rehearſing her <hi>Pater noſter;</hi> when ſhe came to the fifth Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Demitte nobis debita noſtra,</hi> I interrupted her, and demanded what that Petition was, which the then put up to God; ſhe anſwered, She could not tell diſtinctly, but ſhe knew in general that ſhe ſaid the Lords Prayer. Now certainly, it is neceſſary that the heart ſhould know when the tongue asks forgiveneſs of Sins, that ſo it may be ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and deeply affected with a ſenſe and ſhame of ſin in general, and with ſome particular ſins, which lie as a burthen upon the Conſcience, and would come into remembrance at that inſtant when we with underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beg pardon. And the ſame reaſon holds for all requeſts made to God, we ought diſtinctly to underſtand them, that we may be ſuitably affected with a due ſenſe of our wants.

               <p>Yes, ſuch as pretend to moderation in your Church, would ſeem to allow Tranſlations of the Holy Scripture into the vulgar Tongue of every Country, and the common People to read them, but with great caution. Firſt, the Tranſlations muſt be made out of the vulgar Latine, and not out of the Original Hebrew or Greek; ſo the <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> Teſtament in Engliſh, and the <hi>Lovain</hi> Tranſlation in French. Secondly, None may uſe or read theſe Bibles thus Tranſlated, without a Licenſe from the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, and he judgeth they may read them with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>No: but this Licenſe granted to ſome, implies a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon all from reading the Scripture without leave in a known Tongue; as tho to read the Scripture were a thing in it ſelf unlawful, and prohibited unto all, and only allowed to ſome by Indulgence upon ſpecial Conſiderations. You heard before out of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <hi>Nothing is granted by an Indulgence and after the way of Pardon, but Sin.</hi> And withal, to ſhew that thoſe of your ſide are no real Friends to vulgar Tranſlations, and to the common Peoples reading the Scripture, you will find that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who pretends to moderation in this Point, yet urgeth his Arguments both againſt vulgar Tranſlations, and the vulgar reading of the Scripture, as unprofitable and prejudicial; in the ſame manner, as do the moſt rigid ſort of Papiſts, who bitterly inveigh againſt, and openly condemn the common Peoples reading the Scripture, and Tranſlations in their Language to help them, as I will ſhew hereafter. And upon this account, few there are who take out a Licenſe: but the People are altogether ſtrangers to the Word of God, and entertain a prejudice againſt reading the Scriptures, as being not able to underſtand them, and being in danger to wreſt them to their deſtruction: and they find they are more in favor with their Prieſts and Confeſſors, when they do not deſire to look into the Bible, and are perſwaded it would hurt them. Nay, the Learned are very ignorant of the Scriptures, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neglect them. <hi>Claudius Espencaeus,</hi> a <hi>Pariſian</hi> Doctor, in his Comment upon the firſt Chapter of <hi>Titus,</hi> about the middle, tells us, that he remembers how a noble <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhop told him, <hi>That</hi>

Chriſt had foretold, how Deceivers ſhould come in his Name, and in his Perſon, <hi>Mark 13. 21. That falſe Chriſts ſhould ariſe, and men ſhould ſay, Lo here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt; but go not after them, and believe them not.</hi> You ſee therefore how the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture would have fore-warn'd and fore-arm'd him againſt ſuch a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous attemt, had he not bin given over to reprobate mind. You may as well ſay, our Saviors converſe with <hi>Judas</hi> made him the Traitor. As for the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Heretics, (as your Doctors commonly call them) we know the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was much perplex'd with their clamor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, to have the Scripture in the vulgar Tongue, and the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in both kinds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo bitter things are written againſt them: but when you ſhall inſtance in any particulars of their damnable Doctrines (as you ſuppoſe) I will undertake to clear the knowledg and reading of the Holy Scripture from the imputation, That they did erre, becauſe they knew the Scripture. <hi>Ye do therefore greatly erre, becauſe ye know not the Scripture,</hi> Mark 12. 24. ſaith our Bleſſed Savior to the Sadduces. The <hi>Bohemians</hi> did therefore erre, becauſe they did read and know the Scripture, ſay you. As for <hi>Luther</hi>'s calling the Scriptures the Book of Heretics, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cites not the place; and if they do not bely him (according to their accuſtomed dealing with him and others) we do blame him, and think not our ſelves obliged to juſtifie the fumes of heat and choler, or the infirmities of good Men. But now what will you ſay, if I turn the Scales, and ſhew you how Hereſies and damnable Doctrines have bin minted in the Brains of ſubtle Clerks, and not of the ſimple Laity, in compariſon. <hi>Marcion</hi> and <hi>Arrius</hi> were Prieſts. <hi>Neſtorius, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, Dioſcorus,</hi> Patriarchs and Prelates. <hi>Eutyches,</hi> an Abbot; and all theſe Broachers of Hereſie.

               <p>Theſe ſeeming Contradictions do not eaſily fall within the Obſervation of the vulgar, but of the Learned; and withal, they ought to read the Holy Scriptures with veneration, and due acknowledgment that they are the infallible Word of God, and dictates of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who cannot lye nor contradict himſelf: and upon this ground, when we apprehend any contradiction in Gods Word, we muſt diſtruſt our own Judgment, and not queſtion the truth of Holy Scripture in any place, but our own apprehenſion, and apply our ſelves to the Learned for reconciliation and better ſatisfaction.

               <p>This is a great Crime, tending to the ruine of many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. But alas! too general experience proves the contrary, that Men and Women are not ſo eaſily drawn from the cares and buſineſs of the World, to mind Heavenly things; from idle Communications, to the Holy Scriptures. You have heard how <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> complains of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, That ſuch as had Bibles never look'd into them, bound them up in coſtly Covers, and lock'd them up as hidden Treaſures; and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Incumbrances of the World for their excuſe. Our Bleſſed Savior, in the Parable of the Sower, ſheweth, <hi>Matth. 13. 22. How the cares of the world, like thorns, choke the good ſeed of Gods word.</hi> And your Monks fear is, leaſt reading the Word ſhould hinder the neceſſary cares and buſineſs of Life. It ſeems of late, the World is much alter'd for the better, that the hearts of Men ſhould be ſo endear'd unto the Holy Scripture, that if they be not with-held from them, Men would neglect their Callings. But theſe are fond Imaginations; you know the Holy Scriptures ſtrictly enjoin every one <hi>to follow his calling,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 20. Promiſe the Bleſſing of God <hi>upon the diligent band,</hi> Prov. 10. 4. and 12. 24. Command, <hi>That ſuch as will not labor, ſhould not eat,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3. 10.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Truth is a Jewel, which all are concern'd to purchaſe and hold faſt; but where this Treſure is to be found, is the great Queſtion: I have bin diligent in the ſearch, and the Providence of God, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, hath not been wanting in conducting me unto the Catholic Church, the great Repoſitory of Divine Truths.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Doubtleſs, the Holy Catholic Church is ſo, the Truth it ſelf hath promiſ'd to be with her unto the end of the World. The Catholic Church will alwaies hold the Catholic Faith; and by this Rule we judg, particular National Churches to be true Members of the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, as they hold the Catholic Faith.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I mean the Roman Catholic Church, whoſe Faith, as <hi>Peters,</hi> cannot fail; and which hath alwaies laid a juſt claim to be the Catholic Church, wherein the Truths of God, and Eternal Life, are conſerv'd as her peculiar Treſure, and none, who do not communicate with her, can ſhare in them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>That which you call a juſt claim, will in its due place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a moſt intolerable Uſurpation; and ſuch as make the Catholic Church and the Roman Church to be reciprocal terms of the ſame am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude and extent, have forfeited their Logic and their Reaſon together. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at beſt, was a part and Member of the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic; and now ſince, thro her manifold Corruptions, ſhe hath well-nigh forfeited that Intereſt: lo! with an unparallel'd Inſolence, ſhe flies

at all, and preſcribes to the name of Catholic more ſolicitouſly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps out of a jealouſie the Catholic Church ſhould totally exclude her, and out of a conſciouſneſs ſhe hath deſerv'd it. But this digreſſion would uſher in a large Controverſie, beſides our preſent purpoſe, and I deſign firſt to inſiſt upon the manifold Errors of your Church, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, as our occaſions will permit; and then, if you pleaſe, we will diſpute the Point, Whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can be the only true Catholic Church, which has ſo many ways departed from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Doctrine.</p>

               <p>The Text expreſly ſpeaks of drinking his Blood, and that you cannot pretend to do by receiving and eating his Fleſh only in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, altho his Blood and Soul be there alſo (according to your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) by concomitancy.

And ſo this ſaying of our Savior, <hi>If ye eat not the fleſh of the Son of Man, &amp;c.</hi> it is ſpoken to the Church Univerſal, and yet if obſerv'd by ſome, it ſufficeth.

               <p>Chriſt inſtituted theſe Holy Myſteries to confer Grace to the worthy Receivers; to feed them with the Celeſtial Food of his pretious Body and Blood, to convey unto their Souls remiſſion of ſins. So much the words of Inſtitution imply, <hi>Take, eat, This is my Body which is given for you; and drink ye all of this, for this is my Blood of the New Teſtament which was ſhed for many for remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Now all this is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as well under one kind, as under both: for whole Chriſt, his Body, and Blood, and his Divinity, is exhibited under the Species of Bread. For Chriſt expreſly ſaith, <hi>It is my Body:</hi> and if ſo, it is his Blood, and Life, and Divine Nature alſo. For Chriſt now liveth for ever, and the Union between his Soul and Body is indiſſoluble; whereſoever one is, the other muſt be, by a neceſſary concomitancy. And then for the God-head of Chriſt, ſince the great Myſtery of his Incarnation, that can never be ſeparated from the humane Soul and Body, which he aſſumed into one Perſon and ſubſiſtence with Himſelf. So the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath determin'd. <note n="a" place="margin">Seſſ. 13 c. 3.

                  <hi>Immediatly after the Conſecration, the very Body and Blood of our Lord, do exiſt under the Species of Bread and wine, together with his Soul and Divinity.

               <p>You ſhall never find a School-man, without a nice Diſtinction to ſalve the matter. However, hereby you acknowledg the Sacrament in one kind to be maim'd and imperfect, wanting one of the integral parts. But I will not intangle the Diſcourſe with ſuch Niceties: You know our Bleſſed Savior expreſſeth one end of the Sacrament, That in remembrance of him it ſhould be given and received. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews, in what regard chiefly Chriſt is commemorated in the Sacrament, as he was Crucified, <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye ſhew the Lords death till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26. Now you all grant, that the repreſentation of Chriſts death is made by both kinds in the Sacrament. The Bread and Wine apart, repreſents Chriſt Blood ſeparated from his Body. Breaking of Bread ſignifies, how Chriſts Body was wounded, and bruiſ'd, and broken. So <hi>Paul</hi> renders the words of Chriſts Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 24. This is my Body which is broken for you,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament ſhould be given in both kinds, for a ſenſible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Chriſts death.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>The Church holds the commemoration of Chriſts death exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Sacrifice of the Maſs; and this belongs only to the Prieſt, who of neceſſity muſt conſecrate Bread and Wine, and receive both; for this very reaſon, That he may ſo repreſent Chriſts death, and offer up his Body and Blood in Sacrifice; his Body as crucified, and his Blood ſhed. So a great Doctor of our Church, <note n="c" place="margin">Lib. 6. Adverſ. haereſes. Mem. Dominicae mortis agit Sacerdes in altari, non pop. quaprop.

                  <hi>Alphonſus de Caſiro, The Prieſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorates Chriſt death upon the Altar, and not the People receiving the Sacrament. And therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Prieſt of neceſſity muſt conſecrate both kinds, and receive them; becauſe, altho Christ is wholy contain'd in one kind, yet by one he is not ſignified and repreſented: for the Species of Bread only ſignifies and repreſents his Body; and that of Wine, his Blood, &amp;c.</hi>

ſeveral Arguments of your Doctors out of Scripture; and in many places of Scripture, ſay they, the Sacrament is deſcrib'd by this character of breaking Bread; as in this paſſage of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>Altho I do not fear the Cardinals cenſure, if I ſhould deny it, neither can he or any other make it more then probable, that in that place by breaking of Bread is underſtood a Sacramental Action; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is probable both in this Text, and in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Acts, ver. 7. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the firſt day of the week, when the Diſciples came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to break Bread,</hi> Paul <hi>preached.</hi> Therefore ſome of our Divines do allow your Interpretation: yet your Doctors concluſion will not hold, That they received the Sacrament only in one kind, altho the Bread only is expreſs'd, for here a part is put for the whole action of Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: for mark you, breaking of Bread was the Apoſtles or Prieſts act, ſo to diſtribute it to the People: and many other actions muſt concur to make up the Sacrament, as Bleſſing, and Conſecrating, and the like; and you ſind theſe are not expreſs'd, but implied: and ſo alſo muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating the Cup be implied alſo; for otherwiſe, if the Apoſtles did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the Bread and not the Cup, the Sacrament was null by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of your own Doctors.

               <p>It is your part to ſhew they did not, otherwiſe you do not make good that the Sacrament was given only in one kind: Now all your proof is, becauſe the Cup is not expreſſ'd, as the breaking of Bread is. And you know, that it is a weak negative Argument, and if allow'd, it would over-throw your firſt Poſtulatum, that by breaking of Bread is underſtood the Sacrament; ſeeing many neceſſary actions to complete a Sacrament, as you have heard, are not expreſs'd but only implied: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho it is not expreſs'd, yet you take it for granted, That when the Bread was broken, it was bleſs'd and diſtributed, and that the Cup likewiſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44749:36"/>
was conſecrated: And why will you not give me leave to take it likewiſe for granted, that the Cup was given to them, altho it be not expreſs'd? Doth the Expreſſion of breaking the Bread exclude giving the Cup?</p>

               <p>What you may ſuppoſe I know not; but this I am ſure, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cardinal nor you can prove any thing againſt us out of theſe Texts. And before I leave this paſſage, I cannot but obſerve a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of your practice unto this Expreſſion of breaking of Bread, which you make very much of, as the denomination of the whole Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Action (and in ſome places we do not gain-ſay it) and yet when you adminiſter the Sacrament, you do not break Bread; you omit that ſignificant Action which is expreſs'd in our Bleſſed Saviors Inſtitution, and you give unto the People Wafers whole and ſingle, which cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Chriſts Body bruiſd and broken, or the Peoples Communion of the ſame Loaf, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>I am ſolicirous for your ſake, that you may recover out of the ſnare, and be timely ſenſible of your Error. <hi>Tolet</hi> hath other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments as weak as Water, to make good his impudent Aſſertion, That in the Apoſtolic and Primitive Times, the Church adminiſtred the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indifferently either in one or both kinds, as ſhe thought fit. I ſhall meet with them in due place. For I now proceed, as I propoſ'd, to ſhew the practice of the Church for many Ages, both from the reſtimony of the Fathers, and the Learn'd in every Age; and from the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your own Doctors, to give the Communion in both kinds unto the People, according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and the Tradition of the Apoſtles.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>You love to take that for granted, which is the Queſtion: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſts Inſtitution and Apoſtolical Tradition be on your ſide? For altho our Savior gave the Sacrament in both kinds to the Apoſtles, it doth not appear he appointed them to adminiſter it ſo unto the People, as a rule unto ſucceeding Generations.</p>

               <p>The practice of the Church, will beſt interpret the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt, and duty of Chriſtians: If the Church Catholic for 1200 Years gave the Communion in both kinds, thereby they declare the mind of Chriſt, and our obligation to follow them.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I ſpeak of Church Practice, and you divert unto Church Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority: As tho the Holy Fathers, who gave the Sacrament in both kinds
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44749:37"/>
unto their Congregations, did therein follow the Canons of the Church, and not rather the Inſtitutions and Command of Chriſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>The Eſſential parts of the Sacrament we remit to Chriſt and his Inſtitution, but do believe the Church alwaies had power to appoint and alter Circumſtances.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Where Chriſt hath left them undetermin'd. But more-over, we account the Elements of Bread and Wine, to be material and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial parts of the Sacrament, Inſtituted by Chriſt, and therefore not to be accounted Circumſtances, and left to the determination of the Church. But I perceive, while you contend ſo much for the Autority of the Church, you are not willing in this point to hear the conſtant Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Church.</p>

he take ſo great pains to anſwer the Teſtimonies which we bring out of the Fathers, for the giving of the Sacrament in both kinds, ſeeing he might cut all off with this ſtupendious Solution?

But I proceed: About this time Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt makes a Decree, <hi>That ſome Manichees ſhould be obſerved strictly, who diſſembling Church-Communion with Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, would come to the Sacrament, and receive the Bread but not the Wine; becauſe they eſteemed Wine a Creature of the Devil.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhews out of <hi>Gratian,</hi> That this Order was made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Prieſts, who are oblig'd to receive in both kinds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>He might with more reaſon ſay, It was made for the Turks, who with the Manichees, abhor Wine: Can it be ſuppoſed, That Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees could be Prieſts of the Catholic Church, and ſo be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to communicate in both kinds? no, it was made for their diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, when they thruſt in among the People, and would appear as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>It appears by this Paſſage, that the Church then gave the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without the Cup, otherwiſe how could the Manichees hope to counterfeit Church Communion, becauſe refuſing the Cup muſt needs betray them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>By this we prove the contrary: For how could they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by refuſing the Cup, if it were not given to the People?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Thoſe two Popes decree, the Cup ſhould be given at that time on purpoſe to diſcover theſe Heretics.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>No ſuch thing: The Decrees were made for ſtricter prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and obſervation; perhaps ſome negligent Prieſts before might let them paſs without the Cup, or they might take down none of the Wine when the Cup was brought to them, only put it to their Lips, or the like: But how do you anſwer Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> his reaſon of the Decree, and free your ſelves from grand Sacrilege? One and the ſame Sacrament cannot be divided without grand Sacrilege.</p>

               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, in that place <hi>Bellarmin</hi> takes not any notice of that conſiderable paſſage of the Decree.</p>

               <p>Becauſe it was unanſwerable. This is the firſt time I have found him ſilent, and ſo I may the better proceed without interruption.

               <p>Alas, your Doctrine of concomitancy was never heard or thought of, in thoſe Pious Times.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44749:42"/>
in both, and no prohibition to receive in one kind: That upon many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, it is expedient to with-hold the Cup from the Laity: That the Church hath power to order things of this nature: and, That after the expreſs determination of the Church in ſome General Councils, it is even become neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to with-hold the Cup, and an Hereſie to dispute againſt it.</hi> Now to prepare the World for this new practice of receiving only in one kind, that ſo it might be entertain'd in ſome places, and get ground, and afford ſome plea of a Cuſtom in the Church, the School-men ſtarted ſome prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Queſtions, and concluded, <hi>That whole Christ was received under each kind; and he that received only the Body of Chriſt, received likewiſe his Blood and Soul, and Divinity by a concomitancy.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">ſy</hi>, <hi>That the whole intent of the Sacrament, as to the People, all the Eſſentials thereof, were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated under the Species of Bread, with the Body of Christ.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">ſy</hi>, <hi>That he who received in both kinds, had no advantage of thoſe who receiv'd only in one kind.</hi> Altho we find this laſt Theſis not ſo generally admitted among themſelves, yet ſuch as oppoſe muſt not be peremtory, leaſt the People ſhould be ſenſible of ſome injury don them, in being depriv'd of that benefit which ſhould be exhibited more in both kinds, then in one.</p>

               <p>I will not interrupt the Series of my Diſcourſe, by reflecting upon by-paſt Paſſages, but proceed to ſhew, how the Communion in one kind was in uſe in the Primitive Times, and not condemn'd; and ſo by conſequence allow'd. Many Cuſtoms of the Primitive Times, infer, the Body of our Lord was delivered to the People without the Cup. In the days of Perſecution, when they could not aſſemble often to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in public Aſſemblies, it was uſual to carry with them part of the conſecrated Bread, wrapping it up in clean Linnen, and keeping it in their Houſes, until ſuch time as they thought ſit to eat it. Of this Cuſtom <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 2. ad uxorem, c. 5. Non ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>Theſe are Niceties; I pray let me proceed without diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. You know the Sacrament was uſually ſent unto the Sick, to be received upon their Beds, <hi>Tanquam viaticum morientium,</hi> as Food for a long Journey, given unto thoſe who were paſſing from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

What the Faithful receiv'd in the Church, the ſame the Deacon carried to the Faithful in their Houſes, when by reaſon of Sickneſs, or any other juſtifiable occaſion, they could not be preſent at the publick Solemnity. However, your Inſtances are only of the Communion in private Houſes, and the Myſteries reſerv'd; and if one kind only be expreſs'd, the other may be underſtood. But have you any Teſtimony of the Church, which expreſly ſhews the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given in the Church in one kind only; whereas we have brought a cloud of Witneſſes, for the public Communicating in both kinds.</p>

               <p>Yes, many ancient Canons make expreſs mention of the Laick Communion, as diſtinct from that of the Clergy: So that Prieſts and Deacons, Criminals, were cenſur'd to Communicate only as the People, not as the Prieſts, that is in one kind, not in both. So the <hi>Eliberitan</hi> Council, <hi>Anno</hi> 305. in the 76.

                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> brings another Argument, drawn from the conſent and teſtimony of the later Ages of the Church, <hi>That it is evident for more then 800 Years, That in ſome Churches, in the public Aſſemblies, the uſe was to give the Sacrament in one kind.

               <p>Hereby you may judg how ſlightly you examine things, and Books; for in the <hi>Ordo Romanus</hi> you will find, That the Wine is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated in a little Chalice, and the Pope drinks of it: and afterwards, the Arch-Deacon pours out ſome of the Conſecrated Wine into a great Flagon, or Cup of other Wine and Water, and ſo it is Sanctified for the Peoples drinking, but not Conſecrated.</p>

God will not impure Sin to them. As for the Lay-mens Beards, the Prieſts are not ſuch Shavelings, but that they may be liable unto the ſame Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And the Diſciples of Chriſt at Supper with him, are pictur'd with very grave Beards. And withal, theſe Inconveniencies may follow the Bread Conſecrated: It may ſtick in their Teeth, and the crumbs may fall to the ground; and you know your Doctors teach, that whole Chriſt, Divinity, Soul and Body, are contain'd in every minute Particle of the Hoſt. Out of ſuch pretended Reverence, me thinks, you might be as ſolicitous, That the Pretious Body and Blood of Chriſt ſhould not be receiv'd into the fuming Caldron of the Stomach, and ſo keep the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament from us all, in your Patins and Chalices of pure Gold.</p>

               <p>Yes, it will grow mouldy and vinew'd; and beſides, the Mice may, without care, devour it. But what needs this reſervation of the Sacrament, either in the Church, or in our Houſes?

               <p>This was not the matter then in queſtion, and needed no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation; for in the Primitive Times, the Sacrament was given in the Morning, and to ſuch as were able to forbear, it was given faſting. But the great concern, was the Communion in both kinds, acknowledged to be Chriſts Inſtitution, and that he gave it to his Diſciples in both kinds; and then immediatl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>The Motive is expreſs'd, <note n="b" place="margin">Cum firmiſſime ſit credendum &amp; nullatenus dubitandum, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe we must not doubt, but ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly believe, That whole Chriſt, his Body and Blood, is contain'd under ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Species of the Sacrament: And therefore ſuch a cuſtom of giving the Sacrament in one kind, introduc'd by the Church, and the Holy Fathers, and obſerv'd for a moſt long time, let it be taken for a Law.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>The firſt part is warily penn'd: <note n="c" place="margin">Tam ſub Specie panis, quam ſub ſpecie vini veraciter contineri.</note> 
                  <hi>We muſt ſtedfaſtly believe, that whole Christ is verily contain'd, as well under one Species as the other.</hi> So it may be, if it be in neither: and ſo we hold, Chriſt is contain'd in neither ſingly, but he is ſignified and Sacramentally repreſented, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and ſpiritually exhibited by the Sacrament in both kinds unto the Faithful Receiver. His Body that was broken for us, is ſignified by breaking of Bread; and his Blood ſhed, by the Wine poured out of the Cup, and ſeparated from the Bread in the Sacrament: and therefore at preſent, we will diſmiſs this School nicety, and, by the Councils leave, not take it for granted, That whole Chriſt, Body and Soul, is in either Species. <note place="margin">Quod nullus Presbyter ſub poena Excommunicat. communicet Populum ſub utraque Specie.</note>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:44749:46"/>

               <p>Stay there: We abſolutely deny any command of Chriſt, or of his Apoſtles, or of the Church repreſentative in a General Council, to adminiſter the Sacrament in both kinds, and we ſhew two Councils for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>You deny, but the Scriptures affirm: And the reaſon why no General Council determin'd the Sacrament to be in both kinds, was, becauſe the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and the Tradition of the Apoſtles, and the practice of the whole Church, was ſo full and expreſs for it. It was never put to the Queſtion, as I can find, until the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century: and from that time, when the School-men began to ſwarm, moſt of them being ſworn Champions of the See of <hi>Rome: The laudable Cuſtom,</hi> as the Council ſpeaks, <hi>approv'd by Holy Fathers,</hi> (viz. <hi>Monks and Friers) crept inſenſibly into the Church.</hi> And this muſt be made a ground of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, to eſtabliſh the Communion in one kind, and forbid the Cup, and declare a Curſe upon all thoſe that ſhall diſpute it. And now, when I ſhall declare the reaſon, I hope your goodneſs will excuſe that great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my ſelf and you, in thoſe numerous Quotations and Teſtimonies I have brought to prove the practice of the Church for 1200 Years, in giving the Sacrament unto the People in both kinds.

And withal, to manifeſt their impudence in calling that a cuſtom rationally introduc'd, when ſuch <note place="margin">

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>SIR, I have found ſo much courteſie within Doors, that now we are come abroad to continue a Diſcourſe of Controverſie, methinks it is not Manners and Civility to oppoſe your choice and Judgment, and try your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, who have given ſuch Demonſtrations of your goodneſs. But when all proceeds from a Zeal to Truth, and from a cordial Affection to ſo worthy a Friend, and you have charity to believe it, I am encouraged to proceed. Having therefore diſcuſſ'd already two Points, I propoſe the third to Conſideration. The great ſcandal that is given by your Church of <hi>Rome</hi> unto ſober Men and good Chriſtians, from Images and their Worſhip, ſo much pleaded for and defended by your Doctors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>This was indeed a third Objection, which in the beginning of this Conference you propoſ'd againſt the Doctrine and Practice of our Church, which you ſuppoſe hath given occaſion of Scandal both to the Learned and unlearned, as being obvious (as you ſaid) unto every underſtanding: But where lie the apparent Exceptions againſt this Point?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>The ſecond Commandment appears at firſt ſight to forbid worſhipping of Images, and you allow it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>So you make your deluded People to believe, deſigning to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a prejudice and odium againſt our Church, that ſo you might keep them firm to your heady ſeparation from us: But your Learned know in their Conſciences, that we do not tranſgreſs this Commandment, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the thing forbidden, or in the manner of Worſhipping our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages; which are not included in the prohibition of Gods Law.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>You appeal to the Learned of our ſide, as tho you would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to decide the Controverſie if they would ſpeak the dictates of their Conſciences. But this is a ſleight and Artifice, to wipe off your own guilt, and lay the charge of Diſſimulation to our Doctors: But their Grounds and Reaſons, when produc'd, will manifeſt to the World, that the charge they lay againſt them of tranſgreſſing the rule of Gods Word in this Point, proceeds out of Conſcience and not Deſign: you give a great ſcandal and offence to God and Man, and would not have us zealous to reprove it.</p>

               <p>God, in the ſecond Commandment, hath forbid us <hi>to make and worſhip Images;</hi> and your Church hath mightily advanc'd the Trade of Painting, and Carving, and Graving Images, and require veneration and worſhip to be given to them.</p>

               <p>This charge is level'd againſt the Idolatry of the Gentiles, and thoſe Nations whom God caſt out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who did worſhip graven Images of Men, and Women, and Beaſts, and creeping, things, for Gods.</p>

               <p>The Clauſe and Parentheſis in the firſt Verſe of this charge: <hi>For ye ſaw no manner of ſimilitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in</hi> Horeb, I ſay this Clauſe manifeſts, That God gave the charge, leſt by any thing after mention'd, they ſhould attemt to repreſent him. It is truth, that the Heathen did repreſent their falſe Gods in and by ſuch Shapes and Images, and did worſhip them. And the Almighty God, by a full enumeration of Creatures, forbids any ſimilitude to be made to repreſent and to worſhip him under it: And to this effect, the Propher <hi>Iſaiah</hi> expoſtulates with an Idolatrous People: <hi>To whom will ye liken Gods or what likeneſs will ye compare unto him?</hi> Iſa. 40. 18. The beſt Image of God; is Man; an Image of the Lords own making, that this likeneſs and ſimilitude of God conſiſts in the Soul of Man, with her noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Free-will and Underſtanding, and dominion over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in that original rectitude and holineſs where with he was created but theſe things cannot be repreſented by the linea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

and therefore by the Image of a Man, God cannot be repreſented, and much leſs by any inferior Creature. God is Infinite, and Inviſible, and Spiritual; and all Images are finite and material, and terminated by viſible dimenſions, and therefore one cannot reſemble another.</p>

               <p>But there is another inſtance more oppoſite, of thoſe three Men who appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> at his Tent door in the plain of <hi>Mambre, Gen.</hi> 18. It is expreſly ſaid in the firſt verſe, <hi>The Lord appeared to</hi> Abraham
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44749:51"/>
                  <hi>as he ſat at the Tent door.</hi> God therefore was repreſented by one of theſe three Men, who afterwards (as we read, <hi>ver. 17.) staid and communed with</hi> Abraham, <hi>when the other two went to</hi> Sodom. Now to draw three waifering Men turning in to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Tent, and entertain'd by him, whereof two departed towards <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the third communed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> would be Hiſtorically to repreſent God under the Image of a Man.</p>

               <p>We deny not, that three Men may be drawn coming towards <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the ſequel of the Story: but we deny, that either of theſe thus pictur'd would be the Image of God, repreſenting him. God afterwards manifeſted himſelf to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in communication, in means unknown to us; whereas under the ſimilitude of a Man, he was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unknown to the Bleſſed Patriarch.

The ſame reaſon holds, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt deſcending upon Chriſt in the ſhape of a Dove: the Dove was no Image of the Holy Ghoſt, had no ſimilitude or repreſentation of the third Perſon of the Bleſſed Trinity, who is the Eternal Spirit, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be repreſented by Picture.

               <p>The whole Scene of Chriſts Baptiſm being repreſented in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and among the reſt, a Dove deſcending upon Chriſt, it would put us in mind of the Holy Ghoſts deſcent upon him.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Your Doctor deriv'd this deep Theology from the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi> or rather from the old Idolatrous <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts, who were much taken with Hieroglyphics. But I pray obſerve, how his Inſtance in Man as the Analogical Image of God, is the worſt choſen of all the reſt: For all Lambs are meek and patient, and ſo may Hieroglyphically repreſent the patience and meekneſs of Chriſt. But moſt Men are evil, <hi>like the Beaſts that periſh,</hi> as Lions, and Tigers, and Wolves, devouring one another; as Swine and Goats for Luſt, and ſo are become rather Images of the Devil. And notwithſtanding all this, muſt the ſingle I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Figure of a Man, without any other thing to determin it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent God, and become his Analogical Picture? and let me obſerve to you, how they deal worſe with God, then with the Angels; for theſe they picture fair and youthful, to repreſent their florid incorruptible ſtate: but they picture God, <hi>as the ancient of days,</hi> whom we read of in the Prophet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9. with a grey Beard, and antique Countenance, as if he had one foot in the Grave.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Any thing that ſhall pleaſe the fancy, where there is no ground in Reaſon or Religion to determine it. The Heathen Poets made prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Deities; and ſo do Chriſtian Painters. But what Analogy can there be between the Divine Nature and an Image? the one is Infinite, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finite; the one a Spirit, the other altogether material. An Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphic, or Image, which repreſents God in one reſpect, muſt be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely defective in many other. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> Analogically repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great Deity of the World, by the Hieroglyphic of an Eye, to ſignifie his All-ſeeing Providence. But alas! the Eye ſeeth, but doth not fore-ſee. It is the Mind that is provident, not the Eye: And then where is the Power, and Juſtice, and Mercy of God repreſented by that Emblem? <hi>If all were an Eye, where is the Body?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: And if an Eye ſhall be the Image of God, where is the Hand of Power, and the Scepter of Government, and the Scale of Juſtice, and Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt of his Wrath? Put all the Emblems in the World together, and they ſhall repreſent God, as a ſhadow doth the Sun. God hath clearly reveal'd himſelf to us in his Holy Word, and you have drawn a veil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by your Dyſanalogical Images, and Pictures: you take from the People the Holy Scriptures, and teach them by Pictures, according to that memorable Saying of a Pope, <hi>Pictures are Lay-mens Books.

                  </gap>o! by your Pictures of God, you deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Worſhip and the Imagination of deluded People, to the ſhadow and repreſentation of a Body: And becauſe Man is the moſt excellent
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44749:52"/>

               <p>If God was pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf in an human ſhape (as you have heard:) Why may not we repreſent him ſo to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Firſt, there is a great miſtake in thoſe Apparitions of God in the Old Teſtament: you make uſe of them to repreſent God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a human ſhape, whereas the Fathers generally hold, that God the Son aſſumed thoſe appearances, and therefore they call'd them, <hi>Praeludia Incarnationis,</hi> the Prologues of his future Incarnation; and ſo they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not warrant your Picturing of God the Father. But to come more cloſe to our preſent purpoſe, ſuch Viſions of God which we read of, were tranſient, cited only to the preſent purpoſe: as in that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>ancient of days,</hi> it repreſented Gods dreadful coming to Judgment; as you may read at large the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter. Now you would make a ſtanding Repreſentation of God thereby, to all ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes whatſoever. And again, when the Prophet had his Viſion, it was alſo revealed to him what it ſignified; otherwiſe, <hi>an old Man with white garments, and the hair of his head like wool,</hi> could not have repreſented God to the Prophet. It was no Image that did bear any Analogy or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of the Divine Nature, or of any Perſon of the Trinity, and therefore cannot be made uſe of by it ſelf to repreſent God. <note n="a" place="margin">3. Diſt. 9. Qu. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Durandus,</hi> a great School-man, tells us, <hi>Such Forms wherein God appeared in the Old Teſtament, were not aſſumed into one Perſon with the Divine Nature, as was the Humane Nature of Christ; and when the preſent deſign was over, they were laid aſide, as we put off our clothes.</hi> And you may as well make a ſuit of Clothes the Image of a Man, as theſe Forms the Image of God. Suppoſe any Man ſhould converſe with you a day or an hour under a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, would he like it, if you ſhould take his Picture, and the ſtanding copy of his countenance from the Vizar? When the Holy Scriptures mention the Eye of the Lord, and the Mouth of the Lord, his right Hand, and his Holy Arm; will you take theſe parts, and ſet them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and make the Image of a Man to repreſent God, and bring theſe Autorities of Scripture for your warrant? This is a ready way to make our People <hi>Anthropomorphites;</hi> to create in them an Imagination, that God conſiſts of Parts and Members as a Man; and that his Image, after which God made Man, was imprinted in the Body. In the Gatechizing of Youth, we find it an hard work to take their minds off from ſuch conceits, notwithſtanding all the help of Holy Scriptures, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declare, <hi>That God is a Spirit, and not fleſh; inviſible, and not a Body.</hi> When we tell them, that in ſuch Expreſſions of Gods Eye, and Hand, and Mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Holy Ghoſt deſcends to our capacity, and ſpeaks of God after the manner of Men: That he ſeeth all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44749:53"/>
Eyes, he maketh all things without hands; for he ſpake the word, and all things were made: and yet the Heavens are call'd his handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and ſo the whole Creation, becauſe Man performeth ſeveral O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations by ſeveral Organs of the body, therefore, for our better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, theſe Members figuratively, and by a Trope, are aſcribed to God, altho he worketh all things by himſelf, by the Almighty Power of his will and pleaſure. Now when we labor to explain theſe things unto the People, they hardly ſink into their hearts, to take them off from terrene Cogitations of God; and much more would they be confirm'd in ſuch low conceits of the Divine Nature, if they ſhould conſtantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold God pictur'd, and worſhip him under an humane ſhape.</p>

               <p>For no other end do we repreſent God under an humane ſhape, but to deſcend unto vulgar capacities; and our Prieſts can inſtruct them, as well as you, that God is an inviſible Spirit.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Such Images which you make of God, are not Tropes and Figures to repreſent him to the minds of Men, but real Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Eye; and ſo are apt, in undiſcerning Perſons, to improve the imagination, that God is like unto us in our Earthly Members: and for this cauſe, among others, he hath forbid ſuch Images, and you tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Commandment of God, and endanger the Souls of deluded People, in making and expreſſing ſuch Pictures unto public view and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration. And it is worthy Obſervation, That altho God would borrow a viſible ſhape to appear unto a diſcerning Patriarch and a Prophet, yet he would not do ſo when he would manifeſt his prefence to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he deſcended upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in a Cloud, in the voice of Thunder: and he expreſly makes the Obſervation to the People, when he prohibited any likeneſs of God to be made, <hi>Take ye therefore good heed unto your ſelves, for ye ſaw no manner of ſimilitude, on the day that the Lord spake unto you in</hi> Horeb, <hi>out of the midſt of the Fire,</hi> Deut. 4. 15.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44749:55"/>
and that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> had acquitted the Council of <hi>Novatianiſm, &amp;c.</hi> Do you not believe the Learned Cardinal knew as much of this Concern when he wrote his firſt cenſure of the Council, as when he cries <hi>peccavi;</hi> only he was willing to undervalue the Council in the firſt place, and might preſume many of his Readers might never go ſo far as to read this his Recantation. But to proceed in Church Hiſtory, concerning Pictures of the Saints in Churches, we have a notable paſſage of <hi>Epiphaninus,</hi> a Learned Biſhop in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who going towards <hi>Bethel</hi> with <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the way he turn'd into a Church, in a Village call'd <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blatha,</hi> to Pray: And ſeeing there a piece of hanging before the door of the Church, painted, and having the Image of Chriſt in it, or ſome Saint, (for afterwards, in his Letter to <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That he did not well remember whoſe Picture it was)</hi> he cut the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Picture into pieces, and wiſh'd the Keeper of the Church to wrap ſome dead Body in it, and bury it: When ſome of the Village ſtanding by, expoſtulated with him for the Fact, and ſaid, That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhould buy another piece of hanging before the door; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to do ſo, and ſent it afterwards to the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be put up inſtead of the other. Now in this Letter to the Biſhop, who had Juriſdiction in that place, he gives a reaſon of his action: <note n="a" place="margin">Hierom. Tom 2. Epiſt. Epiphan. ad Jeannem Epiſc.

But firſt, I will prepare the way, and let you know, That we do not declare againſt Images in themſelves, but as they are occaſions of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Worſhip. Men prize ancient Pieces, repreſenting Famous Men: Suppoſe <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Tully,</hi> or the Anceſtors of their Family; and much more ſhould we value Pictures of Holy Men and Women, or of our Bleſſed Savior: But you muſt then ſhew they be true Reſemblances and Copies, of their Countenance, Pictures very like them whom they repreſent; whereas now in the Images of the Saints there is no regard had to their likeneſs, but only to ſet up an Image that ſhall ſignifie, and not repreſent. An old Man with a Sword, ſtands for <hi>Paul;</hi> with Keys, for <hi>Peter;</hi> with a Croſs decuſſat, for <hi>Andrew:</hi> ſo in our Saviors Pictures you ſhall obſerve as many Forms as there are Faces or Fancies of Men. If a Painter, deſigning to draw our Ladies Picture, ſhould take a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Courtizan for his pattern, it would ſerve. Now ſuch Pictures,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44749:58"/>
which have no likeneſs to the perſons repreſented, deſerve no regard, neither are they uſeful for Commemoration. Should any one ſend you your Grand-fathers Picture, much unlike him, and drawn at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, you would not honor it ſo much, as to hang it up in your Hall or Parlor. But you and I both have been led out of the way, by thoſe who write upon this ſubject of Images; inſtancing in ſome who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together rejected them, and in others who have approved them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our chief Deſign is, to ſhew the unlawfulneſs of Image Worſhip, to allow no other uſe of Pictures, then to put us in mind either of Things or Perſons, or for ornament of places: If you are content herewith, the diſpute ſhall end between us, always excepting againſt any Image of God, whether Hiſtorical or Analogical, or by what term ſoever you may diſtinguiſh.</p>

               <p>We never ſaid, the ſame honor is due to the Picture of a Prince, as to his Perſon: Do you all ſtand bare in the Parlor, becauſe your Princes Picture hangs there, or the Pictures of any of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors? And ſecondly, from a civil Worſhip given unto a Creature, to a Religious Worſhip given unto a Creature, there is no conſequence to be drawn; and the reaſon is this, God hath forbid one, and not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

But now alas! from his Epiſtle, and from his practice, he ſadly perceiv'd how he was taken from the Truth, and had given great ſcandal to the World. And ſo he ſets himſelf to give ſatisfaction unto ſome Particulars which the Emperor had mention'd in his Letter; telling him before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, <q>That he would write to him dull and illiterate Things, becauſe thou thy ſelf (ſaith he) art ſuch.</q> And in truth, the Pope is as good as his word; for his Letter which he writes to the Emperor, is blunt and deſultory, without any reaſon or conſequence, or good manners. He ſaith, <q>That God did forbid Graven Images, ſuch as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> made</q> and worſhip'd; but he commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to make two Cherubins, a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and an Ark; and theſe were ſimilitudes made with hands for the glory of God.

After this, he tells him, how our Bleſſed Savior ſent a Copy of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in a Napkin to the King of <hi>Edeſſa.</hi> 'Tis truth, ſaith he, we do not Picture God, becauſe we know him not; but if we had beheld him, as we do his Son, we would have made his Picture alſo, and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would call it an Idol. The love of Chriſt knows, ſaith he. That when I go into the Temple of <hi>Peter,</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles, and look upon his Image, I am brought to compunction; and as Rain out of the Clouds, ſo do my Tears flow down.

               <p>He anſwers it thus, True, O King! neither did any of thoſe Councils make Decrees of eating Bread, and drinking Water, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, That it was as evidently neceſſary to worſhip Images, as to eat and drink, and therefore no matter for a Canon of a general Council. And withal he tells him, That the Patriarchs and Biſhops carried Images be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, when they went into the Council; and none that did love Jeſus Chriſt, would take a Journey without ſome Images of the Saints, as their Fellow-Travellers. Now theſe things, and many others, are ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him without any offer of proof; and being not in his Pontifical Chair, it ſeems he was not infallible: neither was it likely ſuch blind Stories, and fond Aſſertions, and fooliſh Letters, ſhould prevail with a Prince of great Power and Reaſon; and therefore he continued his courſe of preventing Idolatry, by taking Images and Pictures out of the way, and ſo he had the Sir-name given him of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>The holy and great general Council of</hi> Conſtantinople, But we have no Record of the Actions of this Council, otherwiſe then we find the definition thereof mangled and confuted by parcels, in the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ſucceeding.

Now here you may obſerve a Scene of Popiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety: When the Emperor <hi>Leo Iſaurus</hi> did not concur in Judgment with <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſecond, altho a Council was deſired. yet the Pope would not conſent, becauſe he well knew, that the Countenance and Autority of the Emperor, would carry all things againſt the Popes Judgment. But when <hi>Irene</hi> the Empreſs, together with her Son <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> were made for the intereſt of the Pope and for Images, Then <hi>Adrian</hi> mightily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the Council, condemns the former general Council of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> which Decreed againſt Images, as a meer Heretical Conventicle, and ſets up this at <hi>Nice</hi> in its ſtead. And he laid his deſign ſure enough: for in the entrance of the Council he writes by his Legats, both to the Emperor, and to <hi>Taraſius</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> That <hi rend="sup">c</hi> he was made Patriarch againſt the Canons of the Church of Chriſt, as being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly taken from a Courtier, and a Lay-man, to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> but becauſe he was ſatisfied of his zeal for Images, therefore he would not except againſt his Conſecration. And in the cloſe of his Epiſtle to <hi>Taraſius,</hi> he tells him plainly, If the Emperor and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſhall not reſtore Images, I cannot by any means admit of your Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44749:61"/>
And this Patriarch, in truth, was fit for the Popes turn, being liable to the exception you have heard, and not learned, he would be rul'd by the Popes Legats, and ſome buſie Monks in the Council, the ſooner; and withal, many of the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> had bin guilty of voting againſt Images in the former Council of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and none of them muſt be admitted into this Council, but ſuch as would ſubmit, acknowledging their Error, and begging pardon, and declaring ſtrenuouſly againſt what they had eſtabliſh'd; and condemning the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil againſt Images unto the pit of Hell. And with theſe preparations you may eaſily judge, what would be the iſſue of the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the firſt that ever declared for Images and their worſhip.</p>

                  <hi>I do from my heart and ſoul anathematize that Council of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>against Images, as being aſſembled out of meer folly and madneſs.</hi> Another of them denounceth an Anathema againſt all ſuch who were of doubtful mind, and did not from their Soul confeſs that Images were to be worſhipped. This was fair for the firſt Scene and Action of that famous Council. In the ſecond Action, Pope <hi>Adrians</hi> Letter to the Emperor, and to the Patriarch <hi>Taraſius,</hi> are publiſh'd and approv'd by the particular Teſtimony of every Biſhop. In his Epiſtle to the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Irene</hi> his Mother, he congratulates their embracing the Faith of the chiefeſt Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> promiſing That theſe Saints ſhall be the Protectors of their Imperial Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and bring the barbarous Nations under their feet. He brings in a Fable of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperor, how in a dream he ſaw <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> come to him, and directing him to ſend for <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> (who liv'd in Baniſhment upon the Mountain <hi>Soracle,</hi> fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Perſecution of <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> and that good Pope ſhould guide him to a Pool, wherein he might waſh and be healed of his Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: whereupon <hi>Conſtantine</hi> awaking, ſends ſome of his Officers to the Pope, who alas! thought of nothing, but that by theſe Meſſengers he was called forth to ſuffer Martyrdom. But the Emperor when he came, entertain'd him with great courteſie, acquainted him with his Dream, and ask'd who thoſe Gods were, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> which appeared to him. <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſier</hi> anſwered, That they were Servants of the moſt high God, great Inſtruments of the Worlds Converſion to Chriſt. The Emperor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether he had their Pictures, that he might know them; and a Deacon is preſently diſpatch'd to fetch their Pictures: and as ſoon as <hi>Constantine</hi> ſaw them, he cryed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>out, <hi>Theſe are the Men I ſaw in my dream;</hi> and ſo he was Baptized by <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> and cleanſed of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie. Now it is ſtrange, That a Pope ſhould write ſuch a Fable, and that a whole Council ſhould believe it, againſt the Evidence of all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> never perſecuted Chriſtians, never had a Leproſie; was not Baptized by <hi>Sylveſter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> but by <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media:</hi> for the Emperor deſigned to be Baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi> where our Savior receiv'd the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> and in his Journey towards <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> fell ſick at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and was Baptized by the Biſhop of the place. This, when need requires, ſhall be made good, by many authentic Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies: and withal, it is moſt certain, That <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was a ſound Chriſtian, and Defender of the Faith, in <hi>Miltiades</hi> his Popedom, who was Predeceſſor in the See of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Sylvester.</hi> It appears, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that endleſs Controverſie between the Catholics and the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, concerning <hi>Cecilianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> unto the hearing of <hi>Miltiades;</hi> and how he ſhould be a Perſecutor of the Church in <hi>Sylveſiers</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:44749:62"/>
Popedom, is a Riddle. I muſt confeſs, <hi>Baronius</hi> would reſolve it: He tells us, <hi>That after</hi> Conſtantine <hi>was Chriſtian, he ſell away, and committed great Cruelties, and perſecuted the Church, inſomuch, that</hi> Sylveſter <hi>fled to</hi> Soracle; <hi>and that God ſmote him with a Leproſie.</hi> And ſo the Story of his Dream fore-mentioned, proceeded. But this is an horrible Forgery, purpoſely deſign'd to maintain <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Baptiſm at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that large donation to the Church Territories in <hi>Italy,</hi> which they pretend to hold from the great Charter of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> But we have read, <hi>That</hi> Julian <hi>was an Apoſtate;</hi> but never before, that <hi>Constantine</hi> was ſo: And withal, the Fable confures it ſelf; for if <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as all confeſs, in <hi>Miltiades</hi> days, how comes it to paſs, that in <hi>Sylveſters</hi> time the Emperor had never heard of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in a Dream to him, but ask'd the Pope, What Gods they were? It ſeems he had drunk of the River <hi>Lethe,</hi> or rather that great Annaliſt was drunk with the Cup of <hi>Romes</hi> Fornications, ſo as to forget the Truth, and vent, in this particular, nothing but Impoſture; againſt the rule of Piety, and Charity, and common Gratitude, to ſtigmatize the firſt great Champion of Chriſtian Religion, who brought Peace and Tranquility to the Catholic Church, with the Brand of Apoſtacy and Perſecution of the Saints: What will not a Cardinal ſay, for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Court of <hi>Rome?</hi> I have bin, in the Series of this Diſcourſe, reduc'd to a neceſſity of this digreſſion. But I return, <hi>Hadrian,</hi> after many impertinent Paſſages in his Epiſtle to the Emperor, he urges the thread-bare Argument of <hi>Moſes,</hi> being by God himſelf commanded to <hi>make two Cherubins, and the Brazen Serpent:</hi> And he moſt <note n="a" place="margin">Ibid. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c.</note> Logically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, If the looking upon a Brazen Serpent could heal the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> much more ſhall ſuch as behold and worſhip the Pictures of Chriſt and of the Saints, be ſaved. Whereas he ſhould have taken notice, how the Serpent was erected by Gods eſpecial command, and endowed with ſuch an healing vertue, whereas they can produce no ſuch command to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Images, or any promiſe of Salvation by looking upon them. He cites from <hi>Jerome</hi> one ſtrange paſſage, but refers to no place, and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, it is no where to be found: It is this, <hi>That as God permitted the Gentiles to adore things made with hands, and was well pleas'd with the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, who did adore the two Tables which</hi> Moſes <hi>hew'd out, and the two golden Cherubins; ſo unto us Chriſtians, he hath given the Croſs, and the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and Images of good Works, to picture and adore them.</hi> Now ſuch For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries and Fooleries paſt for Goſpel among the Biſhops of that Council, who never examin'd any thing that was ſaid, if it had any tendence unto their great deſign to eſtabliſh the worſhip of Images. Only there is one memorable paſſage in his Epiſtle, which if well obſerv'd by all, might help to end the Controverſie for asking the Queſtion: <hi>What honor of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip do we give to the Images of Chriſt and the Saints?</hi> He Anſwers, <hi>Such as we ſinners give to one another in love and honor.</hi> We would not much
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44749:63"/>
contend about this civil reſpect, if they had not train'd the People to give Religious Worſhip and Adoration to Images; altho (as ſome will have it) of an inferior degree to that Worſhip we give to God. The third Action of that Council, conſiſts in hearing and approving ſome Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical Epiſtles, and contains nothing of moment to our preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In the fourth Action, they bring the Teſtimony of Holy Scripture for Images: <hi>That the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes <hi>to make two Cherubins, &amp;c.</hi> And then ſome paſſages of Fathers, who ſpake of Images which they beheld, and were much affected with them: they bring in divers Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends of Miracles effected by Images. I will, for brevity ſake, give an account of one for all. <hi>Peter,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> brings out a Book of the Paſſion of Chriſt, aſcrib'd falſly to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> the Great; out of the Book he reads this Story. <hi>In the City</hi> Berytus, <hi>in</hi> Syria, <hi>dwelt many of the Jews; and near unto their Synagogue, a Chriſtian hired an Houſe, and dwell'd ſome time in it; and over againſt his Bed he ſet up, at full length, the Picture of our Savior, drawn in a Table: when he chang'd his dwelling, and took another Houſe, it fortun'd that he forgat to take away the picture, with his other goods, but left it in the Chamber. A Jew ſucceeding in the Houſe for ſome time, never diſcover'd the Picture, until another Jew being invited to dine with him, caſt his eye upon it, and immediatly expostulated with his Friend for keeping in his Houſe the Picture of Chriſt, and began to curſe our Savior: but leaving the Houſe, be goes to the High Prieſt, and the Council of the Jews, and accuſeth his Neighbor for harboring this Image: They take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with them, and came to the Jews Houſe, and find this Picture, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly caſt him out of the Synagogue. Then they spit it on the Face, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to act over again all the Indignities upon the Picture, which their impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fore-fathers had upon the Perſon of Christ; they pierce the Hands and Feet with Nails, put gaul to his Lips, and ſmite the Head with a reed At last, they ſaid, We have heard that our Fore-fathers did pierce his ſide with a spear, and let not us omit that conſiderable able Circumstance: forthwith, one fetching a spear, pierc'd the ſide, and immediatly iſſued out a ſeream of Blood and Water: at which ſight, they were all amazed and terrified; but recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting themſelves, they ſaid, We have heard Chriſtians boast of many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of their Savior, Let us make the Experiment, and ſend for the lame and blind, and among the rest, for one who was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ealed; and ſuch as were poſſeſſed with the Divel among them.</hi> By this Miracle, the Jews of the City, Princes and People, were converted to the Faith of Chriſt, and came to the Biſhop of the place, profeſſing their Faith, and deſiring Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and their Synagogue was conſecrated into a Temple of the Lord, and great joy was over all the City. Now this Legend was received in the Council with great acclamation, and glory was given to God who had brought to paſs ſuch mighty things for the Converſion of the Jews, and for the confirmation of the Saints in Image-worſhip. But <hi>Taraſius</hi> the Patriarch put to the Council a ſeaſonable Queſtion: How cometh it to paſs that our Images do no ſuch Miracles? and he Anſwers, Becauſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44749:63"/>
are ſigns to Unbelievers, and not to Chriſtians: and yet to ſee the luck of it, this very Miracle is at length brought home to their own Times. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> acknowledgeth the Book of Chriſts Paſſion, out of which they did take the Story, was wrongfully aſcrib'd to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the great Champion of the Faith againſt <hi>Arius.</hi> And ſo doth <hi>Baronius,</hi> and gives his reaſon; for in the ſpace of 400 Years between that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and this Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſome notice would have been taken of this notable Miracle, which yet was never heard of, but in that Book. And withal, <note n="a" place="margin">Baron. Tom. 9. Anno 738. numero 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> tells us, That in the <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrology, or Calender, there is appointed an Holy-day to be kept in commemoration of this Miracle, upon the fifth of the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and that the relation thereof was devoutly read in the Churches; and recorded to have happened in the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Irene,</hi> the punctual time when the Council was aſſembled. And thus you ſee, when they are brought to the Touch-ſtone, Fables and Legends will appear what they are, counterfeit Coin; and ſuch as relate them, their Teſtimonies will not agree: and yet the Council eaſily ſwallowed this, and many other Cheats and Impoſtures, ſerving to erect their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages with their worſhip. <hi>Baronius</hi> gives us one Note more upon the Paſſage, <hi>That the effuſion of Blood from the Picture was ſo great, that many Viols were fill'd therewith, and ſent to the Churches of Chriſt, Eaſt and Weſt, to be kept as Sacred Relies.</hi> Now any one, that had his Wits about him, might eaſily conceive the Story did confute it ſelf: For it is not probable, the Chriſtian, removing Houſhold-ſtuff, ſhould leave behind him unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and undiſcover'd the Picture of Chriſt at full length; and that the Jew ſucceeding, likewiſe ſhould not ſee it, until his Neighbor comes into the diſcovery. In the fifth Action of this Council, they bring in many other Stories and Fables, whereof the Reader may give himſelf an account in reading the Hiſtory of that Council, given by <hi>Binius</hi> in his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Tome;</hi> and there they pretend to ſhew how the former Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi> did impoſe upon many of the Biſhops then preſent, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting Books and Teſtimonies, and forcing their Votes to concur with them; and this by the confeſſion, forſooth, of thoſe who had recant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and now ſate in this Council to condemn and pronounce the other Accurſed. In the ſixth Seſſion they come cloſe to the Point, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the definition of that Conventicle (as they are pleaſed to call it) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Images: but not in the uſual way of Councils by debating particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars among them, but referring all to a malapert Deacon, one <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, The Repreſentative of the Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Sardinia, and he anſwers every Paragraph with Exclamation and Railing, as the impartial Reader may obſerve. To give one Inſtance, the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Picture of Chriſt, ſends us to the Holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper, in commemoration of Chriſt and his Paſſion; and calls the Euchariſt Chriſt Image, wherein he was beſt repreſented to his

               <p>This is ſomthing you ſay to juſtifie that Council: but you muſt obſerve withal, that charge of their Definition of offering Incenſe, and burning Tapers at theſe Images; and Invocating the Saints whom they repreſent for their mediation and aſſiſtance, praying to them, as well as falling down before them: this exceeds all civil worſhip and reſpect, and can hardly be diſtinguiſh'd from Religious worſhip due to God alone, eſpecially in the apprehenſion of vulgar minds, who have not ſubtlety to underſtand between ſupreme and inferior worſhip, or in their practice to make any difference: and withal, that Axiome upon which they ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doctrine of Image worſhip, <hi>That the honor don to the Image, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the Prototype,</hi> would make Men emulous to honor the Image in the ſame degree, as that which is repreſented by it, and ſo the Image of

So <hi>Gregory de Valentia, lib. 2. de Idol. c.</hi> 7. and <hi>Alphonſus de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro,</hi> ſhews out of <hi>Platina,</hi> That one <hi>Felix</hi> who was an <hi>Arian,</hi> was alſo an Image breaker, and the Council of <hi>Francford</hi> was ſummon'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Hereſie of <hi>Felix.</hi>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>All this is ſaid, but not prov'd. <hi>Felix</hi> his Hereſie was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, becauſe he held, That Chriſt, as Man, was the Son of God by adoption, and no other thing was laid to his charge. And likewiſe, the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for breaking Images, was condemn'd in ſhort, but the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> at large, for decreeing the worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And <hi>Baronius</hi> expreſly ſaith, he was ſo far from denying, that he did abſolutly maintain, that the Council of <hi>Francford</hi> did condemn the Council of <hi>Nice, Tom. 9. Anno</hi> 794. And he brings many undeniable Te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtimonies of thoſe times to confirm it; only in ſome Hiſtorians and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of thoſe times, there was a miſtake in calling it the Synod of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> inſtead of the Synod of <hi>Nice:</hi> but they name the Emperor, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Irene,</hi> under whom the Council was held; and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay, The Council of <hi>Francford</hi> condemn'd the Council which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd worſhipping of Images; and the four Caroline Books made by that Council, and own'd by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, which were ſent to Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> wholly determin againſt the worſhipping of Images. <hi>Hinema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> tells us, He ſaw that Book when he was a Youth in the Kings Palace, and did read it: and that when <note n="b" place="margin">Suarum puparum cultum vehementer pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Your Arguments run altogether upon Analogy and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that much more honor is due to the Saints now in Heaven, then when they liv'd in the Fleſh, becauſe they are much more excellent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in Grace and Glory; the great Favorites of the King of Heaven. So proceed your Arguments for the worſhipping of their Images; we give unto them, ſay ye, a relative, inferior, dependent honor, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Analogy of Reaſon; he that loves the Perſon, will love his Image: But where is the Autority of Holy Scripture? God cannot be offended, you will ſay, that the Images of his Saints and Servants ſhould be had in honor; and what is done to the Image, redounds to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Saint repreſented by it; and of God, who hath highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored him. But ſtill you muſt keep within your Bounds: God is jealous of his Honor, and will not permit any degree thereof to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to any other, whether Saint or Angel, much leſs to their Images. For inſtance, Adoration, falling down and worſhipping: the Angel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd it, and ſends the Apoſtle, <hi>to give that to God: Peter</hi> refus'd it: the Divel deſir'd it upon great promiſes, <hi>If thou wilt fall down and worſhip me</hi> (or before me) <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 4. ver. 7. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>If this were ſo, it manifeſts your Doctors and School-men to have been groſly ignorant of the Councils. And ſecondly, That they are reſolv'd to aſſert whatſoever they believe a Council hath determin'd, right or wrong; yea, altho it be againſt the dictate of their Conſcience, and rule of Gods Word. But leaving the Cardinals Excuſes and Gueſſes to himſelf, <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and the reſt, give their own Reaſons for their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: the Church hath taught us to put our hope in the Croſs, and therefore we worſhip it with Divine Worſhip; the honor of his Image tends to Chriſt. The thing repreſented is in the Image as in a Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, and therefore we adore it. Nay, <hi>Azorius</hi> takes notice of the <hi>Nicene</hi> determination, and ſhews how in one ſenſe it is true; in another, not: take the Image of Chriſt materially, as a Conſecrated thing, ſo it is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd with Divine Worſhip: but formally as an Image repreſenting Chriſt, ſo Divine Worſhip is given to it. Now ſuch allowed Diſtinctions as theſe, and Doctrines, have prevail'd upon the unwary People to give the ſame worſhip to the Image and the Exemplar; nay, to give Religious Worſhip to all Images. In the Schools they tell us of divers kinds of Worſhip, whereas in their Churches there is no ſenſible difference; what Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the People give to God, the ſame they give to the Saints; they Pray, they fall down and Worſhip.

               <p>Concerning the Point, <hi>Invocation of Saints departed:</hi> After ſome preliminary Diſcourſes, <note n="a" place="margin">Tom. 2. Controverſ. 4. de Eccl. Triumph. c. 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> undertakes to prove two things, one in order unto the other. 1. That the Saints in Heaven do pray for us. 2. That we muſt pray to them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>One of theſe doth not neceſſarily follow upon the other. That if the Saints Triumphant are ſollicitous for, and do pray for the Church Militant in general (for the triumph of their Faith, and their conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Bliſs, who being Fellow-members of Chriſts myſtical Body the Church, are yet within the Liſts, wreſtling with great oppoſition and many tryals) I ſay, it doth not follow, That if the Saints in Glory do pray for the Church Militant, that therefore we ſhould call upon them ſo to do: They are perfect in Grace, and never wanting to their duty, or unmindful of their concerns. Upon this account, methinks out of a Zeal to the glory of God, you ought as frequently to call upon the Saints in Heaven, to laud and magnifie the God of Heaven; as out of a ſenſe of your own wants to pray unto them to intercede for you. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, you can never give us any infallible aſſurance, that they do hear our Prayers, that ſo in Faith and with confidence we may call upon them. The Members of the Church-Catholic thro-out the World do pray for one another, and yet one National Church doth not Invocate another, except it be by enter courſe of communicatory Epiſtles. Direct me how to ſend a Letter to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and I will not fail to put in my humble requeſt, That he would help me with his Praiers.</p>

               <p>This is out of an Apocryphal Book, and therefore no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible proof from Canonical Scripture: Now touching the Canon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, we may have, by Divine permiſſion, another occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And altho <hi>Bellarmin</hi> pleaſeth himſelf, that <hi>Calvin</hi> had no other refuge but to deny the Autority of the Text; yet we will reflect upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Particulars which appear to weaken the Teſtimony. For it was but a Dream of <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi> which he told unto his Soldiers to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them before the Fight; a Dream worthy to be believed, as if it had been ſo indeed, ſaith the Author, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. It ſeems therefore indeed it was not ſo, and ſo the whole Teſtimony is from a Dream that had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. In the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verſe,</hi> it is call'd, <hi>A Viſion,</hi> you may ſuppoſe a waking Dream; and therein there was ſo much reality, that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> gave a golden Sword to <hi>Judas</hi> to wound his Adverſaries: but a golden Sword is no fit Inſtrument of War for execution, and it is much, we never read it was laid up in the Temple for a Sacred Relic: and much more cauſe we have to wonder, it is not at all mention'd in the firſt Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> which is the more perfect Hiſtory of thoſe Wars; and wherein the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with <hi>Nicanor</hi> is punctually related, 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 7. 41. and <hi>Judas</hi> his Praier to God before the Fight: but of the Dream or Viſion, <hi>ne gry quidem.</hi> And now I pray obſerve, how your Doctors in thoſe Inſtances are inconſtant to their own Principles: for they generally hold, That the Souls of the Faithful departed, before Chriſts Reſurrection, did not enter into Heaven, neither ſee the Face of God, nor know the State of things here above them; and therefore it was not uſual in the Church to call upon them, and ſay, <hi>Holy</hi> Abraham, <hi>pray for us.</hi> Your Doctors hold, <note n="a" place="margin">Bell. ib. c. 19.

                  <hi>That the Spirits of the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and People of God, were ſhut up in</hi> Limbo Patrum (as they call it) <hi>in a ſubterraneous place, the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most verge of Hell, beneath us: without pain, and without joy in the Viſion of God: waiting for their redemtion out of that Priſon by the coming of Chriſt, who deſcended into Hell to ſet them at liberty, and to conduct them triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into Heaven.</hi> When we urge that Text, <hi>Iſa. 63. ver. 16.

               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhews, how Interpreters underſtand, by the Praiers of the Saints, Interceſſions made by the Saints in Heaven, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and ſupport of their weak Brethren upon Earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>It ſeems then, even the Saints in Glory make uſe of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, of the four Beaſts, and the twenty four Elders, to preſent their Prayers to the Lamb. The more general Interpretation of that place is, That theſe Odors, filling the golden Vials, are the Praiers of the Faithful upon Earth, which are repreſented in the Pſalm, <hi>To aſcend like the Incenſe,</hi> Pſal. 141. ver. 2.</p>

               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>This gives as full teſtimony to our purpoſe as the other: for thereby it appears, the Praiers of the Saints on Earth are preſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and to the Lamb, by the Saints and Angels in Heaven. And to this effect we read, <hi>Rev. 8. ver.</hi> 3, 4. how <hi>an Angel came and ſtood at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, having a golden Cenſer: and there was given unto him much Incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the Praiers of all Saints upon the golden Altar which was before the Throne. And the ſmoke of the Incenſe which came with the Praiers of the Saints, aſcended up before God out of the Angels hand.</hi> Now this Incenſe offered up, with the Praiers of the Saints on Earth, we may ſuppoſe are the Merits and Interceſſion of the Saints in Glory.</p>

               <p>And we may ſuppoſe, they are the Merits and Interceſſion of Chriſt, whom <hi>Primaſius</hi> underſtands by the Angel in this place: we know it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. That Chriſt is entred into <hi>the Holiest of all, into Heaven it ſelf, to appear in the preſence of God for us:</hi> and that <hi>by him we offer up to God continually our Sacrifices of Praiſe,</hi> Heb. 13. 15. and without all peradventure, he is moſt properly ſaid to add Incenſe and ſweet Odours to our Praiers and Praiſes, becauſe for his ſake only they are acceptable to the Father.

But at length, you are content we ſhould make the ſame civil Requeſts to the Saints in Heaven for their Praiers, as to the Faithful who are living: You may obſerve it generally, ſuch as are in the wrong, will accept of any compoſition: But we cannot grant it for this reaſon, becauſe Death intercepts all civil Obligations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between Perſons. Parents, when they are dead, ceaſe to be provident for their deer Children, and theſe expect it not from them: The rich Man departed, cannot relieve the poor, nor lend him Money at his need. You formerly did urge, there was a communion between
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44749:81"/>
the Church Militant and Triumphant; but that is myſtical, as Fellow-members of Chriſts Body: But the civil communion between Brethren and Neighbors, and the relation of Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants, Princes and Subjects, Husband and Wife, is interrupted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together by death; and ſo by conſequence, all thoſe acts which depend upon, or flow from that communion: That Children ſhould ask their Fathers Bleſſing after his deceaſe, I never yet did read your Doctors have aſſerted.</p>

               <p>I am well confirm'd by theſe your Digreſſions, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding you would appear to ſlight <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Argument, and pretend to cut off all the four Horns at one blow, by giving a general anſwer; yet in truth, you do warily decline the force of it, and are not willing to come to the four Particulars whereupon he hath inſiſted, That ſeeing the Saints departed are as willing and as able to help us now with their Praiers, as when they were living amongſt us; and ſeeing they know our ſtate, and can hear and receive our Addreſſes to them, and ſeeing their Interceſſion now for us is not injurious to the Interceſſion of Chriſt, therefore we have as much and more reaſon to Invocate them now in Heaven, then when they were converſant with us upon Earth.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Not excluding the confutation already given, I will now take theſe four Particulars into conſideration: The two firſt may eaſily be granted (if there could be mutual communion between them and us) That the Saints departed have as much charity to pray for us, and that their Praiers are as prevalent with God: But alas! Death hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted former commerce. And his third Particular muſt be well prov'd, or all will fall to the ground, namely, That the Saints in Heaven do hear our Praiers, and know our particular needs; otherwiſe, it will be in vain to call for their aſſiſtance. And this main Point, your Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal doth but ſlightly touch, and gives a ſhort and fallible proof of it: That becauſe <hi>the Angels know the converſion of a ſinner, and rejoice thereat,</hi> according to the ſaying of our Bleſſed Savior, therefore likewiſe the bleſſed Saints do know our ſtate, and all our concerns. Now we have already ſhew'd, how the Conſequence is weakly drawn, from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Angels to the knowledg of the Saints in Heaven; becauſe the Angels are Gods Meſſengers, miniſtring unto the heirs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they are imploi'd about us, and know much of our concerns: but of the Saints departed, no ſuch things are recorded. And moreover, doubtleſs the Angels themſelves know not all the affairs of particular perſons, only of thoſe about whom they are emploied, and ſo far as God ſhall impart to them in their Embaſſage and Emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>As they know the Converſion of every Sinner that repenteth, and rejoice; ſo do they know and hear the Praiers of all the Faithful, eſpecially ſuch as do concern them, and are particularly directed to them.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>We are much in the dark as to the meaſure and extent of their knowledg, and muſt not in theſe things ſo much above us, ſet one foot forward, without the light, and conduct, and revelation of Gods Word. Now we read in Holy Writ, <hi>That the Angels have charge over us,</hi> according as God has committed us unto them, but how far, and in what particulars, is not revel'd. We read, <hi>They rejoice at the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Sinner;</hi> which way ſoever, or whenſoever, for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their joy, God is pleaſed to manifeſt it unto them, perhaps, by the relation of thoſe Angels who were inſtrumental in the Converſion. But from thoſe Promiſes, we cannot infer their univerſal Knowledg of Affairs here below, and much leſs the univerſal Knowledg of the Saints in Heaven. Methinks the Learned Cardinal ſhould not ſo peremtorily have handled this grand Point, upon which depends the Invocation of Saints; for if they hear us not, in vain certainly do we make our Praiers to them: If they underſtand not our condition, they cannot recommend it unto God. If <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter</hi> knows not of any ſuch Perſon as <hi>Philodoxus</hi> in being, to no effect ſhall we beg his aſſiſtance.</p>

               <p>He had done well to point out this <hi>Aliquis alius:</hi> Who is this Delegate of the Saints in Heaven, to do their work, whil'ſt themſelves hear not our Prayers? Whil'ſt we Invocate the Saints, do the Angels help us? The ſureſt way then, would be to apply our ſelves to them: Doth God help us, when we pray to the Saints? (altho it is high preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make God the Saints Delegate, <hi>qui eorum vice fungitur)</hi> however, if God helps ſuch as pray to the Saints, the moſt compendious courſe would be to call directly upon him: and ſo did Chriſtians in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and pureſt Times, <hi>Ad memorias Martyrum,</hi> at the Shrines and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Martyrs they did pray to God, who was pleas'd to work many miraculous Cures at their Tombs, in Teſtimony of the Faith which thoſe Martyrs ſealed with their Blood. And this is the juſt account of the Miracles wrought by the Saints and Martyrs in Heaven, at their Shrines here on Earth. The Miracles were wrought by Almighty God, before the Monuments of the Saints, themſelves not knowing of it; as we ſhall ſhew hereafter out of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Auguſtine</hi> his Book, <hi>De cura pro Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis.</hi> And yet from this Aſſertion of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> (wherein I ſuppoſe he ſtands ſingle) That we pray not to the Saints in vain, altho they do not

                  <hi>The Saints are immediatly call'd upon, therefore they know what we ask.</hi> One Suppoſition deſtroies the other: If we may prudently and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pray to them, altho they hear us not; it cannot follow, That if we rightly call upon them, they do hear us.</p>

                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> propoſeth four Opinions of the Doctors, about the manner how the Saints in Heaven know Affairs beneath, and hear the Praiers that are made unto them. The firſt, <hi>That they know them by the relation of Angels, who are Meſſengers between Heaven and Earth.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>That both Angels and Saints are in a ſort every where preſent by the celerity and agility of their natures, and ſo they underſtand the Affairs of the world, and hear our Prayers.</hi> And he cites S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>He cites them very faintly, <hi>Innuit Auguſtinus,</hi> ſaith he, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Augustin</hi> intimates ſo much in his Book, <hi>De cura pro Mortuis:</hi> and there indeed the Father tells us, <hi>The dead may hear of Affairs on Earth, by the relation of Angels;</hi> but he affirms not they do ſo: and then they may hear ſome things related <note n="h" place="margin">Non quidem omnia ſed quae ſinuntur indicare.</note> but not all things. And afterwards he declares, <hi>Fatendum eſt, &amp;c. We muſt acknowledg that the dead do not know the things that are don upon Earth.</hi> I ſhall give you a full account of this Book here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Next for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Jerome, Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, he ſeems to ſay as much in his Book againſt <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> where in truth the Father doth aſſert of the evil Angels, <hi>That they wander far and wide thro-out the World, and by their celerity are every where preſent.</hi> But we muſt of neceſſity underſtand him only in a comparative ſenſe; their agility and ſwiftneſs makes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to paſs from place to place, whereas groſs Bodies required a ſlow, and ſucceſſive motion; but Ubiquity and Omnipreſence is an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of God, Incommunicable to a Creature. Again, Theſe evil

Angels may be conceiv'd preſent in all places by their numbers and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, not by their individual perſons.</p>

                  <hi>Jerome</hi> in that Book argues fully for the ubiquity of the Saints in Heaven, becauſe it is written of them, <hi>That they follow the Lamb whither ſoever be goeth,</hi> Rev. 14. 4. And if the Lamb be every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, therefore they that are with him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>This Argument cannot hold; for then much more the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature and Body of Chriſt, united unto the Divine Nature, ſhould be omnipreſent, which I know none to aſſert, and therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> Interpretation of that place, is this, <note n="k" place="margin">Lib. de Sancta Virginit. c. 27. Quid eſt eum ſequi, niſi imitari?</note> 
                  <hi>To follow him, is to imitate him; not as he is the only Son of God, by whom all things were made, but as he is the Son of Man, giving us an example of all things neceſſary to be ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Bellarmin</hi> knew well the Invalidity of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Jeromes</hi> conſequence, and therefore did not urge it for an Argument.</p>

               <p>But that you love to contradict and ſpin out your Diſcourſe, you need not have perplex'd your ſelf and me with theſe Anſwers: For you know <hi>Bellarmine</hi> approves of neither of theſe two ways of the Saints knowledg in Heaven, Becauſe, ſaith he, celerity cannot ſuffice, but true ubiquity is requir'd to hear all the Praiers that ſhall be made to a Saint, perhaps in all places of the World at the ſame time. And again, he ſaith, That neither Angels nor Saints in Heaven, altho they were preſent with us, can naturally know our mental Praiers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>We account theſe to be ſubſtantial Arguments againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints and Angels, becauſe they cannot be every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to hear Praiers made from all parts, and becauſe they know not our thoughts and mental Praiers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>But theſe are anſwer'd by the the two next ways he propoſeth and approveth of the Saints comprehenſion and knowledg: One is, <note n="l" place="margin">Sanctos in Deo omnia videre, quae ad ipſos aliquo modo tertinent.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Saints do ſec all things in God that concerns them, even from the firſt inſtant of their bleſſedneſs.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I pray tell me, why doth the Cardinal (following <hi>Aquinas</hi> and other School-men) put in that tearm of Limitation, In the Face of God they ſee and know all things that concern them. We know, all things are in God, and in him repreſented as in a Glaſs and Mirror: and therefore Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great asks the Queſtion: <note n="m" place="margin">Quid eſt, quod ibi neſciant ubi ſcientem omnia ſciunt?</note> 
                  <hi>What can they be ignorant of, who know him that knoweth all things?</hi> And therefore, <hi>In spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo Trinitatis</hi> (as the Schools ſpeak) in the Beatifical Viſion, one would think all things ſhould be manifeſt to the Saints and Angels, and not only ſuch things as concern them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>The reaſon is plain: God is <hi>Speculum voluntarium,</hi> ſuch a Glaſs as repreſents according to his good pleaſure, and what he thinks meet,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44749:83"/>
unto thoſe who have the happineſs to ſee his Face: And therefore the Angels, who alwaies behold the Face of God, yet know not all things; not the day of Judgment; not the Myſtery of Chriſts Incarnation, and Mans Redemtion; not the calling of the Gentiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> until they learn'd theſe things by the Preaching of the Goſpel amidſt the Congregation of the Faithful: ſo ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 10. <hi>To the end that now unto Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers in Heavenly places, might be known by the Church, the manifold Wiſdom of God.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Your Anſwer is rational, and excellently ſerves my purpoſe: Such as ſee the Face of God, do not, in that Beatifical Viſion ſee and know all things, but only ſuch things as pleaſeth him to revele unto them. And therefore the fourth Opinion which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> mentions, was, <hi>That God doth revele unto the Saints, in every inſtant, ſuch Particulars as concern them; and ſo, when Praiers are made unto them, the Lord makes the Bleſſed Saints to know and hear their Praiers, by particular Revelation.</hi> Hereupon, I demand how this is prov'd, That it is the good pleaſure of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to revele unto the Saints whatſoever doth concern them; or all the Praiers that are made unto them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I do not find the Cardinal attemts to prove this; becauſe he had reaſon to take it for granted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Or rather becauſe he had no proof to offer: and in truth, he doth not ſo well approve this way of particular Revelation from God to the Saints, becauſe, as he argues well, <note n="n" place="margin">Si indigerent Sancti novâ revelatione, Eccleſia non diceret omnibus Sanctis, Orate pro nobis, ſed peteret aliquando à Deo ut eis revelaret preces noſtras.</note> 
                  <hi>If the Saints know our Praiers which we make to them, by Revelation from God, we ſhould not ſo conſtantly ſay to them, Pray for us; but rather ſomtimes beſeech Almighty God, that he would pleaſe to revele our Praiers to thoſe Saints we Invocate.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>He prefers that Opinion as moſt profitable, That the Saints in Glory, alwaies ſtanding in the preſence of God, and beholding his Face, do in that Beatificall Viſion behold all things which rela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e unto them; and need no particular Revelation, and therefore, in the Viſion of God, they know and hear the Praiers that are made unto them, even from the firſt inſtant of their Beatitude.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>And ſo three waies <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth not approve whereby the Saints and Angels are concern'd to know our ſtate and hear our Praiers. Now the fourth which he ſticks too, That from the firſt inſtant of their happineſs, all things which concern them, are manifeſt and revel'd unto them. This cannot be true, for then the Saints muſt know when they ſhall reaſſume their Bodies (which certainly concerns them) and ſo by conſequence, They muſt know the Day of the general Reſurrection, and of Judgment, which we deny: They muſt alſo know all the Praiers that ſhall be made to them unto the Worlds end, and ſo, by conſequence, the end of the World. So muſt the Angels, from the beginning, know the Praiers that ſhall be made to them, the laps'd ſtate of Man, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demtion
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44749:83"/>
by Chriſt, and other Myſteries, which were made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſaith the Apoſtle, in the Churches, by the Miniſtery of the Goſpel. See <hi>Eſtius</hi> in 4. <hi>Sent. diſt. 46. Paragr. 19. p.</hi> 294. And ſo while your Doctors, without any warrant of Scripture, generally lay this for a Foundation, That the Saints in Heaven do know our ſtate, and bear our Praiers: when they come to the proof and confirmation, every one abounds in his own ſenſe, and they eaſily confute one anothers Reaſons and Opinions, and manifeſt unto their Readers, upon due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that they are full of uncertainties in the Point, which they take for granted, and can urge only fallible Arguments to confirm that which they would have receiv'd by all Men as a meſur'd Truth, but we have not learn'd to ſubſcribe to Mens Dictates. And you acknowledg, your Doctor makes not proof of his Aſſertion, which is a great defect, this being the main Hinge whereupon the Controverſie turns. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, there is no reaſon we ſhould call upon the Saints when they do not hear us; as a Child doth not ask his Fathers Bleſſing when he is out of hearing. Now you aſſert with <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> That the Saints in Heaven out of doubt do hear us, but you know not how. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, ſay you, that in the Face of God they ſee and know all things that concern them, but give no reaſon of that probability: and is it fit that a Doctrine of your Church, which takes up in that part the Devotion of all Gods People, ſhould be grounded only upon ſuch a probability, whereof you can give no reaſon: How can I call upon the Saints with Faith and Comfort, when I have no aſſurance that they can hear me? I may, with as much reaſon, daily beg the Praiers of pious Friends, who live far from me, and ſay, It is probable God will revele to them that I deſire the aſſiſtance of their Praiers.</p>

               <p>Your Inſtance runs not parallel: Our condition here is a ſtate of ignorance; their's a ſtate of comprehenſion: They can ſee the Face of God, and live for ever: they certainly know all things which tend to their conſummation in Bliſs, for they are arriv'd at the ſtate of Perfection, and perfect Knowledge is the foundation of their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>

               <p>I preſume you mean not from the beginning of Chriſtianity: you have heard how the attemt of your Doctors to prove it out of Gods Word, hath been altogether unſucceſsful: and ſome of your Doctors have confes'd, that it is delivered in Holy Scripture very obſcurely; and others have ſhew'd the reaſon, even the humility and modeſty of the Apoſtles, which with-held them from publiſhing this Doctrine, leaſt they ſhould appear to make themſelves as Gods after their deceaſe, by requiring the People of God to make their Praiers and Supplications to them.

And here we may juſtly ſtand amaz'd, to find your Learned Cardinal cite this Canon as of the ſixth general Council, when he could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how that Council made no Canons; only he was willing to found the Doctrine of Saints Invocation upon the Autority of general Councils, and you ſee how ſhamefully he hath pretended to them: If this be the way to uphold their Church, <hi>Let not my ſoul enter into their Councils.</hi> Your Doctor cites likewiſe the next general Council, the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> of which I have given you formerly an Hiſtorical large account. It inſtituted the worſhip of Images, and did allow the Invocation of Saints; but this was held 800 Years after Chriſt, about which time this Superſtitious Worſhip of the Saints was publicly avowed. From the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> proceeds to the Teſtimony of ſix Provincial Councils, which ſpeak not to his purpoſe. They appoint the Litanies of their Churches to be ſolemnly uſed in the times allotted for them: now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Saints are praied to in their new Litanies, therefore your Cardinal ſuppoſeth, they were ſo in the old; and whereſoever he finds a command for the uſe of Litanies, there he infers Invocation of Saints commanded. And the Council of <note n="c" place="margin">Bin. Tom 6. Concil. Moguntinum. c. 32. Adrogandum Deum, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Mentz</hi> is one of them which your

               <p>It is his Artifice to ſet out a weak Argument, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt confidence, for this place doth not prove the Point: He ſhould prove the Invocation of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and the Saints, and he attemts to ſhew her Advocation.</p>

Neither can you conceive, that now ſhe makes Interceſſion for the Mother of all living. None of your Doctors can be ſo cruel, as to keep our Mother <hi>Eve</hi> ſo long in Purgatory. <hi>Ireneus</hi> his plain meaning is this, <hi>That as by the prevarication of the Virgin</hi> Eve, <hi>all her Poſterity did ſuffer; ſo by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Bleſſed Virgin to the Angels Meſſage, and by the Bleſſed Fruit of her Womb, all Man kind is comforted and relieved.</hi> We have not <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> his Works in Greek, as they were firſt written.

               <p>To proceed: We find in the ſame Century, how <hi>Cyprian,</hi> a Bleſſed Martyr, was ſo far perſwaded of the Saints Interceſſion in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that as he deſired, in his Epiſtles to him, the Praiers of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Pope living. So farther, <q>That he would pleaſe to enter with him into a ſerious Engagement, That whether of them, by Divine dignation, ſhould firſt leave the World, he ſhould be mindful to perſevere with God in ſervent Praier for his Brethren, the Faithful, left behind him. <note n="c" place="margin">Tom. 2. l. de diſc.

               <p>This is an Inſtance of Praier to the living, for their aſſiſtance, when they ſhould be tranſlated into Heaven; but nothing to the Point, of the Invocation of Saints departed. It was his private Opinion, That
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44749:89"/>
the Saints in Heaven might retain the remembrance and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Friends and Relations whom they left behind, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them particularly in their Praiers; but not diſtinctly know their condition, or hear their Praiers if they ſhould call upon them: this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtipulation before their deceaſe, rather implies, that they conceiv'd they ſhould not have opportunity after ones deceaſe, for the other to call upon him. And now good Friend, having conferr'd notes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the Teſtimony of the three firſt Centuries of Chriſtianity, there appears none for the Invocation of the Saints departed, <hi>not ſo much as any foot-ſteps of this Doctrine before Cyprians</hi>

               <p>Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was but a young Divine, a novice and Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumen when he was choſen Bishop of <hi>Millam:</hi> he was train'd up in Civill affairs, pleading Cauſes, &amp; as a Deputy of the Country admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring juſtice; &amp; therfore we have no teaſon to ground our Faith upon his dictates. He ſpeaks often piouſly, but not alwaies Orthodoxly: do you allow that paſſage of his in this very proof? <note n="a" place="margin">Qui proprio ſanguine laverunt, ſi qua habuerunt peccata.</note> 
                  <q>The Martyrs, if they had any ſins, have washt them away with their own Blood.</q> The Bleſſed Apoſtle tells us, 1 Joh. 1. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Immediatly before theſe words which Bellarmin quotes, S.

                  <q>The flesh is weak, the mind ſick, and feter'd with the chains of ſin; and ſo we cannot creep to the Phyſician, but muſt call upon the Angels and Martyrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Where do you read in H. Scripture, that the ſick, to wit, the ſinner cannot come to Chriſt the Phyſitian? did he not come <hi>to call ſinners,</hi> to invite <hi>the weary and heavy laden to come to him, and find rest?</hi> you shall hear other Fathers generally contradicting this Doctrine of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and the Holy Scripture much more; yet this is the uſual pretence for Saints Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Interceſſion, That we are unworthy of our ſelves to draw neer to an Holy God, &amp; to put up our ſupplications to him: of which more hereafter, &amp; herein S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> contradicts what he hath piouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented upon the firſt chap. of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom.</hi> in the 4 chap. of his Commentary. <note n="c" place="margin">Solent miſerâ uti excuſatione, per iſtos poſſe ire ad Deum, ut per Comites ad Reg.</note> 
                  <q>This is the miſerable excuſe, ſaith he, that by Angels and Saints, we may have acceſs to God, being unworthy of our ſelves to come unto him, as we go to the King by his Courtiers.</q> For which he anſwers, <note n="d" place="margin">Ideo per Tribunos &amp; Comites, itur ad Regem, quia homo eſt, &amp;c. Ad Deum a. promerendum, qui omnium novit merita, ſuffragatore opus non eſt, ſed mente devotâ.</note> 
                  <q>Therefore we come to the King by his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes and Officers, becauſe the King is a man, and muſt receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from others: but to obtain the favor of God; who knoweth all mens deſerts, we need no ſuffragants but a devout mind: whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuch a one calls upon Him, he will anſwer him.</q> Nothing could be more directly oppos'd to your uſuall plea for the Invocation of Saints. The ſame Father in his book <hi>de Iſaac. &amp; Anima</hi> cap. 5 tells us from the third chap. of <hi>Canticles,</hi> and the third verſ. <note n="e" place="margin">Anima quae Deum quaerit tranſit custodes, enim ſunt mysteria quae etiam Ang. concupiſcunt videre.</note>

will take his adviſe in the other. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> brings the teſtimony of many other Fathers of the later Ages of the Church; and I muſt confeſs I am almoſt tired in following him, eſpecially ſeeing you ſo dextriouſly shift him off. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> ſpeaks home to the point in the latter end of his Oration opon <hi>Theodorus</hi> a Martyr, thus: <q>We want many benefits, doe thou become our Legat with the King of Heaven. Thou art not ignorant of humane neceſſities, procure peace for us. That we have bin ſafe and ſound hitherto we aſcribe it to thee. If you want more aſſiſtance take in the quire of your Brethren the Martyrs.

               <p>This is ſufficient to your purpoſe; you need look no further. But I pray tell me, do you take him for an Orator or Divine in theſe paſſages?

               <p>Why did not the Holy Father make that inference himſelf? or make his Application to them in praier? we ſay, becauſe he did not approve the doctrine of praiers to the Saints in Heaven. All that he exhorts his hearers unto in the cloſe of his Panegyrick is this: <q>To go unto the Monuments of theſe Martyrs with faith and joy, that by the ſight of their shrines, and remembrance of their glorious ſufferings they may reap much fruit, and ſo live, That they may share in their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</q> Would he not have encouraged the people of God to pray unto theſe Martyrs, if he had thought it beneficial or duty?

He ſaith the Council condemns not all Veneration of Angels, but only ſuch as is proper to God the ſupreme Deity: and yet accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own relation, <hi>Simon Magas,</hi> and the Jewiſh Chriſtians that worſhipt Angels, did not worship them as the Supreme Deity, but only as ſubordinate Interceſſors. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul and the Councel of <hi>Laoduea</hi> condemns this: <hi>That in voluntary humility they should deprive them ſelves of that priviledg to come to God themſelves, and ſo make way unto him by the Interceſſion of Angels.</hi> The Apoſtle therefore and the Council ſorbid this inferior worship, as Theodoret obſerves, <note n="f" place="margin">Ne precarentur Angelos.</note> 
                  <hi>That they should not pray to the Angels to make way for them unto the Great God.</hi> And in the next chap. of S. Paul to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> verſ. 17. the Apoſtle commanding as <hi>Whatſoever we do either in word or deed to do all in the name of our Lord Jeſus, giving thanks to God, and the Father by him.</hi> Theodorets Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, <note n="g" place="margin">Deo &amp; Patri gratiarum actionem emittite, per ipſum, non per Angelos.</note> 
                  <hi>Offer up to God your ſacrifice of praiſe by Him, not by the Angels.</hi> Again we find not one ſyllable either in Theodoret, or the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> concerning <hi>Simon Magus</hi> or his hereſie, but only thoſe Chriſtians which did worship and pray to Angels. To conclude this Anſwer, It is the miſerable device of the Schools to shift off evident &amp; unanſwerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,

                  </gap> which apparteins on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God: but an inferior worship call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: or if any were ſo bold to maintaine, That <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is due to the Croſs, or the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet it is in a relative and inferior manner.

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Vale ô Paula, &amp; Cultoris tui ultimam ſenectutem orationibus juva.</note>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>From other evident paſſages of that Father, we conclude This to be a Rhetorical Apoſtrophe, and not the judgment &amp; practiſe of S. <hi>Jerom</hi> to pray unto the Saints departed. For in his book againſt <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius,</hi> he firſt aſſerts, That Martyrs are not to be worshipt. <note n="b" place="margin">Quis aliquando Martyres adoravit?</note>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Praier is a part of religious worship due to God, if you mean only civil requeſts, ſuch as one Chriſtian makes to another to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him in his praiers, we would not deny it to the Saints in Heaven, could we be aſſur'd that they do hear us. But to proceed, <hi>Jerom</hi> doth not bring one ſyllable to aſſert the Invocation of Saints; altho, if his jugdment had inclin'd the ballance that way, he had occaſion given by <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> whoſe Aſſertion was, <hi>That while we live we may pray one for another,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Post mortem nullus audet pro aliis deprecari.</note> 
                  <hi>but none praies for other after death.</hi> Againſt this <hi>Jerom</hi> riſeth with great indignatien: <hi>If the bleſſed Apoſtles and Martyrs while in the flesh could pray for others, how much more after they are crown'd?</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Poſtquam cum Chriſto eſſe cepermt minus valebunt?</note> 
                  <hi>shall they prevail leſs with Christ now they are with him?</hi> This is ſomewhat for their Interceſſion, but not for their Invocation. Nay, in his funeral O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon <hi>Nepotian</hi> dedicated to <hi>Heliodorus, Jerom</hi> ſaith expreſly: <note n="e" place="margin">Quicquid dixero, quia ille non audit, mutum videtur.</note> 
                  <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I ſay of him tis but ſilence, ſeeing he heareth not.</hi> And in the cloſe of the Oration, he ſaith: <note n="f" place="margin">Cum quo loqui non poſſumus, de eo loqui nunquam deſinamus.</note> 
                  <hi>Seeing we cannot ſpeak to him or with him, let us never ceaſe to ſpeak of him;</hi> now making praiers to the deceaſed is ſpeaking to them, and not of them.</p>

                  <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in the next Chapter, will ſhew what he meant by this recommendation. The pious Mother, ſaith he, did deſire her Son ſhould be buried in the Martyrs Temple, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that ſo his Soul ſhould reap ſome benefit from the Martyrs merits: And then he immediatly adds. <note n="b" place="margin">Hoc quod ita credidit ſuppli catio, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>This belief of hens was a kind of Praier, and if any thing did profit her Son, This, was it.</hi> You plainly ſee how doubtfully the good Father ſpeaks concerning the benefit of burial near a Martyr; and how he expreſly interprets praying to the Saint, to be, our believing that by his Merits we ſhall reap ſome advantage to our Souls. He proceeds in that Book to ſhew, That altho there have bin appearances of Ghoſts, complaining, That their Bodies did lie unburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet theſe things may come to paſs by Divine permiſſion, thro the Miniſtry of good or evil Angels: the Spirit departed knowing nothing of the Apparition. He gives an Inſtance of an Executor, who after his Fathers deceaſe, was much diſtreſſed with the demand of a great Debt, which was ſuppoſd to have bin paid; but having no Diſcharge to ſhew, it was like to lie upon him: Mean-while, his Father appears to him, and directs him to the place where he ſhould find the Acquittance, and a full diſcharge of the Debt. Now by this Apparition, Men may be apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That the deceas'd Father underſtood and compaſſionated his Sons condition, and came to his relief; and yet, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Auguſtin, All this might come to paſs by Divine Providence, without his deceaſed Fathers know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> And gives an Inſtance of himſelf, appearing to a Friend of his in his Dream, whiliſt himſelf knew nothing of it. <hi>Eulogius</hi> was to read a ſolemn Lecture before a great Auditory in <hi>Carthage,</hi> upon <hi>Tullies</hi> Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric; and one obſcure paſſage there was which he did not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and was very ſolicitous how to interpret it: <hi>And lo! the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Auguſtine, as</hi> Eulogius <hi>declares, I appeared to him in his Dream, and ſhew'd him an appoſite ſenſe of the Words.</hi> This is in the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Book. In the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> he concludes, That of ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, whether of Perſons living or defunct, are made to others, themſelves being altogether ignorant thereof. And he concludes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That there is no commerce between the living and the dead, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my moſt deer Mother would have often appear'd to me, and

manifeſted her care and love; for God forbid, That I ſhould think ſhe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cruel by her ſtate of Happineſs.</hi> And if our Parents and neareſt Friends have no communion with us after death, How ſhould others thay are Strangers. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Auguſtin</hi> goes on to tell us. That the Children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> expreſly ſay to God, <hi>Iſaiah 63. 16. Surely thou art our Father, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> Abraham <hi>be ignorant of us, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>acknowledge us not. That</hi> Joſiah <hi>was gathered to his Fathers, that his eyes might not ſee the evil which ſhould be brought upon</hi> Jeruſalem, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 20. implying, That after death he ſhould not know it. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <note n="b" place="margin">Ibi ſunt spiritus defuncti ubi non vident quae hic aguntur, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>The Souls of dead Men are where they do not ſee what things are done here below; And how then can they ſee their own Tombs?</hi> And whereas <hi>Abraham</hi> did know <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, and their Writings, when he directed <hi>Dives</hi> his Brethren unto them, <hi>He might know them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by their own Relation after their deceaſe.</hi> In the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapter</hi> he concludes fully, <note n="c" place="margin">Fatendum eſt Neſcire Mortuos, quid hic agatur.</note> 
                  <hi>We muſt confeſs that the dead do not know what is here done, unleſs ſomthing may be made known to them by the relation of Angels, or perſons lately deceas'd,</hi> And whereas, ſaith he, at the Shrines and Monuments of Martyrs, Miracles have bin wrought, and Martyrs themſelves have appear'd to the living, yet they might not themſelves know that they did appear; as we read, That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> appear'd to <hi>Saul</hi> in <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> himſelf knowing not of it, until the Lord acquainted him therewith, <q>The Lord ſaid unto <hi>Ananias,</hi>

                  <q>Such Miracles at the Shrines of Martyrs may be done, by Gods permiſſion, thro the Miniſtry of Angels and Holy Powers, in honor of the Saints, and for the benefit of Men; the Saints themſelves being enter'd into the higheſt reſt, and attending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to more excellent things, being ſequeſtred from us, and praying for us.</q>

of the living for the dead, that will fall into conſideration hereafter. Now as this excellent Father is voluminous, ſo are there ſcattered in his Works many other Paſſages to take us off from the Invocation of Saints, That even at their Shrines we ought not to pray to them, but to God. <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 8.

                  <hi>We honor God by Praier, and ſend up this beſt and moſt holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi> Our Praiers therefore, are the moſt acceptable Sacrifices from us to God. (Of your tranſcendent Sacrifice of the Maſs, we may, God willing, treat hereafter.) Again in his firſt <hi>Tom. Lib.

                  </q> Religion therefore binds me to one Omnipotent God. The good Father often tells us, That the Bleſſed Saints and Angels expect no ſuch ſervice from us, but expreſly, ſaith he, they direct us to pray to God. <q>

               <p>I dare not call evil good, neither have I learn'd the Art of your Doctors, to undertake the defence of great Impieties, and Blaſphemies, and make them plauſible by a diſtinction. The next general Council (as you reckon) was that of <hi>Trent:</hi> where we have the Doctrine of the Invocation of Saints eſtabliſht, and all thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Impious who think otherwiſe. And altho the Council pen'd the decree in moſt cautious terms, (being awakened with the exceptions of reformed Churches,) <note n="a" place="margin">Concil. Trid. ſeſſ. 25.</note> yet we may plainly there diſcover, That it is not their Praiers only which we muſt ſue for, but alſo the help, and ſuccor of the Saints in Heaven. <hi>It is good and profitable humbly to call upon them, and to fly to their Praiers, and aid, and help.</hi> If the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had intended only the Aſſiſtance of their Praiers, they would not have multiplied terms without cauſe in their decree. But in theſe words they have left open a Gap, for the Saints votaries to juſtify their Praiers to the Saints for their aid, and protection, to expect effectual favours from them, not only by their Praiers, but alſo by their Active powers. Theſe things will eaſily fall under this clauſe of the Decree, <hi>Ad eorum orationes, opem, auxiliumque, confugere.</hi>

               <p>Your practiſe will beſt interpret your Rule. If the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic praiers of your Church requeſt more of the Saints in Heaven, then the aſſiſtance only of their Praiers, you may ſuppoſe your Church intended, and underſtood, and expreſt more in her decree. You ſhall find your Church often to ſupplicate, <hi>That as well by the Merits, as by the Interceſſion of the Saints, God would be favourable unto them.</hi> In the Hymnes above mentioned, to the Virgin Mary, ſhe is call'd the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Grace, and mercy,</hi> and Protection from our Ghoſtly Enemy is ſought from her, and reception into Glory. So likewiſe in the hymne of the Apoſtles, Grace, and Vertue is deſired of the Saints for ſuch as languiſh in their Vices. And that by the <hi>command of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> as it is expreſt, and not by their Praiers. And yet <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath the confidence to interpret all theſe things, according to the ſenſe of the Church, as he ſpeaks, <hi>That all theſe things are expected from their Praiers, not from any other aſſiſtance.</hi> You ſhall find ſeveral Popes in the Names of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> promiſing great things unto Princes, who ſhall engage in the defence, and cauſe of the Church, and threatning dreadfull Judgments from them upon ſuch as are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient.

it repreſents Chriſt as a Judg by her praiers and mediation to be appeas'd, the bleſſed Virgin becoming our Interceſſor unto Chriſt. And ſo by the ſtamp of public Authority, you ſee theſe extravagancies confirm'd, which above you would not juſtify, as being the fancies, as you call'd them, of private perſons. Now in confutation of ſuch blaſphemies the Holy Scriptures shew Chriſt to be our Advocate until the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not a juige: <q>A merciful and faithful High-Prieſt in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God, Hebr. 2. 17. Hebr. 4. 15. 16. For we have not High Prieſt, which cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points temted like as we are, yet without ſin: Let us therefore come boldly, ſaith the Apoſtle, unto the Throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy.</q> It is the deſign of Holy Scripture, to make poor ſinners come with confidence and comfort to Chriſt and to the Father. It is the deſigne of your Church to diſcourage them with a ſenſe of their unworthineſs, and to teach them to look upon Chriſt as a ſevere Judge, that ſo they may fly to the Virgin Mother, and to the Saints to be their Mediators and Interceſſors. Nothing is more oppoſite to the Covenant of Grace, to the Love of God, towards ſuch as are reconcil'd in Chriſt, to the tender compaſſion of our bleſſed Saviour, and to the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Invitations of the Goſpel. And upon this account I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your Doctrine of the Saints Invocation and Interceſſion, to be a damnable doctrine, deſtructive to the Souls of men.</p>

He was indeed a Martyr for the Pope, ſtanding ſo highly for his Authority in the juſtification of Appeals to Rome, and not ſubmitting the Clergy to the Laws of the Realm, that he betrai'd his Native Cuntry to a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Juriſdiction, and became a rebel to the King and Kingdom. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was banish'd divers years, and by the intereſt of his great Patron the Pope in neigboring Princes, he created great vexation &amp; trouble unto his lawfull Prince, King Henry the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. After 7. years a reconciliation was made by the mediation of the Pope and other Princes between the King and him, and he return'd into England, the King abiding in his Territories

               <p>Now it is reduc'd unto the Pope: what aſſurance have you of his infallible Judgment? For it is obſerv'd, he hath proceeded much by favor and affection in this Affair, gratifying Princes in their Requeſts for their Relations and Country-men.

               <p>The Infallibility of the Pope in his Determinations, è <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> which you moſt unreaſonably maintain, and whereupon you lay the Foundation of your new-coin'd Articles of Faith, may fall into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration (if God permit) hereafter; mean-while, the Objection turns not altogether upon that hinge: for altho the Pope were infallible in his Canonization, that is, for a general Reception and Veneration; no Saint without the Popes allowance muſt be publicly and generally call'd upon in Praier: Yet <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants the Invocation of other Saints by privat Perſons, and ſaith, <hi>It is the common Opinion of the Doctors.</hi> Now I pray obſerve the Inconveniencies from hence: A Wife who hath loſt a deer Husband, or Children their Parents, they uſually follow them with paſſionate Affection, and prize them higher, being bereft of them, then when they had the happineſs of their Society. Now as other civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is intercepted by death, if communion with them by Invocation and Praier may be allowed, what will be the exceſs of their Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Devotion in this caſe. Affection and Charity, will conclude their Friends deceas'd are undoubted Saints in Heaven, and their Piety will alwaies promt them to call upon them for aſſiſtance and protection, as being moſt aſſur'd of their readineſs to help them, even to the uttermoſt. And ſo when Men and Women ſhould be inſtant in Praier to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, the ſtream of their Devotion will be carried on towards their Relations who are gon to God before them: and ſo the higheſt act of Religion, Praier, with all its Pervors and Devotion, will evaporate in

emty Supplications made to thoſe, of whoſe happineſs Men have no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, but from their fond and fallible Eſtimations: and ſo between the Invocation of Saints that are, and of others ſuppoſed to be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the God of Heaven is almoſt forgotten in your Praiers, according to that proverbial Speech grounded upon your intolerable Exceſſes in this Point, <note n="a" place="margin">Non cognoſcitur Deus inter Sanctos.</note>
