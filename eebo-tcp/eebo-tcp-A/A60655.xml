            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not to be questioned but the Rulers and people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do acknowledge and confess that Christ Jesus is their Redeemer and Saviour, &amp; that they are Christians through the Faith they have in his death and Resurrection, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be hoped that the ensuing matter may meet with better respect and entertainment in Relation to Christ an practice, for Christian practice is always an acceptable thing to a Christian Nature and life, because nature is delighted in that which is in agreement with it, and the first being stated as a thing not questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the latter may be more fully opened and presented for the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony will not break where the matter is substantial in its ground and nature, for whatsoever breaketh harmony doth alter the course of Nature by malignity, for Christianity is concurrent in all passages without any malignity in it self to let or hinder, and in this Harmony the Lord God hath his glory, and where it is not so, it is but Christianity professed which wanteth the substantial ground and nature of a Christian Life, and the Title of a spiritual Prospective Glass comprehends the whole matter by allusion for most people know that it is the property of a visible Prospective Glass to discover visible things plainly, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise are obscure and not to be clearly discerned, and by that means many comes to be satisfied concerning a thing by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it so fully as to know what it is even so must all people come to know and be satisfied concerning spiritual things, by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the Light and Spirit of God, for spiritual things are spiritually discerned, and the Light and Spirit of God doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover spiritual things as they are in nature and Life, and in that discovery there is no deceiveableness by any false presentation or object, but a true discovery of the substance of spiritual things by which the Soul hath great benefit and comfort, and with this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

and so the things of God are revealed by his spirit and taught by his spirit, and they that receive the Spirit they know the things of God in it, and here is the spiritual mind in which is life and peace, and he that hath a spiritual mind is a spiritual man, and that man is fit to judge of spiritual things, because he sees them in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and knows them in the spirit, and therefore able to give sound judgement which the natural man cannot do, for the natural man runs into error by believing in false objects, which darkness presenteth to his view, and as he receives it into his beliefs so he holds it in his judgement and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion as if it was the truth, for error is a mistaking of things as to the truth that is in them, and that was the <hi>Sadduces</hi> condition concerning the Resurrection, and Christ said unto them, <hi>ye do err not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God, for if they had known the Scriptures and the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Examine your selves and your condition by these few questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for these good and holy things are witnessed by such as are regenerated and born again, and except you be regenerated and born again, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, and can your Souls be satisfied out of Gods Kingdom, and is it not the greatest concernment to know an entrance into the Kingdom of God, where the Soul comes to be satisfied in rest and peace, and comfort and happiness, and so there is a coming out of the first <hi>Adams</hi> transgression as the light and power of the second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> is obeyed in manifestation and operation, for the operation of the light and power of Christ Jesus the second <hi>Adam</hi> makes a new creature and they that receive Christ in his light and power to come into Union with him they are new creatures, and new creatures are Christians in Nature and Life, and the Spirit bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witness with their spirits that they are the sons of God; and in such all old things are done away, and all things are become new, and so they are in the New Covenant with a new heart, and a new spirit which God gives them, and puts into them, and these are the people who now worship God in the spirit, and rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh, and so they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the life and practice of new creatures, and Christians in times past, and this keeps the harmony and doth not break it, for the same righteousness, Unity, and Peace, runs as a natural stream in the same light, spirit, life, and power that is in Christ Jesus, and if you come to love this, and live in this and walk in this, your souls will come into Righteousness, Unity and peace, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a comfortable and happy being; but if you gain-say: resist and withstand the light of Christ when it testifieth in your consciences, and love darkness rather then light, your souls are in sorrow and heaviness, whatsoever you may profess of Christianity in your judgement and opinion, for there can be no sound judgement or opinion, but in the Light and power of Christ Jesus, and they

that resist the Light they err in what they hold as to their Judgement and opinion in spiritual things; for the ground of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is ignorance, and the ground of ignorance is darkness, and then such as love darkness rather then light must needs live in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and not in the truth whatever they profess, and Righteousness, unity and peace will never spring out of darkness and error, for where ignorance maintains an error it usually maintains it by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and force against such as hold the contrary, and that will never do the thing that is right, and so cannot be Righteous or bring forth Righteousness, nor never will bring into unity and peace; but provokes unto Wrath, Envy, and Strife, and so it is plain that error in Judgement and opinion touching the way and worship of God is the veryground of persecution, for as dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness vaileth the understanding from the true knowledge of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, so it causeth ignorance and error in Judgement and opinion, and then worketh violently against all dissenters or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of that which it formeth and setteth up to be observed as the way and worship of God, and this breaks the harmony that stands in Righteousness, Unity, and peace, and can never bring comfort and happiness to any Soul, and is it the way and manner of Christians to practice the way of the heathens by whom they were first persecuted, and many destroyed, for did not the heathen Emperors cause the Christians to be persecured and destroyed for above 3 hundred years after Christ? and doth it become Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to walk in the heathens way of outrage and cruelty one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst another, or should they not love one another as Christ commandeth and live in Righteousness, Unity and peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and so judge the Heathens cruelty and not justifie them in it?</p>

Now in things of such weighty concernment there ought to be great regard to the well being of a Nation, for there is your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place to stand and rule not to meddle with spiritual things, but look after the well being of the nation, and to suppress vice and vanity that occasioneth mischief and injury, here stand in your places and exercise your power to the punishment of evil doers there your authority is to shew it self and not in punishing tender peaceable people for their conscience towards God, for perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution will never bring Righteousness, Unity and peace to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but always disturbs and disquiets the most setled conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so thus the consequence of persecution is for the most part strife and sedition, and yet under the colour of suppressing sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious meetings persecution is carried on as the best means to do it, and so that which is evil in it self would make a good thing to appear evil that it might appear against it as evil to make it self appear as if it was good, for this is to be observed that persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never appeared against any thing as if it was good, but as if it was evil, and so hath always had a cloak to cover it in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est fury, for such as are persecuted do always suffer as such that in the account of that spirit which persecuteth deserve the thing that is done for it is the general cry at this day by those that acts persecution or joyn with it, you deserve to suffer that will not obey the Kings Laws, and so would appear as if they were doing a good work with their violent hands, and will concern the King and his Laws in what they do, but such never yet looked thorow the <hi>Spiritual Prospective Glass</hi> to see things as they are, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they follow evil as if it was good, and would suppress the good as if it was evil, and so are evil doers, and who will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that an evil doer obeys the Kings laws, and if it be those that do well that are such, then the Innocent <hi>Quakers</hi> do not deserve that punishment as some inflicteth upon them under colour of disobeying the Kings Laws, and what work doth this make in the Nation, doth it not make the nation like broken shattered

Now let this be your pattern and example which produced such a good effect, Act by this, and walke by this, that you may follow the principle of God in you as your rule to guide you, that your purposes may not stend in wilful resolutions as not to be easily intreated, for if it be so with you there is cause for you to question whether the wisdome from above direct you in your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and if by that you be not directed you may soon erre in what yea doe, nay, you may possibly erre in all you doe, for the wisdom of God in the sure foundation for all laws to stand upon, and be ministred from, and if law stand upon any other thing, or bs ministred from any other thing it cannot clearly answer truth and righteousness either in the fountain or stream, for where laws are made and ministred in a wilful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and purpose against a thing, the matter is mostly resolvedly prosecuted to accomplish the thing intended and by such actions and paaceedings there is no sufferer can have any benifit of the law for his own

right in cases of manifest wrong, for where resolution is both rule and law it will carry the stream in its own channell with that force as nothing may stop it and this only law pretended to answer to the resolution and purpose intended.</p>
            <p>Well Friends, whatsoever you, or any of you may purpose or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ageinst us called <hi>Quakers,</hi> of this you may be sure that we do not purpose or intend any harm unto you, but really desire that it may be well every way with you, and in this we can approve our selves to God, and it cannot be disproved by you, for ye very well know how we have behaved our selves amongst you and towards you for many years, and you cannot justly charge us with any alteration as to our peaceable life, and civil deportment, but what we have been in love, and peace, and good will amongst you and towards you, we are still the same, for our principle doth not vary and change in its nature and life, and as we are preserved by it, to live in it we continue in the same mind and you have no cause to be jealous of us as seditious persons, or contrivers of Insurrections, or any way such as would do you the least wrong or injury, or any body living, and as we have never offered injury to you, or you received any injury by us, it is certainly below you as men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat us evil, and we are very sure that wherein you purpose or intend any harm to us with a resolution to perform it that such purpose or intention will be much more against your selves if you do not stop the action, and as you profess Christianity so it well be more honourable to your profession to cease from prosecution then to continue it, that so in your day and time the Righteous and Godly Christians may sit under their own vine, and under thir own Fig-tree in quietness and peace, for wilfull resolutions and purposes never did good unto any and if you would do good to your selves and the nation then mind humillity and the fear of the Lord, for the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdome and where wisdome orders there all things goes well, but where wisdome is wanting their all things goes wrong, and therefore it is your greatest concernment to wait for Gods wisdom to order you, for wisdome is better then strength, and if you take councell as is to be ordered by it then that which is wrong you will be willing to Right, and that which is Right you will be willing to maintain, and thereby take of all accasions by which the Innocent is vexed and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and that will not only bring peace to your own souls but also to the whole natios, and so both your own souls and the nation will have comfort and happiness and there every one will have the benefit of peace as they came to injoy it, and that is the onely end of this <hi>Spiritual
