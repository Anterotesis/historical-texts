            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>HOW d' ye Friend <hi>Will?</hi> have you
heard the News?</p>
            </sp>

               <p>What News d' ye mean
<hi>Iack?</hi> We have little cause to fear

            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>No? I'm sure I have a piece of ill News to
tell you. Did not you hear that my Lord Mayor
went to <hi>Salters-Hall</hi> on Sunday last, with the Sword
carried before him?</p>
            </sp>

               <p>To <hi>Salters-Hall,</hi> what to do? to a Play, or
a Ball there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Pox on ye for a nump-skull'd Fellow, to a
Play or a Ball on Sundays!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Why all this Fury, <hi>Iack?</hi> I'm sure I have
read a Play that was acted at <hi>Whitehall</hi> on a Sunday in
the Blessed Martyr's time, present King, Queen,
Prince, and God knows how many Stars and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
but indeed I don't know whether the Sword
was carried thither in State or no.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Come, come, <hi>Will;</hi> you love to play the
<unclear>Rogue</unclear>; you know the Lord Mayor went thither on
no such Account.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Why so? how sho'd I know? d' ye think I
am a Conjurer? What did he go thither for then?
was it to hear Archbishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Book of Sports?
I hear my Lord Mayor is a brisk Man, perhaps he
loves Sport and Pastime, and is a good Gamester;
for you know we use to say of such, <hi>that they play a
Sundays.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Plague on ye, leave off your Banter, I tell
you he went thither to a Conventicle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Pish, what is that your ill News? I was
afraid you'd have told me that he had gone to <hi>treat
the Pope's Nuncio at Dinner at</hi> Guildhall; or that you
had had some such frightful Story to tell me, <hi>as that
the Town was on fire again,</hi> and we should have been
forc'd to be at the Expence of a <hi>new Monument,</hi>
which would have ruin'd the Orphans to all Intents
and Purposes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Well well, Friend <hi>Will,</hi> tho the Town be
not a fire, I am sure the Church is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50482:3"/>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Nay then Friend <hi>Iack,</hi> my Lord Mayor did
very well to carry the <hi>wooden Sword</hi> away from it,
for that would have added Fewel to the Flames.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee leave off thy fooling, and let's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
the Point in good earnest; thou always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedst
to be a true Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-man, and
don't ye think that the Lord Mayor's going to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
with the Sword is an Injury to the Church of
<hi>England?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly <hi>Iack,</hi> whether thou believest it
or not, I am as much for the Church of <hi>England</hi> as
any Man alive, and for my part I think that my
Lord Mayor's going to Meetings with the Sword is
a very <hi>noble Act:</hi> for it seems to me, that by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sword thither, he designs to make a Conquest
of 'em for the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I see you love to banter: but you
know that by going thither with the Sword, he
makes a Surrender of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to a pitiful little Conventicle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Why prethee Man, if the Sword be all, no
matter if it had been burnt a dozen Years ago: Thou
knowest very well, that in the late Blessed Reigns it
was the peculiar Doctrine of the Pulpits, that the
Church had no other Weapons but Prayers and
Tears; and why dost make all this pother about a
wooden Sword? Sure thou art not afraid it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
as strange Effects as the old rusty Sword in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster
Abbey,</hi> with which they say the Norman
Duke conquer'd <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Thou talkst like a mad Man; it's not the
very individual Sword that I mean, but it's the Badg
and Ensign of Authority that is carried away from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50482:4"/>
the Church to a nasty lowzy Conventicle: a Pox on
'em, damn 'em, I hope to see 'em fast in the <hi>Pinfold</hi>
yet once more before I die; and then we'll make
'em pay for their Insolence, and Contempt of the
Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee don't rage so: thou hast been so out
of Humour ever since <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV was necessitated to
resign his new Conquests, and abjure King <hi>Iames,</hi>
that thou art fitter for <hi>Bedlam</hi> than any Place else.
Come, I tell thee, that my Lord Mayor's carrying
the Sword thither, neither adds to the Authority of
the Meetings, nor derogates from the Authority of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but rather enlarges her Pale.
But after all the do<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you make about the
Church, I believe I may say to you as the little Boy
said to his Mother, <hi>Mother, what need you talk so much
of the Church? you don't go so often to it.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>That's nothing to you <hi>Will:</hi> do you make
out your Assertion, and then I'll say something to
thee.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Have but Patience, and I will. Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
that the Dissenters are allowed their Meetings by
Act of Parliament, which I hope is another kind of
Authority than my Lord Mayor's Sword; and most
honest Men think it but reasonable they should have
that Liberty, notwithstanding the threatning Words
of the D—n of <hi>C. that if King</hi> William <hi>did not take
away the damn'd Act of Toleration, they'd send him back
again to the Bogs of</hi> Holland.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee let your Stories alone, and come to
the matter. I own that an Act of Parliament is a
better Authority than my Lord Mayor's Sword.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50482:4"/>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Thou knowest also that that Liberty is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd them on condition <hi>that they subscribe to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>I do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Why then it's certain that my Lord Mayor
could not go thither with nor without his Sword, if
the Dissenters did not qualify themselves according
to the Terms of the Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>No, he could not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not plain then, that if my Lord Mayor's
Sword signify any thing, it comes to defend the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at the Meeting as
well as in the Church? And is not his Presence there
with the Ensigns of Authority an Evidence that the
Doctrine of our Church is preach'd there? whereas
in former times the Meetings were look'd upon to be
quite another thing than the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
So that I think it is plain to any Man's Understanding,
that his being there is only a Declaration that the
Pale of the Church is enlarg'd, and that we now
own them for Brethren, that by the heat of some ill
Men were formerly accounted our Enemies!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Nay but you mistake the Matter. The
Meetings have only a Liberty, but ours is the Church
establish'd by Law; their Meetings must not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the Church, because they have neither
Bishops, nor Ceremonies, nor Benefices.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee <hi>Iack</hi> don't talk such Nonsense. The
Meetings are as much establish'd by Law as the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> if an Act of Parliament be a
Law: and you know that it's only the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

               <p>I am sure the Church is Apostolical, and

               <p>Thou art in a grand Mistake, <hi>Iack.</hi> I grant
you there was once such a Set of men as arrogated
to themselves the Name of the Church, that did so;
but you know that the greatest Divines of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> did always account those things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
even in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time: Read but the
Lord Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Letters, and you will
there find plain Proofs of it, under the Hands of our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50482:5"/>
greatest Bishops to the Divines in <hi>Switzerland:</hi> and
for what hath been done since, you know that it was
a Court, and a Popish Faction that enjoin'd those
things on such and such Penalties, merely to widen
the Differences amongst Protestants, that they might
swallow up both our Religion and Liberties; but
the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath altered her Mind
since.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>How! the Church of <hi>England</hi> alter'd her
Mind? What? d' ye make her akin to <hi>Mahomet?</hi>
as if her Religion depended upon the Moon, and
were as changeable as she.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee not so fast <hi>Iack,</hi> I know what I say;
the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath alter'd her Mind oftner
than once; and no Disgrace to her neither. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
hold no Church nor Council Infallible; we
have indeed an infallible Rule, the Scriptures, but
so long as we are clogg'd with Humanity, we are
either like to come short of it, or shoot beyond it;
and in both these Cases must alter our Mind, or set
our selves in opposition to the Almighty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>This is Fanatical Cant. When did the
Church of <hi>England</hi> alter her Mind?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Nay <hi>Iack,</hi> if you be so forgetful, I'll tell
you: The Church of <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s
time prayed her to cut off <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots, the
Heir apparent, or presumptive at least, to the Crown,
and a Crown'd Head too, because she was at the
Head of a Popish Plot. In <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's
time the Church of <hi>England</hi> damn'd all them that
were but for excluding the Duke of <hi>York</hi> upon the
like Account. In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time the Church
of <hi>England</hi> made an Act of Parliament, that the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50482:6"/>
King and Parliament might limit and alter the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession;
it is the 13th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> as I take it: In
<hi>Charles</hi> the First and Second's time they accounted it
damnable Doctrine to recede in the least from the
Her<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ditary Lineal Succession. In <hi>Charles</hi> the First
and Second's time she held it damnable not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Doctrines of Passive Obedience and Non-Resistance,
and all her Clergy were sworn to it in
her Sense: but in the end of <hi>Iames</hi> the Second's
Reign, when he came to touch their own Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
then the Church bellow'd so loud, that she
was heard as far as the <hi>Hague,</hi> she put on a blue
Cloak and Jack-boots, and fought against her Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
with Jack and Spear, and after all settled King
<hi>William,</hi> our present glorious Monarch, on the
Throne, contrary to all her former avow'd Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
So that you must either own that the Church
of <hi>England</hi> hath alter'd her Mind, or declare your
self a rank Jacobite, and disown any Church but
their Faction: and to tell you the truth, it's that
wretched Cabal that blows all these Sparks of
Contention among the hot-headed Party of our
Church, and I know you keep Company with
them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Thou hast said a great deal to convince
me; but pray let me see how the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
hath alter'd her Mind as to that Point of the
Dissenters.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Why they have alter'd it in giving them
their Liberty by a Law, whereas they formerly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted

               <p>How strangely do you talk? It was the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
that gave them the Liberty, and not the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50482:6"/>
Church; if she had done it, it must have been by
Convocation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Nay <hi>Iack,</hi> you talk strangely, and not I.
Is not all the People of <hi>England</hi> represented by the
Parliament?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Who doubts that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Is not the Church then represented in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>That's another thing: The Church is the
Bishops and their Clergy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Grant it be so: The Bishops you know do
actually sit in Parliament in the House of Lords; so
that you must own the Church is well enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
there where all her Fathers meet; and <unclear>you</unclear>
likewise know that the Clergy as Freeholders have
their Votes in chusing Members of the House of
Commons, so that there the Clergy is sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
nay better and more universally than in
any Convocation. Then you know the Laity of
the Church is truly represented in Parliament,
whereas they have no room in the Convocation,
which is only the Officers of the Church, and can
no more be call'd the Church it self, than Officers
without Souldiers can be call'd an Army. So that
when you inveigh against the Liberty given to our
Dissenting Brethren, you inveigh against the Church
of <hi>England</hi> her self, who by her Bishops and <unclear>other</unclear>
Representatives in Parliament have granted them
that Liberty: And tho they have <unclear>reserv'd</unclear> th<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

come into any Place of Power and Trust, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
their being Members of that Body of Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testants

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50482:7"/>
they have not restrain'd any of those Members
from frequenting other Meetings where the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Church is preach'd either with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Ensigns and Badges of their Office. So that
those Gentlemen who by their Order would go to
restrain an Act of Parliament, might do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how they will be able to justify themselves if
the Parliament should call them in question for it;
which they are more like to do than to turn his
Lordship out for acting conformably to the Law,
and the Practice of other Corporations, to whom
<hi>London</hi> ought rather to set a Pattern for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
the Liberties of the Subject, than to follow
them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Nay now thou speakest big, <hi>Will.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>I have reason for what I say. It's the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that hath settled the Limits of our Church,
and given her all the Authority she has, otherwise
'tis a mere Bull to call her the Church by Law esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd;
and that same Authority may enlarge her
Bounds and Pale when they please: and therefore
to be so angry at the Parliament for taking in all
those that embrace the Doctrine of the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Protection of the Law, tho it has not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
'em to partake of the Benefices, is a horrid
<unclear>piece</unclear> of Ingratitude to that August Assembly, who
have all along defended the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the
Possession of what she enjoys, more than her Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
the Dissenters; and by this Liberty the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
have added to her Strength, by giving those
a Legal Authority to defend her Doctrine without
Wages, which so many of those that profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be her Sons, have either slily undermin'd,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50482:7"/>
or but faintly asserted, notwithstanding their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
And you know, <hi>Iack,</hi> that the Dissenters
have been as stanch Patriots of their Country, and
Defenders of our Religion and Liberties, as any
Men in the Nation: and therefore it's the Interest
of all Men that wish well to either of 'em, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
a hearty Union amongst Protestants of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations
whatsoever. So that for my own part
I can see no harm in my Lord Mayor's carrying the
Sword to a Me<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ting as well as to a Church; it has
heard Passive Obedience preach'd long enough, and
it will do it no hurt to be taught the Doctrine of
Self-defence in its turn: for if the latter Doctrine
had not been more serviceable to us than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
we had neither had a Protestant Church nor
Meeting House to have carried the Sword to long
e're this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but for all that you can't but say it's
an ill thing to carry the Sword thither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee in what sense is it ill? For my part
I think the Sword ought to be carried thither rather
than any where else; b<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cause to give the Dissenters
their due, they always held that it was lawful to
make use of the Sword in defence of their Religion
and Liberties, as w<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reas many of our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would allow of no other Weapons against a
Tyrant at home but Prayers and Tears: but to say
the truth, and no more, that was only while the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
impowered them to tyrannize over the Bodies,
Consciences and Estates of their Fellow Christians
and Subjects; for when he came to touch themselves,
nay <hi>but one of their Fingers,</hi> as a famous Author has
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50482:8"/>
it, they made use of Guns and Spears, instead of
Prayers and Tears, against him; and <hi>let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,</hi>
as the same Author says, <hi>that they had given
him only a spiritual Kingdom, and not a Kingdom of
this World: for if his Kingdom had been of this World,
then would his Servants have fought for him.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iack.</speaker>
               <p>Ay but a pox on't, tho we allow our selves
to do so, yet we would not have the Dissenters use
the Sword; ours is the Apostolical Church, and
they are but Schismaticks.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>That's easier said than proved; they hold
the Doctrine of our Church, and live up to it as
well, if not better than many of our selves: so that
we must not c<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll Men <unclear>Schismaticks</unclear> for differing from
us in those things which we our selves account In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.
And as for the Sword, tho some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have thought fit to endeavour the preventing
its being carried to Meetings by an <unclear>Order</unclear>, I cannot
think that the Act of Parliament did ever intend to
make better Provision for our Swords than for our
Souls, or for the Ensigns of Magistracy than for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
themselves. If our Legislators had thought
the going to Meetings would be either hurtful to the
Bodies, Estates, Liberties, or Consciences of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Men, they would never have allow'd them at
all; and if they had thought that the Nation would
be any ways endangered by Magistrates going to
Meetings, they would have made an Exception
against it. So that for any Party of Men to take
upon them to bind up any Person, especially a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
of so great Power and Trust as the Lord
Mayor of <hi>London;</hi> where the Law has left him at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
seems to me to be a manifest Incroachment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50482:8"/>
the Legislative Power: and I wish with all my
Heart there may not be more of Envy and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Pique, (in such especially that are angry to see
the Lord Mayor have more Courage than some of
his Predecessors) than of Zeal for the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> at the bottom of this Opposition: for my
own part I know not why those Dissenters who have
so cordially contributed to deliver us from Tyranny
and Popery, should be suffered still to languish and
groan under the Yoke of an Ecclesiastical Tyranny
themselves, and be deprived of the Liberties and
Privileges that other English Protestants enjoy. So
farewel <hi>Iack</hi> till next Meeting.</p>
