            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But we like careleſſe children little regarding the carefull trauell that herein by them for vs is taken: looke onely to the time preſent, ſatiſfieng our ſenſuall luſt and deſire, not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the dangers and damages that thereby may vnto vs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes inſue and ſo runne headlong negligently and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row diſobedienee into our owne decay, contemning the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces commaundement which is Gods ordinance. Wherefore diuers pennalties and puniſhmentes are by vertue of thoſe lawes appointed to be laid vpon the diſobedient, which being executed, ſeeme grieuous and painefull and the informer greatly abhorred and euill thought on whereas in trueth, ſuch as giue information to the magiſtrate of offences with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire of reformation, and not only for couetouſneſſe, ought of good men rather to be loued and commended: for the life of the law is execution. Therefore a lawe made and not executed lieth dead, &amp; ſmall auaileth to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for which it was made.</p>
            <p>And as all pennall lawes at this day inforce, appeare verie needefull to be obſerued yet are ſome of them more requiſite to be looked into, for the vniuerſall benefite of a common-wealth then ſome other, for that by proofe they import matters of greater waight, yet the effect not conſidered of, they ſeeme of little valew.</p>

But in continuance of time, in maner the whole multitude by enſample of others, did breake that order: ſome in part, and ſome in the whole, whereby the accuſtomed buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and expence of fiſh, whereupon the continuall maintenance of the ſayde Nauie grewe, became ſo ſmall, that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a great decay in the Nauie: neuertheleſſe euerie man proceeded from time to time in breache of the ſaid accuſtomed order, which before was certainely obſerued: and ſo in fewe yeares the Nauie was abated from fiue ſhippes to two in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers partes of this realme, whereupon the force thereof tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that matter was weakened much, to the great perill of this realme, and incouragement of the enemie.</p>

               <p>Which law for a time of great numbers was obſerued: but from thence grewe not ſufficient contribution to repaire and maintaine the Nauie, for that the vniuerſall multitude had litle regard thereunto, whoſe enſample diuers other followed: and ſo manie of the greater ſort ioyning with the leſſer ſort, became more careleſſe (for want of due execution) then anie time before they had bin: And thus the trade of fiſhing and prouiſion of fiſh

               <p>IF the realme in defence thereof be furniſhed with fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſhips, and that we ſhould ſuffer the enemie by pollicie or open force to conſume or deſtroy three hundred of them, were it not a great and a reprooueable negligence. But if the naturall ſubiectes of this realme by their negligent maners, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume or deſtroy three hundred of them, is not their ſo doing worthy grieuous puniſhment: But if they ſhall obſtinately or wilfully doe the ſame, what puniſhment ſuch ought to haue, I leaue to the iudgement of thoſe that haue a wiſedome to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof.</p>
               <p>In aſmuch therefore as by our dyet we abate the Nauie by proportion from fiue ſhips to two, is it not to bee accompted great negligence, and worthie of puniſhment. But after we haue eſpied this negligence wee doe wilfully continue the the ſame, can it bee in trueth any other, then a practiſe to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9630:7"/>
ouerthrowe our owne countrie by weakening the force thereof, to lay it ſo much the more open to the enemie.</p>
               <p>Further when the Queenes Maieſtie hath occaſion to ſend foorth, and maintaine her Nauie at the ſeas, muſt ſhee not be conſtrained either at the firſt ſetting foorth, or in the ſupplie to furniſhe and man the ſame for lacke of ſeafaring men, with wherrimen and bargemen from the Thames and other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers? who although manie of them be tall and luſtie men ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and able, to do good ſeruice in ſuch affaires, Yet the moſt part of them in reſpect of ſuch ſeruice may be accompted but freſhe watered ſouldiers not able to doe ſuche ſeruice at the firſt as ſhall be neceſſarie, for want of ſkill, nor able to abide the Seas in ſuche labour for want of vſe, and therefore wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſufficient Seafaring men amongeſt them, their ſeruice is in daunger to turne rather to the carrying and keeping foorth of ſhippes to deliuer vnto the enemie to increaſe hys force, then to reſiſt or diminiſhe the ſame. We therefore bring this to paſſe by our dyet, what other thing then doe we but by our ſayd dyet, ſeeke to ſtrengthen the enemie, and weaken our ſelues?</p>
               <p>Furthermore let vs make another allegation or argument and ſa, The Queenes Maieſtie is head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-wealth, which the Lord for his mercies ſake long continue. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth is the ſeat that ſhe ſitteth on and ruleth the legges that beare vp this ſeate, are the forces of the ſame, if anie one of theſe legges fayle or decay, it weakeneth the reſt, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all in danger, like a diſioynted frame which reeleth, and is in no certaine ſafetie longer then the ioynts hold ſoundly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And ſo when anie of the principall ioyntes decay, the whole reſt are in perrill, till that ioynt be repaired and made ſure againe.</p>
               <p>Therefore foraſmuch as the Nauie is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall forces or legges that this common-wealth ſtandeth on, which is the Queenes Maieſties ſeat, &amp; that the people do with their teeth, hale or draw that leg aſunder which w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr teeth they are wont to draw &amp; knit togither, faſt ioyned to the reſt of the legs. What other thing doe they but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their own teeth

vndermine the ſeate of the Prince, putting that in perill to fall to their deſtruction, which ſtanding vpright and faſt, would be their tecture and defence.</p>
               <p>But many there be that perhaps will iudge this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t verie vaine and friuilous to perſwade them, remembring the abuſe which in times paſt hath beene vſed in the obſeruation of fiſh dayes. And for that abuſe, ſacke vtterly contemne the ſame without remembring the polliticke deuice for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the Realme, whereunto at the firſt inuention or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thereof in this lande, it was in ſome part (in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ordained, as now it is in the whole: our countrie being an Iland enuironed with the ſeas as our walles.</p>
               <p>Otherſome taking hold on the words of our ſauiour Chriſt in the xv. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where he ſaith, That which entreth into the mouth doth not defile the man, but that which procce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out of the mouth. And by that meanes take libertie to offende. But they conſider not further, where S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, all things indeede are pure, but it is euill for the man that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with offence. And who thinketh not but that is eaten with offence which is eaten contrarie to the Princes lawes, and to the hurt of a common wealth. Neither doth our Sauiour giue any warrants by theſe words, that the thing which entereth into the mouth with offence doth not defile y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in that place is to be conſtred off, according to the words in the text ſpecified, where (in my my iudgement) the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t grew about the waſhing of hands, thorough the ſcribulite of the Scribes and Phariſes.</p>
               <p>We haue alſo another note to conſider off, when the wife of <hi>Tobias</hi> had prouided a Kidde, and brought to her huſbande, ſaying, ſhe would make readie the ſame for him to eate: he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to ſtay, and would not ſuffer her ſo to doo, vntill he had examined whether ſhe came truely by the ſame or not, fearing it had beene ſtolne, or in ſuch like caſe come by, and ſhould ſo eate of it vnlawfully, which he eſteemed to be an offence to God. Many other places of holy ſcripture may be alleaged in this caſe, which I will at this time omit, and leaue the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof to the learned diuines, whoſe office my ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleneſſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9630:8"/>
cannot attaine vnto, but returne to the matter which I haue taken in hand to proue by argument in temporall cauſes as followeth.</p>
               <p>Others perhaps do thinke and ſome in truth will ſay that concerning a maintenance for the Nauie with marriners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the trade of fiſhing, there be diuers waies to encreaſe and maintaine a ſufficient number of Marriners for ſeruice, whenſoeuer occaſion ſhall require by other trades and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fickes of marchandize: as for enſample, was the Realme euer heretofore ſo well furniſhed with ſeruiceable ſhips, as at this time it is maintained onely by trades of marchandize, wherin alſo are encreaſed great numbers of marriners, more apter men in ſuch ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Vnto which it may be anſwered that many ſuch marriners indeed are increaſed, but yet not ſuch a ſufficient number as warres if they haue any continuance will require, wherein verie manie ſuch perſons are to be imployed, as well in other ſhippes of this Realme, as in her maieſties owne ſhips.</p>
               <p>And if it ſhould be graunted that theſe trafickes ſhoulde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe marriners ſufficiently for the ſupply aforeſaid, yet if we ſhould depend thereon, we ſhould expreſſe our ſelues more to leane to things that bring and breed damage, then to things that bring and breede profite.</p>
               <p>For in truth a great part of our marchandize are rather ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous then needfull, &amp; more damageable then profitable, for example: is not the one halfe of our ſugars and other gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie wares, rather daintely conſumed then neceſſarily ſpent? Againe, are not foure parts of fiue of thoſe ſilkes and veluets that are brought into this realme, rather ſuperfluouſly vſed by men of meane eſtate, then conueniently worne by ſuch as are of higher eſtate?</p>
               <p>Further, are not three parts of fiue of the Wines that are brought into this Realme, rather waſtfully conſumed to the decaie and deſtruction of mens healthes, then neceſſarily ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent for the ſuſtentation of mens bodies, to continue or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their healthes? And for the tranſporting of torne and diuerſe kindes of marchandize out of this Realme, by reaſon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9630:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of thoſe trades, if they be done at ſometimes commoodiouſly for the benefite of the Realme, they are done at ſome other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imes diſcommodiouſly to the damage of the Realme, which hing is well knowne to many.</p>
               <p>Now when all theſe trafickes and trades are compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, and their commodities with their diſcommodities, it will appeare that the treaſure and ſtrength of this Realme is by the ſuperfluitie of them rather conſumed and abated, then encreaſed or continued: notwithſtanding I ſpeake not this that it were neceſſarie for ſuch trades to be left off or extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for thereby groweth great benefites to the Realme ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie waies, not onely for ſufficient and ſeruiceable ſhipping, but other neceſſarie commodities alſo. But contrariewiſe, concerning the trade of fiſhing, it is all wayes commodious and no wayes diſcommodious, it encreaſeth wealth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of ſuſtenance, but abateth none. And the more for that fiſh is alwayes ſpent for the neceſſarie ſuſtentation of mens bodies, and not for ſuperfluitie.</p>
               <p>There is yet another thing to be conſidered off concerning the trade of marchandize, that in all manner of trafickes where marchants muſt come within the Dominions of other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, much daunger and perill may happen, for that it is in the wils of thoſe Princes, within whoſe dominions they are to ſtay ſuch ſhippes as there be, and imploy them at their pleaſures in their ſeruice. And ſo England w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great perill may encreaſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners &amp; ſhipping to ſerue other Princes, which may happen ſometimes to be againſt our ſelues. Alſo in diuers traficke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mariners trauell far iournies, by meanes wherof it may be that the Realwe ſhal want them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhould be needfull that they were at home to be imployed for the defence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realm.</p>
               <p>Therefore it may plainely appeare that the trade of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize only for breeding &amp; maintenance of mariners, though it be neceſſary &amp; needfull to the realme, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame is not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out great doubts &amp; perils. Wheras contrariwiſe by the trade of fiſhing, if ſuch fiſh might be certainly ſpent w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in this realme as might be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; proued a ſufficient nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of mariners &amp; other ſeafaringme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupply of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> then may want, might be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9630:9"/>
much more profitabler, and ſaflier bredde and maintained at home, all times in a readines to be imployed for the neceſſarie ſeruice and defence of the Realme, how ſuddainely ſo euer the ſame ſhould require.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THere is yet further to be conſidered, that the trade of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a wonderfull great Nurſe for the breeding or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp of Marrineas, for whereas a Merchants ſhippe vſing the traficke with merchandize, being furniſhed for the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with twentie men, there is amongſt them not paſt two or three boyes which in that trade is brought vp and inſtructed.

               <p>But the Fiſherman going to the ſea, or vpon other waters in great or ſmall veſſels, for euerie one man there is of them commonly two boyes, who being trained vp therein, are ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed with the hardneſſe and painefull toile which in that exerciſe they are vſed to, that they are not onely able to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine al labour to a ſeafaring man belonging, but in ſhort time become a ſufficient ſailor, maſter, or Pilot, as well for ſeruice in her maieſties ſhippes as in the merchants ſhippes. They are alſo acquainted and know the rockes, ſandes and other daungers vpon the ſeacoſtes: where they lye, and how to auoid them by reaſon of their accuſtomed haunting the ſeas in the trade of fiſhing. And by meanes of their trauell from one port to another for the ſale or vtterance of the ſaid fiſh, and other things wherein at vnſeaſonable fiſhing times they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>

there be that will and may truely ſay, the vtterers of fiſh ſell the ſame at ſuch exceſſiue priſes, diuers and ſundrie times, that it diſcourageth men to buy thereof. And the more for that they can a great deale better cheape make their prouiſion with fleſh as well for their familie, as themſelues.</p>
               <p>Many arguments are to be made that will be ſufficient to anſwere this matter. And firſt we are to conſider the times and ſeaſons of the yeare that it ſerueth not alwaies alike, for ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prouiſion of freſhfiſh, at which time little ſtore being taken by reaſon of contagious and contrarie weather, wherein the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherman aduentureth both life and goods, &amp; not onely himſelfe but many other hath their liuings theron depending, great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is that the ſame be ſold the dearer: for beſides his ſaide aduenture, he hath bene at no leſſe charge then though he had taken great quantities. And for remedie hereof, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue in ſuch a ſcarſitie ſome other good ſorts of fiſh, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vſed. To ſatiſfie their diet in times paſt there hath bene prouided for the markets theſe ſorts of fiſh, that is to ſay, Puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens, Tunney, Porpus, Seall, Holibut finnes, Holibut heads, &amp; many other things, wherof was made fine &amp; delicate diſhes, which now for lacke of vſe is not onely left vnprouided, but alſo vtterly forgotten, how or in what ſort it ſhould be vſed, dreſſed, or ſerued: and worſt of all, how it ſhould be eaten, and diſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, for that the proportion and ſubſtance of them is by many forgotten, and the vſe and taſt forgotten of all. There were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſounds &amp; heads of the Cods, which in fiſhing time were ſalted and preſerued to be a diet, in ſuch ſcarſitie for the poorer ſort: all theſe things being by Gods creation ordained for our ſuſtenance, ought rather to be thankefully receiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly caſt off and refuſed.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, that wind and wether being contrary for fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a great cauſe that fiſh is many times very ſcarſe &amp; deere yet the chiefeſt thing that generally cauſeth the ſame, is lacke of certaine vtterance, as by theſe fewe arguments following doth plainly appeare, wherein it may be ſaid.</p>
               <p>As vtterance encreaſeth, or abateth in any trade, ſo the trade will encreaſe or abate.</p>

               <p>The dearenes of the ſaid fleſh victuall cauſeth great gaines to be raiſed by the fatting of cattell.</p>
               <p>The raſing of ſuch gaines cauſeth men to conuert their grounds and farmes from tillage to paſture.</p>
               <p>By that meanes a multitude of people are put out of worke and from their liuings.</p>
               <p>Therby a great number of them are conſtrained to become idle Roges or to practiſe other ſuperfluous &amp; vaine things that breede diuers other great vices.</p>
               <p>Theſe be things that bring great detriment and decay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the common-welth: and therefore, as afore hath bene ſaide, the vſuall and vnlawfull eating of fleſh bringeth great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and decay vnto the common-welth.</p>
               <p>Hereby it may alſo be vnderſtood, that by the decaie of til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, twentie thouſand perſons which haue and might ſtill liue thereby, are put from their accuſtomed worke and liuings.</p>
               <p>Their wiues, women ſeruants and children, whoſe mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance did on them depende, are in number thirtie thouſande, at the leaſt, theſe in the whole extend to fiftie thouſande, beſide the increaſe of a great number of ſundrie fortes of victuall which in a farme houſe is encreaſed towards the ſuſtentation of the people.</p>
               <p>For a farme containing ſixſcore Acres of ground, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to paſture onely, for the breeding and feeding of cattell, there doth come no further increaſe of victuall but Biefes and Muttons onely, and yt may bee prooued that the yearely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereof will not finde yearely aboue ten perſons of thoſe that make their common and onely foode of fleſh.</p>
               <p>But let this farme be imployed into tillage, &amp; there will be a reaſonable encreaſe of Biefe and Muttons: then is there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be made of al kind of graine, as wel for bread as drink

which is the chiefeſt victuall for maintenance of the people.</p>

This is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull decay in a common-wealth: and ought with chriſtian charitie of all men to be lamented.

               <p>The realme is weakened, and made of leſſe force to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and reſiſt the enemie, both on the ſea, and ſeacoaſtes.</p>
               <p>An hundred thouſand perſons are put from their worke and maintenance.</p>

               <p>By abating the force of the realm on the ſea and ſeacoaſtes, it is in the greater danger of the enemie.</p>
               <p>Alſo by putting of an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred thouſand perſons out of worke and maintenance, there muſt needes grow the greater increaſe of idleneſſe, roges, and theeues, with which ſorte of people, it greeueth them to be indamaged and indangered that breedes them, for we would haue no aſhes and yet ſtill increaſe the fire.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9630:12"/>
Alſo we would ſayle in ſafetie, and yet bore holes through the bottome of the ſhippe.</p>
               <p>Further by the yearely abating of three hundred thouſand poundes-worth of victualles there muſt of neceſſitie growe a great want of ſufficient ſuſtenance, eſpecially for the common ſort of people. The miſerie whereof, although it be not felt by the rich, yet the ſame greeuouſly lighteth amongeſt the poore, for ponderous thinges fall to the bottome, and they that ſtrike others, feele not the ſmart themſelues.</p>
               <p>For remedie herein, there hath bene diuers deuiſes &amp; plots made, and ſet downe how fiſhermen might be ſet a worke, fiſh might bee taken, brought in, and prouided for ſeruice of the realme, and ſtraight lawes made for the expence and vtterance thereof, but little is ſaid or done, that the ſaid lawe might be certainely executed and obſerued, for as before hath bene ſayd that it is vtterance that maintaineth the trade of anie thing, and as vtterance increaſeth or abateth, ſo the trade will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and abate.</p>
               <p>For enſample, the great increaſe and vtterance of fleſh that hath growne by the vnlawfull eating of fleſh, hath ſo increaſed the trade for graſing and fatting of cattell to be ſpent and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that thereby hath growne all ſuch detriments as before hath bin ſet down to happen by the decay of tillage.</p>
               <p>Alſo therby (as before hath bene ſaid) the vtterance of fiſh is become ſo ſmall and vncertaine, and the trade of fiſhing, and the buying and ſelling of fiſh by the ſame ſo abated, that all the reſt of ſuch dangers and damages as before are ſet down, haue by that meanes growne and happened.</p>
               <p>Therefore as the increaſe of the vtterance of fleſh, and the abating of the vtterance of fiſhe hath bene cauſe of the euils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
               <p>So the increaſe of the vtterance of fiſhe, and the abating of the vtterance of fleſh muſt be cauſe of the remedie.</p>

               <p>Firſt it is to be conſidered, that in the yeare are 52. weekes and in euerie weeke, ſeuen daies, which are in all for the yeare 364. daies.</p>
               <p>The lent with friday and ſaterday in euerie weeke, and the the other accuſtomed fiſh daies, appoynted by the lawes of the realme to be obſerued, being collected togither: extend to 153. So in the yeare there is 153. fiſhe daies and 211. fleſh daies, which amounteth vnto 58. fleſh daies more then fiſh dayes.</p>
               <p>Now touching the expence of fleſh in London, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbes thereof, and what may be ſpared in thoſe places onely by one dayes abſtinence in a weeke. Firſt the yeare beeing 52. weekes: let ſeuen of them be excepted, for the time of lent, wherein no Biefes ought to be killed, and then remaineth but 45. weekes, wherein butchers doe kill cattell.</p>
               <p>Then let vs ſay there be threeſcore butchers, freemen of the citie of London, that commonly kill Biefes, and euerie butcher to kill weekely one with the other, fiue Biefes, which is for 45. weekes, in the whole 300. Biefes: which amounteth for the ſaid 45. weeks, to 13500. killed by the ſayd freemen.</p>
               <p>The forrenners dwelling in the ſuburbes of London, and ſuch as come out of the countrie to ſerue the markets of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, on the market daies, kill and vtter there, as the butchers of London affirme, foure times ſo much as the freemen of the citie, which amounteth yearly to 54000.

                  </gap>hey extend in al for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare to 67500. biefes.</p>
               <p>It is herein to be noted y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the account by this eſtimat is but for fiue daies in the weeke, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> friday and ſaterday are daies of abſtinence from fleſhe, and therefore out of the ſayde fiue
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9630:13"/>
dayes we muſt ſuppoſe to take one, and the account aforeſayd is ſo to be made, for that in them fleſhe is certainly ſpent other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there can no certaine accompt be made.</p>
               <p>Now if we would knowe what number of Biefes might be ſpared as afore is ſaid, let vs ſay there be in the weeke fiue fleſhe dayes, accuſtomably ſerued with the expence of fleſhe whereof one being taken away, there reſteth but foure.</p>
               <p>In like ſorte let vs deuide the proportion of Biefes that are killed for London and the ſuburbes for a yeare into fiue partes. And the fift part ſuppoſed to be ſaued by the fift dayes abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is 13500. the iuſt number killed for a yeare by the freemen of the Citie.</p>
               <p>It is alſo reported and well knowne, that for euerie Biefe killed, there is killed ten ſheep at the leaſt. Then if there might be ſpared yearely in the places aforeſaid by one daies abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, 13500. beaſtes, there will by that reckning bee ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 135000. ſheepe, beſides lambes, calues, and hogges, whereof like proportion is to be made according to the times of the yeare wherein they be ſpent or ſhould be ſpent. But the abuſe therein is great by killing them at vnlawfull times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to good lawes and ordinances carefully made and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the increaſe of cattell, whereby woonderfull great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages groweth vnto the realme, as by ſundrie probable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes might be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Moreouer there is like accompt to be made of ſuch fine fleſh victuall as is vttered by the poultars, which on the faſtingdaies is moſt commonly ſpent. By this eſtimate, concerning the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of London and the ſuburbes, it may be eaſily decerned of, what might be ſpared thorow the whole realme, which being well conſidered may happily perſwade ſome men the more to the obſeruation of ſuch good lawes and ordinances as for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of fiſhdaies is prouided.</p>
               <p>But concerning this the expence of fiſhe, many there be, that perhaps will ſay, we agree that the taking, vttering and ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of fiſhe is laudable and well to be liked of: but wherefore ſhould wee make choyſe of dayes or times, ſeeing there is no preſcribed rule from God, for the choyſe of meates at any one

day more then another, and that it hath pleaſed almightie God to giue vs his bleſſinges with multitudes of the ſame in the ſeas, confeſſing the ſame alſo to be giuen vs from God, for our ſuſtenance, which being taken &amp; prouided, may be brought or carried vnto cities, townes, and markets, and there ſold and vttered to ſuch as wil buy on euerie day in the weeke, and at all times and ſeaſons when it is taken.</p>
               <p>Herein we muſt conſider, that if it ſhould ſo be obſerued the vncertaintie of ſale would cauſe the prouiders of fiſhe, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their trades and the fiſherman his fiſhing in a ſhort time: firſt, for that moſt men by nature in theſe daies are affectioned from fiſh for diuers cauſes, by them conceiued: ſecondly, when the ſame is ſolde at a deare price, ſo that their prouiſion may be made of fleſh a great deale better cheape.</p>
               <p>But we muſt conſider, that although wind and weather ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth wel at ſome times, that there is great plentie of fiſh taken, and by reaſon thereof ſolde reaſonable good cheape, yet other ſometimes either the winde and weather, or the time and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſerueth not, ſo that little ſtore of fiſh is taken. Neuertheleſſe as afore hath bene ſaid, the fiſhermans liuing depending onely thereupon muſt haue a ſufficient maintenance to liue, for him and his familie, beeing continued therein with great charges diuers waies, and therefore if hee be not certaine to ſell that ſmall ſtore of fiſh which he hath taken in ſuch a time of ſcarſitie and that alſo at ſome good round price to recompence the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and charge which with the aduenture of his life and goods he hath obtained, he neither would nor could continue his ſayd trade, and this hath bene, and is the onely cauſe that many ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring men doe leaue the trade of fiſhing, and ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to other exerciſes, rather hurtfull then beneficiall to the commonwealth.</p>
               <p>Further it is to be conſidered concerning the vncertantie of time in prouiding ſalted fiſhe, to be by the fiſhmonger readie ſeaſoned for the peoples diet. As Samon, Lings, Haberdines, Greenefiſh, Heringes and ſuch like: if there ſhoulde not be a certaine time for the ſpending, the prouiders coulde in no caſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9630:14"/>
ſeaſon or make the ſame readie to be ſufficient for the eater or ſpender when it ſhould be eaten or ſpent, which being ſeaſoned for one day, will ſcarſe ſerue for another: Eſpecially when the weather is warme, and therefore being vncertaine of his ſale although he make ſome prouiſion of fiſhe to ſell drie, or in the ſalte, yet he will not ſeaſon anie with water, fit to be eaten, for the vncertaintie of his ſale, by reaſon he knoweth not when the people are minded to eate fiſhe except a day or a time bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted certaine for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is a victuall, not to be had, as biefes, muttons, veales, and ſuch like in the paſtures feeding, at al times in a readineſſe to be ſpent, but is at libertie in the wide and large ſeas, vppon the taking and prouiding whereof, diligent attendance muſt be giuen, and alſo ſome ſortes or kindes of fiſh muſt be taken and prouided long time before, it will be ſufficient to be ſpent, ſo that if there be not certaine daies and times appoynted for the certaine expence of fiſhe, The fiſherman ſhall be vncertaine to ſell as he may be a gainer thereby when the ſame is taken, the marchant or vtterer of fiſh, vnwilling and diſcouraged, to buy and prouide for the markets, and thereby a more ſcarſitie of fiſhe, and a greater decay of fiſhing will dayly increaſe to the woonderfull decay of the Nauie, and dammage of the whole realme ſundrie waies.</p>
               <p>It may well be thought therefore, that this thing manie yeares ſince was carefully conſidered of, with the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſcommodities that would grow by the vncertaintie of the vtterance of fiſh, that certaine daies and times might be appointed for the fiſhe to be vttered and eaten, whereby a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and ſufficient prouiſion might be alſo made or prouided, and although as before hath bene ſayd, abuſe in continuance of time did growe, by obſeruation of the ſaide dayes and tymes ſo appointed, yet the neceſſarie vſe thereof conſidered, it is not for the ſame to be refuſed, eſpecially for that by the aſſent and conſent of her Maieſties learned and wiſe counſellors, it hath bene not onely thought good for ſpeciall cauſe that the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med times and ſeaſons ſhoulde bee obſerued, But by her

                  <p>Concerning abſtinence from fleſhe, there is a conſcience to bee made in tranſgreſsing the lawe, for what cauſe obedience herein ought to be ſhewed: the iudgement of ſome men which anſwere thereto.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw for that I woulde not anie man ſhoulde miſtake me concerning my opinion, and true meaning in the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I haue thought good (vnder correction of the better lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) to ſet downe the ſame, as followeth. Wherein I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that the eating of fleſhe or forbearing to eate fleſhe, is not anie matter or thing concerning ſaluation of man, or that it is the ſeruice of God otherwaies then all other polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke lawes are, and be: for it is not the abſtinence from fleſh, that pleaſeth God, nor the eating thereof, that offendeth him: But it is the obedience which God requireth to be yeelded, and borne vnto the Prince, and the care of the benefite of hys people that pleaſeth him, and it is diſobedience to the Prince and the neglecting of his peoples benefite that diſpleaſeth hym.</p>
               <p>I doe alſo affirme that there is no conſcience to bee made in eating of fleſhe at anie time, as touching the fleſhe that is eaten, but there is conſcience to be made in that the Prince is diſobeyed, whiche is a contempt of Gods ordinance, and the peoples benefite neglected, which God requireth to bee earneſtly ſought: and therefore a diſobedience of the Princes lawes, cannot bee done without offence to God, for as God hath ordained that Princes ſhould gouerne, ſo hath hee in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie places of the Scriptures commaunded that ſubiectes ſhoulde obey, and the offence in euerie tranſgreſſion is the more by how much the damage vnto the people thereby grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth greater.</p>
               <p>For we are taught to obey the neceſſarie lawes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of Princes and not to neglect and contemne

them to labor and ſeeke for publike wealth, and the vniuerſall commoditie of others, with carefulnes &amp; not to be wilfull ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwers and deſtroyers of the ſame: wherby we may gather that a man without offence may do all things which by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not forbidden, vntill they are forbidden by lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Likewiſe what is commanded by lawfull authoritie, and not by the ſcriptures forbidden, a man is bound to obey &amp; cannot without offence omit the ſame.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo conſider that God hath diſpoſed things ſo by creation, that the encreaſe of the earth doth not ſuffiſe for the ſuſtentation of the people: but ſuch things as he hath created in the ſeas and waters muſt alſo be prouided, and it may be remembred but few yeares paſt, that fiſh did wel nigh as much ſuſtentation to the people of this realme as the fleſh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to omit this reliefe, muſt needs encreaſe a ſcarſitie of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall diuers and ſundrie waies.</p>
               <p>Furthermore ſome men more raſh then true in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not onely thinke but ſay, he that thus earneſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth for an abſtinence from fleſh, is either one of theſe three that followeth, or all: that is to ſay, a ſuperſtitious perſon, an hypocrite, or a Papiſt.</p>
               <p>And firſt he is accounted a ſuperſtitious perſon for that he is a forbidder of meates, perſwading the people thereunto, and maketh conſcience where no cauſe of conſcience is, eſteeming that vnlawfull which is not by God forbidden.</p>
               <p>Herein ſuch raſh giuers of iudgement are greatly deceiued for in truth he is a forbidder of meates that forbiddeth it at all times, and in all reſpects like as in the Apoſtles time ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Iewes perſwaded the Chriſtians, but forbidding of the vſe at certaine times appointed by lawfull authoritie done for a common-welth, is not an vtter forbidding of the thing, the cauſe and reaſon being conſidered, and therefore no conſcience to be made in the kinde or nature of the meate, but for the commoditie of thoſe, for whoſe cauſe it is forborne or forbidden, and ſo the meate is not vnlawful but the vſe vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, being eaten at a time forbidden by ſuch as haue authoritie from God to forbid it, done for the benefite of his people: for

although it be lawfull for a man to ſpend or vſe the things that he commeth lawfully by, it is vnlawfull to ſpende or vſe the things that he commeth vnlawfully by, for then the comman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement is tranſgreſſed ſo, although it be lawfull to eate fleſh at all times, as the creatures of God giuen for the ſuſtenance of man, it is vnlawful to eate the ſame at times forbidden by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authoritie, for therein Gods ordinance is contemned and the benefite of his people neglected.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſome perhaps may name him to be an hypocrite, becauſe he wil not eate fleſh on ſuch dayes that he might ſeeme holy, and one that more careth for his ſaluation then other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as thinking to obtaine the ſame by abſtaining from eating fleſh on a few preſcribed daies and times: but of wiſe men this is to be conſidered, that hypocriſie is priuie ſinne, couched in the minde and intention of man, and although iudgement may be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in or by the dealings of ſome perſons, yet in truth the thing cannot be generally diſcerned in any man but by the wiſedome of God onely.</p>
               <p>For what vertue ſoeuer any perſon vſeth, if it be done for the praiſe of man, and not in conſideration of the duetie which God requireth, is none other but flat hypocriſie: For example, who ſo accuſtometh to reade or heare the holy ſcriptures preached and taught with a ſhew of holines, therby to be praiſed of men, and not learne to liue or bring forth fruites according to the ſame, he may be accounted a meere hypocrite, neuertheleſſe the reading and hearing of the ſcriptures is not hypocriſie, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnfainedly and rightly done, is the liuely nouriſhment and foode of mans ſoule. So abſtinence from fleſh is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted hypocriſie, when it is done for obedience to the law &amp; in reſpect of that law and duetie which God requireth of euery man to be borne towards his neighbour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he is called a Papiſt, for that ſaith ſome, alſo he thinketh it is neceſſarie to abſtaine from eating of fleſh, &amp; doth like &amp; allow of thoſe lawes and deuices made and vſed in the time of Papiſtrie, and by auncient authoritie of the Pope, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhould not in any thing imitate, but rather in all thinges be contrarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:9630:16"/>Here may be ſaid is zeale without knowledge, vnderſtanding blinded, and a great want of true iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: for enſample, mine enemie teacheth me two things, the one I finde euill by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the other good, and becauſe I will not follow the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of my aduerſary, ſhall I caſt away the good for the euils ſake.</p>
               <p>Or thus, it may be ſaid I am taught by mine aduerſarie to run into the fire and eſcape the water, but becauſe contrarie to the minde or teaching of mine aduerſarie I haue eſcaped the fire, ſhall I therefore of mine owne will run into the water and drowne my ſelfe: many good lawes and ordinances in the time of papiſtrie was by them made and ordained, but the ſame is not therfore to be contemned or neglected, for that their deuiſe in many things for the benefite of a common welth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be amended.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid concerning this matter, but few words are ſufficient to ſatiſfie ſuch as are wiſe and diſcreete, whoſe wiſedome can ſufficiently conceaue by this ſmal treatiſe what thing of the author is intended, whoſe heart and minde is knowne to God, that for the benefite of his countrie he hath taken this ſmal paines, crauing patience of the gentle Reader for his rudenes, being in reſpect of many others, but ſimplie trained vp in learning, requireth herein of the wiſe to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. And that theſe his ſimple perſwaſions might be an occaſion without the paine and penalties of the law, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade an obedience in the premiſes, amongſt his natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen, both for themſelues and their families. Then the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhall thinke himſelfe recompenced: and ſuch as liue but few yeares both ſee and feele the great benefits to them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by growing, not onely for encreaſe of victuall and better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the people, but great ſtrength to the Nauie for the more ſeruice and defence of this Realme.</p>
