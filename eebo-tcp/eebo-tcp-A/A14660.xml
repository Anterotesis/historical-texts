            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2244:3"/>
vnto all disobedient and vnsanctified spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which haue, as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> saith, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themselues, yet vnto all faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians which truely fight vnder the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Iesus Christ, I know that such will not onely accept my good will, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise louingly and thankfully bee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to embrace my poore indeuors here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb facs="tcp:2244:4"/>
seeing that I haue kept my selfe, being guided by the Spirit of God, in that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied place, of Christs Vineyard alone, and yet for all this I know that the malice and mischiefe of Sathan is such, that from all those haters of their brethren, who with hateful <hi>Esau,</hi> haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themselues, &amp; contemned their birth-right, I expect
<pb facs="tcp:2244:4"/>
no better gratuitie at their hands, then deadly hate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: and my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is this, because Grapes cannot grow vpon Thornes, nor Figs vpon Thistles. If that kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet DAVID had great cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of his times, how that his enemies were greatly multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, &amp; his sorrowes much increased: by

how much more hath our most gracious King iust cause to complaine, seeing that Sathan now worketh after such a strange and most fearefull manner, by his wicked instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the like was neuer heard nor seen from the beginning of the world vntill this present time; of which times Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath truely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied,

hard before these fearefull signes, are now alreadie fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, part of them in our late and gracious Queenes time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memorie, and likewise the rest of these tribulations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatest, in his Maiesties time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially since his Highnesse came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs?

               <hi>Cain,</hi> that man of sin, would not haue left one <hi>Abel</hi> aliue, if that God himself had not stood in the gap, for vs? Now for these tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, I doubt not, but that the very strengths of them are alreadie past, and that this most feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plot of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Treason, &amp; what else was the very last shake of the glasse.</p>
            <p>These and such like

persecutions and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, haue at all times, and in all ages displayed themselues against the poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised Church of CHRIST: but of all those engines which Sathan by his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hath deuised, was neuer the like heard of as that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plot of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to shake vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and yet behold,
<pb facs="tcp:2244:8"/>
most worthy Sir, there is such a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full shaking by the children of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, now amongst vs, as for the time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was, nor I hope neuer shall be, untill the day of iudgment, we haue but yet spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the shaking of our mortall bodies.</p>
            <p>But behold, and yee shall see further, how that Sathan by his sharpest &amp; most hot
<pb facs="tcp:2244:8"/>
instruments, doth now shake the verie powers of heauen. For Iesus Christ who now sitteth in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, hauing receiued all power from God his Father, is so sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at this present time, in his wounded members, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy vnto his little Church, had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

King, as aspecial meanes to hinder Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in his progresse herein: I am verily perswaded, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing preuailed so far alreadie as hee hath done, that if hemight but bee suffered to haue his intent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that according to our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours speech, no flesh should bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this cause, I
<pb facs="tcp:2244:9"/>
most humbly craue vppon my bended knees, that as GOD by his mighty power and loue vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto his church, hath so often stood in the gap against the power of Sathan, and his most wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, to deliuer his Sacred Maiestie from so many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers, that now at last it would please his Grace, in
<pb facs="tcp:2244:10"/>
some recompence of so many and vn-vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable great fauours, receiued, to stand once more in the gap for him, then as we haue had alwaies iust cause, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts beeing increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and our spirits further emboldned, to cry still from the bottom of our harts, with heartie teares of repentance, vnto the Lord of Hosts, that as
<pb facs="tcp:2244:10"/>
hee hath so many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall times miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously defended, and protected his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty: so it would please him still for the great honor of his Name, and the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and good of his Church, to defend &amp; protect him still vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shadow of his wings, and not onely himselfe, but likewise our most gracious Queene, with that
<pb facs="tcp:2244:11"/>
most blessed and hopefull Progenie, that it wold so please him, to protect them all in safetie &amp; peace, that neither the wild Bore of the Forrest, nor <hi>Esau</hi> this most wicked hunter, which hunteth cruelly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this English Pale, may euer preuaile, or take any further roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting herein: and here once againe, let no man bee offended,
<pb facs="tcp:2244:11"/>
that seeing this vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall brother hath not only broken that vnion, which should bee amongst Christs members, and so fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise dayly withdraw infinite multitudes, by his life &amp; doctrin, to become deadly haters of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in so much that loue &amp; charitie hath lost her sight: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:2244:12"/>
still vpon my bended knees, I most humbly craue, that seeing the Lord of heauen and earth is by them so greatly dishonored, it would please his sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, to stop the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of these violent Hunts-men, which wilfully spoile and destroy the game: Then according to our blessed Sauiours speech, that last signe
<pb facs="tcp:2244:12"/>
of the Sonne of Man immediately before his last comming to Iudgement, shall more cleerely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, amongst the clouds; then shall there bee such cause of reioycing, as mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Iesus Christ our Redeemer, we shall reioyce with him for euermore.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our saith; <hi>Hee that is not with mee, is against</hi>

                  </gap>s, whereby we know that it is the last time,</hi> I. Ioh. 2. 18. &amp; in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next verse, he saith, <hi>They went from vs, but they were not of vs.</hi> Now if any would know, who these specially are which are against CHRIST; and so as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Antichrists:
<pb facs="tcp:2244:13"/>
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> prophesying of these last times, plainely describe, and haue set them down by their qualities and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all agreeing as it were with one consent saying, that they are spirits of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the thirteenth to the <hi>Romans</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verse, and in the second of <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:2244:14"/>
the second Chapter and the tenth verse: And in <hi>Iudes</hi> Epistle the eighth Verse. Now Saint <hi>Iude</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on farther, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> words, and saith in the nineteenth verse, that they haue sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themselues; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which words of these two blessed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and finde, that
<pb facs="tcp:2244:14"/>
there is no sect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole cope of heauen, which can so iustly deserue the title of this seuered imputation, as this Sect now resident amongst vs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes. For although the Pope of Rome is not onely a disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient spirit, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise deserueth the highest roome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,
<pb facs="tcp:2244:15"/>
yet to say properly, hee is gone from vs, would but proue an improper speech, because hee neuer was of vs: now for this our elder brother, it may true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly bee said, how that hee is gone from vs, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in this word onely in Christ, may truely be said, that he was of vs. Now the question is how and
<pb facs="tcp:2244:15"/>

            <p>I must tell thee, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (and I am sorry that thou hast giuen mee such iust cause to tell thee so)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2244:47"/>
that if it were not for one crying sinne which that bloody and wandering <hi>Cain</hi> is branded in the fore-head withal, I meane that most monsterous Beast of Babylon, who denyeth the Offices of our Redeemer: I say, and speake it from the Spirit of God, that thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so little inferiour in persecuting and murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the soules of Christs members; that thou hast not onely pledged the Pope of ROME a full health of the dregges of your conceited inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and false imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2244:48"/>
but as thou hast pledged him herein. I feare me it will proue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee part, that thou hast begun another halfe pot to him againe. And although thou doest not runne on with him in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of some fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points of Religion, yet I dare vndertake, that thou resting thy selfe in thy owne conceit, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; shaddowes therof, whose substances cannot bee without, dost more hurt by thy disobedience amongst vs herein, then he doth, or can doe, being
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2244:48"/>
so publikely knowne as hee is. And here as our Sauior Christ saith, <hi>Thou art but a blind guide, which straines out a gnat, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a Camell,</hi> Mat. 23. 24.</p>
            <p>Thus, Brother, thou carriest this offence of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience vpon thy back, and therefore thou canst not perceiue it thy selfe. Now I haue made bold, comming behinde thee, to take it off, &amp; haue layed the same) as thou now seest) before thy face: For which, if thou wouldst so keepe there, and cast it no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde thee, I shall be glad
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2244:49"/>
that it was my chance to remoue the same.</p>
            <p>But if thou rest thy selfe in thy owne conceit, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience from thee, and so become a carrier still of thy offences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee, then wilt thou enforce mee, to say with <hi>Salomon: That there is more hope in a very naturall foole, then of him that is conceited,</hi> Pro. 26. 12. <hi>ver.</hi> And this shall serue for a taste of thy disobedience, and to let the world see, That as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> saith; <hi>Hauing separated thy selfe</hi> from the true members of Christ, thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2244:49"/>
no better then a <hi>wandring Starre,</hi> whose portion without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>is blacknesse of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for euer, Iude 13. vers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therfore, Brother, let mee aduise thee to learne a lesson of that Starre which guided the Wise men from the East Countrie, vnto Bethlem, where our blessed Sauior <note place="margin">Mat. 2. 9.</note> CHRIST was, &amp; as that Star did stand still, when it came iust ouer where the Babe was, and so left them there: so thou who doest rest thy selfe but in thy owne conceit, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience vnto su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2244:50"/>
power, let it now be sufficient, &amp; too much, that thou hast settled thy affections, in that East countrie of thy owne i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bee found but Inchanters and Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. And heere I must leaue thee, and turne my self vnto those, of whom, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self better things,</hi> Heb 6 9. And thus, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Christian, thou seest what great danger the children of disobedience haue broughtthemselues into. Thou seest that our elder brother, for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2244:50"/>
is counted no better in the iudgement of Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> then a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Starre. Thou seest what such haue prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the Scriptures for their diet, after this life: S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>condemnation,</hi> Rom. 13. 2. Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iude</hi> saith, <hi>black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of darknesse for euer.</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 17. <hi>Iude</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Verse. Thou seest these blessed Apostles so speaking against these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient spirits, as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of these fearefull iudgements. And in briefe, thou seest how truely these holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2244:51"/>
hath prophesied of these disobedient spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, in these very last times. And againe, thou seest how opposite these spirits are vnto the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ himselfe, who paied Tribute vnto <hi>Caesar</hi> in his owne person: who rather then hee would bee an ensample of the least offence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a freeman, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himselfe vnto a base Publican. And thus may all men see, the King of all Kings, an ensample of obedience vnto the whole world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:2244:51"/>
And yet behold, heere thou seest a disobedient spirit so full of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that hee will tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend aboue principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers. But faithful Christian, let this fearefull example be such a speciall warning vnto thee, that thou keepe thy selfe in all loyall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto Princes espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially: and likewise let this example bee a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto all sorts of people, that they yeeld obedience vnto whom so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is due. <hi>As Children to Parents, and Parents to their Children: Wiues to</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:2244:52"/>
               <hi>their Husbands, and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to their Wiues: Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to their Masters, and Masters to their Seruants,</hi> Col. 3. 18, 19, 20. And in a word, al in general to our most gracious King.</p>
            <p>Now that we may the better performe these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, let vs take counsell of that blessed Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such disobedient spirits, saith, <hi>Turne away from such,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>And thus, faithful bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou seest what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger our elder brother hath brought himselfe vnto, in despising gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:2244:52"/>
It resteth now in the second place, to let thee see his disobedience in his doctrine, and as in briefe thou seest his diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience against man, thou shalt likewise, by Gods assistance, see his disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e against both God and man, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeuteth Christ in his members: both thou and I haue felt the smart: but faithfull brother, I must leaue thee for a while.</p>
            <p>And now, brother, by Gods assistance, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my promise, I am readie to encounter with thee this second
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2244:53"/>
time. And wheras I haue already reproued thee for thy disobedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst man, not finding thee in this Combate to yeeld; beeing prouoked further, I am readie to manifest vnto the whole world, how contrarie thou art to Christ and all good men, by thy disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in thy Doctrine. Likewise shewing the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth and the spirit of error. But before I proceede, I am to meete with an obiection, which the whole world, who being against the truth,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2244:53"/>
may propound, and that is where the true Church of Christ is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to giue satisfaction herein, the world shall vnderstand that both the true Church and the false is in this little Iland, called <hi>England:</hi> and as there are many false Churches in the world, and but onely one true: The world may likewise perceiue, that as the true Church of GOD is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies accompanied, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>with some heresies for the better tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thereof,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19. So now especially is it at
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2244:54"/>
this present time, for there are three sorts of Teachers amongst vs, whereof one of these is the true Church of Christ, and the other two with all the rest, doe but oppose themselues. Now of these two latter being both false, the one of them doth teach in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, the other doth preach in publike. Now for this priuate teacher, it is needelesse to speake any thing of him, seeing that the Church of God doth know him suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, how that he degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Christ of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2244:54"/>
challengeth such prerogatiues vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as are onely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar vnto Christ, and therefore no true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof.</p>
            <p>And as this priuate teacher is a knowne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie vnto Iesus Christ: so likewise, I am readie to prooue by the Word of God, that thou, who restest in thy owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, hauing separated thy selfe from thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, being become a rash accusing iudger of them, that thou art so farre off from being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a teacher, or a scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2244:55"/>
in the Schoole of Christ, that thou art an enemie thereunto, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely in the vanitie of thy owne imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And that this is true, our blessed Sauiour, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to teach the whole world the way vnto the Kingdome of heauen, hath erected vnto the view of the whole world, a large free Schoole, wherein he teacheth that whosoeuer would bee a teacher, or a scholler therein, must learne this lesson of <hi>meekenesse and lowlinesse, Matth.</hi> 11. 29. And lest his children
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2244:55"/>
should swerue or goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray from this his milde Commandement: hee giues a speciall warning in the sixth Chapter of Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospell, and thirtie seuenth verse, in these words: <hi>Iudge not, that yee bee not iudged: condemne not, and yee shall not be condemned: forgiue, and yee shall be forgiuen, Luk.</hi> 6. 37.</p>
            <p>Now there are diuers and sundrie sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which doe perswade themselues, that they are true teachers in this schoole of Christ, which indeed are not: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               </gap>ripture, that the ignorant may not onely be better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but likewise, that their vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dings may be more apt to conceiue of things afterwards. And for this purpose, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>Trie the Spirits, whether they bee of God, or not,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 1. and in the next verse he saith, <hi>Heereby shall yee know the</hi>

               <hi>Spirit of God: Euery spirit which confesseth, that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p>Now heere thou must take heede, how thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandest these words: if thou take them litteral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Papists doe in the sixt Chapter of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sacrament, then thou art in an errour: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not only the Papists, but specially the Puritan, with diuers other sects, should receiue benefit by Christs death; which being rightly vnderstood, thou maist plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2244:57"/>
that they haue no right nor interest therein. For they that degrade Christ of his offices, as the Papists doe, or seeme to to seuer that vnion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Christs members, as the Puritan doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe separate themselues, both from Iesus Christ and h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s members. And therfore to cleare this point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceede, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esay</hi> saith: <hi>This peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come neere me with their mouth, and honour me with their lippes, but their heart is farre from me, Esa.</hi> 29. 13 And our blessed Sauiour saith) <hi>Not euery one that</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:2244:57"/>
               <hi>saith vnto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but he that doth the will of my father which is in heauen, Mat.</hi> 7. 21. And to make this more plaine, our Sauiour Christ saith further, <hi>Many will say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee in that day,</hi> that is, the day of Doome, <hi>Haue wee not prophesied by thy name, and by thy name cast out deuils, and by thy name done many great workes?</hi> yet for all these outward actions, wanting loue and charitie vnto the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, thy answer shall be, <hi>Depart from me, thou worker of iniquitie, I</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:2244:58"/>
               <hi>know thee not, Mat.</hi> 7. 2 3. So that wee see by these proofes, that it is not an outward profession only, which God requireth, but likewise an answerable conuersation. But now to the purpose.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadest thy selfe to bee a Teacher in the Schole of Christ, the world shall plainly see, that thou dost but flatter thy self in thy owne imagination, being quite contrarie minded to the true teachers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And that this is true, I will first set down a true disciple, and a follower
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2244:58"/>
of Christ, who according to our blessed Sauiours commaund, approouing himselfe both in his life and doctrine, teacheth with the spirit of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and patience, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by that blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of himselfe, and all true Teachers in this Schole of Christ, saith in these words: <hi>Wee giue no occasion of offence, that our Ministerie should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2244:59"/>
should mistake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, who are to deale some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with such an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, as doth oppose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against the truth, he likewise aduiseth <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie; To instruct such with the words of meekenes:</hi> and hee hath set downe a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why; <hi>for per aduenture God may give them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25.</p>
            <p>Now Brother, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art a Teacher after this manner, or but a Teacher after thine owne conceit, I appeale vnto such words as flow from thy fierie spirit of accusing Iudgements,

            <p>Saint <hi>Iude</hi> speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst disobedient spirits of authoritie, saith, <hi>That their rage is such, that they fome out their owne shame, Iude</hi> the thirteenth verse.

who ought not to keepe such words secret.

such fruits as these doe spring? there doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeare in thee but disobedience, rash accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Iudgements, hatred and malice, and cruell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, and all against the poore members of Iesus Christ, whose number by thy inchanted doctrine thou hast so diminished, that those of thy hatefull sect are growne infinite in multitudes. Thou hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest the fruits of the Gospel: Thou causest the Ministerie to be euill spoken of, thou resistest the truth, by setting vp an Idol of thy owne imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2244:66"/>
thou art so deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plunged in the depth of thy owne conceit, that as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>There is more hope in a foole then in him that is conceited.</hi> Prou. 26. 12. Thouhast giuen vs great cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-Smith, <hi>Thou hast done vs much hurt.</hi> But as he said, <hi>I trust the Lord will reward thee thereafter.</hi> 2. Tim. 4. 14. And yet for al this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou hast caused Gods Name greatly to be dishonoured, and loue and charitie smothered, notwithstanding all this,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2244:67"/>
thou art still readie with those conceited Iewes, who cryed, The Temple of the Lord, to excuse thy selfe and say, The Lords Anointed, the Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed. Now if it were not, that the god of this world had bewitcht thy thoughts, thou wouldst blnsh for shame to make such a cry amongst them, which know thee better then thou knowst thy selfe.</p>
            <p>Suppose thou couldst speak, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, <hi>with the tong of men &amp; Angels, &amp; haue not loue, thou art no better then sounding brasse</hi>

If thou wouldst giue vs cause to reioyce with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> how that thou preachest Christ as thou doest: thou must get thy

selfe to Virginia, or some other place where Christ was neuer heard before, where (no doubt) their good workes far exceede thine: then would be iust cause of reioycing, where Gods Name would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come greatly more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and they, and we both, more comforted. But to stay heere like an vnskilfull Physicion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the wounded members of Christ, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the wine of Gods Iudgements, reseruing the oyle of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies vnto thy selfe, I will vndertake, whereas thou
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2244:68"/>
curest one soule, thou kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest a thousand, so that in stead of reioycing, there is nothing to be expected from thee, but iust cause of great sorrow: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>We haue good cause to refuse thy company,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>If wee walke in the light, as hee is in the light, wee haue fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship one with another, and the blood of Iesus Christ his Sonne, clenseth us from all sinne,</hi> I. Ioh. 1. 7.</p>
            <p>Brother, thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest that the bloud of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ the Sonne of God, doth clense vs from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2244:69"/>
all sinne. And thou canst not deny, but that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the same. Now a question may arise, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are wee separated, and whether of vs haue sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated our selues? I haue alreadie shewed the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence herein sufficiently. For the tree is known by his fruit. But I will tell thee, Brother, if that thou hadst looked as seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and stayed thy self in the beginning of this verse, as thou hast done in the latter end, thou mightst better haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, not onely who it is, that goeth about to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2244:69"/>
breake this vnion which is betwixt Christ and his Church, butlikewise who it is that doth separate themselues herein.</p>
            <p>This Verse is sufficient to confute and confound both the Pope of Rome, and thy selfe, the latter end is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him, &amp; the fore-end sufficient to confound thee: he hath cut off him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in denying that the blood of Christ doth clense vs from all sinne: and thou hast cut off thy selfe, beeing separated from the fellowship of thy brethren, according

            <p>I haue sufficiently shewed how that thou hast not onely separated thy selfe from vs, but likewise prooued by the fruit of thy accusing Iudgements, how that both thou and thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers are become dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haters of thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: and thus the world may plainely see, how that by hating ofvs, thou

Vpon these words I gather, that thou art but an intruder in thy calling, and liuest by the sweate of other mens browes: that as the wandring and sturdy begger doth eate the bread of others: so thou beeing but a wandring Starre, and impatient, doest eate the bread of thy brothers. Thou preachest long Sermons,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2244:71"/>
and often: therein I blame thee not: it is the manner only that marres all: for in steade of that fierie Spirit of zeale and sinceritie of the heart to preach Christ in loue and humility: thou preachest Christ in accusing and condemning iudgements with the fiery spirit of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. And heere thou makest <hi>the verie powers of heauen to shake, Matth.</hi> 24. 29.</p>
            <p>But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being of a contrary spirit, saith, <hi>To the weake I become as weake, that I may win the weake: I am made all things</hi>

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> heere, to winne men vnto Christ, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect these outward things of indifferencie, but is content to obserue all times, and to eate and drinke with all sorts of people, to winne some vnto God. And for this ende, our Sauiour Christ was content to debase himselfe, <hi>To conuerse, and to eate and drinke with Publicans and sinners, Luk.</hi> 5. 29. But thou, who scornest all company but those of thy owne sect, <hi>Bindest heauie burdens, and</hi>

               <hi>layest them on mens shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but as for thy selfe, thou wilt not mooue them with one of thy fingers, Matth.</hi> 23. 4. Thou, like the proud Pharise, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest the Law very strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and thou seemest in outward shew to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs; and if wee doe not make an outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as thou doest, then presently thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trest into vncharitable iudgement of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and yet who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, how fleshly-minded thou art, both in thy wordes and deedes? and how thou <hi>temptest</hi>

            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Who art thou that iudgest thy brother? or why doest thou set thy brother at nought? we must all appeare before the Iudgement seat o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

the truth is, wee know thee but too well, for we finde thee altogether, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Without naturall affection,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 3. But alas, what hast thou done in iudging thus vncharitably? Thou hast done no lesse then ioyned thy selfe with the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to iudge all, but will be iudged of none; and therefore making thy selfe hayle fellow well met with him, thou hast with him and all the rest of the whole world, which doe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselues against

the LORD and his Anointed, yeelded your selues so farre vnto the vanitie of your owne i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, that yee wilfully haue drowned your selues in the redde sea of Iudgements.</p>
            <p>And thus I haue let thee see, first, thy diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: secondly, thy impatient and accusing iudgements, wherein the world may plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, how that nothing doth proceed, nor can be gathered from them, but contention, enuie, hatred, and such inuetered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, that thereby thou
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2244:74"/>
hast caused the Sunne to be darkened, the Moone to lose her light, and the very powers of heauen to shake. In a word, thou hast iustly caused Gods most sacred name so greatly dishonored, that without a very speedy and suddaine repentance, thou shalt haue for thy better satisfaction, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, such a recompence of reward, as is prescribed in these two wordes, <hi>Indignation and wrath, Rom.</hi> 2. 8</p>
            <p>Now Brother, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these thy most cruell iudgements against

            <p>It is he whom thou hast opposed thy selfe against, both in thy disobedience to man, and likewise in thy rash iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst both God &amp; Man. And as I haue in loue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended thy errours in these two: so likewise I am ready by Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to reproue thee in thy prayer, wherin thou deseruest. And first for the length of thy prayer.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2244:88"/>
our blessed Sauiour, lest his Disciples should imitate the Heathen in their idle repetitions: he giues them a prescription &amp; forme of prayer, giuing them a special warning to direct and frame all their prayers after the manner of the prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 9. And hereupon I gather, that all long prayers are absolutely for bidden. For seeing that al things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both body &amp; soul, are contained within this short compasse of these sixe petitions, I conclude that all our prayers must of necessitie, if we wil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2244:89"/>
Christs direction, be made both pythic and short. And how soeuer I am not able to reason the case with a Scholler, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am no Scholler my selfe: yet the Spirit of God telleth me against the greatest schollers in the world, that hee is out of Christs schoole, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer hee bee that doth reason to the contrarie; of which sort, how soeuer they may seeme to please themselues, it is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument, that such neither loue Christ, nor his prayer.</p>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2244:89"/>
good, I am readie to approue it by such two sufficient witnesses, that if thy eyes bee not darkened still, thou wilt confesse the same.</p>
            <p>My first proofe is Christ himselfe, who draweth a reason from Gods omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, in these words: <hi>For your Father knoweth whereof ye haue need, before ye aske of him, Math.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
            <p>My second proofe is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in these words: <hi>Bee not rash with thy mouth, nor let thy heart be hastie to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a thing before God: for God is in the bea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

These two examples, who for wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was neuer any comparable, these iumpe both in one reason, being drawne from Gods om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie. Now the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whether that thou wilt rest thy self still in thy owne conceit, as thou hast done, or thou wilt yeeld thy selfe vnto these 2. examples: I dare vndertake that for any prayer thou makest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Sermons, deuide the same into 4. parts, and as much and more may be contained in one part, as is in all the rest.</p>

sweetnesse thereof hath no good rellish, in thy owne conceite: for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it so fast ouer, as though thou wert count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to twenty, doth argue that thou neither takest loue or liking thereunto: and therefore marke well what I say, thou, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusest the counsell of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and wilt not be aduised by his followers, resisting the Spirit of grace offered thee, shalt one day, without a speedy repentance, so taste and drinke of that poysoned cup of thy owne conceit, that very deseruedly, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2244:92"/>
most worthy therof, thou shalt bee excluded both from Iesus Christ, and his members for euermore.</p>
            <p>Now because that the world shall better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, how contrarie thy thoughts and conceited imaginations are, vnto the true meaning of the Lords Prayer, I will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that little measure of knowledge, explaine the same, in as briefe a manner as I can: And first what is meant by <hi>hallowed be thy Name:</hi> that is, to desire with the inward affection of the heart, that God alone
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2244:92"/>
may haue all honour and glory vnto himselfe: but thou, who restest in thy own conceit, attributest honour vnto thy selfe: herein thou art a thiefe, in robbing God of his glory.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Thy Kingdome come:</hi> that is, to desire with the inward affection of the heart, that God would so rule and raigne, both in our inward affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as that neither Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, nor our owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, may rule or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineere against vs, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring further, that hee
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2244:93"/>
would hasten his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Iudgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e his Name is so greatly dishonored. Now seeing that thou refusest to desire this in thy hart, which God greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, or vsing to passe it ouer sometimes so slightly as thou doest: it is no maruell, that thou art inchanted by Sathan, to follow the vaine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of thy owne heart. Therefore thou canst not say, &amp; say truly, Hasten thy Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in Heauen:</hi> That is, to desire that our
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2244:93"/>
wils and affections may bee framed according to Gods will: and as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heauen are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ready in a heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience, to do Gods wil, both readily, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and gladly: Euen so should we alwaies be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand vs, imitating the Angels, willingly, gladly, &amp; readily. Now how far off thou art from submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy wil and affection vnto Gods will, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in thy disobedience against Principalities and Powers. And againe, how
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2244:94"/>
sarre thou art off from the example of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Angels, appeareth by the fruits both of thy life and doctrine, so that thy will and affections are so contrarie vnto Gods will, that they are only linked vnto the imagination of thy owne heart.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Giue vs this day our daily bread:</hi> that is, to desire all things conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, both for body and soule. Heerein thou hast made thy selfe vnworthy to partake of the least of Gods benefits, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the wicked flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish for a time, and that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2244:94"/>
the dearest of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren many times doe want these outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, yet it pleaseth God so to enrich them with his inward graces, that outward wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts neuer trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their mindes at all.</p>
            <p>Now thou, who art so disobedient both vnto God and man, being but an intruder in thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, hast tyed thy selfe in a double bond, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to partake of these outward blessings, and resting thy selfe in thine own imaginations, thou hast depriued thy self of the inward graces.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2244:95"/>
               <hi>And forgiue vs our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, as we forgiue them that trespasse against vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas wee desire here to haue our offences forgiuen vs with a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: who knoweth not that all those, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a patient Spirit of adoption, that they are so farre off from the least shaddow of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies readie, and willing to forgiue their vtter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?</p>
            <p>But how contrarie. minded thou art herein, I might appeale vnto thy owne conscience, if thou
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2244:95"/>
haddest any: but seeing thou hast none, the world may iudge what spirit thou art of, as appeareth before, concerning a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written vnto one of the chiefe of thy sect. For which how greatly I was troubled, and likewise what it cost my purse, I omit to set downe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I expect no better requitall at any of your hands, vntill such time, as the wisest in your own conceit can prooue, that grapes may growe vpon thornes, and figgs vpon thistles.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>And leade vs</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:2244:96"/>
               <hi>not into temptation, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs from all euill.</hi> Here wee desire that God would not suffer Satan and our naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to tempt vs aboue our strength: and because out greatest strength is too weake to resist, wee desire in the second place so to assist vs, that by his speciall power he would deliuer vs from all euill.</p>
            <p>Now whereas thou hast refused to pray vnto God in Christ, in this most perfect prayer, it is no maruaile that God in his iust iudgement hath giuen thee ouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2244:96"/>
Satan, and thy owne corruptions, letting thee swimme in that sinfull sea of thy owne imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And thus may the world see how contrarie thou art to Iesus Christ, and his prayer, refusing the God of light, beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thy selfe to an Idol god of darknesse.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Sauiour Christ saith, <hi>And when thou prayest, be not like the Hypocrite, for they loue to stand and pray in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, Matth.</hi> 6. 5. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, praving for the <hi>Ephesians, I bow my knees vnto the Father of</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:2244:97"/>
               <hi>our Lord Iesus Christ, Eph.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
            <p>Now, as thou hast shewed thy selfe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted spirit against both God and good men: so now especially, lest the world should not take more full notice of thy folly, thou hast got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thy selfe into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie height of shame: and as thy deformed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of disobedience haue burst out of thy in ward parts: so now at last thou shewest likewise what a deformed creature thou art, in thy outward parts; for, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other are at their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2244:97"/>
praiers, vpon their knees, thou and thy followers stand vp like May-poles amongst vs, as though ye had no knees at all.</p>
            <p>Now, how true this is, it cannot bee denied, for both thy selfe, and infinit multitudes of thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, in all places of this Land, doe manifest the same. And as this is true in thy publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Church where specially it is forbidden: so likewise at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Sacrament: &amp; although Iesus Christ be as truly there, by the eie of faith, after a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2244:98"/>
manner, as though we did beholde him, and touch him as Saint <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> did: yet thou, who neither fearest God, nor reuerencest man, as thou hast shewed thy selfe a deformed fellow from the beginning, doest not blush to stand, in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when others are vpon their knees. Now if the Officers of the Church come to reproue these thy followers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are an offence vnto their brethren, then must their vsurping guide say, Sirra, let them alone:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2244:98"/>
and thus are almost al the places of this Land abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with this disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Sect; and that this is true, wofull experience doth manifest the same.</p>
            <p>If I should aske thee this question, why thou wilt not pray kneeling? thou wilt answer me, It is not because thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest it vnlawfull: but thy reason is, that thou canst pray with as good a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion standing, as I can doe kneeling. I doe not deny, but that one may pray standing, going, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, sitting, or lying. But whereas our Sauiour
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2244:99"/>
Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands, that we should not stand praying in the Synagogues or Churches: Why wilt thou, hauing conuenient roome, not yeelde thy selfe vnto Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? I did once make answere for thee before, and because thou hast no good reason for thy selfe, I will second an answere for thee once againe.</p>
            <p>Because thou wouldest make the world beleeue, that thou art better then thy neighbours in shew of thy outward actions, therefore thou hast sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated thy selfe from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2244:99"/>
and rather then the world should not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that thou art <hi>singular</hi> (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith of such) <hi>in thy owne eyes still, Prou.</hi> 16. 2. Thou now standest streight vp, when others are kneeling, that all men may now behold, that thou art but a plaine Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</p>
            <p>Againe, for thy beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour both at thy first sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down in the Church, and likewise at thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the Pulpit, thou art so far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy selfe vnto God, that without either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate prayer, or seeming

Now seeing thou doest but intrude thy self, prefuming too bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into that place of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitìe, if thou wilt neither pray nor sing with vs, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thy face, or come there no more, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile these sinfull times wherein we liue, as being the principall instrument for Satan thereof, and be sure of this one thing, that ifthou dost not feele
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2244:100"/>
a touch for thy sinnes, vpon the sight heereof, thou maiest perswade thy selfe, that thou art in a most fearefull and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable case: and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised how thou presumest into that holy place any more: for assure thy sel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e, that Christ, whom thou hast so grieuously of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in his members, will one day, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie shortly, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent repentance, require their blood at thy hands, and will auenge their cause in that place, where all Hypocrites shall haue their portion, which bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

            <p>One thing more I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, which I would not willingly haue omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: how that a reformed Minister submitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe at his approch into the Pulpit, as his maner is, one of thy chiefest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, being a Ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this crue, most shamefully burst forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a scornefull laughter, This is one of thy brood, that being hatcht vnder such a Cockatrice, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruit can come therof.</p>
            <p>Now, seeing that all thy outward actions are
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2244:101"/>
but flourisht like painted sepulchres, and that from all thy actions both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth proceede but enuy and strife, pride, and vaine-glory, hatred and malice, and most cruel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: why dost thou not begin to tremble &amp; quake for feare, seeing that <hi>the axe is alreadie laid to the roote of the tree, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery tree which bringeth not soorth good fruite, must be hewne downe, and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, Mat.</hi> 7. 19?</p>
            <p>Our blessed Sauiour saith, <hi>Hee that is not with me, is against me, Ma.</hi> 12. 30</p>

               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:2244:102"/>
Now who is he that seeth not, how that thou opposest thy selfe against Christ; and therefore as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, of whom it is said, <hi>That there are many gone out into the world, whereby wee know, that it is the last time,</hi> I. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 18.</p>
            <p>Againe, who knoweth not, that thou art a starre fallen from heauen, who by thy accusing iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in condemning both the quicke and the dead, seeming to pull that peculiar rod foorth of Gods owne hands, who therewith hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

now at last, who is he that liueth in these daies, and doth not lament to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how that Religion, euen in those which doe professe Christ, is now become nothing else but a plaine cloke, or a couer for sinne? for is it not too manifest, that some one of the chiefest of thy sect, meeting a Countriman in his trauell by meere chance, took occasion for some by-respect, to haue some conference with him: but his name being demanded, hee did not only peremptorily deny himselfe, but likewise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

his name, in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that some other countrimen, being of good note and fashion, who know him better, then he knowes himselfe, being sorrie to heare a man of his coate, &amp; their Countriman so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to denie himself, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded further where he dwelt? but his answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friuolous as before, said, Euery where, where our King hath any land.
