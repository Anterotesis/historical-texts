            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And also how that in Salomons daies, euery man gaue to the building of the temple more or lesse, and now séeing it hathe pleased our <hi>Iehoas</hi> to giue commaundement to the Préests to repair the Temple at their charge. And our <hi>Darius</hi> to forbid any man to hinder the woork, but all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to further the same: I (as a cariar of rubbishe or fillingꝭ) haue thought my selfe to negligent in looking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> so long, and although that my labour
<pb facs="tcp:11245:3"/>
be small, &amp; my cunning muche lesse, yet let the frée Masons (or maister woorkme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) bear with me, and accept my good wil, be séeching them to build on as they haue be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gun, that I, and suche prentises of theirs as I am: may dayly learn at their handꝭ, at length to be iorney men, the head ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of all assisting vs. I haue taken in hand to make in méeter, the chéef &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pall matters in the whole Bible, keping the order of the chapters as they stand, &amp; also beginning the first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chapter of euery book with A. the first letter of the Crosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, and the second B. the third C. and so to the letter U. the Alphabet to last, xx. letters, kéeping on twentie Chapters. Now if the book or part of the same be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue twentie chapters: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> begin I with A. again, as for example, <hi>Genesis</hi> hath fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Chapiters, therefore because that it should not be to tedious: it is deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts, as the first part fiue &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie Chapters, and so the next, then when the twentie chapiters be done, A. and so B. C. D. E. whiche are fiue letters, and there ends that part, then beginneth the next part with A. againe, and so to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and then those fiue letters again, and
<pb facs="tcp:11245:4"/>
so ends that book and fiftie chapters, but some book hath not twentie chapiters, as héer in this setting out, the book of <hi>Ruthe,</hi> then goeth the letters no further then there be chapters, as D. is the fourth let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, so hath that story but foure chapters.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth the letter A. and the number one, so holde thou out thy left hand, and point with thy fore finger of thy right hand, to the top of thy left hand thombe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that there is the first letter, the first in number, and the first chapiter of eche book (vnlesse that it begin again as I tolde thée of <hi>Genesis</hi>) then though it be the first letter, yet standeth it for one &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie in number and chapters.
