         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOu are to take
this Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
very Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for the Authour
of it has ventur'd his
Reputation to Oblige
you: Ventur'd it
(I say) even in the
<pb facs="tcp:47898:3"/>
very Attempt of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying
so Nice an
Original. It is, in
<hi>French,</hi> one of the
most Artificial Pieces
perhaps of the Kind,
that is any where Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant:
Beside the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Graces, and
Felicities of that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
in the Matter
of an <hi>Amour,</hi> which
cannot be adopted
into any other
Tongue without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<pb facs="tcp:47898:3"/>
Force, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation.
There was
(it seems) an <hi>Intrigue</hi>
of Love carry'd on
betwixt a <hi>French Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>
and a <hi>Nun</hi> in
<hi>Portugal.</hi> The Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
forsakes his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress,
and Returns
for <hi>France.</hi> The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
expostulates the
Business in five Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Complaint,
which She sends af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him; and those
<pb facs="tcp:47898:4"/>
five Letters are here
at your Service. You
will find in them the
Lively Image of an
Extravagant, and an
Unfortunate Passion;
and that <hi>a Woman may
be Flesh and Bloud, in a
Cloyster, as well as in a
Palace.</hi>

Portugaise
LETTERS
Turn'd into

            <head>The first Letter.</head>
            <p>OH my Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
Improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Love; and those
Treacherous Hopes that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47898:5"/>
have betray'd both Thee,
and Me! The Passion
that I design'd for the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of my Life, is become
the Torment of it: A Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as prodigious as the
Cruelty of his Absence
that causes it. Bless mee!
But must this Absence last
for ever? This Hellish
Absence, that Sorrow it
self wants words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press?
Am I then never
to see those Eyes again,
that have so often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd
Love with Mine,
and Charm'd my very
soul with Extacy, and
Delight? Those Eyes that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47898:5"/>
were ten thousand worlds
to mee, and all that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd;
the only comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Light of Mine, which,
since I understood the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of your Insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Departure, have
Serv'd mee but to weep
withall, and to lament
the sad Approach of my
Inevitable fate. And yet
in this Extremity I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
me-thinks, but have
some Tenderness, even
for the Misfortunes that
are of your Creating.
My Life was vow'd to
you the first time I saw
you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and since you would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47898:6"/>
not accept of it as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
I am Content to
make it a sacrifice. A
Thousand times a day I
send my Sighs to hunt
you out: and what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
for all my Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Disquiets, but the
good Counsel of my Cross
fortune? that whispers
me at every turn; Ah
wretched <hi>Mariane!</hi> why
do'st thou flatter, and
Consume thy self in the
vain pursuit of a Creature
never to be Recover'd?
Hee's gone, hee's gone;
Irrevocably gone; h'as
past the seas to fly thee.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47898:6"/>
Hee's now in <hi>France;</hi>
dissolv'd in pleasures; and
thinks no more of thee,
or what thou suffer'st for
his false sake, then if he
had never known any
such woman. But hold:
Y'ave more of Honour in
you then to do so ill a
thing; and so have I, then
to believe it, especially
of a Person that I'm so
much concern'd to justify.
<hi>Forget me?</hi> 'Tis Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
My Case is bad
enough at best, without
the Aggravation of vain
suppositions. No, no:
The Care and Pains you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47898:7"/>
took to make me think
you lov'd me, and then
the Joyes that That Care
gave Me, must never be
forgotten: and should I
love you less this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then when I lov'd
you most, (in Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that you lov'd me
so too) I were Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
'Tis an Unnatural,
and a strange thing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
that the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of those blessed
hours should be now so
terrible to me; and that
those delights that were
so ravishing in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
should become so
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47898:7"/>
ter in the Reflection. Your
last Letter gave me such a
Passion of the heart, as if
it would have forc'd its
way thorough my Breast,
and follow'd you. It laid
me three hours sensless:
I wish it had been <hi>dead;</hi>
for I had dy'd of Love.
But I reviv'd: and to
what End? only to die
again, and lose that Life
for you, which you your
self did not think worth
the saving. Beside that
there's no Rest for me,
while you're Away, but
in the grave. This fit
was follow'd with other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47898:8"/>
Ill Accidents which I shall
never be without, till I
see you: In the mean
while, I bear them yet
without repining, because
they came from you. But
with your Leave: Is this
the Recompense that you
intend me? Is this your
way of treating those that
love you? Yet 'tis no
Matter, for (do what you
will) I am resolv'd to be
firm to you to my last
gasp; and never to see
the Eyes of any other
Mortal. And I dare as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you that it will not
be the worse for you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47898:8"/>
if you never set your
heart upon any other
woman: for certainly a
Passion under the degree
of mine, will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
you: You may find
more Beauty perhaps els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
(tho' the time was
when you found no fault
with mine) but you shall
never meet with so true a
heart; and all the rest is
nothing.</p>
            <p>Let me entreat you not
to stuff your Letters with
things Unprofitable, and
Impertinent to our Affair:
and you may save your
self the trouble too of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47898:9"/>
desiring me to THINK
of you. why 'tis Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for me to forget you:
and I must not forget the
hope you gave me neither,
of your Return, and of
spending some part of your
time here with us in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi>
Alas! And why
not your whole Life ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
If I could but find
any way to deliver my
self from this unlucky
Cloyster, I should hardly
stand gaping here for the
performance of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
but in defiance of
all opposition, put my
self upon the March,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47898:9"/>
Search you out, follow
you, and love you
throughout the whole
world. It is not that I
please my self with this
Project as a thing feasible;
or that I would so much
as entertain any hope of
Comfort; (tho' in the
very delusion I might find
pleasure) but as it is my
Lot to be miserable, I
will be only sensible of
that which is my Doom.
And yet after all this, I
cannot deny but upon this
Opportunity of writing
to you which my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
has given me, I was

surpriz'd with some faint
Glimmerings of Delight,
that yielded me a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Respite to the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of my despair. Tell
me I conjure you; what
was it that made you so
sollicitous to entangle me,
when you knew you were
to leave me? And why
so bloudily bent to make
me Unhappy? why
could you not let me
alone at quiet in my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Cloyster as you found me?
Did I ever do you any
Injury?</p>
            <p>But I must ask your
Pardon; for I lay nothing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47898:11"/>
to your Charge. I am
not in condition to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
a Revenge: and I
can only complain of the
Rigour of my Perverse
fortune. When she has
parted our Bodies, she has
done her worst, and left
us nothing more to fear:
Our hearts are Inseparable;
for those whom Love has
United are never to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.
As you tender my
soul let me hear often
from you. I have a Right
me-thinks to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
both of your Heart,
and of your fortune; and
to your Care to inform
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47898:12"/>
me of it too. But <hi>what ever
you do, be sure to come; and
above all things in the
world, to let me see you.
Adieu.</hi> And yet I cannot
quitt this Paper yet. Oh
that I could but convey
my self in the Place on't!
Mad fool that I am, to
talk at this Rate of a thing
that I my self know to be
Impossible! <hi>Adieu.</hi> For
I can go no farther. <hi>Adieu.</hi>
Do but Love me for ever,

               </gap>or my Quiet. Or
if I may not say that you
are Unjust, it is yet the
most Reasonable thing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47898:13"/>
in the World to let me
tell you that I am Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
I foresaw what it
would come to, upon the
very Instant of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to leave me.
Weak Woman that I was!
to expect, (after this)
that you should have more
Honour, and Integrity
then other Men, because
I had unquestionably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
it from you, by a
transcendent degree of
Affection above the Love
of Other Women. No,
no; Your Levity, and
Aversion have overrul'd
your Gratitude, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47898:14"/>
Justice; you are my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
by Inclination:
whereas only the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Disposition
can Oblige me. Nay
your Love it self, if it
were barely grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Loving of you,
could never make me
happy. But so far am I
even from that Pretence,
that in six Moneths I have
not receiv'd one sillable
from you; Which I must
impute to the blind fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of my own Passion,
for I should otherwise
have foreseen that my
Comforts were to be but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47898:14"/>
Temporary, and my Love
Everlasting. For Why
should I think that you
would ever content your
self to spend your Whole
Life in <hi>Portugal;</hi> and
relinquish your Country,
and your fortune, only
to think of me? Alas!
my sorrows are Inconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
and the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of my past
Enjoyments makes up a
great part of my present
pain. But must all my
hopes be blasted then,
and fruitless? Why may
not I yet live to see you
again within these Walls,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47898:15"/>
and with all those Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports
of Extacy, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
as heretofore?
But how I fool my self! for
I find now that the Passion,
which on my side, took
up all the faculties of my
soul, and Body, was only
excited on your part by
some loose Pleasures, and
that they were to live and
die together. It should
have been my Business,
even in the Nick of those
Critical, and Blessed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
to have Reason'd
my self into the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so Charming,
and deadly an Excess; and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47898:15"/>
to have told my self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
the fate which
I now suffer. But my
Thoughts were too much
taken up with You to
consider my self; So that
I was not in Condition to
attend the Care of my
Repose, or to bethink
my self of what might
poison it, and disappoint
me in the full Emprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the most Ardent
Instances of your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I was too much
pleas'd with you, to think
of parting with you, and
yet you may remember
that I have told you now
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47898:16"/>
and then by fits, that
you would be the Ruin
of me. But those Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
were soon dispers'd;
and I was glad to yield
them up too; and to give
up my self to the Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of your false Oaths,
and Protestations. I see
very well the Remedy of
all my Misfortunes, and
that I should quickly be
at Ease if I could leave
Loving you. But Alas!
That were a Remedy
worse then the disease.
No, no: I'le rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any thing then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
you. Nor could I if I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47898:16"/>
would. 'Tis a thing that
did never so much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into my Thought.
But is not your Condition
now the worse of the two?
Is it not better to endure
what I now suffer, then
to enjoy Your faint satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
among your
French Mistresses? I am
so far from Envying your
Indifference, that I Pitty
it. I defie you to forget
me absolutely: and I am
deceiv'd if I have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
such a Course with
you, that you shall never
be perfectly happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
me. Nay perhaps I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47898:17"/>
am at this Instant the less
miserable of the two; in
regard that I am the more
employ'd. They have
lately made me door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
here in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
All the people that
talk to me think me mad;
for I answer them I know
not what; And certainly
the rest of the Convent
must be as mad as I, they
would never else have
thought me Capable of
any Trust. How do I
envy the good Fortune
of poor <hi>Emanuel,</hi> and
<hi>Francisco!</hi> Why cannot
I be with you perpetually
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47898:17"/>
as they are? tho in your
Livery too? I should
follow you as Close with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
dispute, and serve
you at least as faithfully;
for there is nothing in this
World that I so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
as to see you; But
however, let me entreat
you to think of me; and
I shall Content my self
with a bare place in your
Memory. And yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell neither, whether
I should or no: for I
know very well that when
I saw you every day I
should hardly have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
my self within these
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47898:18"/>
Bounds. But you have
taught me since, that
whatsoever you will have
me do, I must do. In
the <hi>Interim,</hi> I do not at
all repent of my Passion
for you; Nay, I am well
enough satisfi'd that you
have seduc'd me; and
your Absence it self tho'
never so rigorous, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Eternal, does not at
all lessen the vigour of my
Love: which I will avow
to the Whole world, for
I make no secret on't. I
have done many things
irregularly 'tis true; and
and against the Common
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47898:18"/>
Rules of good Manners:
and not without taking
some Glory in them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because they were
done for your sake. My
honour, and Religion are
brought only to serve
the Turn of my Love, and
to carry me on to my
lives end, in the Passionate
Continuance of the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
I have begun. I do
not write this, to draw a
Letter from you; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
never force your self
for the Matter: for I will
receive nothing at your
hands; no not so much
as any Mark of your Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47898:19"/>
unless it comes of its
own accord, and in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
whether you Will or
No. If it may give you any
satisfaction, to save your
self the trouble of Writing,
it shall give me some like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
to excuse the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness
of it; for I am
wonderfully enclin'd to
pass over all your faults.
A <hi>French</hi> Officer, that
had the Charity this
morning to hold me at
least three hours in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of you, tell me
that <hi>France</hi> has made a
Peace. If it be so; Why
cannot you bestow a visit
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47898:19"/>
upon me, and take me
away with you? But 'tis
more then I deserve, and
it must be as you please;
for my Love does not at
all depend upon your
Manner of treating me.
Since you went away I
have not had one Minutes
Health, nor any sort of
Pleasure, but in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
of your Name, which
I call upon a Thousand
times a day. Some of
my Companions that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the deplorable
Ruin you have brought
upon me, are so good as
to entertain me many
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47898:20"/>
times concerning you. I
keep as Close to my
Chamber as is possible;
which is the dearer to me
even for the many Visits
you have made me there.
Your Picture I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
before me, and
I Love it more then my
hearts bloud. The very
Counterfeit gives me some
Comfort: But oh the
Horrours too! When I
consider that the Original,
for ought I know, is lost
for ever. But why should
it be possible, even to be
possible, that I may never
see you more? Have you
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47898:20"/>
forsaken me then for ever?
It turns my Brain to think
on't. Poor <hi>Mariane!</hi> But
my Spirits fail me, and
I shall scarce out-live this
Letter?—Mercy—Farwel,
Farwel.</p>

            <p>WHat shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

Or what will
you advise me to do? How
strangely am I dissap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
in all my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations!
Where are the
Letters from you? the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47898:22"/>
Long and Kind Letters
that I look'd for by every
Post? To keep me alive
in the hopes of Seeing
you again; and in the
Confidence of your faith,
and Justice; to settle me
in some tolerable state of
Repose, without being
abandon'd to any insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
Extream? I had
once cast my Thoughts
upon some Idle Projects
of endeavouring my own
Cure, in Case I could but
once assure my self that I
was totally forgotten.
The distance you were at;
Certain Impulses of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47898:22"/>
the fear of utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroying the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of my Imperfect
health, by so many rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Nights, and Cares;
the Improbability of your
Return; The Coldness of
your Passion, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of your last <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu's;</hi>
Your Weak, and
frivolous pretences for
your departure: These,
with a thousand other
Considerations, (of more
weight, then profit) did
all concurre to encourage
me in my design, if I
should find it necessary;
In fine; having only my
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47898:23"/>
single self to encounter I
could not doubt of the
success, nor could it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into my Apprehension
what I feel at this day.
Alas! how wretched is
my Condition, that am
not allow'd so much as to
divide these sorrows with
you, of which you your self
are the Cause? You are
the Offender, and I am
to bear the Punishment
of your Crime. It strikes
me to the very heart, for
fear you, that are now so
Insensible of my Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
were never much
affected with our mutual
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47898:23"/>
delights. Yes, yes; 'Tis
now a Clear Case that
your whole Address to
me was only an Artificial
disguise. You betray'd
me as often as you told
me, how over-joy'd you
were that you had got me
alone: and your Passions,
and Transports were only
the Effects of my own
Importunities. Yours was
a deliberate design to fool
me; your business was to
make a Conquest, not a
friend; and to triumph
over my Heart, without
ever engaging or hazzard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your own. Are not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47898:24"/>
you very Unhappy now,
and (at least) Ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd,
if not ill-bred, only
to make this wretched
use of so Superlative a
friendship? Who would
have thought it possible
that such a Love as mine,
should not have made you
happy? 'Tis for your sake
alone if I am troubl'd for
the Infinite delights that
you have lost, and might
as easily have enjoy'd,
had you but thought them
worth the while. Ah! If
you did but understand
them aright, you would
find a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47898:24"/>
the Pleasure of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging
me, and that of
Abusing me; and betwixt
the Charming felicities of
Loving violently, and of
being so belov'd. I do
not know either what I
am, or what I do, or
what I would be at. I
am torn to pieces by a
Thousand contrary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and in a Condition
deplorable beyond imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
I love you to
death, and so tenderly too
that I dare hardly wish
your heart in the same
condition with mine. I
should destroy my self, or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47898:25"/>
die with Grief, could I
believe your nights and
Thoughts, as restless as
I find Mine; your Life as
Anxious and disturb'd;
your Eyes still flowing,
and all things and people
Odious to you. Alas! I
am hardly able to bear up
under my own Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
how should I then
Support the Weight of
yours; which would be a
Thousand times more
grievous to me? And yet
all this While I cannot
bring my self to advise
you, not to Think of me.
And to deal freely with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47898:25"/>
you, there is not any thing
in <hi>France</hi> that you take
pleasure in, or that comes
near your heart, but I'm
most furiously jealous of it.
I do not know what 'tis I
write for. Perhaps you'l
pitty me; but what good
will that pitty do me?
I'le none on't. Oh how
I hate my self when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what I have forfeited
to oblige you! I have
blasted my Reputation;
I have lost my Parents;
I have expos'd my self to
the Lawes of my Country
against Persons of my
Profession; and finally,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47898:26"/>
to your Ingratitude, the
worst of my Misfortunes.
But why do I pretend to a
Remorse, when at this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
I should be glad with
all my Soul, if I had run ten
thousand greater hazzards
for your dear Sake? and
for the danger of my Life
and Honour; the very
thought on't is a kind of
doleful Pleasure to me,
and all's no more then
the delivery of whats
your own, and what
I hold most Pretious,
into your Disposition;
And I do not know how
all these risques could have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47898:26"/>
been better Imploy'd. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Whole matter, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing displeases me,
my Love, my Misfortune;
and alas! I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my self that I am
well us'd even by You. And
yet I Live, (false as I am)
and take as much pains to
preserve my life, as to lose
it. Why do I not die of
shame then, and shew you
the despair of my Heart,
as well as of my Letters?
If I had lov'd you so much
as I have told you a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times I did, I had
been in my Grave long
ere this. But I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47898:27"/>
you, and the Cause
of Complaint is now on
your side. Alas! why
did you not tell me of it?
Did I not see you go away?
Am I not out of all hopes
of ever seeing you again?
And am I yet alive? I have
betray'd you, and I beg
your pardon. But do not
grant it though; Treat
me as severely as you
will: Tell me that my
Passion is Weak, and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolute.
Make your self
yet harder to be pleas'd.
Write me word that
you would have me die
for you. Do it, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47898:27"/>
you; and assist me
in the Work of surmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Infirmity of my
Sex; and that I may put
an end to all my fruitless
deliberations, by an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
despair. A Tragical
Conclusion would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
bring me often
into your thoughts, and
make my Memory dear to
you. And who knows
how you might be Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with the Bravery of
so Glorious a death? A
death Incomparably to be
preferr'd before the Life
that you have left me.
Farwel then; and <hi>I wish</hi>

Contradicts my Pen; for
I feel, in the very moment
that I write it, that I

Love you in any state of
Misery, then agree to the
bare Supposition that I
had never Seen you.
Wherefore since you do
not think fit, to mend
my fortune, I shall chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
submit to the worst
on't. <hi>Adieu;</hi> but first
promise me, that if I die
of grief, you will have
some Tenderness for my
Ashes: Or at least that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47898:29"/>
the Generosity of my
Passion shall put you out
of Love with all other
things. This Consolation
shall satisfie me, that if
you must never be mine,
I may be secur'd that you
shall never be Anothers.
You cannot be so Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
sure, as to make a
mean use of my most Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
despairs, and
to recommend your self
to any other Woman, by
shewing the Power you
have had upon me. Once
more, <hi>Adieu.</hi> My Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are long, and I fear
troublesom; but I hope
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47898:30"/>

of a Sot of your own
making. <hi>Adieu.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I run over and over

of my most deplorable
Condition: Give me leave
now to thank you from
the Bottom of my heart
for the Miseries you have
brought upon me, and to
detest the Tranquillity I
liv'd in before I knew you.
My Passion is greater eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<hi>Adieu.</hi> Oh what a World

            <head>THE
FOURTH
Letter.</head>
            <p>YOur Lieutenant tells
me that you were
forc'd by foul Weather to
put in upon the Coast of
<hi>Algarve.</hi> I am afraid the
Sea does not agree with
you; and my Fears for
your Misfortunes make
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47898:31"/>
me almost to forget my
own. Can you imagin
your Lieutenant to be
more concern'd in what
befals you, than I am?
If not, How comes he
to be so well inform'd,
and not one sillable to
me? If you could never
find the means of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to me since you went,
I am very Unhappy; but
I am more so, if you
could have written, and
would not. But what
should a body expect from
so much Ingratitude, and
Injustice? And yet it would
break my heart, if hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47898:31"/>
should punish you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any account of mine.
For I had much rather
gratifie my kindness, than
my Revenge. There can
be nothing clearer, than
that you neither Love me,
nor Care what becomes
of me; and yet am I so
foolish, as to follow the
Dictate of a blind, and
besotted Passion, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Counsels
of a demonstrative Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
This Coldness of
yours, when you and I
were first acquainted,
would have sav'd me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a sorrowful Thought.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47898:32"/>
But where's the Woman,
that in my Place, would
have done otherwise than
I did? Who would ever
have question'd the Truth
of so pressing and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
an Importunity?
We cannot easily bring
our selves to suspect the
Faith of those we Love.
I know very well, that a
slender Excuse will serve
your Turn; and I'le be so
kind as to save you even
the Labour of That too,
by telling you, that I
can never consent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
you guilty, but in
order to the infinite Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47898:32"/>
I shall take to acquit
you, in perswading my
self that you are Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
It was the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity
of your Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that refin'd me; your
Passion that inflam'd me;
Your good humour that
Charm'd me; your Oaths,
and Vows that confirm'd
me; but 'twas my own
precipitate Inclination that
seduc'd me; and what's
the Issue of these fair, and
promising Beginnings, but
Sighs, Tears, Disquiets,
nay, and the worst of
Deaths too, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hope, or Remedy.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47898:33"/>
The Delights of my Love,
I must confess, have been
strangely surprizing; but
follow'd with Miseries
not to be express'd; (as
whatever comes from you
works upon me in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.)
If I had either
obstinately oppos'd your
Address; or done any
thing to put you out of
humour, or make you
jealous, with a design to
draw you on: If I had
gon any crafty, artificial
wayes to work with you;
or but so much as check'd
my early, and my grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Inclinations to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47898:33"/>
with you, (tho' it
would have been to no
purpose at all) you might
have had some Colour
then to make use of your
Power, and deal with me
accordingly. But so far
was I from opposing your
Passion, that I prevented
it; for I had a kindness
for your Person, before
you ever told me any
thing of your Love; and
you had no sooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
it, but with all the
joy imaginable I receiv'd
it, and gave my self up
wholly to that Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
You had at that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47898:34"/>
time your Eyes in your
Head, tho' I was Blind.
Why would you let me
go on then to make my
self the miserable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which now I am?
Why would you <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rain me
on to all those Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances
which to a person
of your Indifference must
needs have been very
Importune? You knew
well enough that you
were not to be always in
<hi>Portugal;</hi> Why must I
then be singl'd out from
all the rest, to be made
thus Unfortunate? In this
Country without dispute
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47898:34"/>
you might have found
out handsomer Women
than my self, that would
have serv'd your turn eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
jot as well, (to your
course purpose) and that
would have been true to
you as far as they could
have seen you, without
breaking their hearts for
you, when you were gon:
and such as you might
have forsaken at last, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either Falsness, or
Cruelty: Do you call this
the Tenderness of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or the Persecution of
a Tyrant? And 'tis but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
of your own nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47898:35"/>
You are just as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
I find, to believe ill of
me, as I have always
been to think better of
you than you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.
Had you but lov'd
me half so well as I do
you, you would never
have parted with me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so easie Terms. I
should have master'd grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Difficulties, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have upbraided you
with the Obligation nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Your Reasons, 'tis
true, were very feeble,
but if they had been the
strongest imaginable, it
had been all one to me:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47898:35"/>
for nothing but death it
self could ever have torn
me from you. Your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>France</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the World but a
Pretext of your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving.
<hi>There was a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi>
(you said) <hi>that was
thither bound.</hi> And why
could not you let that Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
take her Course? <hi>Your
Relations sent for you away.</hi>
You are are no stranger
sure to the Persecution,
that for your sake, I have
suffer'd from mine. <hi>Your
Honour</hi> (forsooth) <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
you to forsake me.</hi>
Why did you not think of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47898:36"/>
that scruple, when you
deluded me to the loss of
mine? <hi>Well! but you must
go back to serve your
Prince.</hi> His Majesty, I
presume, would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
you in that point;
for I cannot learn that he
has any need of your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
But, Alas! I should
have been too happy, if
you and I might have
liv'd, and dy'd together.
This only Comfort I have
in the bitterness of our
deadly separation, that I
was never false to you; and
that for the whole World I
would not have my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47898:36"/>
tainted with so
black a Crime. But can
you then, that know the
Integrity of my Soul, and
the Tenderness that I have
for you; can you (I say)
find in your heart to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
me for ever, and
expose me to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
that attend my
wretched Condition? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much as to think
of me again, but only
when you are to sacrifice
me to a new Passion.
My Love, you see, has
distracted me; and yet I
make no complaint at all
of the violence of it: for I
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47898:37"/>
am so wonted to Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that I have discover'd
a kind of pleasure in them,
which I would not live
without, and which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
while I love you,
in the middle of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
afflictions. The most
grievous part of my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
is the hatred, and
disgust that you have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me for all other
things: My Friends, my
Kindred, the Convent it
self is grown intollerable
to me; and whatsoever
I am oblig'd either to see,
or to do, is become odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
I am grown so jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47898:37"/>
of my Passion, that
methinks all my Actions,
and all my Dutys ought
to have some regard to
you. Nay, every moment
that is not employ'd
upon your service, my
Conscience checks me for
it, either as misbestow'd,
or cast away. My Heart
is full of Love, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred;
and, Alas! what
should I do without it?
should I survive this rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness
of thought, to
lead a Life of more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
and ease, such an
Emptiness, and such an
Insensibility could never
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47898:38"/>
consist. Every Creature
takes Notice how strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I am chang'd in my
Humour, my Manners,
and in my Person. My
Mother takes me to task
about it: One while she
speaks me fair, and then
she chides me, and asks
me what I ail. I do not
well know what answers
I have made her; but I
Phancy that I have told
her all. The most severe,
even of the Religious
themselves, take pity of
me, and bear with my
Condition. The whole
World is touch'd with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47898:38"/>
my Misfortunes; your
single self excepted, as
wholy unconcern'd: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you are not pleas'd
to write at all; or else
your Letters are so cold;
so stuff'd with Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
the Paper not half
full, and your Constraint
so grosly disguis'd, that
one may see with half an
Eye the pain you are in
till they are over. <hi>Dona
Brites</hi> would not let me
be quiet the other day,
till she had got me out of
my Chamber, on to the
Balcon that looks (you
know) toward <hi>Mertola:</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:47898:39"/>
she did it to oblige me, and
I follow'd her: But the
very sight of the Place
struck me with so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
an Impression, that
it set me a Crying the
whole day after. Upon
this, she took me back
again, and I threw my
self upon my Bed, where
I pass'd a thousand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon the despairs
of my Recovery. I am
the worse I find for that
which people do to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
they offer me do
but serve to aggravate
my Miseries. Many a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47898:39"/>
time have I seen you pass
by from this Balcon;
(and the sight pleas'd me
but too well) and there
was I that fatal day, when
I first found my self strook
with this unhappy Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Methought you
look'd as if you had a
mind to oblige me, even
before you knew me;
and your Eye was more
upon me than the rest of
the Company. And when
you made a stop, I fool'd
my self to think that it
was meant to me too,
that I might take a fuller
view of you, and see how
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47898:40"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:47898:40"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:47898:41"/>
every thing became you.
Upon giving your Horse
the spur (I remember) my
heart was at my mouth for
fear of an untoward leap
you put him upon. In fine;
I could not but secretly
concern my self in all your
Actions; and as you were
no longer indifferent to
me, so I took several things
to my self also from you;
and as done in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
I need not tell
you the sequel of Matters
(not that I care who
knows it) nor would I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
write the whole Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
lest I should make you
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47898:41"/>
thought more culpable (if
possible) than in Effect
(perhaps) you are. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
that it might furnish
your Vanity with subject
of reproach, by shewing
that all my Labours, and
Endeavours to make sure
of you, could not yet keep
you from forsaking me.
But what a fool am I, in
thinking to work more
upon your Ingratitude,
with Letters, and Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives,
than ever I could
with my Infinite Love,
and the liberty that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it! No, no: I am
too sure of my ill Fortune,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47898:42"/>
and you are too unjust to
make me doubt of it; and
since I find my self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
what mischief is
there in Nature which I
am not to fear? But are
your Charms only to
work upon me? Why
may not other Women
look upon you with
my Eyes? I should be
well enough content per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to find more of my
Sex (in some degree) of
my Opinion; and that
all the Ladyes of <hi>France</hi>
had an esteem for you,
provided that none of
them either doted upon
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47898:42"/>
you, or pleas'd you:
This is a most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and an impossible
Proposition. But there's
no danger (I may speak
it upon sad Experience)
of your troubling your
head long with any one
thing; and you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
me easily enough,
without the help of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forc'd to't by a new
Passion. So infinitely do
I love you, that (since I
am to lose you) I could
e'en wish that you had had
some fairer colour for't.
It is true, that it would
have made me more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47898:43"/>
but you should
have had less to answer
for then. You'l stay in
<hi>France,</hi> I perceive, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Freedom, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not much to your
Satisfaction; The Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of a long Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
some Punctilioes of
good Manners; and the
fear of not returning
Love for Love, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
keep you there.
Oh, you may safely trust
me in this Case: Let me
but only see you now and
then, and know that we
are both of us in the
same Country, it shall
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47898:43"/>
content me. But why do
I flatter my self? Who
knows but that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and Severity of some
other Woman may come
to prevail upon you more
than all my Favours? tho'
I cannot believe you yet
to be a Person that will
be wrought upon by ill
usage.</p>
            <p>Before you come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in any powerful Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
let me entreat you
to bethink your self of
the Excess of my Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;
the Uncertainty
of my Purposes; the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
of my Thoughts;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47898:44"/>
the Extravagance of my
Letters; the Trusts I have
repos'd in you; my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairs,
my Wishes, and
my Jealousies. Alas! I
am affraid that you are
about to make your self
unfortunate. Take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I beg of you, by my
Example, and make some
Use to your self of the
Miseries that I endure for
you. I remember you
told me in Confidence,
(and in great Earnest too)
some five, or six Months
ago, that you had once
a Passion for a <hi>French</hi>
Lady. If she be any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47898:44"/>
to your Return,
deal frankly with me,
and put me out of my
Pain. It will be a kind
of Mercy to me, if the faint
hope which yet Supports
me, must never take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
even to lose my Life,
and that together. Pray'e
send me her picture, and
Some of her Letters, and
write me all she says. I
shall find Something there
undoubtedly that will
make me either better, or
worse. In the Condition
that I am, I cannot long
continue; and any Change
whatsoever must be to my
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47898:45"/>
Advantage. I should take
it kindly if you would
send me your Brothers, and
your Sisters pictures too.
Whatsoever is dear to you
must be so to me; and I
am a very faithful Servant
to any thing that is related
to you: and it cannot be
otherwise: for you have
left me no power at all
to dispose of my self.
Sometimes me-thinks I
could Submit even to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon the Woman
that you Love. So low
am I brought by your
Scorns, and ill Usage, that
I dare not so much as say
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47898:45"/>
to my self, <hi>Methinks I
might be allow'd to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
without displeasing
you.</hi> Nay, I chide my
self as the most mistaken
Creature in the World
to blame you: and I am
many times convinc'd
that I ought not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
you as I do, with
those passages, and
thoughts which you are
pleas'd to disown.</p>
            <p>The Officer that waits
for this Letter grows a
little Impatient: I had
once resolv'd to keep it
clear from any possibility
of giving you Offence.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47898:46"/>
But it is broken out into
Extravagances, and 'tis
time to put an end to't.
But Alas! I have not the
heart to give it over.
When I write to you, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I speak to you:
and our Letters bring us
nearer together. The first
shall be neither So long,
nor So troublesome. But
you may venture to open,
it, and read it upon
the assurance that I now
give you. I am not to
entertain you, I know,
with a Passion that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleases
you, and you shall
hear no more on't. It
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47898:46"/>
is now a year within a few
days, that I have deliver'd
my self wholy up to you,
without any Reserve. Your
Love I took to be both
Warm, and Sincere: And I
could never have thought
you would have been so
weary of my favours, as to
take a Voyage of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
leagues; and run the
Hazzards of Rocks, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
only to avoid them.
This is a Treatment that
certainly I never deserv'd
at any mans hands. You
can call to mind my Shame
my Confusion, and my
Disorders. But you have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47898:47"/>
forgotten the Obligations
you had to Love me even
in despite of your Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
The Officer calls
upon me now the fourth
time for my Letter. He
will go away without it,
he Says; and presses me,
as if he were running away
from another Mistress.
Farwell. You had not
half the difficulty to leave
me (tho' perhaps for
ever) which I have, only
to part with this Letter.
But <hi>Adieu.</hi> There are
a thousand tender names
that I could call you now.
But I dare not deliver my
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47898:47"/>
self up to the freedom of
Writing my thoughts.
You are a thousand times
dearer to me than my
Life, and a thousand
times more than I imagine
too. Never was any thing
So barbarous, and so
much belov'd. I must
needs tell you once again,
that <hi>you do not write to me.</hi>
But I am now going to
begin afresh, and <hi>the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
will be gone.</hi> Well, and
what matters it? Let him
go. 'Tis not so much for
your sake that I write, as
my own; for my Business
is only to divert, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47898:48"/>
entertain my self: Beside
that the very Length of
this Letter will make
you afraid on't: And
you'le never read it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
neither. What
Have I done to draw all
these Miseries upon me?
And why should you of
all others be the poisoner
of my peace, and blast
the Comfort of my Life?
Why was I not born in
some other Country? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
me, and farwell. See
but to what a Miserable
point I am reduc'd, when I
dare not so much as intreat
you to Love me. <hi>Adieu.</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div n="5" type="letter">
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:47898:48"/>
            <head>THE
FIFTH
Letter.</head>
            <p>YOu will find, I
hope, by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Ayre and
stile of this Letter, from
all my former, that I have
chang'd my Thoughts
too; and you are to take
this for an Eternal farwell;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47898:49"/>
for I am now at length
perfectly convinc'd, that
since I have Irrecoverably
lost your Love, I can no
longer justify my own.
Whatsoever I had of Yours
shall be sent you by the
first Opportunity: There
shall be no more writing
in the Case; No, not
so much as your Name
upon the Pacquett. <hi>Dona
Brites</hi> is a Person whom
I can trust as my own
soul, and whom I have
entrusted (as you know
very well) Unfortunate,
Wretch that I am! in
Confidences of another
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47898:49"/>
Quality betwixt you and
me. I have left it to her
Care to see your Picture
and your Bracelets di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch'd
away to you,
(those once beloved Pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of your Kindness)
and only in due time to
assure me that you have
receiv'd them. Would you
believe me now, if I should
swear to you, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these five days, I have
been at least fifty times
upon the very point of
Burning the One, and of
Tearing the Other into
a Million of Pieces? But,
You have found me too
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47898:50"/>
easy a fool, to think me
Capable of so Generous
an Indignation. If I
could but vex you a little
in the story of my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes;
it would be
some sort of Abatement
me-thinks to the Cruelty
of them. Those Bawbles
(I must confess, both to
Your shame, and Mine)
went nearer my heart
than I am willing to tell
you, and when it came
to the Pinch of parting
with them, I found it the
hardest thing in the World
to go thorough with it:
So Mortal a Tenderness
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47898:50"/>
had I for any thing of
Yours, even at that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
when you your self
seem'd to me the most In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
thing in Nature:
But there's no resisting the
force of Necessity and
Reason. This Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has cost me Many,
and Many a Tear; A
thousand, and a thousand
Agonies, and Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
more than you can
imagine; and more, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
than you shall
ever hear of from me.
<hi>Dona Brites</hi> (I say) has
them in Charge; upon
Condition, never to name
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47898:51"/>
them to Me again; No,
not so much as to give me
a sight of them, though
I should beg for't upon
my Knees; but, in fine,
to hasten them away,
without one Syllable to
Me of their Going.</p>
            <p>If it had not been for
this Trial to get the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of my Passion, I
should never have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the force of it; and
if I could have foreseen
the Pains, and the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of the Encounter,
I am afraid that I should
never have ventur'd upon
the Attempt: for I am
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47898:51"/>
verily perswaded that I
could much better have
Supported your Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
it self, though never
so foul, and Odious, than
the Deadly, Deadly
Thought of this Irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Separation. And it
is not your Person nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is so dear to
me, but the Dignity of
my unalterable Affection.
My soul is strangely divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
Your falseness makes
me abhor you, and yet
at the same time my
Love, my Obstinate, and
Invincible Love, will not
consent to part with you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:47898:52"/>
What a Blessing were
it to me now, if I were
but endu'd with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Quality of other
Women, and only Proud
enough to despise you?
Alas! Your Contempt
I have born already: Nay,
had it been your Hatred,
or the most Raging Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie;
All this, compar'd
with your Indifference,
had been a Mercy to me.
By the Impertinent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
and the most Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
Civilities of your
Last Letter, I find that
all mine are Come to your
hand; and that you have
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47898:52"/>
read them over too: but
as unconcern'd, as if you
forsooth had no Interest
at all in the Matter. Sot
that I am, to lie thus at the
Mercy of an Insensible,
and Ungrateful Creature;
and to be as much afflicted
now at the Certainty of
the Arrival of those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
as I was before, for
fear of their Miscarriage!
What have I to do with
your telling me the
<hi>TRVTH OF THINGS?</hi>
Who desir'd to know it?
Or the <hi>SINCERITY</hi> you
talk of; a thing you never
practis'd toward me, but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47898:53"/>
to my Mischief. Why
could you not let me alone
in my Ignorance? Who
bad you Write? Miserable
Woman that I am! Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
after so much pains
taken already to delude
me to my Ruin, you
might have streyn'd one
point more, in this
Extremity, to deceive me
to my Advantage, without
pretending to excuse your
self. 'Tis too late to tell
you that I have cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
many a Tender
Thought upon the Worst
of Men; the most Oblig'd,
and the most Unthankful.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47898:53"/>
Let it suffice that I know
you now as well as if I
were in the heart of you.
The only favour that I
have now to desire from
you, after so many done
for you, is This: (and
I hope you will not refuse
it me) Write no more to
me; and remember that I
have conjur'd you never
to do it. Do all that is
Possible for you to do, (if
ever you had any Love for
me) to make me absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forget you. For Alas!
I dare not trust my self in
any sort of Correspond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with you. The least
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47898:54"/>
hint in the World of any
kind Reflection upon
the reading of this Letter,
would perchance expose
me to a Relapse; and then
the taking of me at my
Word, on the other side,
would most certainly
transport me into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance
of Choler, and
Despair. So that in my
Opinion it will be your
best course not to meddle
at all with Me, or my
Affairs: for which way so
ever you go to work, it
must inevitably bring a
great disorder upon both.
I have no Curiosity to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47898:54"/>
know the success of this
Letter: Me-thinks the
Sorrows you have brought
upon me already, might
abundantly content you
(even if your Design were
never so malicious) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
disturbing me in my
Preparations for my future
Peace. Do but leave me
in my Uncertainty, and
I will not yet despair, in
time, of arriving at some
degree of Quiet. This I
dare promise you, that I
shall never hate you; for
I am too great an Enemy
to Violent Resolutions
ever to go about it. Who
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47898:55"/>
knows but I may yet live
to find a truer friend than
I have lost? But Alas!
What signifies any mans
Love to me, if I cannot
Love him? Why should
his Passion work more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my heart, than mine
could upon Yours? I have
found by sad Experience,
that the first Motions of
Love, which we are more
properly said to Feel, than
to Understand, are never
to be forgotten: That our
souls are perpetually In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon the Idol which
we our selves have made:
That the first Wounds, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47898:55"/>
the first Images are never
to be cur'd, or defac'd: That
all the Passions that pretend
to succour us either by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
or Satisfaction,
are but so many vain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of bringing us to our
Wits again, which, if once
lost, are never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd:
And that all the
Pleasures that we pursue,
(many times without any
desire of finding them)
amount to no more, than
to convince us, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is so dear to us as the
Remembrance of our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.
Why must you
pitch upon Mee, for the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47898:56"/>
subject of an Imperfect, and
Tormenting Inclination;
which I can neither Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
with Temper,
nor Preserve with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
The dismal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of an Impetuous
Love, which is not Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual?
And why is it that
by a Conspiracy of Blind
Affection, and Inexorable
fate, we are still condemn'd
to Love where we are
Despis'd, and to hate
where we are Belov'd?</p>
            <p>But what if I could flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my self with the Hope
of diverting my Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
by any other Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47898:56"/>
I am so sensible of
my own Condition, that
I should make a very great
scruple of Using any other
Mortal as you have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me: and though I am
not Conscious of any
Obligation to spare you,
yet if it were in my Power
to take my Revenge upon
you, by changing you for
any other, (a thing very
Unlikely) I could never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to the gratifying of
my Passion that way.</p>
            <p>I am now telling my
self in your behalf, that it
is not reasonable to expect,
that the simplicity of a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47898:57"/>
Religious should confine
the Inclinations of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier.
And yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
if a body might
be allow'd to reason upon
the Actions of Love, a
man should rather fix upon
a Mistress in a Convent
than any where else. For
they have nothing there
to hinder them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perpetually Intent
upon their Passion:
Whereas in the World,
there are a thousand foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and Amusements,
that either take up
their Thoughts intirely,
or at least divert them.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47898:57"/>
And what Pleasure is it
(or rather how great a
Torment, if a body be not
Stupid) for a man to see
the Woman that he loves,
in a Continual Hurry of
Delights; taken up with
Ceremony, and Visits;
no discourses but of Balls,
Dresses, Walks <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which
must needs expose him
every hour to fresh jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies?
Who can secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that Women are not
better Satisfied with these
Entertainments than they
ought to be? even to the
Disgusting of their own
Husbands? How can any
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47898:58"/>
man pretend to Love, who
without examining Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
contentedly believes
what's told him, and looks
upon his Mistress under
all these Circumstances
with Confidence, and
Quiet? It is not that I am
now Arguing my self into
a Title to your Kindness,
for this is not a way to do
my business: especially
after the Trial of a much
more probable Method,
and to as little purpose.
No, no: I know my Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
too Well, and there's
no strugling with it. My
Whole Life is to be mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47898:58"/>
It was so, when I
saw you every day; When
we were together, for fear
of your Infidelity; and at
a distance, because I could
not endure you out of my
sight: My heart ak'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time you came into the
Convent; and my very life
was at stake when you were
in the Army: It put me out
of all Patience to consider
that neither my Person,
nor Condition were Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of you: I was afraid
that your Pretensions to
me might turn to your
Damage: I could not Love
you enough me thought:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47898:59"/>
I liv'd in dayly Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of some Mischief or
other from my Parents:
So that upon the Whole
Matter, my Case was not
much better at that time
then it is at present. Nay
had you but given me the
least Proof of your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
since you left <hi>Portugal,</hi>
I should most certainly
have made my Escape, and
follow'd you in a disguise.
And what would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of me then, after the
loss of my honour, and
my friends to see my self
abandon'd in <hi>France?</hi>
What a Confusion should
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47898:59"/>
I have been in? What a
plunge should I have been
at? What an Infamy should
I have brought upon my
family, which I do assure
you, since I left loving of
you, is very dear to me.
Take Notice I pray'e, that
in Cold thoughts I am
very Sensible that I might
have been much more Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
than I am; and
that once in my Life I
have talk'd Reason to you:
but whether my Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
pleases you, or not;
and what Opinion soever
you entertain of me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you keep it to your
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47898:60"/>
self. I have desir'd you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and I do now re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you, never to Write
to me again.</p>
            <p>Methinks you should
sometimes reflect upon the
Injuries you have done
me; and upon your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
to the most Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Obligations in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I have Lov'd you
to the degree of Madness;
and to the Contempt of all
other things, and Mortals.
You have not dealt with
me like a Man of honour.
Nothing but a Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
could have kept
you even from adoring
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47898:60"/>
me. Never was any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
bewitch'd upon So
easy terms. What did you
ever do that might entitle
you to my favour? What
did you ever Lose, or but
so much as hazzard for my
Sake? Have you not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
your self with a
thousand other delights?
No, not so much as a Sett
at Tennis, or a Hunting-Match,
that you would
ever forbear upon any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of Mine. Were
you not still the first that
went to the Army, and
the last that came back
again? Were you ever the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47898:61"/>
more Careful of your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
there, because I begg'd
it of you, as the greatest
Blessing of my Soul? Did
you ever so much as offer
at the Establishment of
your fortune in <hi>Portugal?</hi>
A place where you were
so much esteem'd. But
one single Letter of your
Brothers hurry'd you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
without so much as
a moments time to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it: and I am certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inform'd too, that you
were never in better hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in your Whole Life,
than upon that Voyage.
You your self cannot deny,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47898:61"/>
but that I have reason to
hate you above all men
Living; and yet, in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
I may thank my Self;
for I have drawn all these
Calamities upon my own
head. I dealt too openly,
and plainly with you at
first: I gave you my heart
too soon. It is not Love
alone that begets Love;
there must be Skill, and
Address; for it is Artifice,
and not Passion, that
creates Affection. Your
first design was to make
me Love you, and there
was not any thing in the
World which you would
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47898:62"/>
not then have done, to
compass that End: Nay
rather than fail, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
you would have
lov'd Me too, if you had
judg'd it necessary. But
you found out easier ways
to do your Business, and
so thought it better to let
the Love alone. Perfidious
Man! Can you ever think
to carry off this Affront,
without being call'd to an
Accompt for't? If ever
you Set foot in <hi>Portugal</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
I do declare it to you,
that I'le deliver you up to
the Revenge of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
It is along time that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47898:62"/>
I have now liv'd in a kind
of Licentious Idolatry, And
the Conscience of it strikes
me with horrour, and an
Insupportable Remorse;
I am Confounded with the
Shame of What I have
done for your Sake; and
I have no longer (alas!)
the Passion that kept the
foulness of it from my
Sight. Shall this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
heart of Mine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
find ease? Ah barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Man! When shall I
see the End of this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression?
And yet after
all this I cannot find in
my heart to wish you any
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47898:63"/>
Sort of harm; Nay in my
Conscience I could be yet
well enough content to see
you happy: which as the
Case stands, is utterly
Impossible.</p>
            <p>Within a While, you
may yet perhaps receive
another Letter from me,
to shew you that I have
outliv'd all your Outrages,
and Philosophiz'd my self
into a state of Repose. Oh
what a Pleasure will it be
to me, when I shall be
able to tell you of your
Ingratitude, and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
without being any
longer concern'd at them
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47898:63"/>
my Self! When I shall be
able to discourse of you
with Scorn; When I shall
have forgotten all my
Griefs, and Pleasures, and
not so much as think of
your Self, but when I have
a mind to't.</p>
            <p>That you have had the
better of me, 'tis true; for I
have Lov'd you to the very
Loss of my Reason: But
it is no less true that you
have not much cause to be
proud on't. Alas I was
young, and Credulous:
Cloyster'd up from a
Child; and only Wonted
to a rude, and disagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47898:64"/>
sort of People. I
never knew what belong'd
to fine Words, and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
till (most unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately)
I came acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with you: And all
the Charmes, and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
you so often told me
of, I only look'd upon as
the Obliging Mistakes
of your Civility, and
Bounty. You had a good
Character in the World;
I heard every body Speak
well of you: and to all
this, you made it your
Business to engage me; but
you have now (I thank
you for't) brought me
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47898:64"/>
to my self again, and not
without great need of
your Assistance. Your
two last Letters I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to keep, and to read
them over oftener than
ever I did any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
for fear of a Relapse.
You may well afford
them, I am sure, at the
Price that they have cost
me. Oh how happy
might I have been, if you
would but have given
me Leave to Love you
for ever! I know very
well that betwixt my
Indignation, and your
Infidelity, my present

Disorder. But remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what I tell you: I
am not yet out of hope
of a more peaceable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
which I will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Compass, or take
some other Course with
my self; which I presume,
you will be well enough
content to hear of. But
I will never have any
thing more to do with you.
I am a fool for saying the
Same things over, and over
again so often. I must
leave you, and not so
much as think of you.
Now do I begin to Phansie
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47898:66"/>
that I shall not write to
you again for all This;
for what Necesity is there
that I must be telling of
you at every turn how my
Pulse beats?</p>
