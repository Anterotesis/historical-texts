         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WEE had a Messenger came from the
Army, with newes of the taking of
Kneck-Linch Castle, 18. miles off, a
very strong Castle, one <hi>Plunket</hi> being chiefe
that was in it, who stood out to the last, but
when they saw our men so violent, not fearing
to come upon the walls of the Castle, then all
the women cryed for quarter, and it was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, but the men fired the stayres and
roomes about their own eares, so our men at
last went in, and put all to the Sword, but the
women, save only 7. that would not have

quarter, we had 20. men, as they say, lost,
Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Kirke</hi> shot in the backe,
who will hardly escape it; of the enemy 80.
killed, and some Commanders taken.</p>
               <p>Upon the taking of that Castle, Lord of
Trimbestons Castle, a Rebell was left by them
that kept it.</p>
               <p>The seventeenth day, the Earle of Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven,
Sir <hi>Henry Elmer,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas White,</hi>
and his two sons, were called to the Kings
Bench, from thence committed close Prisoners
as Traytors; but the Earle fained himself sick,
and went not, and still remaines in the Sheriffes
hands.</p>
               <p>The eighteenth day, one <hi>Russell,</hi> and one
<hi>Archbald</hi> were hanged and quartered, able
men in estate, their fact I know not: That night
wee had some Cattle stollen by the Rebels,
within two miles of us.</p>
               <p>The twentieth day, one Captaine <hi>Lloyd</hi> was
buried, a Captaine of the Fire-locks, which is
a great losse, being a valiant man: that day the
Lords had notice that the Rebels would come
neare us, out of Wicklow side, South-west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that night 700. foot and 2. troopes of
horse went that way, under the command of
Colonell <hi>Gilson,</hi> and so burnt all the way as
they went, 14. miles outright, and none to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them, but all run away to the Woods,
and Mountaines, but tooke their Cattle with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110800:3"/>
them, for I beleeve they had notice of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
comming. That day some came from
Dundalke, that brings word, that Captaine
<hi>Vaughan,</hi> Governour of the Towne, had pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
a protected House within two miles of the
Towne, having notice of some design this man
had, to bring the Rebels to take Dundalke, he
being familiar with our Army, and protected
by Sir <hi>Henry Tichborne,</hi> but as God would
have it, our Army mistrusted him, and upon
that Captaine <hi>Vaughan</hi> went, as his usuall
course was, to this mans house, but gave order
to Captaine <hi>Codogan,</hi> to bring some Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
after him: so <hi>Vaughan</hi> tooke on him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but called the man out, and rid about the
fields, in the meane time Captaine <hi>Codogan</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the house, and found there 300. men, most
of them armed, put them all to the Sword, and
found Letters from Sir <hi>Philem O Neale,</hi> to wish
him to stop the Post from Drogheda to Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalke,
and withall writ to him that he would
be with him upon Sunday night with 12000.
men to take Dundalke, and found with the
man a protection from Sir <hi>Philem O Neale,</hi> the
man they have prisoner, and two Priests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
               <p>Sunday night, they looked for Sir <hi>Philem O
Neale,</hi> and had prepared themselves for his
comming, but he came not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:110800:4"/>That night likewise we had some Cattle stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
by the Rebels, this they doe alwayes when
our Army is abroad, thinking that will turne
them home.</p>
               <p>The Parliament doth sit here, the Bishop of
<hi>Kiffanoxah</hi> made a brave Speech against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and to have the Law in force against
them, and they not to sit in Parliament at all;
the House of Commons drew up an Order to
that purpose; all that sate tooke the Oath of
Supremacy, and now they are about to make
an Act against Jesuits and Priests, and all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
to be in force here as it is in <hi>England.</hi>
That night our Army that went out the day
before, came home very well, and brought
home some Pillage, about an hundred Cowes,
many sheepe, and some horses, burnt fortie or
fiftie Townes and Villages: Also that day a
Proclamation proclaimed, that no Souldiers
should pillage them that came to Market, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their
cut or mow grasse or greene corne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
warrant from the Lords, or their Colonell,
as they have done, both robbed and pillaged,
and cut grasse, corne, and spoyle all that come
neere them; but now if they doe so, they are
to be executed by Martiall Law; the Provost
Martiall of the City hath a strict command to
looke to the businesse, and to execute the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
