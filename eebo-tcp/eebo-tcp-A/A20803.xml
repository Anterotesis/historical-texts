         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

occasion for the tempter to assault him, yea and to worke

three speciall <hi>temptations,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Math. 4. ver. 3.</note> whereof the first was directed to

minde with the venemous vapour of ambition, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
all which he resisted, and ouer-came by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and word of God: euen so here in the Cantickles the
church was encountered with three sorts of temptations,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10433:3"/>
though in forme and kinde differing from Christ his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
The first which is the best, and most holy tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Canti 2. 4.</note>
was her <hi>Loue-sicknesse,</hi> or falling into a <hi>swound,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the sight of the great prouision, and spirituall dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

                     </p>
                     <p>The second <hi>temptation</hi> wherein (as also in the next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing)
the Church more bewraieth her corruption,<note place="margin">Cap. 3. vers. 1. 2. 3.</note> is the
<hi>feare</hi> (which commeth from infidelitie) in the Church,
least she had lost Christ; yet so qualified, as thereby the
spirit kindleth in her more paines, and studie, both to seeke
to attaine vnto Christ more neerely, and to apprehend him
more firmely, and in a while after that all the meanes had
beene vsed, shee findeth Christ, and renueth and reuiueth
her faith in him.</p>
                     <p>The third, and last temptation, which is worldly drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,<note place="margin">Cap. 5. 2. 3. 4.</note>
and some kinde of securitie, incident to the Church,
and children of God; the bitternesse, and extremity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was, that <hi>shee</hi> fell into a <hi>swound,</hi> that is, she for the time,
was almost in despaire of her saluation, as one depriued of
feeling and comfort of grace: But at length by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with her friends concerning Christ his excellencie,
and the place where he was gone, her faith beginneth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue,
&amp; she assureth her selfe that <hi>Christ is hers, &amp; she is his.</hi>
And this is the third,<note place="margin">Vers. 17. 18.</note> and last temptation, wherin we meane
to insist. The originall, briefe &amp; substance of it is conteined
in these words; <hi>I sleepe,</hi> that is, I am some-what secure, and
carelesse, and keepe not that watch against the pleasures of
this life, and the baites &amp; hookes of the world as I should,
and am bound to doe.</p>

                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:10433:3"/>
Then followeth a limitation, or exception in these
words. <hi>But mine heart waketh,</hi> that is, my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

and holdeth Christ, and I doe not suffer my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and ioy in him to cease, and determine.</p>
                     <p>In the temptation comprized in these words, <hi>I sleepe,</hi>
two things are to be considered. First the Churches wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or slumbering. Secondly the confession, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of her faulte, and offence.</p>
                     <p>In that the Church is here sayd to sleepe, or slumber, yet
so as that shee discerneth off,<note place="margin">1. Obser.</note> notwithstanding that her
heart, that is, <hi>her faith,</hi> and better part waked, laied hold on,
and found sweere repose, and contentment in Christ. We
learne hence this doctrine, and iustruction <hi>viz.</hi> that the
true Church of God, and the particuler members of it,
are not only subiect to sinne, and error in generall, for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

wee are but defectiue and <hi>vnprofitable seruants;</hi> but also,
and that more particularly, that many times the Church
of Christ, euen in the best, and most flourishing outward

and securitie, and is lesse carefull, and watchfull to
beware of the snares of the worldes prosperitie, and the
baites, and allurements of honours, and pleasures; so that
here it must needs follow that her faith must oftentimes be
weakened, eclipsed, and darkned, yea and she now and
then fall into simptoms, and fits of desperation.</p>

                     <p>The causes then from whence the churches slumber pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
were (especially) worldly prosperity, and cares, as

hurtfull incombrances do choake the corne (that is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

corrupt motions of the flesh doe preuaile in the hearts of
men, and ouercome faith: so that it doth suppresse, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the power and working of heauenly doctrine before
it be come to his full ripenesse. And therefore it standeth
euery man vpon, to pull these manifold thornes out of his
heart, vnlesse hee would haue Gods word vtterly choaked
in him. Prosperitie, and excessiue pleasures and delights,
corrupted, &amp; effeminated most wise <hi>Salomon,</hi> that at length

And because the spirituall sleepe, and slumber, which hath
allusion to that which is naturall, doth and will, by way of
comparison with it, more fully and effectually appeare, let
vs a little consider the similitude, and proportion that is
betwixt them both.</p>
                     <p>Naturall sleepe is the rest or binding of the senses, and
the suspension, or interruption of the spirits, caused by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
sumes and vapours, which by reason of plenty of
meate and drinke, ascend from the stomack into the head
and braine, and thereby stopping the rootes of the sinews,
or nerues, are by the animall spirits caried vnto the seates
of the outward senses: so a spirituall sleepe or slumber, is a
ceasing, or stopping of the spirituall senses, so that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
eye, for the time, cannot see, nor the eare attend, nor
the palate taste, the mouth speake, nor the stomack desire,
or digest, nor the hand worke, nor the feete goe, (as in a
deepe sleepe): or but very faintly, and weakly (as in a
winking, or nodding slumber) such as that of the church
is in this place, and it is caused from the fumes, and vapours
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10433:5"/>
of earthly prosperitie, cares, and pleasures, honours and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
which ascend from the distempered affections into the

The second cause,<note place="margin">2 cause worldly cares</note> or occasion, of the Churches slumber,

all knowne sinnes, but onely of that sinne which troubleth
and vexeth the conscience; or of that whereby our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

first when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

can bee obtained: For as the Phisition must know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease
before hee can apply the remedie, euen so the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
or brother cannot comfort, or councell the distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
before that he hath discouered his griefe. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the persons to whome confession is to be made are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
the faithfull Ministers and Pastors, who for their
callings,<note place="margin">Isai. 50. 4.</note> guifts, and experience, are of all men most apt
and able to direct, informe, and comfort the troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
And thus <hi>Dauid</hi> confessed his sinne to <hi>Nathan,</hi>

word and corrections,<note place="margin">1. Reason. 10. 12. 27.</note> who the more we debase our selues
before him (in respect of our sinnes) the more we glorifie
God,<note place="margin">Iohn. 9. 24.</note> from whome nothing is hid,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 4.</note> and the more vile, <hi rend="margQuotes">and
base that we are in our owne eyes the more pretious and
glorious in Gods; and when wee thinke and confesse that
we are lost in our selues wee are found of him.</hi> The second
reason is,<note place="margin">Psal. 32. 5.</note> because vnlesse wee confesse our sinnes before
God, wee can finde no ease of them, but they will more
paine and torment vs. The stomacke that is ouercharged
with some vndisgested meates that doth annoy it,<note place="margin">A similitude.</note> or with
<hi>Rheume</hi> or <hi>Flegme</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that is burdened with sinne is eased and relieued by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and accusation of it selfe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly without confession, there is not, nor cannot
bee any true repentance, for it is a part of it, yea the
gate, dore, and foundation of it, and if the heart bee
holy, contrite, godly sorrowfull, it cannot but manifest,
and discouer it selfe by the confession of the mouth
which <hi>speaketh out of the aboundance of the heart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The last reason is because without <hi>confession</hi> of all our
knowne sinnes vnto GOD, there is no remission of
sinnes.<note place="margin">Prou 28. ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the more wee hide them, the sooner, and more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely
will they issue forth to our shame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,<note place="margin">A similitude.</note>
like as the waters the more they are dam'ed vppe,
the more violently will they breake forth. <hi>Dauid</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee confessed his sinnes,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 12.</note> hee found not pardon.
And vppon his confession hee was immediately pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                        <p>Seeing that confession of sinne, is so necessary,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> &amp; that it
is not so easie a matter to finde out all our sinnes, we must
not onely try &amp; examine our deedes, words, and thoughts
by the strickt and straight line and rule of Gods lawe,
which is the discouerer, and reuealer of sinne; but because
our knowledge is vnperfect, and wee blinde, and partiall in
our owne cases, we must be content to haue our sinnes ript
vp and laid open by publike doctrine,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 25.</note> and preaching; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10433:16"/>
indure it albeit, it neuer so much gall, wound, and shame
vs: and also admitte and allow of priuate, and brotherly
admonition. For all these are holy, &amp; the ordinary meanes
ordained and sanctified of God for our humiliation, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and recouery, which whosoeuer neglecteth contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
or refuseth, hee can neuer truly come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and conscience of sinne, much lesse repent of it, and
so be saued.</p>
                        <p>Secondly wee must not onely confesse those our sinnes
vnto God, that are more enormous, and haynous &amp; these <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> that are many times odious before men; but also our secret,
and particular corruptions, faultes, blottes, weakenesses,
infirmities, yea and also sinnes of omission, and neglect es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
of <hi>prayer, praise, thankesgiuing</hi> vnto God. And we
must haue a true touch and godly sorrow for them: for the
least sinne in it owne nature beeing committed against the
good and infinite maiestie of God,<note place="margin">Rom 6.</note> and his vndefiled law
<hi>deserueth death.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal 25.</note> Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> desireth pardon of the <hi>sinnes
of his youth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>yea of his vnknowne sins.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Iob. 1. 5.</note> Thus <hi>Iob</hi> offered burnt
offerings for his children euery day fearing least <hi>his sonnes

<hi>Paule</hi> was afflicted and troubled in him-selfe for his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

                           <hi>was troubled in his heart.</hi>
He also confesseth <hi>his blindness &amp; ignorance</hi> in Gods mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The Church of God in <hi>Isaias</hi> his time doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that whereas they <hi>erred from Gods waies,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Isai 63. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>&amp; that their</hi>
hearts were hardened from his feare, it came for their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefullnes,
&amp; that God in iustice was the author of it.
Lastly when they omit good duties to God or men, or faile
in the manner, and measure of them, they make confession
of it, <hi>we haue failed &amp; we haue rebelled,</hi> &amp;c. And in another
place:<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 42.</note> all this plague is come vpon vs, as it is written in the
law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 13.</note> 
                           <q>
                              <hi>yet made we not our praiers before the Lord our
God,</hi> &amp;c.</q> And of this we must haue a care to repent, because
by leauing our duty vnaccomplished wee oftner offend,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10433:17"/>
then by sinnes committed: and if GOD should require
it at our handes, the smallest sinne of omission it
is enough to condemne vs.<note place="margin">Psol. 130. 3.</note> And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> saith
<hi>if thou O Lord straitly markest iniquitie, who shall stand?</hi> And
againe,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>cursed is euery man that continueth not in all things
which are written in the booke of the law to doe them.</hi> And
here is a notable touchstone whereby the children of
God are discerned, and distinguished from all reprobates
whatsoeuer. The reprobates (and that but now and then)
are touched with, and make confession of some great, and
notorious sinne, as wee haue examples in <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

From this her confession wee learne to our
comfort that the elect, and Saints of GOD (of whome
alone his Catholike Church doth consist)<note place="margin">The elect as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of Gods fauour and their election.</note> are (except
onelie in the greene blade, and insancie of the Church or

and assured in their owne consciences by Gods
spirit that they are in the state of grace, and saluation, and
shall neuer fall away from it.</p>
                        <p>Now that we may be assured that wee haue faith in our

the spirit of Adoption, whereby wee cry abba father, the same
spirit beareth witnesse with our spirit, that wee are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

most certaine; for the spirit can neuer bee deceiued,
therefore vndoubtedlie they knewe that they were

Here the Apostle alludeth vnto the old figures of the law,

of Priests and Kings in the old testament was a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

why the holy Ghost is here,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 14.</note> and else where named <gap reason="foreign">

Lastly (to be breife) I wil conclude with that of <hi>Paul; I am

then the whore of <hi>Babilons golden cup,</hi> glorious without,
but within full of abhominations and deadly poyson. Of
this kinde of opinions, and errours (to omit others) are
these following. First that the now Romish church (albeit
idolatrous, and apostatical) is a true visible church.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Error.</hi> That the holy religion of Christ now profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and by publicke authority maintained in <hi>England,</hi> and
the doctrine and worship of Papists differ onely in acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and circumstances and not in substance, and that a
reconciliation betwixt both parties might well be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Whereas first the Romish religion is (for the most
part) <hi>Idolatrous and hereticall,</hi> but so is not ours at all. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
the Papists will in no wise yeeld to any recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation

wee yeeld and bee reconciled to them in error, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie?</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Error.</hi> That we must not enquire how Christ is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the <hi>Eucharist (viz:</hi> whether spiritually or bodilie)
intending heereby to keepe men in suspence, and to make
away for that absurd and blasphemous doctrine of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi>
Whereas otherwise it is most plaine by
scripture that Christs presence is altogither spirituall.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Error.</hi> That the sabboth is but a ceremony, and that it
is in the churches power and libertie to alter it, determine
the time, and the continuance of it, and to remit and abate
of the strictnesse of it as it shall thinke good. Whereas it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10433:25"/>
is one of the tenne <hi>commandements,</hi> and therefore must

Secondly, that it might be a witnes to all nations, &amp;
that al men might bee conuinced sufficiently through

and conuersion of the nation of the Iewes (in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

when the fulnesse of vs Gentiles is come into the church,

                     <p>The third signe next succeeding and following in order

were such that tooke vpon them the name of the Messias

and seduced and drew many after them (as we haue exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

as well the Gentiles as the Iewes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly those Christs did shew no signes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
as these shall doe, who shall labour by false miracles
and satanicall illusions and conclusions to gaine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
credit and authoritie to their false doctrine, and also
in respect of efficacie of error in the last generation or age

and condemned all such who beeing led by their

beeleue not the last iudgement but contemne and deride
it. 2. Pet. 3. ver. 3.</p>
                     <p>Whereas first this doctrine is plainely and abundantly
set forth in the scriptues. Psal. 50. 1. Act. 10. 42. Math. 25.
31. Luk. 18. 17. Rom. 2. 16. Hebrew. 9. 27. Iob. 19. 25. Act.

                     <p>Secondly except there should bee a generall iudgement
there neede no resurrection. Lastly God could not
shewe himselfe either perfectly iust in punishing and
condemning the reprobates, nor perfectly mercifull in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing
