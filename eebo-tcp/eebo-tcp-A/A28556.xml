            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Am bound in the first place to acquaint my Reader, That the Learned <hi>Johnston,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Physician, is the Principal Author I have followed in this Piece; for I would not translate him: To what I found there, I have added what I could light upon that was pertinent to my purpose in the Histories of those Times: So that I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, it cost me as much pains and time, as it cost him at first to write it. I took the liberty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to use my own Language, and Thoughts, as well as Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:49245:6"/>
in the whole; adding and diminishing, as I thought fit, though never without Reason, or good Authority.</p>
            <p>In such a Work as this, things ought to be delivered without any order of time, things of the same nature being laid together; So that this is not intended so much for a regular Story of those Times, as a Collection of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that others may thereby be instructed what to chuse or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, what to commend or blame, what had a good, or an ill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <p>Truth is as well the soul of a good <hi>Character,</hi> as of an <hi>History;</hi> to commend without cause or above measure, is the part of a <hi>PANEGYRICK;</hi> but it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth a <hi>Character,</hi> or an <hi>History,</hi> suspected and odious. I love the Name and Memory of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb facs="tcp:49245:6"/>
Queen as much as any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; but it could not bribe me to represent her otherwise than she was: The mixing the Faults of great Persons with their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, abates the Envy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and purchaseth a kind and ready Acceptance of the whole. A Lying Satyr is full as odious as a Flattering Panegyrick: If I were worthy to have my Story written, or my Picture drawn, I should wish they might be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, and represent both my Life, and my Face, just such as they were.</p>
            <p>It is not impossible some may be offended with the Truth of this Little Piece; but they must know, I have no other share in it, than the collecting things that lay dispersed before, and the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting them as I found them (I hope I have no-where Censured
<pb facs="tcp:49245:7"/>
or Commended any thing above the truth; but if I have, upon admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition I shall endeavour to amend it. As the Persons mentioned in it were all dead before I was born, so I cannot be suspected to be guilty of Love or Hatred, but what was the result of their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or their Vices: If I would not spare the Queen, there was no reason I should spare any of her Courtiers; and when any of our Nobility find any of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors did ill things, and they are represented in Story; let them remember, the Princes of those times had their Faults too, and they are as freely written. Let them think also, Thus it will be with us; Infamy or Oblivion will cover our memories when we are dead, if we do not live well. It is only Virtue that can render a Name illustrious in the Annals
<pb facs="tcp:49245:7"/>
of time, though great Estates and swelling Titles may make a man seem great on this side the Grave: And Posterity will be no more able to drown the Vices of this present Age, than they are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the knowledge of those that are past. As a bad Face quarrels a true Looking-Glass, so a bad Liver hates a true Historian, and both equally without just cause.</p>
            <p>There has nothing more Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Glory of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> than the want of a good History of her Reign in <hi>English. Cambden</hi> is good in the Original, but too short; but the Version of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is intolerably bad; would any good Pen do that by her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, which I have done here by her Character, it would be a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tribute paid to Her Sacred Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Would our Great Men live in the Memory of the World? why
<pb facs="tcp:49245:8"/>
let them promote the History of their Countrey, and that will make their Names famous to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity. <hi>Maecenas</hi> is oftener remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred for his bounties to Learning, than for all his other Expences and Gallantry, of which perhaps it was not the hundredth part.</p>
            <p>No Nation in <hi>Europe</hi> hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the <hi>English</hi> in Martial Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; but for want of good Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, much of the Honour of our Ancestors is lost both at home and abroad. I would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to die when I had finished but one good Piece of our Story in such a manner as it should be worth the reading. I would serve my Countrey in any honest and brave thing; but History is my beloved Study, with it I would (if I had it in my power) grow old and die.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49245:8"/>
It was the comfort of a Prince in all his Sufferings, that his Name would one day, like the Sun, break through the Clouds of Reproach that the Iniquity of the Times had thrown about him; and he should shine the more gloriously in History for the things he had suffered in his Life. If he in the lowest Abyss of Misery, in the melancholly Recesses of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, could thus comfort his drooping Spirits with the prospect of that Honour would be paid him in his Grave, when his Name should be imbalmed in the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful memory of his Subjects; It is a wonder there is no more care taken by the Living to render this grateful Acknowledgment to their Ancestors for all that they have left them.</p>
            <p>But if we are unmindsul of the Dead, if their cold Bones can me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb facs="tcp:49245:9"/>
no corner in our Hearts or thoughts; why are we so regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of the Living? a Prince can scarce deserve better of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, instruct, direct, reform, or amend them more effectually by any other method, than by Good Histories. The Precepts that are so delivered, slide insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and pleasantly into the minds of the Reader, and make lasting Impressions on his Memory.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Benefit confined to the Subject, and meaner Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; even Princes themselves do borrow from History those Counsels and Assistances they shall hardly gain from Courtiers and Ministers; sometimes they will not, sometimes they dare not Admonish their Master; whilst a good History shews them by others, what will be the effect of ill-concerted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
<pb facs="tcp:49245:9"/>
and Counsels, and at the same time is an Awe upon them, suggesting this Thought frequently to them, <hi>How will this look in History?</hi> Thus <hi>Augustus,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> became Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to Posterity, by observing carefully in History, what Fate had attended the Princes that preceded them.</p>
            <p>Posterity too are to be taken care of; if the present Age is not such as a Good or a Wise Man would wish it, let us try if we can make the next Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better, by shewing the Chain of Calamities have followed at the heels of the Vices of the last and of this Age. At her Death the Thrift, the Probity, the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Hospitality of the <hi>English</hi> Nation was much abated: The Luxury that attended the
<pb facs="tcp:49245:10"/>
Peaceable Reign of <hi>James</hi> the First, and the Beginning of <hi>Charles</hi> the First, brought on a War that threatned our Ruin: What has hapned since the Restitution, to the time in which Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties began Their Reign, is now fresh in Memory, but will be lost, if not written. And I am persuaded nothing can possibly be invented to make us Wiser than we now are, sooner or more easily, than a good Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Period of Time; but then our Princes and Great Men must encourage it, and skreen the Writer, or it will never be done: The Expence is too great for a Private Man, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials are most of them locked up from the view of all those who have not the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity consenting to their Inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Royal Purse to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

            <p>Methinks every Prince that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth to do things worthy to be written, should take care to have one good Historian about him, to preserve the Memory of his Actions. Those that live ill, will find what they fear above all things, a man to paint out those things to the Life, which they would gladly have concealed. Story will go on with or without their care, but to their Damage, if not discreetly encouraged.</p>
            <p>But why do I write thus in all the Misfortunes that have so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly befallen me! My Character has been written with the Poison of Asps, instead of Ink; so that one single <hi>Word</hi> (in another man's Work, otherwise interpreted than either he or I meant it, as is plain by the words that follow and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

it) has been enough to sink me, after my Reputation had been sufficiently pierced by the Arrows of Envy and Detraction. But all that I shall say in my own Defence, is, That I hate what I am supposed to be guilty of, as much as any man in the Nation; and never suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, said, or thought the thing in all my Life.</p>

Her Father was <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, Her Mother was the Lady <hi>Anna Boleyn</hi> the Daughter of Sir <hi>Thomas Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn,</hi> a Knight of great Estate and Esteem. After She came to wear the Royal Crown of <hi>England,</hi> She had a particular Affection for <hi>Greenwich,</hi> that Pleasant Seat upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> as for the place of Her Nativity: and upon that account, amongst many others, She preferr'd Her Palace there before all Her other Country Seats near <hi>London;</hi> as in truth it enjoys one of the Noblest Prospects in the World, and an health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49245:18"/>
and a pleasing Air. From Her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cradle She was exposed to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and Hardships of an unkind For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. <hi>Anna Boleyn</hi> Her Mother, upon the Death of Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi> in the Year 1535. the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned for Treason; and in 1536. being Sentenced, was freed by Death from a bloody Marriage, the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May.</hi> The Inveterate Malice of the Popish Clergy having ever since pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Match with their Reproaches as unlawful and void; because Queen <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi> his first Wife was then still li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and very much inraged at it, tho' to no purpose. Hereupon soon after a Parliament was summoned, which began the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June;</hi> In which the <hi>Issue of both the King's former Marriages was declared Illegitimate, and for ever excluded from claiming the Inheritance of the Crown as the King's Lawful Heirs by Lineal Descent; and the Attainder of Queen</hi> Ann, <hi>and her Complices, was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</hi> So that by Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment She stood wholly incapacitated as to the wearing the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Her only Support in the mean time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all these Injuries and Afflictions was the Goodness of God.</p>

The King Her Father observing in <note place="margin">Her Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Her a Noble Presence of Mind, a good Memory, great Apprehension, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Nature, and good Dispositions towards Piety and Vertue, caused Her to be diligently educated and brought up in Learning, and taught whatever was suitable to Her Birth and Age. Her <hi>Tutoress</hi> was the Lady <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon,</hi> a Person of great Worth, who formed this great Wit from Her Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and improved Her Native Modesty with wise Counsels, and a Liberal and Sage Advice. Thus Her Natural Parts were in progress of time polished and improved by the knowledge of many of the best and most useful Arts: That when She came to Reign (which was even then supposed) She might manage Her Affairs with a steady hand, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and regularly Administer Justice, and shew Mercy, cure Her Anger, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern prudently all Her other Passions and Affections. The King Her Father, the day after Her Mother was beheaded, married the Lady <hi>Jane Seymour;</hi> and this New Queen, what from the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Her Disposition, and out of compliance with the King, who loved Her very much, was as kind to Her as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49245:19"/>
if She had been Her Mother. There is still extant two Letters written by this Young Princess to Her, the one in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> and the other in <hi>English,</hi> in a fair Hand, the same She wrote all the rest of Her Life, when She was not full Four years of Age.

The Learned Mr. <hi>Roger Ashcam</hi> (a man born and bred for that Age, which was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> to a Politeness, and raise them to an Eloquence) was Her Tutor for the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue; and by his Industry and Diligence he directed Her so well, that from <hi>Cicero, Pliny</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> She became the Mistress of an Even, Beautiful, pure, unmixed, and truly Princely Stile, which She could speak with Elegance and Facility. As She became thus Eloquent, and was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49245:19"/>
well furnished with Knowledge by the means of this Tongue; so upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions She was ready afterwards to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Her Love and Esteem for the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Tongue. She became so perfect in it, that she spoke it with all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Eloquence; so that some of Her Extemporary Orations were deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly approved by both the <hi>Universities,</hi> and they too are consigned to Eternity, and left a lasting Impression on the minds of them that heard them, though few of them are now extant; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there is one preserved and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his History of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> Page 138. In this Tongue She did not make it Her business, whilst She was reading the best <hi>Latin</hi> Authors, to furnish Her Memory with Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Observations, or a plenty of high sounding Words, or Elegant Phrases, which might help to exalt her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Learning, or adorn Her Stile: But She treasured up those Precepts ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefully, which were useful for the government of Her Life, or for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging Her Private Affairs, or those of the State, well and wisely. To this end She read <hi>Livy</hi>'s <hi>History, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> his <hi>Annals, the Acts of Tiberius</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49245:20"/>
the Emperor, and all <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Works. By all which She at last furnished Her Judgment with the best Remedies against all the Attacks of Fortune: With an equal Industry She read over all the best of the <hi>Greek Orators and Historians;</hi> with the Assistance of Mr. <hi>Ashcam</hi> She read <hi>Isocrates, Aeschinis</hi> and <hi>Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> She was curious, not only to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Propriety of the <hi>Greek</hi> Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, and the Sense of the Author, but pried into the Antiquities that occurr'd, the Causes they managed, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the People, the Customs of the <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>cians,</hi> and the Manners of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City of <hi>Athens,</hi> till She throughly understood them. She caused Sir <hi>John Fortescue,</hi> a great Master in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, to read to Her <hi>Thuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides, Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Polybins,</hi> and after them <hi>Euripides, Aeschines</hi> and <hi>Sophocles:</hi> And to reward him for this Service, She afterwards made him Master of her <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drove, and Chancellor, and Under-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer of the Exchequer;</hi> And She would afterwards say, that <hi>Fortescue for Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,</hi> and <hi>Walsingham for Subtilty, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Her Expectation;</hi> no wonder then that he was ever of Her Privy Council. She had afterwards a great Love for Sir
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49245:20"/>
               <hi>Henry Savil,</hi> a Gentleman of various and great Learning, who afterwards composed many noble Volumes, and arose to Honout purely by his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>In Her reading She did not only aim <note place="margin">Her Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in Reading.</note> to understand Her Author, and observe the <hi>softness of the Attick, and the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Greek Tongue,</hi> which may serve for Ostentation: But She mado many Observations for the Tempering of Manners; The Sanctity of Justice, and the allaying Humane Passions, that nothing might be done by Her Angrily, Proudly, Injuriously, and beyond the Rules of Civility. There was not one remarkable Story or Expression in all the Works of <hi>Thucidides</hi> and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Governmene of Life or Manners, or to the ordering Publick Affairs, but She had it by heart. She was as great an Admirer of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as of <hi>Eloquence;</hi> by which She attained the Knowledg of many excellent Things; and that civil Prudence or Policy which is so absolutely necessary for all Princes, And besides all that civil Prudence and the Knowledge of Governing, by which the Publick Utility is acquired and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, She drew from the Ancient and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49245:21"/>
most Noble Philosophers all those Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that they have set down for the gaining <hi>Moral Prudence and Vertue:</hi> For Her greatest Care was spent in the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating these two beautiful Parts of Philosophy. I will omit the common Philosophers, of whose Learning and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine She was a great Lover. The <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Plato,</hi> that illustrious Light of <hi>Greece,</hi> was made more Noble by the Hands of this Heroick Princess. <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> the Prince of the Philosophers, the acute Master of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, was read by Her: She was throughly acquainted with <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s <hi>Cyrus; a Piece not writ with the Truth of an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian; but to represent the lively Image of a Just and Moderate Prince,</hi> accomplished with all those Endowments which the Great <hi>Soerates</hi> had set sorth, for the living well and happily.</p>

And being of a Great Wit, and a Strong Memory, She drew from the <hi>Annals</hi> of all Nations and People the Actions of the Greatest Princes, and an innumerable number of their Fights, and most Illustrious Victories.

her, and made a kind of Claim of the Crown for the <hi>Dauphiness.</hi> The Queen feared the King of <hi>Spain</hi> the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus this Heroick Lady, which had tried both Adverse and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous Fortune, being by Nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a strange Sagacity and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is very rarely to be found in that Sex; and which she had also much improved by the Afflictons she had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; by her wise Counsels soon brought this almost Shipwrack'd Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to a sase Port, and governed it all her days with much ease and Peace; by which she gave the World a noble <hi>Specimen</hi> of her Virtue, Justice and Prudence.

aside all her Feminine Indignation, and would not suffer her most intimate Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to have any place or consideration with her, when she was to consult the Peace, and secure the safety of her Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Of which this may serve for a clear Proof; From the beginning of her Reign she had established this as a Maxim, <hi>That the King of</hi> Spain <hi>was the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Enemy the</hi> English <hi>then had;</hi> but then because that Nation was strong, rich, and powerful, she seemingly paid, for some time, a great respect to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he and the <hi>French</hi> King might not join against her; and she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sent an Ambassador to renew the Amity between her and the House of <hi>Austria.</hi>

               </note> that she should in a short time have a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> and that part of his Dominions lay near her, and that others were more remote, and very rich and fruitful, so that they would well pay her Subjects for the pains and danger of attacking them; She upon the whole concluded, That it was her Interest to enter into a Treaty of Peace and Amity with the King of <hi>France;</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly she kindly received his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,

who were sent hither to renew the Peace.

In all Revolutions and Changes, the Queen always in the first place took care to secure the True Worship of God, and the safety of all her Subjects.

And as to the State, she promised she would use her utmost endeavour to advance the Prosperity, and preserve the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her Subjects. And tho she had need then of their Assistance, yet she professed she would desire no Supply, but what they did freely and chearfully offer.

for the Justification of their <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> were overwhelmed by the load of Infamy their Pride and Cruelty had brought upon them; so that it was not possible for them to abate the Hatred, or remove the Contempt the people were then possessd with, against the Popish Clergy; they sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenly pretended, That in the Matters of Religion there was no need of Reason and Disputation; and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves with more Passion and Anger, than Reason and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

If she happened at any time to be sick, or ever so little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered in her health, her Nobility would be so alarmed at it, that they would willingly never stir from her to eat or drink, or take any care of themselves; and all degrees of people would fly in vast Numbers to the Churches, and with Tears and the most devout Prayers beg her Life and Health, and the Continuance of her Government over them, till God heard their Petitions, and restored her to her Health. Nor was this an enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and formal Devotion, but it was as hearty and as earnest as that which is made for the nearest and dearest Relations: And when they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their desire, the Joy and the Gratitude they expressed, shewed they took her Preservation and Life for a Publick and an Universal Blessing.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49245:80"/>
their Preservation. Many have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to blacken this Act of the Queen's, and others to defend and excuse it; but for my part, I think the Character God gave of King <hi>David,</hi> may be applied to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> here; <hi>David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him, all the days of his life; save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.</hi> And what if upon the whole, the Queen of the <hi>Scots</hi> is to be excepted only in our Instance?</p>
            <p>This Reflection will appear so much <note place="margin">The Queen prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to put the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> upon her Trial.</note> the more reasonable, if we take into Consideration her Death too. The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had been now a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>England</hi> almost XVIII.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49245:81"/>
for the <hi>English</hi> to have kept all those ill men from her, which might put the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> upon such Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, so it was utterly unreasonable that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should expect the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> would desist from endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring by all the ways that were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to recover her Liberty and her Kingdom, tho with the Death of her Oppressor. But by this time the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> her Son was become a man, and he would have secured the Peace and Possession of that Kingdom; and the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was now XLIV. Years of Age, and so not so likely if she had escaped, to have been Courted, or to have wrought her any great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in the world, as she might have done in her Younger years; besides, by this time the States of <hi>Holland</hi> had pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well establishtd themselves to balance the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but then the House of <hi>Guise</hi> was then in its greatest Pride, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was preparing his <hi>Invincible Armado,</hi> which came two years after; and these two may seem to have been the real Motives to it: But whatever they were, the thing cannot be justified, neither ought it; and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> seems to own as much, by her

            <p>This short Speech is highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <note place="margin">The Speech censured.</note> for the Ingenuity and Softness of it; but it was a detestable piece of Wickedness to wheedle a poor Captive Queen, who was ignorant of the Laws of Nations, and destitute of all Advice and Counsel, out of her Reputation, Majesty, Innocence, and Life; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the false Pretences of the Queen's Tenderness for her, her Judges Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness, and her own alledg'd Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, to bring her by a Pretended Shew of Justice, to a Scaffold as a Subject, who was an Equal, an Enemy, and a Sovereign.

               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:49245:82"/>
ought to have set her at Liberty, and commanded her out of her Kingdom, before she could justly treat her as an Enemy.

The two Earls were by this time sensible that a great part of the Popish Faction would not Rise, and that they had neither Numbers, nor Officers, nor Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, nor Money to carry on a War; and besides, they heard that the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Clinton</hi> were Raising For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the <hi>South,</hi> and had got together 12000 men, and were marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: So that if they had beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en <hi>Sussex,</hi> they had been sure of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The Queen was so incensed against them too, that she Attainted all that she could find were concerned in it, that were men of Estate, but shewed more Mercy to the Poorer people, whose Ignorance might bespeak her Compassion.

caused by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his Bull, tho they broke out before the <hi>Bull</hi> was Published here in <hi>England,</hi> which was one great reason that they spread no further.

No; but if they find the Person of a Prince is out of their reach, that they cannot destroy it, their next care is, to defame them to Posterity, and so to murther their Reputation.

and <hi>Gifford,</hi> those Firebrands of Hell, that brought him to so Untimely a Grave, with Infamy and Horrible Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for he was perfectly alive when he was cut open, and said after he was cut down, <hi>Parce mihi Domine Jesu; Lord Jesus spare me.</hi> And however unjustifiable the Execution of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> is, these were the men that brought her too to an Untimely Grave, and betrayed her into the hands of her Enemies; and in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thty shall answer for her Blood.</p>
            <p>The Queen in the mean time finding <note place="margin">The Queen has a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Supply gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> her Treasury exhausted by the vast Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences she had been put to for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the <hi>Hollanders</hi> against the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> to whom in the year 1576. she Lent 20000 <hi>l</hi> and after that time she furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them several times: And in the year 1585. she had Cautionary Towns gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her, and openly espoused their Cause, and undertook the protection of them.

Thus her Care and Thrift enabled her to maintain a vast Charge with a small Revenue; and at the same time relieve the needy part of the Nation, by her remitting one Part, and the whole Nation by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasing another Part; <hi>which won the Hearts of her People to that degree, that they never after denied her whatever she asked.</hi>

And with a Maseuline Courage, despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all their Rage and Baseness, she took great care of her self, and put her

whole trust in God: For the rest, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting <note place="margin">She spared none of those who fell into her hands.</note> to her dying day in her first Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, not to spare one of these Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that fell into her hands, as she at first told them in a Proclamation she would not: <hi>And this is the true way of dealing with these Implacable Monsters, who are neither worthy of Mercy, nor capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Repentance.</hi>

            <p>This Censure may possibly seem too <note place="margin">A Digression concerning <hi>William Parry.</hi>
               </note> severe to those that are not perfectly acquainted with the Principles and Tempers of these Men; and therefore it will not be amiss to confirm it with an Example: <hi>William Parry,</hi> mention'd above, was employed by the Jesuits to murther the Queen, and they had tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly pèrswaded him, <hi>That there was nothing more Glorious than to die for the service of the Church; and that he would be reputed a Martyr, if he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate her who was the Favourer of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and the Enemy of the Church.</hi> To this End he came into <hi>England,</hi> in the Year 1583. And to insinuate himself into the Queen's Favour (whose Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant he had formerly been) and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her belief, he freely and openly told her, that he had been solicited to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49245:98"/>
Murther her, by <hi>Morgan</hi> and other Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Priests beyond the Seas; <hi>Pretending that he had entred into a Familiarity with them to no other end, than to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their secret Designs against her, and to take care of her Safety,</hi> to whom he owed his Life; she having pardoned him when he had forfeited it to Justice, in the year 1580. The Queen heard all this Story with an unconcerned Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and told him, <hi>That none of the Catholicks should be called in question on account of his Religion, or of the Pope's pretended Supremacy, if they behaved themselves in all other things like good Subjects.</hi> Which words he afterwards confessed made such an impression on his mind, that he could not forget them: And after this he was so much in her good opinion, that he solicited for an Employment; but receiving a Letter from the <hi>Cardinal of</hi> Coma, <hi>wherein he commended the Design he was engaged in,</hi> (saith he) <hi>and sending him an Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Parry</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> 
               <hi>in the Pope's Name; tho he shewed the Letter to the Queen, yet he persisted in his Resolution to Assassinate her; and from thenceforward had no scruple in his mind concerning the Lawfulness of the Fact. But then he pretended he was resolved first</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:49245:99"/>
               <hi>to try if he could perswade her by fair means to use the Catholicks more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: And when at any time he went to the Queen, he would lay by his Dagger, for fear the Opportunity should be too strong a Temptation to him. When he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, and considered her Royal Virtues, he confessed he was staggered in his mind:</hi> But his Vows were in Heaven, and his Letters and Promises on Earth, that he would do it; <hi>and this perpetually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted him, and put him on. At last he fell upon a Book written by</hi> Alan <hi>a Jesuit, to prove,</hi> That Princes that were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, might be Deposed or Slain; <hi>and this Book was a strong Motive to him to go on with the Treason. And he communicated it to</hi> Nevil, (who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Accused him); <hi>and they two having taken an Oath of Secrefse each to other, formed a Design to set upon her with Ten Horsemen when she was in the Countrey, and so Murther her.</hi> They could, however, never find the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; <hi>and about six months after this the Earl of</hi> Westmorland <hi>dying, and</hi> Nevil <hi>being his next Heir, he discovered</hi>

               <hi>to Secretary</hi> Walsingham <hi>this Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> By the Queen's Order he sent for <hi>Parry,</hi> and asked him, <hi>If he had had</hi>

               <hi>any Treaty with any Dissatisfied or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected person;</hi> opening him a door for his Escape; but he plainly denied he ever had; for if he had confessed it, and said he did it to try <hi>Nevil,</hi> he had without doubt escaped; but the Crime he had resolved upon, had blinded his eyes so, that he could not see it: Nay, he had the Impudence to say, That tho the Queen had twice spared his Life, yet he was not beholden to her for it, because it had been unjust to have taken it. The greatest part of this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is extracted from his own Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion before the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hatton,</hi> and others; so that there can be no doubt of the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>This her Severity to them struck a <note place="margin">The Queen's Severity to these Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators made her terrible to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Papists.</note> great Terror into the minds of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Papists, when they every where saw the Heads and Quarters of their Party exposed to the publick view, but nothing could cure or appease their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered Malice. Her Majesty and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, we see, was able to excite the Admiration, and her undaunted Valour to terrifie this Cut-throat, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed; but tho she charmed his hands, yet neither was her Mercy or Goodness
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49245:100"/>
able to melt his hardned heart; nor was her Severity towards him and other such Miscreants, sufficient to mitigate the enraged Malice of the rest of the Jesuits and Popish Villains, but they still went on with their Hellish Designs to destroy her. But when all was done, the Goodness of God watched over her to preserve her, and frustrated all the Designs of wicked men against her: and without this, all the wise Counsel of <hi>Burleigh</hi> and <hi>Walsingham,</hi> and the rest of her Servants would have signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nothing.

And it is worth the observing, That in all the times since the Reformation began, which is now One hundred seventy five years, though they have been engaged in endless Plots

Who
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49245:103"/>
could reconcile these two contrary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, That they should and should not be tolerated at one and the same time? The Pope to promote this War, gave the King leave to sell Church-Lands, to the Value of 50000 Crowns by the year; and saith the same Jesuit, <hi>Never were Church Revenues better employed, or granted away upon a better reason.</hi> The destruction of Hereticks with Fire and Sword, contrary to the Publick Faith, is certainly a most Holy Work, and an Excellent Subject to spend the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Church on.

In the mean time the noble Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> was desolated by Fire and Sword, their Populous Towns destroyed, their Rich Churches and Monasteries plunder'd, their Nobility and Gentry slain on both sides, and by their own Swords; their Matrons Ravished, and the Children Murdered in the Arms
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49245:104"/>
of their Parents, and <hi>France</hi> was more wasted by this War in her bowels, than by all the Foreign Wars she had been engaged in from the time the <hi>English</hi> were expelled, to that time. <hi>Was ever Church-Treasures better spent?</hi>

            <p>At the same time that <hi>France</hi> was thus miserably harass'd by an intestine <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Low-Countrey</hi> War.</note> War, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were as busie in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> to extirpate Heresie, as they pretended, but in truth to deprive those Provinces, under that pretence, of their Ancient Liberties and Civil Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and to submit them to the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Insolent <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that so they might from thence pass on to the Conquest of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and so erect an Universal Monarchy in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> which Design they had Vanity enough to discover.

in the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion, as those that were well inclined to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, seeing the Liberty and Riches, Trade and Commerce of their Countrey must be ruined, if these courses were taken, they interceded with <hi>Margaret</hi> the King's Sister, their <hi>Regent,</hi> that the King's Letter might not be put in execution; but she went on, however, and they on the other hand stood upon their guard, and as much as was possible hindred it. The next year the Quarrel grew higher, and the multitude rose in many places with an irresistible fury, and destroyed all the <hi>Images</hi> in the Churches of many of the great Cities; the Torrent ran so high, and was so impetuous, that the Regent was forced to publish an Edict of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <note place="margin">Liberty of Conscience treacherously granted, and re-called.</note> of Conscience, to appease the people, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being not able by any other means to secure the Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these Countries; but so soon as the people were quieted, the Edict was recalled; which they owned was granted only to gain time to send for Men and Moneys, to force the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> to submit to the King's Will, and to punish them for their disobedience. Yet however,

in the mean time, whilst this Edict was observed, all places returned to the former state of Peace, and Trade went on successfully; so that if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could have perswaded himself to have complied with his Interest in this Affair, he and his Posterity had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Peaceable Possession of these Provinces, which would have been worth the owning, Rich, Populous, and Potent, and able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against the <hi>French.</hi> But by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing contrary Methods, he brought a War upon himself, which wasted <hi>Spain,</hi> ruined his Treasures, erected a part of these Provinces into an Independent Commonwealth; and so depopulated and impoverished the rest, that they are not able to defend themselves against the <hi>French:</hi> So that the breaking this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, proved the Ruin of all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Greatness.</p>

She saw also that he had sent <hi>Ferdinand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavares, Duke of Alva,</hi> a Bloody man, to usurp this Arbitrary Government,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49245:114"/>
who being no way related to the Royal Family, was now constituted the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governor of these Provinces, contrary to their Laws, and that he had abolished and suspended the Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Authority of all their Legal Courts, and brought in amongst them a new unheard of <hi>Tribunal,</hi> which had proceeded illegally against several of the Nobility of that Countrey, and condemned them to death, and they had been thereupon executed. That <hi>Spanish</hi> Garisons were quartered, and Citadels built in the great Towns and Cities; and the Twentieth Penny of all their Real Estates, and the Tenth of their Personal had been illegally as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd, and by force levied. She saw al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that the <hi>Duke d' Alva</hi> the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1568. had furiously and impatiently seized the Goods and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of her own Subjects, and put them into the Custody of his Soldiers, on the pretence of some Moneys stopped in <hi>England,</hi> which belonged to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Genoua,</hi> who had consented to the <hi>Embargo;</hi> and she concluded this enraged man was not content to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> but would needs make himself a Terror to her and her

people too; whereupon this Heroick Lady commanded all the Ships and Goods of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> which were in her Ports, to be stopp'd; which were of greater value than those the Duke had been able to find in the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;</hi> whereby she humbled that proud, hasty man, and made him see how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle she could fear either him or his Master.</p>
            <p>This Action of the Queen's opened <note place="margin">The Inhabitants of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> follow the Example of Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </note> the eyes of the poor oppressed people of these Countries, and shewed them the way to deal with their Oppressors was to attack them by Water, and not by Land. They had made several attempts on the side of <hi>Germany,</hi> under the Command of some of their banished Nobility, in the year 1568; and they had been unfortunate in all of them. <hi>Lewis Van Nassau,</hi> Brother of <hi>William Prince of Orange,</hi> tho he had 7000 men, Horse and Foot, and was a good and a prudent Commander, and had taken all the care that was possible to prevent Misfortunes, yet he was defeated near <hi>Emden</hi> The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who followed after, was in a short time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire into <hi>France,</hi> tho he had
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49245:115"/>
11000 men under him. The two next years he served the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and in the year 1569. he took up the Resolution to grant Letters of <hi>Mart</hi> to all that would put out Ships to Cruise against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> the <hi>Heer Van Dolhain</hi> being Admiral, who in that year took, and spoiled, and ransomed many Ships. This good success encouraged more in the year 1570. to take this course; and as they grew stronger and more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, so they had better success. In 1571. they set upon the Fleet that was going to <hi>Spain,</hi> and took and plundered a great part of it in the <hi>Texel.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> sent out some Men of War against these Privateers, but to small purpose, because they were small and too nimble for his great Ships; and <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>England</hi> protected, victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all'd, and harboured them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in the year 1571. he sent to the Queen of <hi>England</hi> to complain of the <note place="margin">He com-plains to Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of her Harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland</hi> Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</note> Harbouring these Pyrates as he called them. The Queen was in no haste to do his business after he had so far provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her, but in the year 1572. when they were become Rich, and very Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, she put out a severe Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49245:115"/>
against them, commanding them to be gone by a limited time, or to be feized in her Harbours; whereupon in <hi>March</hi> this year they put themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of <hi>William Van Marck, Lord Lumey,</hi> to the number of about Thirty Ships or Fly-Boats, well mann'd and victuall'd; and these had the good fortune to find the <hi>Briel</hi> without <note place="margin">They seize the Sea-Ports of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand.</hi>
               </note> any Garison, and so they took Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it without any opposition, the first of <hi>April.</hi> The eighth of the same month, <hi>Flushing</hi> joined with them, and cast out the few <hi>Spaniards</hi> were there. And after this, in a short time the whole Provinces of <hi>South</hi> and <hi>North Holland,</hi> as fast as they could by any means get rid of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Garisons, revolted from them, and took up Arms against the <hi>Duke of Alva,</hi> declaring at first for the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> as Stadtholder to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in these Provinces. Thus were the Foundations of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties <note place="margin">Which was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</hi>
               </note> of the United Provinces in the Low Countries, laid in the blood of its Inhabitants, and as heartily at first promoted by the <hi>Roman-</hi>Catholick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to preserve their Civil Privileges, as by the Protestants to secure their Lives and Fortunes from the Arbitrary
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49245:116"/>
Violence of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> 
               <q>So that if <note place="margin">☞</note> either of them were Rebels, it was because <hi>Philip</hi> the IId. would not be contented with the same degree of Power the former Princes his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors had enjoyed; but made use of a Ferment the Providence of God and his own Cruelty and Imprudenee had raised in the minds of his Subjects, to enslave the Innocent and the Guilty. And altho he made Religion his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, yet Ambition and Worldly Greatness, and the subduing his own People and all his Neighbours, was the Real Motive at the bottom.</q> I conclude therefore, That he was a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and a Perfidious Man; and his Subjects that revolted from him upon such horrid Provocations, and after they had done all that was possible to bring him to better courses, were no Rebels. I cannot here but observe how frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and passionately of late the <hi>Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> were called Rebels and Traytors here, by a sort of men who were going to act upon us all the ill things the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> did there; but wanting Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they were forced to go slowly on, and had great thoughts of heart, that our Doctrine of <hi>Non-Resistance</hi> might
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49245:116"/>
fail them when they stood most in need of it to bind up our hands till they should cut our Throats; and therefore they declaimed furiously against these <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to fright us into the snare. But certainly the man must be very silly, that would at all regard the being called a Rebel by the <hi>Roman-</hi>Catholicks; or part with all that is valuable, to avoid that Reproach from such men of all others.</p>
            <p>But to return from this Digression <note place="margin">Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> undertakes the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressedNeigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> concerning the Cause of this War: The Queen seeing her Neighbours in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> thus oppressed by the Savage Tyranny of the Duke <hi>De Alva,</hi> and so injuriously exhausted by his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and Illegal Exactions, Prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Murthers, and all the other Calamities of an unjust War; and the distressed Inhabitants of these Provinces flocking in great numbers into her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to shelter themselves from the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, Assassinations, Pride and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of this Enemy and Executioner, with all they could bring away with them, she opened her Ports to receive them, and with great compassion heard their bitter Complaints, whilst they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49245:117"/>
deplored the Miseries of their Country, and begged her Protection, pursuant to the Treaties and Leagues between <hi>England,</hi> and the House of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> She always expressed a great regard for those Nations and Countries that lay near hers, and were by Leagues uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her; and she was the more afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this People, because fhe saw the extirpating the Protestant Religion, was made the Pretence of one of the most flagrant Injuries that was ever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to a Free People: And therefore she was the more easily induced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver these her nearest Allies out of the Jaws of this Pyratc and Enemy of Mankind; and to curb the Insolence of these <hi>Spanish</hi> Forccs, that from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were poured in upon these misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Countries, to enslave and destroy them. She thought there was nothing in this world which so well became the Majesty of a Prince, and tended more to her Reputation and Glory, than the taking Arms against such men as these, and in the Defence of such Supplicants, to deliver them at once from the most intolerable Dangers, and from Slavery. It is very probable she would for a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er time have dissembled the Injuries the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49245:117"/>
King of <hi>Spain</hi> had done to her and her Subjects, if he would have mitigated his Rigors in the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> but seeing that was not to be hoped for, she resolved to put a stop to his Rage by Force; <hi>and for the Glory of God, and the common Safety of the Protestant Interest,</hi> to assist the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> with Men, Money, Arms, Ammunition, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else was necessary to keep them out of the hands of their Oppressors. She neither feared the Greatness of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the <hi>IId</hi> nor the Threats of <hi>France,</hi> nor the Secret and Treacherous Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Plots of her own Popish Subjects at home; nor the Hazards, Expences, or Calamities of a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and lasting War abroad, with the Richest and most Potent Princes in her Times; but putting her sole Trust and Confidence in the Providence and Protection of God, she chearfully and undauntedly entred the Lists with these men, that her Neighbours and Friends, Confederates and Allies, might enjoy their Ancient Liberties and Privileges, their beloved Countrey, their Estates and Fortunes, and the Liberty of their Consciences, and live happily. She thought no Labour, no Danger, no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49245:118"/>
too great to be hazarded, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain so great a Blessing for them; but went through all that stood in her way, with Courage, Equinimity, Fidelity, and Constancy: By which she acquired an Immortal Glory, and is still esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Deliverer and Preserver of this People, and in truth of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Interest in <hi>Christendom.</hi> The Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> in the mean time threatned to expel her out of her Kingdoms; and promoted Rebellions in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to that end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her; but there happened such dreadful Civil Wars in both their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, that they were very much disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled from prosecuting these Designs to the degree they intended. And she for her part was not wanting, but sent her Forces both into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> to find these two Monarchs work at home, and by kindling Fires in their Kingdoms, prevented their laying her own in Ashes. Thus at the same time she delivered <hi>Britain</hi> from the fear of a War with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> and whilst she protected her Oppressed Neighbours, she preserved her own Subjects from an intolerable Foreign Servitude.

The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Party was strong and numerous, and every day grew greater, and was headed by the Princes of the Royal Family of the House of <hi>Bourbon:</hi> And the Popish Party on the other side was the far greater Party, and was headed by the Royal Family that was in Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Crown of <hi>France:</hi> So that <hi>Henry</hi> II. and <hi>Francis</hi> II. <hi>Charles</hi> IX. and <hi>Henry</hi> III. his Sons, who were all successively Kings of <hi>France</hi> one after the other, did all that was possible, by Wit and Policy, Force, Perfidy, Wars, Massacres, Breach of Faith, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, to extirpate this Party; and when all was done, the End of Seven

Civil Wars one after another, was a Toloration; and the End of every To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, but the last, was a Civil War, began by the Popish Party, upon the Principle, <hi>That no Faith was to be kept with Hereticks;</hi> which Maxim was so often alledged, either by way of Excuse, or by way of Incitement, or Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that nothing but the Weakness of the Protestant Party could possibly have induced them to accept a Security, which had been so often forfeited, and which they were certain would last no longer, than till the Popish Party were in a condition to break it. And yet the keeping of the Seventh, that was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Henry</hi> the IVth. in the year 1596. did them more damage than the breach of all the other Six that went before it; because by its long duration it disarmed and effeminated that Party, and robbed them of their Fears, their Martial Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and that keen Zeal for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which the Perfidy and Violence of the former Times had kept alive.

In the year 1565. there was a secret <note place="margin">A Private League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Protestants.</note> League made at <hi>Bayone,</hi> between the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which was called, <hi>The Holy League,</hi> because chiefly designed for the Extirpating the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> tho it was managed with all the Privacy and Secrecy that was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet the suspicion of the Protestant Party gave them the first hint to dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and within a little time it was discovered both by its effects, and by the cross Interests of many of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-</hi>Catholicks, who were to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their Civil Privileges, in lieu of having their Religion established and preserved.

After which Victory, the King was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to have a Peace, and the <hi>Guises</hi> and the Popish Party to continue the War: And upon this the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Party subdivided it self into two Factions, part siding with the King for a Peace, and part joining with the <hi>Guises</hi> to carry on the War, and depose this King as a Favourer of Heresle, soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Pleasures, and unfit for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49245:138"/>
the Fatigues that attended Insurrections and Tumults: That King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedonia</hi> was less terrible to him than a desultory Enemy, and a barbarous <hi>Irish Teagne:</hi> That this languid Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be composed without wounds or bloodshed, as some thought, if good men were but sent to treat with the Rebels: That there were those in <hi>Ireland</hi> who had conferred with the Rebels, and had sent into <hi>England</hi> the Rebels Defamations against him and others of her Governors: By which passage the Deputy slily taxed Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> as one that had done nothing worthy of his former Military Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but thought to work upon the good nature of the <hi>Ulster</hi> Clowns by his Courtship and Flattery; which tended rather to the making them more insolent. This carriage of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's was the occasion of fierce Contests and Quarrels between him and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, and the effect of it was, that not only the Heads of the <hi>Clans</hi> in <hi>Ulster,</hi> but those also in <hi>Connanght</hi> and <hi>Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> took Arms and revolted from the Crown of <hi>England</hi> The Deputy seeing things by their Divisions brought to so desperate an estate, resolved to get rid

of the Government, and by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters humbly besought the Queen a good General might be sent in his place In this doubtful time, Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> as earnestly desired to be Deputy, and that his Brother, who was fitter for the Labours of the War, might be made President of <hi>Munster.</hi> But he obtained neither of his Requests.

with the change, for that he dreaded the fiery Temper of that Lord, with whom he had formerly had some quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, which he would now have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly sacrificed to the Welfare of his Countrey. But the Deputy was of an Implacable Temper, and commanded him into <hi>Munster,</hi> upon the peril of his life, not permitting <hi>Norris</hi> to see him: This Great and Stout Man could not bear the Affront; but he that had run through so many Perils in the Field, in the <hi>Netherlands, France,</hi> and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;</hi> he that had despised the Rages of the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and put a stop to the Victories of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> fell under this, and expired in the Arms of his Brother. Thus he became a wonderful Instance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, as well as of Martial Courage; being rather pitied than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; because his Management in <hi>Ireland</hi> was much inferior to what he had done elsewhere, and short of what was expected from him. The Lord Lieutenant died in <hi>November</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet in that short time he beat the <hi>Irish</hi> in <hi>Ulster,</hi> and recovered the Fort of <hi>Blackwater,</hi> and Garison'd it with <hi>English.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Norris</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated

               <hi>Irish</hi> by this Defeat got Arms, Victual, Ammunition, and Reputation, and the Fort of <hi>Blackwater;</hi> so that the <hi>English</hi> were reduced from an Offensive to a Defensive War. This nettled the Queen, and she sent to <hi>Ormond,</hi> who was Lieutenant-General, to clear the Army of all the <hi>Irish,</hi> and she sent 2000 Foot and 100 Horse to recruit the Army. <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi> sent after this 4000 <hi>Kerns</hi> into <hi>Munster,</hi> and the President not being able to resist them, by reason his Forces were small, that whole Province re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled also in <hi>October,</hi> 1598. and began

to Kill, Rob, and Ravage the <hi>English,</hi> without Measure or Mercy. Thus the Rebellion grew to that height, that it became terrible to the Queen. <hi>Tyrone</hi> in the mean time sent submissive Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <note place="margin">And at the same time treats with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>

in any part of her Dominions the Countrey hapned to become desolate and ill peopl'd, she took particular care to send <hi>Colonies</hi> thither to supply that defect.

of <hi>Affrica. Drake</hi> and <hi>Cavendish,</hi> in these times went round the Globe of the Earth, and erected every where Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies to the Honour of their Queen. This last was not only above the hopes, but beyond the thoughts of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so far they were of attempting any thing of that nature before.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> was of a mean and <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi>'s Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> obscure Extraction, and born in <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> his Father embracing the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. was persecuted for the same, and forced to remove for his greater security into <hi>Kent,</hi> after which he entred Orders, and by Poverty was constrained to bind his Son to the Master of a Ship, who sometimes passed into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> The young Man so well pleased his Master, that he dying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, he gave this Servant of his, his Ship. After this he put himself under Mr. <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> who in the year 1567. was preparing a small Fleet at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> with a design to discover some yet unknown Parts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica;</hi> but this Voyage was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, and the <hi>English</hi> falling into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he lost all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49245:145"/>
his stock, and hardly escaped with his Liberty. After this he became one of the most famous Mariners this Nation has produced; and by his industry he opened the way to both the <hi>Indies,</hi> which before was not known to the <hi>English.</hi> For about five years after this first Voyage, he preyed as a Pyrate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wheresoever he found them, and could master them; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by this means acquired a good sum of Money, he built a stout Ship, which he called the <hi>Dragon,</hi> with which and two Barks he ventured once more in the Year 1572. to visit the Coasts of <hi>America,</hi> and took <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> a Town in the Bay of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Here he was informed by the <hi>Negroes</hi> that were Slaves to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (and were called <hi>Cimarones)</hi> that a vast Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in Gold and Silver was to be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after transported by Mules and other Land-Carriages from <hi>Panama,</hi> in order to be shipped for <hi>Spain:</hi> These he waylayed, and seized all this Wealth, which proved much more than he could bring away; so that he was forced to leave the Silver, a great part of which he buried in the Earth, but he got all the Gold on board his Ship; after
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49245:145"/>
which he burnt <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> a Rich Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of the Merchandises of this Country, seated upon the River <hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre,</hi> which falls into the Gulf of <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico,</hi> at <hi>Porto Bello.</hi> This Town of <hi>Sancta Cruz</hi> seems to be that which Mr. <hi>Gage</hi> in his Travels calls <hi>Venta de Cruzes,</hi> and saith it lies about twelve Leagues from <hi>Panama</hi> to the <hi>East,</hi> upon the <hi>Chiagre,</hi> and was in his time inhabited by none but <hi>Mulatto's</hi> and <hi>Black-Moors,</hi> who belonged to the Boats that carry the Goods brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Porto Bello.</hi> Thus far this bold Captain ventured to travel by Land with a small Party of resolute <hi>English</hi> men, to the great loss and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and by the success of it encouraged others to follow him. So that the <hi>Buccaneers,</hi> which in our times have performed such wonderful things in <hi>America,</hi> have only followed him in their Adventures. From the Mountains of <hi>St. Pablo</hi> upon this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he first saw the <hi>Mar del Zur,</hi> or the <hi>Pacifick Occan,</hi> which washeth the <hi>Western</hi> Shoars of <hi>America,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being strangely possess'd with a strong desire to sail herafter upon thatO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, he fell down upon his Knees,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49245:146"/>
and beseeched God to grant him that favour, vowing to do his utmost for the discovering it; and from thenceforth he found no rest in his mind night or day, till he had accomplished this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. In the mean time our Great Man having divided the spoil he had taken amongst his followers, with an open hand to all their content, he set sail for <hi>England</hi> with vast Riches. Whilst others gazed on the Gold he brought home with wonder; He glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in nothing but that he had seen the <hi>Mar de Zur,</hi> and thought of nothing but the making Preparations to sail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, which the Treasure he had got (for he was now become very rich) fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished him with means to effect, and enabled him to build Ships for that purpose.</p>

               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:49245:146"/>
and sail upon that Sea before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; to this end he got a single Ship, and 70 Sailors to venture with him; and in the year 1575. failed to the same place; but hearing from the <hi>Negroes,</hi> that now the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were become so cautious as to send a Guard of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with their <hi>Caravans,</hi> to guard them from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Porto Bello,</hi> he drew his Ship ashore in a desolate place, and covered it with Boughs, burying his Cannon and Provisions in the earth, and then with all his Company, and six <hi>Negroes</hi> for his Guide, he travelled to a River, which falls into the <hi>South Sea,</hi> where he cut down Timber, and built some Boats, and so passed to the <hi>Island of Pearls</hi> in that Ocean, which lay not far from the Mouth of this River; where he staid ten days to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the return of the Ships from <hi>Peru;</hi> and he intercepted one with fixty pound of <hi>Gold,</hi> and another with One hundred pound of <hi>Silver;</hi> and in these ships he passed back to the River. The News of this being brought to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> they sent <hi>John de Ortega,</hi> with an hundred Soldiers, to pursue the bold Adventurers; the River had Three Mouths, and he was doubtful which

Arriving at <hi>Lima,</hi> he found twelve Ships, but all the Mariners were on shore, and yet in them he had a great quantity of Silk, and a Chest of Minted Silver; which shews how se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from Pyrates this Coast had to this time been. Nor in truth till this time had any other than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ever sailed upon this Sea, except <hi>Oxenham.</hi> In his journey to <hi>Panama</hi> he took a

The first of <hi>March</hi> he took a Ship cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Cacofoga,</hi> which had on board 80 pound weight of Gold, and 13 Chests of Minted Money, and as much Silver as balasted his own Ship; the Master of this Ship told him, That his Ship <hi>(Drake</hi>'s) should henceforth be call'd the <hi>Cacofoga,</hi> and the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship the <hi>Cacoplata.</hi>

            <p>Being thus wonderfully enriched, and, as he thought, sufficiently aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for the Loss he had sustained in his first Attempt upon <hi>Vera Crnz,</hi> he began to consider of his return; and not thinking the passage by the Streights of <hi>Magellan</hi> safe (as in truth it was beset by the Orders of <hi>Francis Duke of Toledo,</hi> then Viceroy of <hi>Peru)</hi> he directed his Course <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> to the height of 42 Degrees of <hi>North Latitude,</hi> to seek a paslage; but finding nothing but snow and defolate shores, he returned to 38 degrees, and Wintered there, calling the Countrey <hi>New Albion;</hi> and here the naked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple chofe him for their King, and by their ignorance shewed him plainly

After this the Queen often made him one of her Admirals;

and he being grown exceeding rich, took diligent care to put out a greater Fleet, and openly assaulted the Island of St. <hi>Jago,</hi> and took St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and some others in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> being sent by the Queen with 21 Ships, and 2300 men, in the year 1585. The Towns they took in this Expedition were either so poor that there was nothing of Silver or Gold to be found in them, or they had had such previous notice of the coming of the <hi>English,</hi> that they had sent a way all that was valuable; yet <hi>St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo</hi> and <hi>Carthagena</hi> were forced to redeem themselves from Fire by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; the first gave Twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Ducats, and the latter One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten thousand, which was presently divided amongst the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Seamen.

The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Ships were very much higher and stronger than the <hi>English,</hi> and had

greater and more Cannon; but there was four <hi>CARACKS</hi> of an exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Greatness, and which seemed scarce fit for motion, which served instead of Castles to defend the smaller Ships: The <hi>English</hi> Fleet, on the contrary, was nimble, and very well provided for Fight or Flight, and managed by men that understood the Sea-Affairs wonderfully well; so that they assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Spanish Armado</hi> the <hi>21st.</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> with Dexterity and Courage: The Fight lasted three days without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission, and then was intermitted for want of Gunpowder.

the <hi>Spaniards</hi> than the two former, but they would not be provoked to stop till they came to <hi>Calis,</hi> that being the Orders given them in <hi>Spain;</hi> by this time the <hi>English</hi> Fleet was become a hundred strong, of one sort or other; and many Voluntier Ships made out by men of all degrees, were come into it; and by that time they came to <hi>Dover,</hi> there was 130. of which yet there was not above 22. or 23. of the Queen's biggest ships, that were able to grapple with the <hi>Spanish</hi> ships. The <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> the Sea was calm, and four great <hi>Galeasses</hi> which had Oars, fought the <hi>English</hi> Fleet with great advantage; by night the <hi>English</hi> wanted Gunpowder, which they sent for that night.

manner of Necessaries for such an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and all the <hi>Flandrians</hi> had no great inclinations to make the King of <hi>Spain</hi> Master of <hi>England,</hi> to the Ruin of their own Civil Privileges. The Mariners also that were to have served the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> being terrified by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> withdrew from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and stole away for fear they should have been forced by the Duke to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the passing through the <hi>Dutch Fleet</hi> to their Ruin. The <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> was the day appointed for the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>England;</hi> but before that came, the Admiral of <hi>England</hi> having chosen eight old Ships, and filled them with combustible matter, and charged all their Ordnance with Stones and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, he sent them the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> about Two of the Clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the Wind and Tide against the <hi>Spanish Fleet,</hi> and when they were just upon it, the Mariners fired all these ships at once, and left them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sail to enter the <hi>Spanish Fleet;</hi> this fire in the dead of the night put the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into such an affright, that cutting their Cables, and hoisting their Sails, they betook themselves to the Sea in great confusion and disorder; one of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:49245:154"/>
the greatest of their <hi>Galeasses</hi> falling foul upon another ship, lost her Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and was driven on the Coast of <hi>Calis,</hi> where the <hi>English</hi> found and took her, and in her, besides other valuable Spoils, they found 50000 <hi>Ducats</hi> of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Treasure. The <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> the <hi>Spanish Fleet</hi> got it self into some Order again before <hi>Graveling,</hi> but the <hi>English Fleet</hi> which had followed it, furiously assaulted it, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> suffered the <hi>English</hi> to get the Weathergage of them, tho they were more in number, and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the <hi>English,</hi> but they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to keep on the Defensive part till <hi>Parma</hi> was joined with them. This whole day was spent in a furious Fight, with great slaughter of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> tho there was few ships taken or sunk; but at night the <hi>English</hi> having spent all their Powder, retired. In all these fights the <hi>English</hi> did not lose above 100 men, and amongst them not one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Quality. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships were so battered, that this night two or three of them sunk, and amongst them a great ship of <hi>Biscay,</hi> and two <hi>Portugal Galeons</hi> of Seven or Eight Hundred Tun, were deserted by the

               <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, because the Water entred into them on all sides, and taken by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> of <hi>Flushing.</hi> That day the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet passed by <hi>Dunkirk:</hi> The next day the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet cut down their Main-Sails, and resolved to fight no more; nor was there any occasion, for the <hi>English Admiral</hi> having sent a Squadron to secure the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> he with the rest pursued the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet till the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> but tho he was very near them, yet wanting Powder and Ball he never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them any violence. The <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Navy spread all their Sails before a strong Wind, and committed their shattered ships to the Violence of the <hi>Northern</hi> Ocean, but the <hi>English</hi> following them to 57.

            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> found they had lost <note place="margin">The Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, when the <hi>English</hi> left it:</note> four or five thousand of their men, and ten or twelve of their principal ships; and tho they were rid of the <hi>English,</hi>

yet they wanted <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Victuals, Cables, Cordage, Anchors, Masts,</hi> and <hi>Sails;</hi> and as for the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> he they saw could not succour them; so they resolved to pass round about <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and return into <hi>Spain;</hi> they also cast over-board all their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Mules, to preserve the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Water: Thus they were driven <hi>Northward</hi> to 61 Degrees of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; Twenty five of the best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ships returned into <hi>Spain;</hi> forty more wanting Water, set sail for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to get fresh Water there: These (the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>September)</hi> were by a Storm from the <hi>South-West</hi> driven upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and most of their Ships perished, together with the men in them; others were by a <hi>West</hi> Wind blown into the <hi>English</hi> Channel again, and were taken by the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers:</hi> So that of 134 ships (as some counted them) that came from <hi>Spain,</hi> there never returned above 53.

In short, there was not one Great Family in <hi>Spain,</hi> which did not lose a Son, a

Brother, or a Kinsman.

Tho the <hi>English</hi> did not get much by this Expedition, yet the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were great Losers, one of their biggest Caracks being forced ashore, and burnt, three ships were taken, and many others of that Fleet being kept out too long, perished by tempestuous weather; whereas all the <hi>English</hi> Fleet returned in safety.</p>

            <p>There was one singular Instance of <note place="margin">A rare Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Martial Valour and Courage.</note> Personal Valour in the Course of this War, which happened in the Year 1591. but was reserved to this Place, that the Steps by which the <hi>Spanish</hi> Pride and Greatness were abated and pull'd down, might appear the better by being laid together. May this Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity of this Virgin Queen be an encouragement and an Example to the Present Age for the humbling another Prince, who in our times, and by our means, is become a terror to all his Neighbours on the score of his Naval Forces, though infinitely inferior in that, and the Point of Wealth too, to <hi>Philip</hi> the IId.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:49245:159"/>
and Sea-men being generally sick, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso Bassano,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Admiral, came upon him suddenly with 80 Ships, so that the <hi>English</hi> could hardly gain the main Sea to make their defence. One <hi>RICHARD GREEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILL,</hi> Vice-Admiral, being in a Ship called the <hi>REVENGE,</hi> stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little too long to take in some of his men who were on shoar, and not hoisting his Sails neither in the mean time, out of a contempt of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> by all these oversights happened to be shut in between the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet and the Island. Attemping, when it was too late, to break through the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Fleet, which was divided into four Squadrons, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Admiral, called the St. <hi>Philip,</hi> a Ship of vast bulk, clapt in between him and the Wind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of it, and three smaller Ships surrounded him, and poured in their great and small Shot on all sides; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> very often boarded him, but he every time drove them into their own ships, or into the Sea; Thus he defended himself all that night, with the great slaughter of his own men, but with the greater loss of the Enemy. In the morning the <hi>English</hi> found their
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49245:160"/>
Powder fail, their Masts shot down, their Rigging torn, and the most part of their bravest men slain or wounded, and the rest so wearied with the fight, that they could hardly stand to their Arms; The ship also had received 800 shot of Cannon from the Enemy. <hi>Greenvill</hi> was wounded, and whilst the Chyrurgeon was applying a Plaister to the Wound, he was wounded on the head, and the <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi> was slain. When the day broke upon them, they found the Deck all covered with Blood, shattered Timber, dead and dying men; so that it struck terror into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder. <hi>Greenvill</hi> having now fought 15 hours, and there being no hope of escaping, commanded the ship to be sunk; the Pilot forbad it, and went forth within the Long-boat to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Admiral</hi> to resign the <hi>English</hi> ship, covenanting for their Lives and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were left in it; <hi>Greenvill</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was carried aboard the <hi>Spanish Admiral</hi> languishing, and just ready to expire. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when they came to fetch him off, found him lying upon the Deck all covered with Blood and Wounds, and gasping out his Soul; and they being amazed at the Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

he had made, and the Condition they found him in, endeavoured to stanch his Wounds, and applied fit Remedies to him. But all they could do or say to mitigate his Sorrows was despised by him, and he answered all their Kindnesses with Frowns and Threats; and thus living two days in the Agonies of Death, he expired. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are a valiant Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were so far from being exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this carriage of his, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced him as an <hi>Hero.</hi> The ship verified her Name at last, for being sent into <hi>Spain</hi> with 200 men on board, she perished in a storm, and all the men were drown'd: so that every way she was to them a severe <hi>REVENGE.</hi>

Thus she put a stop to the Insolence of the <hi>Londoners</hi> when they were in the greatest Rage that was possible, by the sole Authority of her Proclamation, without any Forces. She frequently <note place="margin">Her Care of the Poor.</note> issued considerable Sums of Money out of her Treasury, for the Relief of the Poor. She took a particular care that all Religious Foundations, and places built for the benefit of the Poor, should be employed to the right uses; and that the Lands and Houses belonging to them, should for ever be preserved intire to them.</p>

As she took effectual and wise Care <note place="margin">Her affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Care of the Church.</note> to heal the Wounds of the State, or Civil Government, so she well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the Diseases of the Church were to be taken into consideration too, and to be prevented with the utmost hazard of a Prince's Personal Safety: To this end she made severe Laws against the selling Livings, the Avarice of Patrons, and the Simony of Clergy-men. She detested the giving Curacies and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments to those that had no Learning. She preferred honest stout men, who were well read in Divine and Humane Literature, and well acquainted with Men, and Books, and the Times, to the Dignities of the Church, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and best endowed Livings: But on the other hand, she despised all those that had neither Virtue, nor Parts, nor Learning; but above all, the dishonest, slanderous, and crasty Knaves, who were at a catch to injure others. She compelled all that were inducted into any Benefice, to swear, That they had not given nor promised any thing to any person whatsoever, directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, on the account of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. She would not suffer any Benefice to be bought or sold; but she
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:49245:169"/>
detested the Buyer and the Seller as the worst of Plagues; and took care to exclude them from that and all other Preferments. She was never silent or unconcerned, when unworthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit men were recommended to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the Church. The most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest solicitations of the greatest of her Courtiers and Favourites, could in this case have no effect upon her; and in all other things which concerned the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Welfare of the Church, she took a Pious and Religious Care to place her Favours to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>She was a Lady of Great Beauty, of <note place="margin">Her Stature and Personal Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> a Decent Stature, and of an Excellent Shape: In her youth she was adorned with a more than usual Maiden Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty; her Skin was of pure white, and her hair of a yellow colour; her Eyes were beautiful and lively: In short, her whole Body was well made, and her Face was adorned with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and sweet Beauty and Majesty. This Beauty lasted till her Middle Age, tho it declined: In her Old Age she became deformed with Wrinkles, Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and fallen Lips; so that it was
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49245:170"/>
hard to believe she had ever had that Excellent Composure, and Lovely Beauty: But then, Time was able to make no change in her, as to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, her Princely Speech and Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; her Mind was as high, her Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as regular, and the Course of her Life the same it had ever been. She was however so displeased to see her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wear off, and her Body decline from its former Lustre, that she made her self a little ridiculous, by her taking too much notice of it. If she hapned by accident to cast her eye upon a true <hi>Looking-glass,</hi> she would be strangely <note place="margin">In her Old Age she was offended at the Decay of her Beauty.</note> transported and offended, because it did not still shew her what she had been. The Courtiers, who knew her humour, if she were to pass through any of the Ladies Chambers that waited on her, presently conveyed away all the Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glasses, and sometimes for haste broke them. To please and flatter her, they would also frequently admire her Beauty, and pretend in her greatest Age and Deformity she was still hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and lovely. She was strangely pleased to hear the Beauty of her Face, the Sweetness of her Voice, and the Majesty and Decence of her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:49245:170"/>
still admired by others: And this gave occasion to many unworthy strokes of Flattery, and examples of <note place="margin">Adulation sometimes used to her.</note> Adulation. Thus the Orators of those times would too often in their Speeches vainly commemorate and celebrate the wonderful and pleasing Beauty and Shape of their Queen, and say, The Majesty of her Countenance was not at all subject to the Injuries of Time; when their eyes told them and all that saw her, the contrary; from thence they went on sometimes to tell her, She had a Soul was worthy to Rule over the whole World; and enjoyed those Favours of Fortune, and Gifts of Nature and Art, which fitted her for the Empire of the Universe: Nor were her stately Palaces and Buildings, her noble Furniture, her fine Statues, or excellent Pictures, her great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, Virtues, or Felicity, forgotten on these occasions.</p>
            <p>The Flatteries of <hi>Learned</hi> men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">The Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> her were very base and shameful, and such as would hardly become the Stage or Theatre; for they would often apply to her that Expression of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s as spoken of her, <hi>(O Dea certe)!

               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:49245:171"/>
               <hi>this is a Goddess!</hi> And that Sentence too which <hi>Tacitus</hi> marked as the utmost pitch of a wild and boundless Assenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>(Solam D. Elizabethae mentena tantae molis capacem), That none but the Divine Soul of Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was able to sustain that Weight:</hi> By which extravagant Flatteries they would have had men think that the Name of their Queen had something of Divinity in it, and that they revered her as a Goddess which fell from Heaven. These base and pernicious Flatteries so far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported the minds of <hi>Caligula, Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and <hi>Heliogabilus,</hi> that they fell into a kind of Madness, and forgetting the frailty of their humane state, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the Stile and Honours of <hi>gods,</hi> and despised all Religions, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God. The Queen especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">She endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured at first to raise a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of her self in her Subjects.</note> in the beginning of her Reign endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to raise in the minds of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects an high opinion of her self; and to that end she shewed her self on all occasions very Civil and Obliging to the <hi>Many</hi> in her Attire, Retinue, and Carriage. She always openly profess'd that she would make it her business to employ her Estate and Fortunes in the most prudent Administration of her
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49245:171"/>
Royal Power and Authority. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <note place="margin">Which by degrees brought her to love Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</note> she did or said was by her design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to draw upon her self the Applause and Good Wills of her Subjects; and by this her Moderation and Prudence she won the Hearts, and obtained the Prailes of all men. Afterwards with the Prosperity of her Affairs, <hi>Flattery,</hi> that old haunter of the Courts of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Monarchs,</hi> under the Vizor and Mask of Diligence, Loyalty, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, gained her ear and her heart; and she was pleased to see her Parasitical Courtiers, when they had looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently on her, of sudden cast their eyes upon the ground, and craftily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seem to shake, as if their Modesty was not able to bear the Greatness of her Majesty, and the splendor of her Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Eyes. And if in their common Intercourses with her, or their Publick Addresses to her, they happened to fall into Flattery, she never corrected them for it, nor forbid these indecent and unseasonable Flatteries. She would not suffer any of her Subjects, tho Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men, to speak to her by way of Address or Business, but upon their Knees, and with great submission. The crafty men of that Age who lay in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:49245:172"/>
made great use of this Infirmity <note place="margin">Crafty men wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this her Infirmity.</note> of the Queen's, and observed not only her Words, but her Looks and Nods, and flattered her in every thing. Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Henage,</hi> a <hi>Knight,</hi> was one of these cunning Blades, who by the basest crouching Insinuations scrued himself into her good opinion, and most inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Familiarity; and by this means in her Court raised himself to a great Power and Estate. And besides him, there were many others who were not ignorant of this useful Art, tho they were inferior to him in Place, Fortune, and Fame. Tho many of her more sincere and hearty Friends advised her, <hi>Not to be imposed on by the specious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of obsequious Diligence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect;</hi> yet she was not only better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with <hi>Flattery</hi> than <hi>Truth,</hi> but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all that Liberty in her Subjects that was above this practice. A Learned man taking notice in one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons before her, That she that had been as meek <hi>as a Lamb,</hi> was become an <hi>untameable Heifer;</hi> he was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by her so soon as he came out of the Pulpit, <hi>as an over-confident man, that dishonoured his Sovereign;</hi> as in truth that was the worst Time and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:49245:172"/>
Place he could have chosen to Reprove her in. <hi>Rudd, Bishop of St. David</hi>'s, a man of great Piety and Learning, discoursing once very prudently of the many Infirmities of Old Age, so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Indignation of the Queen, that she would never after endure to hear him. Tho she was an utter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all Freedom of Speech, yet she very well knew how to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Crafty Preacher who made it his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">She under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood Preacli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Severe and Grave men.</note> 
               <hi>business to accomodate himself to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Wills of his Hearers, and a constant, severe, and grave man.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly she ever preferr'd a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and Temperate Way of Preaching, for fear her People should have been excited by such Turbulent men to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Insolence, and the minds of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser men should also have been offended. In this affair she made good use of the provident Prudence of the Bishops, <note place="margin">But curbed the Fiery, Turbulent Preachers.</note> who deprived the over-fiery spirits of the Liberty of Preaching, and put a stop to their excessive Boldness. And this was the principal Reason why none were suffercd to Preach in her times, but such as were Licensed to do so. Yet at the same time she was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of great Piety, and endowed with
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49245:173"/>
the most ardent Love of Religion; but then she did not think it was fit to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her Kingdoms to be embroiled by Seditious spirits, under the Mask and <note place="margin">She loved Religion, but hated Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Pretence of avoiding Persecution, and promoting the Service of God: And she was happy in this, that in her times those Parties that have since spread themselves over this whole Kingdom, were small and inconsiderable, and so she was under no necessity of comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them for her own safety, but could treat them as she thought fit; and perhaps if her two next immediate Successors had pursued the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods she did, there had been no Civil War in <hi>England;</hi> but whilst they sought to gratifie the Princes of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion abroad, by their Lenity to the Papists at home, the Protestant Dissenters grew up here, and if they were connived at, encreased; if they were suppressed, they turned the Envy of the Favour shewn to the Papists, upon the Government; and easily persuaded the People, that Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would be restored in <hi>England.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she consulted of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

the promoting Charity and Piety, she <note place="margin">Her Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</note> Religiously observed the stated and ap pointed Festivals of the Church, when she was present at the appointed Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Sermons, both which she heard with much Devotion and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but without the least mixture of Superstition. She ever received the <hi>Eucharist</hi> with highest Expressions of Respect, and used the Ceremonies of the Church. When she went to hear the Week day or <hi>Lent-</hi>Sermons, she was ever attended by many of, her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of both Sexes, but without, any extraordinary Splendor in her Dress or Retinue. According to the nature and circumstance of the times, she religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and devoutly listned to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons made before her; and according to the Merits of the Preachers, rarely failed to shew them her Favour, and salute and thank them before they went away. She very freely exposed <note place="margin">She exposed her Life for the Safety of the Church.</note> her Life to the utmost hazards for the preserving the Dignity and Discipline of the Church; to which end she cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her Laws against the Papists to be constantly and regularly executed; and she shewed the same Severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Obstinacy of the <hi>Protestant</hi>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:49245:174"/>
               <hi>Dissenters,</hi> whom she kept all her times under strict and sharp Restraint. I think it is not needful to shew here again to what great Perils she exposed her Life for the Preservation of the Reformed Religion.</p>
            <p>She shewed her self ever easie and <note place="margin">She humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> merciful to the People, and condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to humour them, and promote their Welfare with the utmost Humanity. By this her Clemency and Sweetness, and the Equity of her Laws, and the Proceedings on them, her Courteous Behaviour, and Obliging Speeches to them, she so intirely won their Hearts, and fixed their Affections, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Command of hers, of their own accord, and by an universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, they every year celebrated her <hi>Coronation-Day</hi> with a Religious Joy: They chearfully exposed their Lives to any Danger for her Safety; and never refused to suffer or hazard any thing, if they might but enjoy their beloved Queen. Being thus secured of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of her People, she lived plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly and securely in Peace and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and she could safely treat her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as became a Prince, when she
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49245:174"/>
was sure to be reverenced and obeyed; her Authority being supported thus by the Love and good disposition of her Subjects towards her. The People ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured some of her Ministers of State too, and very much applauded them; and upon every <hi>New-Year's Day</hi> freely made a present to them, to testifie the grateful sense they had of the Benefits they had received by their Ministry. The People of the meanest degree had ever an easie access to the Queen, and could with the utmost freedom make their Complaints to her of any Injury they had suffered from the greatest of the Nobility; so that it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to say, whether her Subjects most feared her Authority, or loved her Humanity and Courtesie. All these many and great Virtues, her Piety, the Love of her Kingdom, and the careful diligence she employed to win and keep the Affections of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, sprang from one and the same Fountain, her <hi>Prudence.</hi> This taught her how much it contributed to the Safety and Security of her State, to have her Privy Council consist of none but Wise and Faithful Men, chosen freely and prudently by her self: And
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:49245:175"/>
by the Authority and with the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of this Council, she provided for the Government of her Border-Counties and Garisons, approved men, of good Understandings, and well E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated, who were to take care to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her Kingdom from External Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, and Internal Broils; they were directed by her to take care also of whatever tended to the Welfare of her People, and to punish what was wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and disquieting; which they did, not only by the execution of good Laws, but also by the exemplary Lives they led.</p>
            <p>The Parliaments in her time were <note place="margin">Parliaments frequently held, and for the most part well tempered.</note> frequent, and well tempered; the Lower House being generally chosen of Men of good Prudence, and beloved by the people, upon the opinion of their Integrity, Fidelity, and Piety: By their Advice and Assistance the Royal Authority became more resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; and whilst they did their Duties, she as carefully observed their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and regarded their Petitions and Advices; but if at any time they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to transgress their bounds, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon her Authority, she would
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:49245:175"/>
make them soon sensible that they were her Subjects, as well in Parliament, as out of Parliament: And the truth is, those Notions and Practices which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards imbroil d this Kingdom, and injealoused some, and ruined one of her Successors, began to spring up in her time, and were only suppressed by the prudence and steadiness of the Queen, her wise Council, good Government, and the affection the People bore to her; so that it was not possible for Factious and Ambitious Men in her times to raise those Fears, or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment those Distrusts, that became so fatal afterwards. Though she was thus jealous of her own Regal and Sovereign Authority, by which she had the right of conferring Titles of Honour, administring Justice, &amp;c. yet she did little of importance without the concurrence of the <hi>Three Estates:</hi> And they never stubbornly and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally invaded the Royal Authority, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised her Commands, or resisted her Counsels and Admonitions. Whilst she was setling the methods of her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, she laid down this as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Maxim,</hi> which she had learned from the <hi>English</hi> History, and her own
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:49245:176"/>
Observation and Experience, <hi>That the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Her Maxim concerning War and Peace.</note> 
               <hi>People of</hi> England <hi>were more governable in times of War, than in times of Peace. That the common People were hardened and made valiant by War, but by too much Peace became sloathful and dissolute, and at the same time Factious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</hi> That the Nobility, if once ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numised from the Labours and Perils of War, would in Peace become expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, luxurious and effeminate. Her greater care was to know throughly the state of her Kingdoms; and those men that were intrusted by her to govern her People, whose Words and Actions she carefully observed. She carefully observed the Examples of her Royal Ancestors, the Publick Laws and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, the Manners and Inclinations of the Common People, the Names and Abilities of her Nobility, their Publick Offices, and Private Estates, the number of her Soldiers and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, her Fleets and Forts, and whatever else had been provided for the defence and safety of her Kingdoms; her Customs, Taxes, Crown-Lands, and Revenues, and the Charges and Expence she was to make; in all which she prudently and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49245:176"/>
providently altered many things for the better. She never put Arms into the <note place="margin">She would never arm the meanest of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> hands of the meanest and poorest of the People, that their wants might not prompt them to Sedition; So that the <hi>Militia</hi> in her time was generally sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the <hi>Yeomanry and richer Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> who served in their own Arms. The present Practice of imploying mean people, arose upon the multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Train Arms, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging men, which indeed has made them more numerous, but not so safe, considerable, or governable, as they were before, to the damage both of the Crown and People. She never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced any to the degree of a Peer, but <note place="margin">The Honours belonging to the Peerage, carefully gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> those that were men of worth, and whose virtue and industry had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them fit for it; and yet after all these Cautions, the number she crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted was very small. She rarely created any man <hi>a Peer</hi> upon the solicitation or recommendation of others, or for her own fancy or humour; but when any person stood Candidate for that Honour, there was an exact and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful confideration had of the Nobility of his Ancestors, the Greatness of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the Endowments of his Mind,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49245:177"/>
and the briskness of his Parts, of his Probity, Wisdom and Prudence, and of the strength and vigour of his Body, which might enable him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form some good service to the Nation. <hi>It was the rare felicity of these Times, That men were advanced to Honours without their seeking it; and sometimes against their wills, being promoted for their Virtues, not Fortunes.</hi> She chose <note place="margin">Her care in chusing good Councellors, Bishops, Judges and Ministers.</note> her Counsellors, Bishops, Judges, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Court-Officers, and her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Magistrates, on the single score of their Fidelity, Experience, Piety, Justice, Modesty, Prudence and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: That they being thus advanced, might exercise their Offices the more honourably and sincerely. She would often tell those she entrusted, That they might rest assured she would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their Integrity, Industry and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and if she found them guilty of any Injustice and Oppression, she would as certainly punish them for it. She would never entertain in her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice any Ignorant, Covetous, Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, or Light Person. She always loved Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> for his great Ingenuity and Loyalty, yet he was never admitted into the Privy Council.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49245:177"/>
When <hi>Burleigh,</hi> the Lord Treasurer, had a long time solicited her to advance his Son <hi>Robert,</hi> a Person of great Parts, to be Secretary of State; she a great while denied it, only because he was little of stature, and hunch-backed; and she thought it a dishonour to that Board, to have a deformed Person sit amongst so many Eminent and Noble Persons; and when afterwards he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Honour upon the solicitation of his Father, and his other Friends, the Nobility were highly offended at it. And when after that he was, upon the death of the Lord <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> made his Father's Assistant in the Treasury, it so far provoked the Military men, that it proved the Ruine of the <hi>Earl of Essex,</hi> and it was well it ended here. The Queen being thus provided with a Wise and Noble <hi>Council</hi> with great care and prudence, and which were highly esteemed by her People too, as well as her self, for their virtue; she chose the most learned and uprightest of the Councellors, or Lawyers, to be her Judges, only <hi>Hatton</hi> excepted.</p>
            <p>She was an exact Observer of <hi>Justice,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Her Justice, and Veracity, and Severity to Offenders.</note> which is the most resplendent of all the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49245:178"/>
Moral Virtues, and of <hi>veracity</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy</hi> to her Word, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Justice:</hi> She was extremely severe against all that broke her Laws, <hi>and punished sometimes small Offences with great severity.</hi> Though the <hi>Earl of Essex</hi> was a Person of great Fame, her particular Favourite, and had done her, and the Nation, good Services, and was the best Soldier her times bred (which were well stored with excellent Military men) yet when by the fraud of his Enemies and Flatterers, rather than his own Inclinations, he was so far transported, as to attempt to arm her Subjects against his envious Rivals, who treacherously sought his ruine; That which he expected would have turned to his advantage failing, the Queen delivered him into the hands of the common Executioner, who mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Body to that degree, that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the people that saw it, against the Hangman, and they stoned and cursed him for it, and drove him out of the City.

the space of a few years; Sir <hi>Robert Cecil,</hi> the principal Agent in it, lived longer, but at last perished too by a long Disease, attended with Ulcers, and other painful and loathsome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; and as the Story goes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Hedge in the open Fields as he was travelling on the Road.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Perrot,</hi> a <hi>Welsh</hi> Gentleman <note place="margin">Sir <hi>John Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of her Severity.</note> of great Spirit, and of much fame for his Military Exploits, and his Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the management of the Wars in <hi>Ireland;</hi> was yet of something too fierce a temper, which gave his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies too many opportunities to traduce and injure him. The <hi>Lord Chancellor Hatton</hi> was one of those who imployed Spies upon him, and they catching some Expressions that fell from him in a passion, and much improving them to his disadvantage, accused him to the Queen as one that was not well affected to Her Majesty, and that had used some Expressions which tended to her disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; for which, and his over-stiff Contumacy, he was put upon his Trial, and being found guilty, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and was imprisoned to the day of his death; suffering want,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:49245:179"/>
and nastiness of a common Goal and the uneasiness of an afflicted and dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted mind. to see himself thus in his old Age abandon'd to the malice of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by his Mistress, whom he had ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with much fidelity and courage in her Wars. His Estate also, which he had received from his Ancestors, which was considerable, and what he had gained himself, was all taken from him. The Lord <hi>Treasurer Burleigh</hi> was also suspected to have had a great share in the Contrivance of this Gentleman's Ruine.</p>
            <p>Her Severity, which she exerted in <note place="margin">Her very Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders made her the more beloved by the People.</note> punishing the Disorders and Offences of her Servants, was so far from being invidious, that it made her more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and the better thought of by all good men. She had the utmost aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for all contrived and malicious Murthers; so that she thought such Miscreants could never be treated too ill; and when she got them into her power, she would rarely shew them any mercy. Of this I will only give two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of a multitude that happened in her times, which will shorten my Work, and serve to illustrate her Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49245:179"/>
and Severity. There were two Brothers of the Family of <hi>Davers</hi> who were of the degree of Knights, and men of good Estates and Reputations, and they had a quarrel with another Gentleman of equal Birth and Estate, whose name was <hi>Long,</hi> a man of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour too; thereupon they resolved to murther him; and taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as he was going to set down to Dinner, they shot him in the breast. The <hi>Queen</hi> hearing of this Fact, was strangely enraged at it, and resolved to revenge the Villany to the utmost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree (as she ever detected all premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Assassinations) and she according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered the Law to pass against the two <hi>Daverses,</hi> and cited them to appear before her Judges to answer for it. But the two Brothers made their escape, and fled first into <hi>France;</hi> there they heard of the Insurrections in <hi>Ireland,</hi> into which Kingdom they passed, and served the Queen against her Rebel-Subjects, in hopes by some signal Acts of Valour to blot out their said Crime, and regain her Favour; And in truth they served her many years with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Fidelity and Courage against those Barbarous Rebels; yet after all,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:49245:180"/>
the <hi>Earl of Essex</hi> could not obtain their Pardon without very great difficuly, and many and repeated Solicitations. The Eldest of these two Brothers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards lost his Life in the Service of the Queen, and under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Essex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all private Suits she was observed <note place="margin">Her Justice.</note> to be a religious Observer of Justice and Equity, and to keep the Ballance even between the greatest and the meanest of her Subjects: She preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the poorest from wrongs, and made it her care that every man might enjoy what was his own, and serve the Publick with it; by the impartiality of Justice, and the equity of all Law-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, providing carefully for the preservation of Human Society, for the good of the whole Community. When any Case happened to be wrongfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, by reason of Perjury, or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, Partiality, or mistake in any of her Courts; she would upon complaint hear it her self, taking to her assistance men of the greatest Authority, and much celebrated for their exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> And when she had thus sifted it to the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:49245:180"/>
bottom, she would ever give a most just and wise Sentence, by which she made her Judges the more careful to keep within the bounds of Equity and Justice, and shewed her Subjects, that no part of her People should want the benign influence of her care and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in time of need. She always took care that her inferior Magistrates should be reverenced, and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her Council and Laws kept up? But then whatever had been injurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transacted by Bribery, or Error, in any of her Courts, she as willingly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, that Errors might not encrease and multiply by her carelesness, or the ignorance of her Judges; and that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes might not get strength by time, and plead custom. She would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also cause Cases to be heard by her other ordinary Judges after they had been determined, that she might keep the ordinary Judges in awe, and make them the more circumspect, when they were liable to have their Actions scanned over again.</p>

When some of them had wasted the <note place="margin">She was too sparing in her Rewards, especially to the Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> Estates left them by their Ancestors, and complained to her of their Poverty, beseeching her to give them wherewith
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:49245:181"/>
to pay off the Debts they had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in her Service, it is certain she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contributed any thing to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose from her <hi>Treasure,</hi> nor in the least assisted or favoured them in any thing. <hi>She sought rather to encourage and win her Generals and Nobility over to Acts of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour by her Commendations, than by the gift of Money, Lands, or Offices.</hi> In her conversation with them she would shew them much patience and affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and would frequently acknowledge how much they had obliged her by their Actions. But as to those that had lost their Lives in her Service, or done any great Action for the Safety, Liberty, and Glory of her Kingdom, she would often take occasion to speak of them with much affection and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which was the best Reward they often met with for having served her with great Iudustry and Courage.</p>
            <p>When Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Philip Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</note> of noble Birth, and honest Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, of great Parts, Learning, Virtue and Fame, had lost his life before <hi>Zut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> in the Year 1586. he was not only lamented by the whole Army in the Camp, and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:49245:182"/>
Elegies made to his Honour by the Universities of <hi>England,</hi> but he was commended also by the Court, and the Queen commanded his Body to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly interred in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church in <hi>London,</hi> which was performed with much solemnity, and a vast concourse of the Nobility, Gentry, and Citizens: And it was fit all this respect should be shewed to his Memory on the score of his Virtue, Learning and Merits, which have made him so famous in those, and all the succeeding times. This is an Honour that is more lasting, and more noble, than any Statues, or Funeral Monuments, which are often destroyed by Fire, Wars, Earthquakes, or Time; and without any of these, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lost to the knowledge of men, and themselves buried in forgetfulness; but his Books and Actions will make him admired in all times. The Magnificent Funeral of this Noble Knight was an honour to the Queen, and to the Age, and even to Learning it self. The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Leicester,</hi> who was his Unkle, was chief Mourner at his Funeral, and extoll'd the Virtue of his Nephew to Heaven, in hopes the lustre of his Pupil's Name would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:49245:182"/>
upon himself an equal commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and glory; but in truth Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> was his own Tutor, and gained all the glory he met with by his natural Endowments, and his Studies; and perhaps it was owing too in great part to the scarcity of Learning at that time, which made those that enjoyed it then, more conspicuous and regardable than they have been since, when it became more common; but then this latter neglect has made it less desired, and less aspired to, and almost wheeled us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to the same point of the Circle he was in.</p>
            <p>Nor was the Queen's Favours confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">She shewed great respect to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the meanest Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in her Service.</note> only to her <hi>Generals, and Great Men,</hi> but she would condescend to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Memory of the <hi>meanest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldier</hi> that had had the honour to spend his life in the service of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to excess. She redeemed out of Captivity those that were taken of the meaner People; and she willingly gave to their Parents, Wives and Children, that Money, and those Rewards they might justly have expected from her, if they had lived. So that she kindled in the minds of all her Subjects by her
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:49245:183"/>
bounty, kindness and beneficence, an ardent desire of Military Virtue, <hi>and in this she exceeded the most of her Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. Burleigh,</hi> though a man of great virtue and honour, too stubbornly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted the Cause of the Exchequer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Commanders of those times, and kept the Queen from shewing them that Favour, and from giving them those Rewards they had by their Virtue and Industry so well deserved; by which means he alienated from the Queen the <note place="margin">But was not liberal to the Great men, which had an ill effect.</note> hearts of many of the Nobility, who were men of great knowledge, valour, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry and fidelity, and had, with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their Lives and Limbs, procured hers, and the Nation's safety; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, in their old, Age were left in poverty to struggle with the Debts and Diseases they had contracted in her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. To this man's sordid and sparing Humour was owing the failing of all Military Virtue in the following Reigns, when men saw how rich he, and the rest of the States men, could leave their Families and Descendents; whilst those of the greatest Generals and Commanders in the Wars, were forced to be satisfied with the gilded glory of their Ancestors, but ought in
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49245:183"/>
Reason and Justice to have been at least equally rewarded, and I may say, in point of Interest too.</p>
            <p>Yet she was not over-liberal to the Gown-men and States-men in general, nor did she take any extraordinary care of them or theirs. She had learned this Lesson of her Grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIth. <hi>Not to exhaust in any case the Fountain of her Bounty,</hi> I mean the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> which was again to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited by the Spoils of the People, and unusual Taxes. That Prince by his <note place="margin">The Praises of <hi>Henry</hi> VII.</note> Virtue, Labour, Solicitude, Thrifti ness, and Provident Administration, had re-established and improved the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy, and the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Crown; and was for it much esteemed by the People of <hi>England</hi> of all degrees; his Covetous Humour having been more beneficial to the Crown, than damageable to the Body of the People, because he gave few or none of the Crown-Lands to his Followers or Servants, except when they were extorted from him by mere importunity, or he was cheated with the pretence of an advantageous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; but then he was also wont to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:49245:184"/>
give more freely the Estates of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed Criminals; so that there are many Examples in the Rolls of his Times, of men that rose by the Falls, and grew rich by the Calamities and Ruins of others. The small Gifts, and inconsiderable <hi>Largesses</hi> this Prince gave when he was possessed of so much Wealth, was a means that preserved <hi>England</hi> from Ruin, after it had been so terribly exhausted by the Civil Wars between the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> was one of the <note place="margin">Her Bounty to the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and some few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Nobility.</note> most Ancient Houses amongst the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but by the excessive Bounty and Splendor of the former Earl was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a very low and mean condition, so that the Family was no longer able to maintain its Dignity and Grandeur: And the Queen allowed that House One thousand Pound the year out of her Exchequer, that one of the most Illustrious Houses in her Kingdom might not suffer that Want which was intolerable to those of meaner Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. She also upheld Sir <hi>Edward Dyer,</hi> an old Courtier, who was become very poor, and would not suffer him to want.

But as for those <hi>Spendthrifts</hi> and Wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that had foolishly wasted their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies in Luxury and base Expences, to gratifie their Intemperance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards solicited her to bestow Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on them, she sent some of them to her Privy Council, who rejected their Petitions, and gave those Reasons for it which the Queen was not willing to give her self; and others who sought <note place="margin">And her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts.</note> by way of Reward what they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deserved, she neglected: That her Bounty might not encourage others to Luxury and imprudent Expences, whilst they relied upon the Crown for the Repair of what they had wastfully consumed.</p>

There were not many Enobled, or raised from the lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Peerage to higher, as <hi>Clinton</hi> and <hi>Howard,</hi> her <hi>Admirals</hi> at Sea, <hi>Lei cester</hi> and <hi>Warwick.</hi> She made few <hi>Barons,</hi> and amongst them, <hi>Burleigh,</hi> after he had served her many years with admirable Prudence, Fidelity, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, in many of the principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at Court.

It was not then sold by men that had easily obtained the Grant of a Blank Patent, instead

of ready Money; and took no other care, but who should give most for the Mercenary Creation; which could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dishonour the person that gave it, as well as he that bought it. In her time none but the most Worthy, the most Valiant, the most Faithful to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the most Loyal to his Prince, could hope to obtain this Favour, and raise his Name and Family.

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:49245:186"/>
and he had deserved so very well of her by his unparallel'd Care, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and Vigilance; yet because he was but a Gentleman born, and a Peer of her own Creation only, it was very long before she could persuade her self to take him into the Order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which has flourished now Three hundred years and more, and has in all times been given to the Greatest and Best of the Nobility at Home, for the best Services they could do for their Princes and Countrey; or to Foreign Princes Abroad, who were united to us by the most strict and indearing Bonds of Friendship and Interest.</p>

to keep them as much as was possible out of such men's hands. Yet she was not too hard to, or suspicious of her Servants; she extended her Favour to all those she found good men, and her Friendship and Kindness was lasting to all those she found honest, thrifty, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men; but then in Law-Suits she would not suffer any the least distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made between her Servants and Favourites, and the rest of her Subjects, lest they being exalted by it above measure, should any way endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the common Liberty of her People, or the Publick Peace and Safety.

               <hi>Francis Walsingham, Secretary of State,</hi> who was one of the Pillars of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and so intent upon the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Publick Safety, and the Discovery of the Designs of her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against her Person and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he took little care of his own private Family, and made no provision for those he left behind him: But then it was hardly well taken by the body of the Nation, to see the most part of his Inheritance sold after his death to repay those Moneys to the Treasury, which he had spent in the Queen's Service: The Envy of which, however, fell heaviest upon the <hi>Treasurer</hi> and the <hi>Earl of Leicester,</hi> who were none of his Friends whilst he lived, and took this opportunity to revenge the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts they had received from him. She <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon, Eger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Popham,</hi> but above all the Lord <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> and <hi>Howard.</hi>

of <hi>England,</hi> the Ornament of his own Family, and a strange Example of Modesty, Civility, and Liberality. These men enjoyed her Favour to the last, and were ever of great Authority with her.</p>
            <p>She loved a Prudent and Moderate <note place="margin">Her Habit in Publick and in Private.</note> Habit in her private Apartment and conversation with her ownServants; but when she appeared in Publick, she was ever richly adorn'dwith the most valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cloaths, set off again with much gold, and Jewels of inestimable Value; and on such occasions she ever wore High Shooes, that she might seem Taller than indeed she was. The first day of the Parliament she would appear in a Robe Embroidered with Pearls, the Royal Crown upon her Head, the Golden Ball in her Left-hand, and the Scepter in her Right; and as she never failed then of the loud Acclamations of her People, so she was ever pleased with it, and went to the House in a kind of Triumph, with all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of Majesty. There was at such times so great a Concourse of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to see and salute the Queen, that many were trodden down, and some have been lamed. <hi>The Royal Name</hi>

She persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all Married Women to pay a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Respect to their Husbands, as to their Superiors. She kept a severer Guard upon her own desires, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those of others that were about her; so that by degrees she made them seem at least like her self, because she ever laboured so to have them. <hi>She banished from her Court all Drunkenness, Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Immodesty, and the very fame and saspicion of Wantonness. Whoredoms, Rapes, Adulteries, and Incests, were Crimes she detested;</hi> and if she found any of her Retinue, how great soever they were, guilty of them, they must never more come before her. She ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <hi>Burgess,</hi> one of her Maids of Honour, because she had entred into an Intriegue with the <hi>Earl of Essex,</hi> who loved her very passionately; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Queen suspected she had had an hand in his Ruin: And the Lady
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:49245:189"/>
               <hi>Fitton,</hi> another of these Maids, was sent away too, for yielding to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements of a young Gentleman of Noble Birth. The Noblemen found no more favour than the Ladies, if once they were found guilty in the same kind. She sent the <hi>Earl of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> for attempting to Ravish one of her Maids of Honour, that was a Tall and Lovely Lady. If she knew any of her Nobility given to frequent Houses of ill fame, she treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with as little Respect as she did meaner men. To conclude, she shewed her self the Irreconcilable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of all that had been found guilty of any base or immodest and unchaste Action. She would frequently admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish her Servants and Attendants, <q>That they should take heed not to do any thing that might be dishonourable to her, destructive to themselves, and of ill Example to the Publick. That they should take care not to bring an Ill Report upon the Chaste, a Blot upon the Upright, or an Infamy and Dishonour upon the Good.</q>

            <p>In the Furniture of her Royal Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">Her Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> she ever affected Magnificence, and an extraordinary Splendor; she adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:49245:190"/>
the Galeties with excellent Pictures, done by the best Artists; the Walls she covered with Rich <hi>Tapistries:</hi> She was a true Lover of Jewels and Pearls, all sorts of Precious Stones, Plate, plain, Bossed of Gold and Silver, and Gilt; Rich Beds, Fine Coaches and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Carpets, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Medals, &amp;c. which she would purchase at great Prices. The Specimen of her Rich Furniture was to be seen a long time after her Death, at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> which was Moveabled, above any of the other Royal Houses in her Times; and here she had caused her Naval Victories obtained against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to be represented in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Tapistries,</hi> and laid up amongst the Richest Pieces of her Wardrobe. These things did not only please the eyes of the Spectators, and renew the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the great things atchieved in her Times, but they helped to raise in the minds of her Subjects and of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers too, a Venerable Idea of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, Wisdom, Riches, and Power of this Heroick Lady.</p>
            <p>In her Meat, Drink, and other Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishments <note place="margin">Her Diet in Publick and in Private.</note> and Refreshments, she was very Temperate, in private especially.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:49245:190"/>
She was not subject to the love of Sleep, or any of the other Pleasures of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life. She eat very little, but then she chose what was pleasant, and easie of digestion; and in her declining Age she became more Temperate than before; but then she eat whensoever she was hungry: She seldom drank above Three times at a Meal, and that was common Beer, and she very rarely drank again till Supper. She would seldom drink any Wine, for fear it should cloud her Faculties: She loved <note place="margin">Aligophore.</note> 
               <hi>Alicant</hi> Wine above any other. <hi>She al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Religiously observed the Fasting-Days.</hi> When she made any Publick Feast or Dinners for her Honour or her Pleasure, she would then order her Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be served with all the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence that was possible; and many Side-Tables to be adorned with all sorts of Plate. She had many of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which waited upon her at the Table at those times, and served her with great Care and Attention. In these things she took the greatest Pride to shew her Royal Treasures, and made her greatest Feasts when Foreign Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors were present, who were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pleased with these Shews. At these
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:49245:191"/>
times she would also have all sorts of Musick, Vocal and Instrumental; and after Dinner, Dancing; and she took care thus to entertain the most Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Persons of other Nations, that came into <hi>England.</hi> Nor was she less careful that her great Ministers of State should keep up the Tables she allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; and she would order her Nobility to keep good Hospitable Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses according to their Qualities and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. All which tended more to her Honour, and the Reputation of the Nation, than the Courses were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken up with a greater Expence.</p>
            <p>The Splendor and Magnificence of <note place="margin">The Splendor and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements of the Court.</note> the Publick Feasts in her times, and the Ceremonies that were used when the several Courses were serv'd up to the Table, would be troublesome to relate, and perhaps a little ridiculous, now they are antiquated. The Cup-bearer never presented the Cup to the Queen, but with much ceremony, and kneeled always when he gave, or took it; and during the whole Refreshment, <hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>Songs</hi> were heard, and the Queen her self would frequently dance to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour the younger Persons in her Court; for all these Solemnities were in her
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:49245:191"/>
Royal Palace, and were designed to adorn and sweeten her Government. The coming of the Duke of <hi>Alenzon</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> opened a way to a more free way of living, and relaxed very much the old severe form of Discipline: The Queen danced often then, and omitted no sort of Recreation, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Conversation, or variety of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights for his satisfaction: At the same time the plenty of good Dishes, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Wines, fragrant Ointments and Perfumes, Dances, Masques, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of rich Attires, were all taken up, and used, to shew him how much he was honoured. There were then acted Comedies and Tragedies with much cost and splendor; <hi>From whence proceeded in after-times an unrestrainable desire of frequenting these Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; so that there was afterwards a greater concourse at the Theatre, than at the Sermon.</hi> When these things had once been entertained, the Courtiers were never more to be reclaimed from them; and they could not be satiated, or wearied with them. But when <hi>Alenzon</hi> was once dismissed, and gone, the Queen her self left off these Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements, and betook her self, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:49245:192"/>
to the care of her Kingdom: And by her own Example and severe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, she as heartily endeavoured to reduce her Nobility to their old severe way of living, and the former provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent way of cloathing.</p>
            <p>In her private way of living she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <note place="margin">Her private way ofliving.</note> preferr'd her necessary Affairs, and the dispatch of what concerned the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, before, and above any Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, Recreations, and Conversation; and serious things before what was pleasing. In the morning she spent the first fruits of her time in her Closet at her Devotions, and then she betook her self to the dispatch of her Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and to the reading of Letters, and the ordering what Answers should be returned; then she considered what was fit to be brought before the Lords of the Council; she ever kept a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eye upon the Motions of <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was all her days plotting and contriving the Conquest of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the reducing all his Neighbours and the Free-States, and Cities of it, under his obedience. She ever consulted first with her wisest, and best experienced Ministers and States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of whose Fidelity, Industry and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49245:192"/>
Ability, she had formerly made good proof; and she commanded them to speak freely and plainly what was best to be done; and when she had heard the Advices of all, she chose what she thought was best. When she had thus wearied her self, and oppressed her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, she sought for rest and peace; and would either walk in a shady Garden, or pleasant Gallery, without any other Attendance, than that of a few Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men. Then she took her Coach, and passed in the sight of her People to the Neighbouring Groves and Fields, and sometimes would hunt, or hawk, spending in her Youth all her time in this change of Labour, or innocent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement. Nor was she less careful to exercise her mind in Learning, than her body by Labour; but by a wise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of her time, she consulted the good and welfare both of Body and Soul. There was scarce a day in her <note place="margin">Her Studies.</note> life, but she imployed a part of it in reading and study; sometimes before she entered upon her State-affairs, and sometimes after them; so that by this means she gained a part of every day for her self, and the improvement of her own Faculties. In her Studies she
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:49245:193"/>
mixed pleasing and serious things one with another. In the Summer she for <note place="margin">Her Summer Progress, and catriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her People in it.</note> the most part lived in the Countrey; then she took her Royal Progresses into the several Counties of <hi>England,</hi> and she would amuse her self with consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and commending the pleasantness and goodness of her Countrey, and the greatness and variety of the Fruits <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> produced; she would also admire the Wisdom and Goodness of God in diversifying the face of the Earth by the mixture of Fields, Meadows, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures and Woods; and she would, as occasion offered, hunt too. In all this she was intent upon that which was her main business, the government of her People, the management of her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of her Revenues, and the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the state and condition, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and designs of the Neighbour States and Princes; which way soever she went, she was sure to draw upon her the eyes of her People: Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crowds of them met her in all places with loud hearty Acclamations, with Countenances full of joy, and hearts equally filled with love and admiration, and this ever attended her in publick, and in private; for what sight in this
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:49245:193"/>
World can possibly please Mortals, like that of a just, beneficent, and kind Prince? So that those Places were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the most happy, in which, for the goodness of the Air, or the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness of the Fields, she was pleased to stay the longest. <hi>In her Progress she was the most easie to be approached; Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons, and Magistrates, Men and Women, Countrey people and Children, came joyfully, and without any fear, to wait upon her, and see her. Her ears were then open to the Complaints of the afflicted, and of those that had been any way injured. She would not suffer the meanest of her People to be shut out from the places where she resided, but the greatest and the least were then in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner levelled. She took with her own hand, and read with the greatest goodness the Petitions of the meanest Rusticks. And she would frequently assure them, that she would take a particular care of their Affairs; and she would ever be as good as her word.</hi> She by her Royal Authority protected those that were injured and oppressed: She punished the Fraudulent, False, Perfidious and Wicked. In all this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Affairs she was able to keep her temper, and appear with an equal and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:49245:194"/>
uninterrupted serenity and humanity to all that came nigh her; <hi>She was never seen angry with the most unseasonable, or uncourtly Approach: She was never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the most impudent or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Petitioner.</hi> There was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion to be seen in her mind, no Re-proaches, no Reprehensions came from her. Nor was there any thing in the whole course of her Reign that more won the hearts of the People, than this her wonderful facility, condescention, and the strange sweetness and pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with which she entertained all that came to her. Thus for the most part she spent her Summer.</p>
            <p>She spent her Winter in <hi>London</hi> in <note place="margin">The Winter she spent in <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> the procuring the safety of her People, and that of her Allies and Confederates. Before day every morning she heard the Petitions of those that had any business with her; and calling her Secretaries of State, and Masters of Requests, she caused the Orders of Council, Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, Patents, and all other Papers relating to the Publick, to be read, which were then depending; and gave such order in each Affair as she thought fit, which was set down in short Notes, either by her self, or her Secretaries. As
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:49245:194"/>
often as any thing happened that was difficult, she called her great and wise men to her, and proposing the diversity of Opinions, she very attentively consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and weighed on which side the strongest reason lay, ever preferring that way which seemed most to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the publick safety and welfare. When she was thus wearied with her morning work, she would take a walk, if the Sun shined, into her Garden, or otherwise in her Galleries, especially in windy or rainy Weather. She would then cause <hi>Stanhop,</hi> or Sir <hi>Henry Savill,</hi> or some other very learned Man to be called to walk with her, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain her with some learned Subject; the rest of the day she spent in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reading History, or some other Learning, with great care and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not out of ostentation, and a vain ambition of being always learning something, but out of a diligent care to enable her self thereby to live the better, and to avoid sin; and she would commonly have some Learned Man with her, or near her, to assist her; whose Labour and Industry she would well reward: Thus she spent her Winter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:49245:195"/>
In the Summer time, when she was <note place="margin">Her Diet in Summer and Winter.</note> hungry, she would eat something that was of light and easie digestion in her Chamber, with the Windows open to admit the gentle breezes of wind from the Gardens, or pleasant Hills. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times she would do this alone, but more commonly she would have her Friends with her then. When she had thus satisfied her hunger and thirst with a very moderate repast, she would rest awhile upon an <hi>Indian Couch</hi> curiously and richly covered. In the Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time she observed the same Order, but she omitted her Noon-sleep. When her day was thus spent, she went late to Supper, which was ever sparing, and very moderate. At Supper she would divert her self with her Friends and Attendance; <hi>and if they made her no anfwer, she would put them upon mirth and pleasant discourse with great civility.</hi> She would then also admit <hi>Tarleton,</hi> a famousComedian, and a pleasant Talker, and other such like men, to divert her with Stories of the Town, and the common Jests, or Accidents; but so, that they kept within the bounds of modesty and chastity. In the Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, after Supper, she would some
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:49245:195"/>
time hear a Song, or a Lesson or two plaid upon the Lute; but she would be much offended if there was any rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to any Person, any reproach or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Reflection used. <hi>Tarleton,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Her Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</note> who was then the best Comedian in <hi>England,</hi> had made a pleasant Play, and when it was acting before the Queen, he pointed at Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> and said, <hi>See the Knave commands the Queen;</hi> for which he was corrected by a Frown from the Queen; yet he had the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to add, that he was of too much, and too intolerable a power; and going on with the same liberty, he reflected on the over-great Power and Riches of the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> which was so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally applauded by all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that she thought fit for the present to bear these Reflections with a seeming unconcernedness. But yet she was so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that she forbad <hi>Tarleton,</hi> and all her Jesters, from coming near her Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being inwardly displeased with this impudent and unreasonable Liberty. She would talk with Learned Men that had travelled, in the presence of many, and ask them many Questions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Government, Customs and Discipline used abroad. She loved a
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:49245:196"/>
natural Jester, that would tell a Story pleasantly, and humour it with his Countenance, and Gesture, and Voice; but she hated all those Praters that made bold with other mens Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or defamed them. She detested, as ominous and unfortunate, all Dwarfs and Monstrous Births. She loved <hi>Little Dogs, Singing Birds, Parrots,</hi> and <hi>Apes:</hi> And when she was in private, she would recreate her self with various Discourses, a game at Chess, Dancing, or Singing. Then she would retire into her Bed-chamber, where she was attended by married Ladies of the Nobility, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioness of <hi>Winchester,</hi> then a Widow, the Countess of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Scroop</hi>'s Lady, whose Husband was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the <hi>West Marshes.</hi> She would seldom suffer any to wait upon her there, except <hi>Leicester, Hatton, Essex, Nottingham,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> who were more intimately conversant with her than anyother of theCourtiers; She frequently mixed serious things with her Jests, and her Mirth; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Festival Days, and especially in <hi>Christmas-</hi>time, she would play at <hi>Cards</hi> and <hi>Tables,</hi> which was one of her usual Pastimes; and if at any time she hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:49245:196"/>
to win, she would be sure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Money. When she found her self sleepy, she would take her leave of them that were present with much kindness and gravity, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take her to her rest; some Lady of good quality, and of her intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, always lying in the same Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And besides her Guards, that were always upon Duty, there was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Good Quality, and some others, up in the next Chamber, who were to wake her in case any thing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary happened.</p>
            <p>Though she was endowed with all <note place="margin">She was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently angry.</note> the Goods of Nature and Fortune, and adorned with all those things which are valuable, and to be desired; yet there were some things in her that were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of amendment; nor was there ever any Mortal, whose Virtues were not eclipsed by the neigbourhood of some Vices or Imperfections. She was subject to be vehemently transported with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and when she was so, she would shew it by her Voice, her Countenance, and her Hand. She would chide her familiar Servants so loud, that they that stood afar off, might sometimes hear her Voice. And it was reported, that for
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:49245:197"/>
small Offences she would strike her Maids of Honour with her hand; but then her Anger was short, and very innocent, and she learned from <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon's Book, Of the Institution of Cyrus,</hi> the method of curbing and correcting this unruly and uneasie Passion. And when her Friends acknowledged their Offences, and humbly begged her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, she with an appeased mind easily forgave them many things.</p>
            <p>She was also of an Opinion, That Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity <note place="margin">Her Severity, and especially to the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </note> was safe, and too much Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency was destructive, and therefore in her Punishments and Justice she was the more severe. The worst thing that she did in all her Reign, was her treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by her own Subjects driven into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile, and not only deprived of her Regal Authority, but of her Liberty, her Estate, and her Treasures; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poor and distressed into <hi>England</hi> upon the Queen's promise and faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, she at first kindly and hospitably received and entertained her; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confined her, and at last, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence that the Queen of the <hi>Scots</hi> was plotting against her, put her upon her trial, condemned, and at last execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:49245:197"/>
her, making her a sad, and unheard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Example of her cruel and unjust Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. Thus she polluted her happy Reign with the Innocent Blood, not of an Enemy, but of a Guest: The memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of old Disgusts and Injuries prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more upon the mind of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> than the dignity of a Sovereign Queen, the Intercession of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princes, the Laws of Hospitality, the Tears of a Captive, and a Kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; so that no Intercession, no Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications could take any place in a mind inexorably bent upon Revenge. They that would excuse this mournful Action, pretend the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was only confined to prevent mischief; but she entering into a Conspiracy against the Queen of <hi>England</hi> in her own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and her Designs against the Life and Throne of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being thus detected, there was no other way left to preserve the Life, and consult the safety of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but by the punishment of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and others, who had conspired to destroy her. That all Precautions were in vain, and therefore it was absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to cut off this Guest, though her Cousin, and the next Heir after her of

the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and one, that by her deprivation of her Kingdom, and her Imprisonment in <hi>England,</hi> was deprived of all means to hurt her. If she would have taken the right method to secure her self, she should have released her Captive, and have sent her away, which would have cut off the Causes, and the Pretences of these Conspiracies, and have tended more to her honour and peace, than the way she took. This Execution of the Queen of the <hi>Scots</hi> raised in the minds of the Neighbour Princes an enraged Indignation. And she her self, when she knew the Fact was done, and could not be recalled, deplored the <hi>united and common Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all the Foreign Princes with many tears, and gave many signs of her inward grief, laying the blame of this wicked action wholly upon the Actors; and upon every men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the death of the Queen of</hi> Scots, <hi>she would to her dying day weep bitterly, and lament her misfortune in it.</hi> So great was the force of her Repentance, tho it came too late, and was altogether useless.</p>
            <p>It was thought she brought <hi>Leicester</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Her Severity to Leicester and <hi>Hatton.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Hatton,</hi> two of her greatest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, to their Graves, by her hard usages, and the many Indignities she
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:49245:198"/>
put upon them. <hi>Leicester</hi> had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, by attempting to imbroil the Affairs of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> to that end he had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his Soldiers to live very irregular, and without almost any Military Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline, and this in a State the most closely united to her; and he had am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiously affected the Power of a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant·General in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> which <hi>Burleigh</hi> represented to the Queen as intolerable; and thereupon she became so incensed against him, that she brought him to a Despondence of Mind, which ended in his Death; the Queen declining all Reconciliation, that he might be an Example to all others to consult their own and the Publick Interest better than he had done, and not aspire like him to too great and dangerous Honours. Upon this Repulse he resolved to retire into the Countrey, and to live remote from the Court, at <hi>Killingnorth;</hi> but on the Road he fell into a violent Feavet, which brought him to his Grave. He left a Brother behind him, who was Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and had the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a good man from his Enemies; and he succeeded him in the Estate,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:49245:199"/>
but did not long enjoy it. He left also a Son who laid Claim afterwards to the Earldom of <hi>Leicester,</hi> but he was then very young, and not owned as Legitimate. When the Queen heard of the Death of <hi>Leicester,</hi> she could not forbear grieving at it: She ordered, however, his Personal Estate to be sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed for Money due to the Exchequer from the deceased Earl; but she got lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by it, the Creditors and others by various Stratagems, and on various Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, drawing it out again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hatton</hi> was a very good Dancer, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hatton</hi>'s Death.</note> that was his best Qualification, and was the means of promoting him to be <hi>Lord Chancellor of England.</hi> Being in that high and undeserved Station, he became proud and arrogant, and at last began to favour the Popish Party more than the Queen thought well of. The Queen thereupon told him, That he was too much exalted by the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his Fortune, which had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in a Station for which he was unfit, he being ignorant of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery-Law, and needing the Assistance of others to enable him to do his Duty. This Reproach struck him to the heart, and he resolved to admit no Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:49245:199"/>
When he was almost half-dead, the Queen repented of her Severity, and went her self in Person to comfort the Dying Chancellor, and did what was possible to retrieve him; but it was all to no purpose, for he was obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolved to dye. His Brother's Son succeeded him in his Estates and Goods, (he dying a Batchellor) and raised a Family upon this Foundation; and the Queen did not exact from him the Debts due to the Exchequer, whether out of Respect to the Deceased, or Favour to the Lord Treasurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> whose Niece this Gentleman had Married.</p>
            <p>As the Queen was by Nature severe, <note place="margin">The Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations she met with were many and great.</note> so she did not want the utmost Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to exert her Natural Temper: For there was in all her Reign a Chain of Conspiracies detected, which were so outragious and wicked, that they exceeded by their Cruelty and bruitish Ferity all measures, and seemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and call for Severity in her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of them; she was also exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Rebellions and Insurrections in both her Kingdoms, and by most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Libels published without any Author's Name, against the Cruelty of this Prince, with the Infamy of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:49245:200"/>
them that writ these Books. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Cruelty would not fix upon her, tho they did what was possible to defame her, because all men thought the Actors and Leaders in these horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treasons and Rebellions, deserved all the Punishments and Severities she inflicted on them for their Crimes. However it is apparent, That in her Reign many of the Nobility were put to Death, some of the most Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies were ruined, and that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-</hi>Catholicks were punished, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or forced to flye into Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to escape those Punishments they had drawn upon themselves by their restless endeavours to undermine her Throne, and subvert her Government, or to destroy her Person. After all, some of these Papists, out of a spirit of Slander and Detraction, and a desire to gratifie the Pope and his Party, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured by all ways that they could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, to have her thought a Cruel and a Bloody Princess, and with the utmost Impudence represented her as such in their Pamphlets, tho she was forced to this Severity by their great and repeated Villanies.</p>
            <p>There were some that with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>susserable
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:49245:200"/>
Rashness charged her with <note place="margin">The Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who defamed her.</note> Unchastity: The principal of which was <hi>Nicholas Sanders,</hi> one of the basest and wickedest Slanderers, and of the most hellish and incurable Malice that ever was born. This Fellow forgot all Modesty, and not content with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming her Mother, and the reviving all those Slanders against her, which had before his time been sufficiently detected and disproved, or were forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he went on to slander and defame the Queen too; and to that end invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very many lewd Stories, and most infamous Satyrs against her and her Ministers, endeavouring to have the World believe she was guilty of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, villanous Lusts, and intolerable Frauds for the Subversion of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Nation. But the Modesty and the incredible Chastity of her Life, easily dispelled all these black and noisom Slanders and Reproaches; her worst Enemies having never been able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the least shadow of Luxury or Unchastity in all her Life; which was so pure and so spotless and unblamable, that it is very hard to believe she was a Mortal. This her rare Temperance and Continence put a stop to the Lyes
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:49245:201"/>
and Defamations of this abominable Slanderer, and made all men despise him and his Writings. Nor did he so escape the Justice of God, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued him for this and his other Crimes, and before his Death deprived him of his Reason and Understanding, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing him from the Conversation of men, he perished in a desolate place in <hi>Ireland,</hi> after he had a long time strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Hunger and Cold, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to preserve himself alive with the Roots of the Herbs that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally grew in those Woods he lurked in; nor was there one Friend to cover his Carkass with a little earth after he was dead, but it was found by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> in the Woods, and left a Prey to the Wild Beasts; all men rejoicing that the Justice of God had thus fhewn it self in the Punishment of this infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Slanderer, and Impenitent Rebel.</p>
            <p>Another virulent Slanderer printed <note place="margin">Dydimus Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus.</note> a Book, under the Title of <hi>Dydimus Veridicus,</hi> being infected with the same contagious distemper of Lying, and presumed to pollute the ears of men with most wicked Difcourses, and to attempt the Ruin of the Fame of a most Noble Princess, which was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:49245:201"/>
by the united Approbation and Praises of Mankind. He invented ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny absurd, false, and incredible things, that were like the fained Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Poets and Painters, so that they appear false at first sight, and only serve to shew the liberty he took of Lying notoriously; so that he may be left without any answer, to receive his Confutation from the Prudence of the Reader.</p>

them to be burnt: And she extended this her Severity to all Rumors and Reports that were spread abroad under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, for fear her People should by these means be excited to Rebellions or Seditions.</p>

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:49245:203"/>
they saw the muttering Discontents of her Physicians, and considered seriously the uncertainty of the Event which might follow this Sickness of Body and Mind, and the Imbecility of human Nature, they became anxious, and most earnestly besought her, That she would curb this Disturbance and Grief of her mind; that she would for the present not fill her mind with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Learned men against the Fears of Death, tho they had the shew of Wisdom; that she would consult her own Reason, and endeavour the Preservation of her Life, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of her former Health: That she would not encrease her Danger by Despondency, or her Distemper by her Obstinacy against all Medicines; but that she would be pleased to yield to the Perswasions of her Physicians, and follow their Advices, Eat, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to overcome her inward grief with Patience: Lastly, That she would be pleased to value and endeavour to preserve her own Life, and deliver her Loyal and Faithful Servants, Nobility, and Subjects, from that Anxiety and Sorrow that now oppressed them. She made no other Answer to all this Wise
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:49245:203"/>
and Loyal Advice, but <hi>That she was full satiated with this present Life, and now</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Her last Words to her Council.</note> 
               <hi>desired nothing more than to be translated to a state of Immortality, and to make her escape out of this dark and disordered state of human Affairs. That</hi> Death, <hi>which many so much abhorred, was only the payment of a Debt due to Nature; and that our Spirits were of right to be restored to God from whom they came.</hi> Thus her Body by slow degrees consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med away, and she became very Lean, Weak, and Faint. Yet after all, her Mind was more afflicted than her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; <hi>She was night and day troubled with a sorrowful Remembrance of the late exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Earl of</hi> Essex. The Grief of her Mind was encreased by the Necessity of her Affairs, which compell'd her to yield to <hi>Tyrone,</hi> not only his Life and Liberty, and the Pardon of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions and Perfidy, but a great part of his Estate; which she esteemed a kind of rewarding him for his Treasons and Perjuries.</p>
            <p>Her Sorrows were every day increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">She nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.</note> and made more insupportable, by the Melancholy Humour which then abounded in her Blood, and the restless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her Mind; so that all her Strength being exhausted, and her
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:49245:204"/>
Mind, which was filled with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contributing more and more to the Disease, she seemed to decline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace by the Weakness which augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every day, yet she bore this her last Sickness with a wonderful Constancy and Patience, which alone deserved ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Commendation. When some of the principal Nobility of <hi>England, the Lord Admiral, the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and one of the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State,</hi> in the Name and by the Order of the Privy Council, told her Majesty, That it was their humble Request, That she would, if not for her own sake, yet for the good of her People, throw off that load of Grief which oppressed her, and lay aside the Resolution of dying: That if she should happen to dye by the course of Nature, in the present Circumstances of Affairs, it would bring Ruin upon <hi>England:</hi> That they had no hopes of any Prosperity after her Death, unless the Certainty of the Succession were fixed by her. If she should leave this to be determined after her Death, in that flagrant desire men had of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sovereignty, there might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ill things be done and suffered, which would augment the Sorrows of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:49245:204"/>
her People for the loss of so good a Prince: Therefore they most earnestly, and with one Voice, and united Tears and Sighs intreated her, That in her present Circumstances she would take care of the Common Safety of her People after her Death; and that she would be pleased to remember, That so many of the Lives of her Subjects would be exposed to the utmost hazard if she died without Naming her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor. To which she lovingly and modestly replied, <hi>That if she died of this sickness, the Kingdom would not want a Defender, but would be in the same state of quiet. Nottingham, the Lord Admiral</hi> replied, <hi>Whom do your Majesty mean?</hi> She looking thereupon steadily on all that were then present, said, I mean <hi>James King Of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>my Dearest Kinsman, and the Right Heir to</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> VIIth. This cheared all that were present, and she persisted constantly in this to her last Breath, That he was her undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heir.</p>
            <p>When she had said this, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <note place="margin">She spent the last Moments of her Life wholly in Devotion.</note> her Name and Memory to her Nobility, she cast off all the Cares of this Life, and betook her self wholly to the acts of Piety and Devotion; she
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:49245:205"/>
sent also for the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> a Learned, Pious, and Moderate Prelate, who was then the Guide of her Conscience, and whose Salutary Advices she always much esteemed and gladly embraced. When this great and good man came to her, he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished her to consider the Imperfection of the Human Nature, and therefore advised her to place all her Hopes in the Merits of Christ. She replied with some <note place="margin">Her last Words to the Archbishop.</note> difficulty of breathing or speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>she was weary of this misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Life, which was subject to so many Calamities and Dangers:</hi> That <hi>from her Soul she desired to pass to that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Light which overflowed with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Felicity; and was hastning to her Heavenly Countrey, to the Presence of her good Saviour, and into his holy Arms.</hi> When the Bishop had ended his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and holy Exhortation, she turned her a little, and laying her Head upon her Right Arm, she composed her self as it were to her Last Long Sleep, with a Quiet Mind, and a Composed Countenance; nor were her Last Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unlike the rest of her Life, but it appeared by the motions of her Hand and Eyes, that they were spent in the acts of Devotion and Mental Prayer.
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:49245:205"/>
Thus being at last wholly spent, she quietly yielded up her Soul to God, the <note place="margin">And her Death.</note> 
               <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> about Midnight, in the year of our Lord 1602. in her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and in the same Chamber <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIth. her Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father died in. She called this Royal Palace the Warm Box to which she could best trust her sickly Old Age; and she was now come hither to avoid the over-sharp Winter. She was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle less than Seventy years of Age, and she had Reigned Forty four Years, Four Months, and Seven Days. Thus died this Illustrious Queen, which was not only the Greatest and the Best Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the times in which she lived, but equal, if not superior, to any of her Predecessors, in the Majesty of her Name, or the Reverence that was paid to her by her Subjects and Neighbours; in the Art of Governing; in all the commendable Qualities of a Prince, such as Council, Policy, Magnanimity in Misfortunes, Moderation and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in Prosperity, Constancy in her Behaviour, Maxims, Friendship, and Resolutions; and accordingly the Glory that followed her, and the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her Reign was Incomparable. She was lamented by them that then
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:49245:206"/>
lived, with an unfeigned and an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible Grief; and the Memory of her Virtue, Learning, and Piety, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained fresh and flourishing in all the following Times, and shall do so for ever. Her Words and Actions are in truth such as will render her Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Honourable, be the Abilities of the Historians that shall truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the same what they will.</p>
            <p>So soon as it was known that she <note place="margin">The Sorrow for her Death.</note> was dead, the Court was filled with the Lamentations and sorrowful Sighs and Tears of her Courtiers and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as for the greatest Loss that ever befel any men. There was never any where a greater, a sincerer, a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolable Grief, than that which then took possession of this Royal Palace; nothing could stop the torrent of their Tears, nothing could appease or soften their bitter Complaints. The Noble Ladies which by the Order of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-Council were appointed to take Care of her Body, were scarce able to bear the load of their Sorrows which oppressed them, but lifted up their Hands and Eyes to Heaven, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the Mercy of God in this their Desolations and Affliction; concluding, without his powerful Assistance, and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:49245:206"/>
favourable Interposition, <hi>This Night</hi> would prove fatal to the <hi>English</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that nothing less than the Ruin of the Kingdom, could be the consequence of so great and so deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Loss as this. The Countess of <hi>Warwick,</hi> a Lady of great Honour, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Piety, Sanctity, and intirely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Queen, testified her sorrow for the loss of her Mistress in all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of an inconsolable Affliction, and would never be induced to put off that mourning Habit she had put on upon this occasion. She performed all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices belonging to the Sepulture of the Queen with the utmost care, piery and fidelity, and by her Example taught all the rest of the Queen's Servants how they ought to behave themselves in this Mournful Affair. Those of the Noblemen who were present at the time of her death, expressed their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in silent tears, and a deep, but grave sorrow. The meanest of her Servants were more noisy in their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, and that Court became in a few hours a desolate place, very few induring to stay in that place in which they had lost their good Mistress, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent Sovereign, and their great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:49245:207"/>
When Report had once spread the News of her Death in the City of <hi>London,</hi> an incredible Sorrow and Lamentation both of the Citizens and Strangers was observed, which spread it self to all the Neighbour Nations, as the fame of her Death was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them. But none more heartily deplored this loss than the <hi>HOLLANDERS,</hi> who were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deprived of the <hi>Author of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; the Defender of their Liberty, and the Preserver of their Peace and Safety.</hi> A Prince she was, that would refuse no Labour, no Expence, no Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, how great soever it were, that the <hi>Protestants</hi> might live in peace, and enjoy their Liberty; and this and the many good Offices she had done to them and all the Neighbour Nations, had made her Name so venerable, that it was no easie Task for the Magistrates at home, or abroad, to keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People in any bounds in this their outragious Sorrows; for almost all that heard it were of Opinion, That worse Times would follow, and that many and great Calamities would ensue in <hi>England,</hi> and all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations.</p>
