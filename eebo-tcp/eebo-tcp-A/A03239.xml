            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Enerous Reader, thou hear'st my charge, and I come to present my selfe to thy viewe, like a Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bill, pitifully complaining. The reason is, because I am turn'd out, like a masterles man, without Patron, or Mecaenas to counta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance mee, much misery I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, meerely for my names-sake: For is he that hath a bad name is said to be halfe hang'd, what may I hope for then, when mine is so abominable; Notwithstanding, if my condition had accorded with my Title. I might have had Incouragers enough, and too many; but when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood my nature and my name were directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites (For many who were loath to have me follow them publikly in the streetes, would have beene glad to have hugg'd me in their private Chambers) I then was left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, both of pitty and patronage: For instance; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented my service to a great Favourite in the Court, who when hee apprehended that my comming was, rather to plucke up, then plant the Vine, and to condemne, not countenance the vice, he bit the lip, contracted the brow, and made me this answere: <hi>And would'st thou barre me from drinking healths to the Prince whom I serue? the Lords whom I honour? and my Mistris whom I love?</hi> So with a looke able to sowre the next draught before he swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, left me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4263:4"/>From the Court I tooke my progresse into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where hearing of a Noble house-keeper, who kept liberall hospitalitie (not common in these dayes) I ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred my seruice to him, who generously excused himselfe thus. <hi>Friend, would'st thou have mee now close-handed, and to set a pad-locke upon my Buttery hatch; If my seruants bee freely entertained in other great mens Sellers? Shall I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid their followers to drinke drunke in mine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From him I went to an old Country Lawyer, his next Neighbour, who presently clapt his spectacles on his nose, and reading my inside, with my Title (in a great chollar, which swell'd up his ruffe as hie, as his veluet cap) said, <hi>Hence from my doores thou imposture, which art not what thou seemest, were it not for such of thy name, who quarrell in their cups, how should I doe for clients to maintaine my estate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neere unto the Lawyer, dwelt a Farmer: I descended so low, as to offer my selfe to him, telling him my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and qualitie, he replied in a furie, <hi>How then shall I pay my Land-lord? were it not for Drunkards, I should sow no more Barley, so might the Malt-men starue, and I perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having such cold comfort in the Countrey, I then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to come up to <hi>London</hi> with the Carryer. The first Inne wee came unto, I open'd my selfe to mine Host (a Iollie Corpulent fellow, and a boone Companion) who at the very motion, first stamped, then staring, he began at length to be starke mad, saying aloud; <hi>Who then shall keepe my guests vp all night? call in for drinke? and put them to unnecessary charges? how shall my Tapster live? or I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fire in thy Kitchin? As good perswade me to cut downe my signe-post: For thinkest thou, that I can eate and drinke hay and water, with the Horses?</hi> Much adoe I had to get lodging there that night, but with condition, to be gone thence by the day breake in the morning. At length I came to the Citie, and hoping to have beene entertain'd by one of the Sheriffes, I found the Seargeants and Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ready to beate their siluer Flagons about mine eares.
<pb facs="tcp:4263:4"/>

               <p>Of this cursed (I may say) most contagious sinne (for commonly, one drunkard infecteth another) heare what the wise man, King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> saith, <hi>Proverb.</hi> 23. Keepe not company with drunkards, nor with gluttons, for the glutton, and the drunkard shall be poore, and the sleeper shall be clothed with raggs: To whom is woe? To whom is sorrow: To whom is strife: To whom is mourning? To whom is wounds without cause? And to whom is the rednesse of the eyes? Even to thee that tarryest long at the Wine, to them that seeke mixt wine; looke not then upon the <hi>Wine</hi> when it is red, and when it sheweth his colour in the cup, or goeth downe pleasantly; In the end thereof, it will bite like a serpent, and hurt like a Cockatrice: Thine eyes shall looke upon strange Women, and thine heart shall

speake lewd things, and thou shalt be as one that sleeps in the midst of the sea, and as he that sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the top of the Mast. They have stricken me (shalt thou say) but I was not sicke; they have beaten me, but I knew not when I awoke, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I seeke it yet still, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 3, 4. <hi>Take heede to your selues, least at any time your hearts bee oppressed with furfets and drunkennesse, and cares of this life, least that day come on you at unawares, for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take therefore the Counsell of <hi>Boethius</hi> the Christian Philosopher and Poet, who speaketh thus: Then necessitie impells to a sober and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right life, when wee apprehend and consider, that all our actions, how private soever, are visible to him that shall judge them; Neither ought wee to delay the amending of our lives, or correcting of our manners, for as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Dat penitenti veniam, fortasse non dabit peccanti penitentiam. i.</hi> Hee that gives pardon to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinner, will not perhaps give repentance to him that sinneth, for there is no man who drinks to day, that can presume to lift the cup to his head to morrow.</p>
               <p>If lavish cups be not permitted to Kings and Princes, how much lesse to common men: Heare what the Wise-man saith, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 31. 4. It is not for Kings (<hi>Oh Lemuel</hi>) It is not for Kings to drinke Wine, nor for Princes strong drinke, least he drinke, and so forget the decree, and

change the judgement of all the children of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. To you therefore I speake (who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together given over to this sinne) hated of God, and abhorred of all good men,) which St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> 5. 17. <hi>And be not drunke with Wine, wherein is excesse, but bee satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore speake unto God, as if men did heare us: And live amongst men, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God seeth us, whose eyes peirce into the secrets of the prison, into the corners of the hearts, into the hiddennesse of time, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealednesse of Eternitie: For not to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but to him that is offended, doth God grant pardon, saith Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi>

man, <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Temperance.</hi> Let us then be swaid by <hi>Leo Pap.</hi> who tells us that wee ought all to labour (by the Almighties Grace and helpe, that he may in His owne Temple, which is our bodies, find nothing that may be offensive to the eyes of so Divine a Majestie, but let the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and habitation of our hearts be cleane swept from all vices, and furnished with Vertues, keeping them still shut and lock't, against the Temptations of the devill, but alwayes open to receive our Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Thus I conclude, beseeching the Almighty, that as our Nation being the most forward to commit this grievous and abominable sinne of drunkennesse, so it may be the first to expresse a true Repentance, and contrition for the same, that his heavy Iudgements, long threaten'd, and now impending, may be turned from us, which hee grant for His mercy sake, and Merits of His Sonne our blessed Saviour.</p>
