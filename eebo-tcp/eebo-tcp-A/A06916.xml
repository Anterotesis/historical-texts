            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Amblers, to chuse for Stallion a Ienet of Spaine, or an
Irish Hobbie: and for him that will bréede Runners, a
Barbarie or a Turke. Of these I well allow, for they bée
good, albeit the Ienet is not so fitte for that purpose: for
though he be of high pride and comely shape, yet be theyr
paces weake and vncertaine, especially theyr ambles, in

vncertainly.</p>
            <p>Nowe to come to the true Stallion, who for hys braue
trotte, and pure vertue of valure in the Fielde, is a staine to
all other Horses: whose comely and easie amble, may be
an eternall instruction to all Aldermens Hackneyes, howe
to rocke theyr Maisters into a sound sleepe, whose wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

               </gap>es, who
by nature hath all things perfect, nothing defectiue: him I
hold a fitte Stallion to breede on, and a fitte beast for hys
Maister to hazard his life on, and thys is onely the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
of Arabia. A Courser I tearme him, because once hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
on an olde writing of a Muncks, written in parche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
about the méeting of <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Hector,</hi> writ that
<hi>Achilles</hi> rode on an Arabian Courser.</p>
            <p>Thys Horse of Arabia, is of a reasonable stature, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

hys chyne a handfull broade and more, hys buttocke long,
vpright and cleane, the sterne of hys tayle, welnie so small
as a mans finger, but in strength beyond any other Horse,
the hayre thereon so thinne as is possible: hys legges are
small and cleane, hauing no hayre on his fetlocke, his body

that it is not possible almost in any parte of him but his
mane and tayle, to catch holde to pull of one hayre. The
collour of that Arabian which I haue séene, and which is
euen now vnder mine hands, is a most delicate bay, whom
if you viewe in the Sunne, you will iudge him eyther like
changeable Satine or cloth of God.</p>
            <p>Thys Arabian is of nature milde and gentle to hys
Ryder and Keeper, but to strangers most cruell: they will
byte like Mastifes, if you offer to strike them, they will
runne open mouthed at you like a dogge, and the more you
strike, the more they will byte, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that haue trauailed in those Countreyes, they ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
lyue till fifty and thréescore yéeres.</p>
            <p>Thys Horse for a Stallion is peerelesse, for hee hath in
him the puritie and vertue of all other Horses. They bée so
excellent for trauaile, that thys Arabian (of which I haue
the ryding) beeing trauaild from a parte of Arabia called
<hi>Angelica</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and from thence to the higher-most
partes of Germanie by lande, and so by Sea to
Englande, yet was hee so couragious and lyuely, (hauing
no fleshe on his backe) that by no meanes hée coulde bée
ruled.</p>
            <p>Hauing gotten your selfe a Stallion of thys Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
being young and lustie, which commonlie are the best,
or for want of such, (because they bee rare,) one of those
which I haue before mencioned, I woulde wishe you thus

March till midde May following: for before and after those
<pb facs="tcp:8345:7"/>
tymes I doe not allow the couering of Mares. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap>
hauing newly changed, and finding your Mare readie for
the Horse, which you shall know by her running too and fro,
and by her pride, or els by proouing her with some badde

hauing beene in the soile a wéeke at least, put him to her, and
let hym abide with her all night, and in the morning when
the Sunne is vp take him from her, and feede him well ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in like manner, and thus d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> for three or foure dayes
together, prouided alwaies that you kéepe your Mare du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that time from any meate, vnlesse it be a handfull or

couer all your Mares, and you shall finde no way more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
surer, nor safer.</p>
            <p>It may séeme in me a poynt of no lesse absurdity then
arrogancie, to sette downe this peremptory resolution, of
couering of Mares, when <hi>Xenophon, Vegetius, Grison,</hi>
and all our English writers, haue concluded and set downe
precepts for the couering of Mares to be abroade, and that
the Stallion should run with them in open places, to which
opinion I am cleane oposite. If therefore my reasons and
practise shall be found in equall ballance with theyr former
iudgements, I doubt not but the censures of the wiser, will
allow me, though the ignorant carpe at my wrytings.</p>
            <p>My first reason therfore is, that that Horse whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that he is of a gentle or good disposition, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
dull, heauy and weake nature: neither can hee be a true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian
Neapolitan, nor of any good strayne, for no Horse
of good courage (much more they) will be kept but within
<pb facs="tcp:8345:7"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> which they can by no meanes looke, and
euery one that wil endeuour himselfe to bréede a good horse,
cannot haue a wald ground, but were it so that euery one
had a wald ground, yet shall you finde many inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
First, (for I haue noted it) many yéeres if your Mares
be in lust or pride, you shall be in venture to haue neuer a
Colt-foale, for your Horse being hote and at liberty, in two
or three of the first dayes hee will so disorderly spende him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
both on the Mares and for want of foode, (for Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
will neuer eate much amongst Mares) that beeing
weake &amp; the Mares in pride, they will be so much too strong
for him in conception, that you shall bréed only Fillies.</p>
            <p>Againe, running amongst your Mares, some will bée
ready, some vnready, in so much that the Horse being cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious,
hee will couer the ready Mare so oft, that those

it is the nature and propertie of the Arabians and Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans,

be drawne from them, and they themselues haue libertie to
feede without eyther trauell or working, they will grow so
grosse, that by reason of theyr extreame fatnes, the Matrixe
or place of conception will be so straitned, that they will ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not at all holde to the Horse, or holding, bring foorth
but small foales. And thus much haue I thought good to
write, as touching your grounds to bréede on, the choyse of
your Mares and Stallion, the ordering of them both, and
the bringing vp of your young Foales. For other thinges
which I haue omitted, as touching the speciall markes of
Horses, theyr complexion and colours, theyr sundry kinds,
their natures &amp; dispositions, I refer you to <hi>Grison</hi> or <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauill,</hi>
who of those things haue writ sufficiently.</p>
            <p>It resteth therefore that I speake as touching the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of your Foales, which I woulde wishe in this order.
Your Foales hauing run with your Mares the space of a
yeere, or within a Moneth, in somuch that they are readie
to foale againe, I would wish you to draw them from their
Dams, and lock them in some close house for a night: then
in the morning to take them, and to giue each of them two
or thrée slippes of Sauen, and so to let them rest two or thrée
houres after: this Sauen is a most soueraigne Medicine
for the wormes, which will be most aboundant in young
Foales, insomuch that if they haue not present remedie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the first drawing from their Dammes, they will many
times suddainly drop away and die.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus doone, I would haue you to put them in
the Close for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> purpose before prescribed, where they may
runne vntill they shall be found fit for the saddle, prouided
alwaies, that they bee neither within the sight or hearing
of theyr Dammes for a weeke and more, nor that your filly
Foales be suffered to runne with your Coltes, but be kept
in seuerall.</p>

it were good you driue them vppe into
some close house, where hauing good strength
of men, you may haulter them, which I would wish to bée
doone with all the gentlenes and quiet meanes that may be.
When your Colt is once haultered, then offer to leade him
forth into some Courte or Close, where when he comes,
there is no doubt but (n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which when he couets to doo, suffer him euen as far as your
chase haulter will giue him leaue, and then with a good
strength euen in his running or leaping, giue him such a
twitch backe, that you make his necke ready to cracke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
or els plucke him vpon his buttocks, and faile not
but as oft as he striues to breake away, so oft doo you pluck
him backe with these suddaine straynes and twitches, the
commoditie whereof is this.</p>
            <p>If he be a Horse of a thicke, short and strong fore-hand,
and withall of wilfull and haughty courage, this strayning
and ouer-maistering him in the haulter, will make him so
plyant of his necke and so tender of his head, that (fearing
the like correction) he will neyther offer to breake from his
Kéeper when he shall leade him, nor indanger his Ryder,
with that villainous quallity of running away. Moreouer,
this manner of conquering him with the haulter, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

hys Ryder shall finde him so obedient to his hande, that hée
shall place his head where he list, and in one wéekes tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
rule the Colt how he list.</p>
            <p>But if he be a sullen Iade that wil neither run nor leape,
but onely hang backe, then let some standers by with long
poles or goades beate him and prick him, till you make him
leade vppe and downe gently, not forgetting but to make
much and cherrish him, when you shall finde him obedient
and plyant to your will. This doone, let him be sette vp in

suddaine motions, and violent furies, that makes Horses
learne to strike, to byte, to starte at the saddle, to refuse the

let it rubbe his shoulder, then his side, then his buttocke,
and so by degrées set it on his backe, not failing to set it on
and take it off many times ere you let it rest: alwaies che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing

            <p>When it is so seated on his backe, then let one on the

one while clapping, another while shaking the saddle, tyll
you finde in the Colte a carelesse regard of the noyse, &amp; that
he wil neither shrinke nor stirre for any thing you doo about
him. Then take a Trench or watring Snaffle, but the
Trench I rather preferre, and annoynt it with Honny and
Salte, then put it in the Coltes mouth, casting the raynes
thereof ouer the Saddle pomell: yet in any case not so strait
as eyther it may draw in the Colts heade, or force hym to
striue against it, but let it lye in his mouth, that hee may
worke and play vpon it at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>In this sort let him be trimd euery day for the space of a

time gette gently into the Saddle, and seate your selfe qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
without moouing or stirring. Place your body vpright,
your eyes betwéene his eares, your legs straight out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
spurres, and your rodde vpright by your shoulder, least
if you should hold it low before his eyes, it might breede in
him some affright or amazement, which were a grosse error
in a Horses first backing.</p>
            <p>Beeing thus mounted &amp; well placed, let his Kéeper offer
to leade him forward gently, which if hee doe quietly, (as
there is no doubt but he will) then let the Kéeper lay off his
hand, and let his Rider mildly put him forward, not coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to haue him kéepe any one way or forrowe, but suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Colte to goe as himselfe shall best like, sometimes
ouer-thwart, some-times endwaies, or as hee shall bée
disposed: obseruing this rule alwaies, to carry a gentle vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
hand of the Colte, neither so hard that it may by anie
meanes either mooue stay in hym, or force him to finde
faulte at the correction, or writhe his mouth or necke: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so slacke, that he may eyther winne the head of you to
put it betwéene his fore-legges, which they will most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
couet, or make proffer to runne away by reason of
too great libertie, which to the best Horses is most natural.
Therefore I say, carry a gentle hande, so as you may haue
a féeling of the Colte, and the Colte no more but a perfect
say of your hand, vnlesse extreamity compel you. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the hand is the onely instrument, and chiefe guide to
bring a Horse to his perfection, I will before I goe anie
further, shew both the vse of the hande in the first backing,
and also the carrying of the raynes.</p>
            <p>Béeing seated in your Saddle as is before mencioned,
take the rayne of your bridle and folde the one side ouer the
other, making each side both of an euen length, &amp; so short,
that you may haue the Colts head at commaundment, then
lay on both your hands, the one a handfull distant from the
other, and doo not draw your hands to the Saddle pomell,
or plucke them close in to your body, but place them ouer
<pb facs="tcp:8345:11"/>
the midst of his crest, pulling his head still vpwarde and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft,
not drawing it in as to bring him to an vniformitie of
rayne, for that shal be but a marring of his mouth, and the
first rule to bring a comely fore-hand to an euill show: but
as I said, lift your hands still vpwarde, suffering them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to goe and come with easie motions, onely to thys
end, that you may gather vppe his necke to the vttermost
height, that arte or nature wil by any meanes suffer it.</p>
            <p>Nowe forasmuch as some Horses, haue naturallie such
good fore-hands and such comely raynes, that the Ryder
néedeth little labour and lesse arte, as for example, hee that
hath a long large vpright necke, a wide chaule and a dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
mouth, othersome so imperfectly framde by nature, that
though the Ryder vse extreame industry and much arte, yet
if he haue not the very ground and absolute knowledge of
horsemanship, he shall neuer bring him to staiednes, comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or good show, as those which be short neckt, narrowe
chauld, thicke headed, and deade mouthed. And sith these
contraries, must haue contrary meanes to bring them to
theyr perfections, because lenity to him that is dul and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berne,
will from a little, bring him to iust nothing dooing,
and cruelty to him that is frée, apt and couragious, is the
hie way not onely to marre him, but also to kill him: and
because the onely arte of ryding, consisteth in the making of
a comely, staied, and well fashiond rayne, I will héere set
downe the manner, howe they ought both kindes of them
to be trayned and taught, drawing all the natures, disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and vmors of Horses, into these two heades or bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Dulnesse and Freenesse.</p>
            <p>Under thys worde dulnesse, I conclude such as be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
naturd, slow, vnapt, churlish, alwaies crauing correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
restie and forgetfull: vnder this worde fréenes, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
those that be light, nimble, couragious, apt, that wil
catch a lesson from his Rider ere it be fully taught him, and
is alwaies readie for more then can be put vnto him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will beginne first (because they aske more labour
<pb facs="tcp:8345:12"/>
and arte) with those kinde of Horses which I tearmed dul.
Hauing backt your Horse as is before prescribed, and made
him to receiue you off and on at your pleasure, which may
be doone in a day or two, then enter into the nature and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Horse, (which who so cannot finde, let hym
neyther professe nor expect to be a Horseman,) then finding
him to be of nature dull and vntowarde, neyther apt to
proude pace nor rayne, in any case neyther offer him lesson
nor Ring, but beeing mounted on his backe, and hauing
pausde &amp; setled your selfe, thrust him out into a good round
trotte, the length of twenty or forty score, all the way with
your hands working vp his heade aloft: and then offer to
stoppe hym, by drawing in your hand more firme and hard
then you were wont in the working vppe of his heade, at
which if he offer to thrust downe his head, and wil not stay,
thrust him forward as farre againe, and then offer him the
stoppe, prouided alwaies you keepe him in a swift trotte,
in which if he prooue slothfull, as no doubt but he will, then
reuiue hym with a sharpe rodde, with your voyce, and with
the ierting of your legges and bodie forward at once.</p>
            <p>If at the second offer, he refuse to yéeld in his heade or
stoppe, then at hym the thirde tyme, the fourth and the fift,
till you haue trotted him a myle or somewhat more: then
turne him homeward, and exercise him after the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which peraduenture will the first day nothing at all
preuaile with him, but be you carelesse, &amp; in any case stryue
not with hym, or séeke by strong hand to ouercome him, for
so you shall marre hys mouth, teache hym manie knauish
qualities, and no more make his heade mooue then a great
Oake: but take hym out the second day, and then trot hym
foorth two miles, and alwaies in twelue score, sixe score, or
twenty score, as you find your grounde or féele your Horse,
offer him the stop, which if he refuse, meruaile not, but take
him out the third day, the 4. and 5. increasing his trauel as
his daies increase. And if you find in him an ability of body
and strength, to which you must haue great respect, &amp; onely
<pb facs="tcp:8345:12"/>
an vntoward stubbernes and vnaptnes, hinders what you
goe about, then spare not to labor him two or thrée houres
together about the fieldes, til by this your labor &amp; toyle you
make him yéeld to your hand, which you shal no sooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
but immediatly make much of him, cherrish him, light
from his back, and giue him grasse or greene corne if there
be any néere you: and faile not but exercise him thus for a
weeke or a fortnight, in which space you may make him so
well acquainted with your hand, that when soeuer you shal
but straine your bridle rayne, he will yéeld and stop at your
pleasure. It may be the first day you trot him forth, you shal
finde him of such a gentle mouth, that at the first proffer hee
will stop, yet couet to haue his head betwéene his legs, and
trot but slouenly and like a Iade: which if he doo, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> looke
what trauell I prescribed you for the stop, imploy the selfe
same, onely to the raysing vp of his head, to the bringing of
him to lightnes, to a fayre trotte and forwardnesse of way,
which no meane that euer I tryed or saw, wil so soone bring
to passe as thys.</p>
            <p>When you haue brought him to this perfection that
he will yéeld to your hand, carry his heade aloft, and trotte
forth both lightly and fréely: then shall you endeuour (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
gotten his necke to his vttermost height,) to bring
downe his nose and mussell, that it may rest vpon his thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and so haue a perfect, staied and gallant rayne, which
you shal doo in this manner: being mounted vpon his back
and hauing pausde a space, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> draw vp your hand, at which
if he offer to yéeld or goe back, then thrust your legs out stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

it slack, then let some footeman standing by draw it straiter,
yet in any case not too strait, but so as the Horse may rest
vppon it and no more, then trot him forth into some graueld
earth or newe plowed grounde, but the graueld earth I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

as you did before, obseruing for your left hande your left
rayne and your right leg, then will your large Ring haue
two whole Ringes within the same, as thys figure follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sheweth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:13"/>
               <figure/>
Then on your right hand walke him other thrée times,
(because you must holde it for a generall rule in horsman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe,
alwaies to end on that hande you begunne) and so
trotte him straight forward twenty yards, and there stoppe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
him and cherrish him: which doone, drawe in both your
hands euen together, and make him goe backe a pace or
two, which if he refuse to doo, then ease your handes, &amp; pull
them in againe so gently as may be, neuer ceassing, but let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome and goe till he yéeld and goe backe, which
I am sure he will instantly doo, vnlesse he be a wonderfull
vnruly and restie Iade: which if he be, then must you haue
a foote-man to stande by, who with a cudgell beating him
vpon the nose, and you with your rod beating hym vpon his
fore-legges, enforce him perforce to goe backe, which when
hee dooth, immediatly cherrish him, and then taking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
enough for feare of making him weake neckt, turne
him about, and downe the same furrowe pace him to the
Ring againe, where you may exercise him in his lesson as
<pb facs="tcp:8345:14"/>
you did before. In this manner would I haue you for foure
or fiue daies to practise your Horse, not suffering him to
trot or gallop, but onely to pace, to stop, and goe backe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
alwaies a speciall regarde to kéepe your Martingale
stiffe, that by little and little you may win in his head, tyll
you haue it in that place you desire, where when it is, then
stay, and in any case drawe your Martingale no straigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Nowe when by this your trauaile, you haue brought
your Horse that he will willingly pace this Ring, &amp; make
his change within, on both hands without compulsion, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
may you well aduenture to trotte him in the same, making
him doo it with spirite and nimblenes: prouided alwaies
that if you find him vnwilling to make his changes on both
hands within the Ring, and that he rather couets to mooue
his necke and heade then his body, all which shoulde goe
euen, &amp; equally together, then make your changes in this
manner.</p>
            <p>When you would haue him turne on your right hand,
draw your left rayne straight, and so hold it, then moouing
gently your right hand rayne, lay the calue of your left leg
close to his side, &amp; with your rod on his left shoulder, make
him come in on your right hand as your selfe would, and so
likewise for your left hande vse the like contrary meanes,
which when you haue found by experience to preuaile, and
that by this meanes and exercise, he will both pace and trot
this Ring with good courage, (which you must chéefely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,)
and that he wil make his stop close and well, and at
the motion of your hande retire, which in one Monethes
practise (at the most) you may at ease performe, then shall
it be requisite you teach him to galloppe the same Ring in
this sort.</p>
            <p>First when you come into the fielde, as I haue before
prescribed, gently pace him about your Ring, that he may
thereby know about what hee goeth, then put him to hys
trotte, and force him to trotte it with great life, still thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb facs="tcp:8345:14"/>
him forward with your féete and body, till you make
him gallop, then hauing gallopt a stroke or two, drawe in
your hand, and make him but trotte againe: then hauing
trotted awhile, make him gallop somewhat more then hée
did before, and then trotte, and thus increase your gallop
by little and little, as first a stroke or two, then halfe the
Ring, then thrée parts, and at length all the Ring rounde
about, but by no meanes for a day or two let him galloppe
your changes.</p>
            <p>And note heere, that although I sette you downe this
abrupt manner of beginning to gallop, yet neuerthelesse, in
this as in the rest, you must obserue your three times on a
hand, as to pace once about, to trotte once, and gallop once,
or to pace the one halfe of the Ring, trotte the other, gallop
an other, and then pace againe, as your owne discretion
shall moue you, till you finde in your Horse (through thys
maner of instruction) such a readines, that but moouing ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your legge, body, rodde or voice, he will instantly take
his galloppe: which being perceiued, as no doubt but you
shall within thrée or foure daies ryding, then may you take
this order.</p>
            <p>When you begin in the morning, first pace him thrice
about your Ring on your right hand, and then changing doo
as much on your left hand, then change againe, and trotte
thrise on your right hand, and thrise on your left, then gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
thrice on your right hand, thrice on your left, and thrice
on your right hand againe, then gallop straight forth-right
forty yardes or more, and there, by drawing in your hand
euen, firme, and at leysure, make him stoppe and stand stil
awhile, then put him backe two or thrée paces, and let him
stande still without moouing for a good space, neyther doe
you your selfe eyther stirre your legges or bodie, but onely
with your hand, voyce, and the bigge ende of your rodde,
clawe him and make much of him, thereby to encourage
him in hys well dooing: And after this sorte and manner
(as I haue heere prescribed) woulde I haue you exercise,
<pb facs="tcp:8345:15"/>
him for three weekes or a Moneth, if you finde him dull or
vntowarde.</p>
            <p>Now, for that sundry obseruations are to be obserued
in this lesson, I will so farre digresse from my purpose, as
first to let you vnderstand them. Note therefore that in this
lesson as in all other, you must haue an especiall regard that
your Horse carry a gallant rayne, his head round and lofty,
without eyther thrusting his nose out like a Pigge, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his heade betwéene his legges like a fearefull Beare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelpe,
which you shall not bring to passe by haling or pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at his mouth, but by kéeping his Martingale stiffe, and
by feeding his mouth with a gentle hand, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> alwaies comes
and goes with swéete motions. Note that when you gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
him on your right hande, if hee eyther come not in so
round as you would haue him, or if hee throwe his hinder
parts out of the Ring, as many Horses will, that then you
correct him, by beating him on the flancke on the lefte side,
with the in side of your left legge, which if it preu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e not,
then with your spurre strike him, and with your rod on his
left buttock: which will in once or twice going about, make
hym gladde to kéepe hys Ring: and so for the other hande,
vse the like meane on the other side.</p>
            <p>Note that when you make your changes on eyther
hand, in which you draw your Horse into a straight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
that than you pull your bridle raines more straight
then before: and putting the calues of your legges close to
your Horse sides, you ierte them forwarde againe with a
good strength, not ceassing but so to doo, till you come again
into your large Ring, the effect whereof is this: the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the calues of your legges to your Horses sides, will
in hys galloppe make him rayse vppe his fore-parts, and
then the ier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of your legges forward, will so put on your
Horse, that not staying, his hinder legges will followe hys
fore-legges in such comely sorte, that as if hee were taught
to beate an artificiall turne, euen with such nimblenesse,
strength, and comely grace will he make his changes: and
<pb facs="tcp:8345:15"/>
and by this meanes, when hee shall be taught to make hys
turnes, you shall find him more apt, ready, and a thousand
times more frée from any manner of vice belonging to that
lesson.</p>
            <p>Therefore in this, vse great labour and dilligence, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in keeping iust time with your legge and hand, for
if either your legge and hand goe so very fast, that the horse
cannot keepe time with you, or if your motions be so slow,
that the Horse must stay for you, or if in stedde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> calue
of your legge you giue the spurre, then be you assured, you
doo not make but marre, for as the one dooth help, the other
doth correct: and the difference betwixt them, who cannot
iudge.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse, if the Horse be dull and stubberne, of
which king I most intreate, for in them is the depth of arte
to be tryed, and that you find the calue of your legge wil not
quicken him, then it shall be néedfull that you vse the euen
stroke of both your spurres, which hauing reuiued him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vse the calues of your legges, and as oft as he waxeth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
and dull, so oft vse your spurres and rodde, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
in this lesson. Note that when you galloppe your
Horse forth-right in the euen forrowe to giue him his stop,
that a little space before you stoppe him, you thrust him out
with more force and courage then before, that thereby in
the stoppe he may couch his hinder loynes the closer, and
make his stoppe more firme and comely. Note that if in
the stoppe he will not couch his hinder loynes, but will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
trust to his fore-legges, which is both vnsure and
vnseemely, that then you chuse such a péece of earth to ryde
vpon, as your euen forrowe may be desending downe the
knole of some hil, where in the deepest descent, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
alwaies to make your Horse stoppe, by which means
you shal both make him to yéeld his hinder parts, and also
if the ground where by chaunce you shall ride him, he loose
and vncertaine, rather then the wil ouer-shoote his ground,
he will stop vpon his buttocks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:16"/>Note that when you make your Horse goe backe, if hée
thrust his hinder parts out of the furrow and goe crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that then with the calue of your legge on that side which
he swarueth on, you correct him, in which if he persist, then
vse your rodde, yet but in gentle sort, and some-times your
spurre, and that but seldome.</p>
            <p>After thus your Horse can pace, trotte, and gallop your
Ring, and make his stoppe in good sort, which be well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
hee dooth perfectly and readily, ere you offer him any
newe lesson, it shall be necessarie that for a grace, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of what hee dooth, that then you teach him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
before: which as it dooth adorne, so dooth it carrie
great profite and commoditie, and therefore you may bring
him vnto it in this manner. Ryde him into some beaten
hie-way which is eyther grauell or sandie, and there trotte
him forward a dozen yardes or there about, and then make
him stoppe, and in the stopping, giue him the calues of both
your legges euen together, and also your voyce, by letting
your tongue parte sharplie from the roofe of your mouth,
together with the noyse of your rodde shaken in your hand:
which at the first will peraduenture but moue in your horse
a stamaring or amazement, but be you carelesse, and trotte
him forward againe as farre as you did before, and there
offer him the like stoppe, and the like motions, at which if
he refuse to aduaunce, and offer to runne backe, then thrust
him forward with your legs, and solicite him till you make
him take vp but one of his legs, which when you perceiue,
immediatly cherrish him, and let him pause a space, then
trotte him forwarde, and doo as you did before, continuing
this manner, till you finde your Horse vnderstandeth your
meaning.</p>
            <p>But what for want of vse and nimblenesse hee will not
performe, or doo it according to your minde, when this you
finde, which you shall perceiue by his lifting vp of one leg,
or by aduancing of both vpon compulsion or great correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then shal you labor him in this lesson, alwaies correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:8345:16"/>
him when he is vntoward, and cherrishing him when
he giueth any shew of likelihoode to performe your will, till
such time that you haue made him, that he will vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of your leg to his side, aduaunce himselfe before, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his head in his true place, and taking his legs vp euen
together, in such sort as the true arte of horsmanshippe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p>When thus hee will aduance, then shall you exercise
him to stoppe vpon foot-pace, and to aduaunce withall, after
that, vpon his trotte both slow and swift, to stoppe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce:
and lastly, vpon his gallop to stop and aduaunce.
Now for such notes and obseruations, as are to be obserued
during the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> teaching of thys, I will heere sette down. First
note that when you stoppe your Horse, and compell him to
aduaunce, that you doo not hang vpon his mouth, or presse
it too sore, for that is the ready way to spoyle all, and make
him runne away, but onely carry such a gentle firme hand,
as may no more but stay him from pressing forwarde, nay
let your hand be such, that hee may rather haue libertie to
presse forward a pace or two, then by your extreame pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of him, that he may haue his mouth duld: and by that
meanes, not onely winne the head from you, but be as new
to begin, as if he had neuer beene haultred.</p>
            <p>Note, that if he chaunce (béeing at the first ignorant of
your meaning,) to presse forwarde two or thrée paces, that
then you make him retire and goe backe, iust so much as he
went forward, that thereby he may know hee did offende,
and therefore after adread to doo the like.</p>
            <p>Note, that if in a dayes ryding or two, ne thrée, you
can not bring him to that perfection you woulde, that then
you be not discouraged, but continue your labour, for those
Horses that are the slowest of conceite, and hardest to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
theyr Ryders meaning, béeing once brought to
know what they must doo, are alwaies the surest holders,
and euer after, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfectest performers of any lesson, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:17"/>Note, that if he eyther aduaunce too hie, or when you
would not haue him, as the best mettald Horses most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
will doe, that then with a good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udgell you beate him
vpon the fore-legges, or with the great ende of your rodde,
betweene the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ares correct him, and vndoubtedly he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
that abuse.</p>
            <p>Note, that after he will aduaunce perfectly and in order,
that then in euery stoppe when you make him aduaunce,
that you make him doo it twice, thrice, and sometimes foure
times together, without intermission, and then to stande
still, the profite whereof you shall find, when you come to
teach your Horse to doo the <hi>Coruett capriole,</hi> and such like
salts of pleasure, to which thys is the perfect path-way and
guide.</p>
            <p>Now for asmuch as I am in matters of seruice, I will
follow that purpose, and heereafter come to things of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
When your Horse can absolutely well doo all these
lessons before mencioned, which by continuall trauell, vse,
and exercise, you must bring him vnto, for in any case you
must offer no newe lesson till the olde be most perfect, least
by making a confusion in the Horses sence, and for want of
true conceite and vnderstanding, he be brought to doo iust
nothing, as many vnskilfull Horsemen doo at this day, who
will striue to make their Horses gallop their Ringes, stop,
turne, aduaunce, goe backe, and all in one morning: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
considering, that a Horse is a beast, whose capacity can
conceiue no more then a beast, which absurdity I wish the
wiser sort to eschew.</p>
            <p>Hauing therefore as I said, your Horse perfect in these
lessons, especially that he will gallop the Ring before speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
which Ring in effect, containeth all other Ringes vsed
by our English Ryders: yet neuerthelesse, I woulde haue
you practise your Horse in one other Ring more, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
as touching the making of a Horse ready and perfect, it
hath no more vertue then the former, and that what Horse
soeuer can gallop the first, must of force consequently with
<pb facs="tcp:8345:17"/>
more ease gallop this, yet for because this in seruice is in
daily and hourely vse, as well in charging and anoying the
Enemie, as in safe-garding the Riders person from shotte,
or such like mischiefes, I will heere set it downe as a lesson
as needfull as any other whatsoeuer, tearming it by the
tytle of gallopping the fielde, the figure whereof is this.<figure/>
            </p>
            <p>The manner of bringing your Horse to doo thys lesson,
is thus, first marke out vpon your right hande in a fayre
foote-pace, a Ring of a reasonable sise, being about a three
yardes ouer euery way, then another on your left hand ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the former, and so making your Ringes still for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
make a third on your right hand againe, which done,
put your Horse into his galloppe, and as you did pace the
Ringes, so let him gallop them backe againe: and then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him straight forwarde twentie or forty yardes, make
your stop and aduauncement, thus would I haue you eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
morning when you bring your Horse foorth, to teache
him.</p>
            <p>After you haue trotted and gallopt your Ring first of all
mentioned, finding him of sufficient strength and ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>e,
after some little rest and ease, let him galloppe these latter
Ringes, which I tearme gallopping the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>lde. And note
that for any certaine number of turnes in this lesson<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other certaintie what soeuer (saue the carrying of hys
head, which must alwaie kéepe his true place in al lessons,)
there is none to be respected, but all to be referd to the Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb facs="tcp:8345:18"/>
discretion. Therefore the Ryder must haue a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
that in this lesson hee put not the Horse beyonde hys
strength, or force him to gallop, longer then he shall find the
Horse of himselfe willing to presse forward: for if he be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-toyld,
and brought to a wearin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and sloth, he will not
onely learne to prooue restie, but also béeing young and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
put foorth splynts, spauens, ring-bones, and such lyke
foule diseases to bring him to lamenes.</p>
            <p>Note that for any vice incident to this lesson, (if the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
haue him perfect in the former,) there is none, because
in effect, these Rings and the former Ring is all one, saue
that these be in a larger manner, which is more easie: and
in the first, is a certaine order and method to be vsed, and in
these none, but onely a confusion, yet a care of true tyme
keeping. Note, that when your Horse can perfectly wel gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
the fielde, that then you shall not neede to exercise him
in it aboue once in a wéeke.</p>
            <p>Now hauing thus farre continued my purpose, I will
consequently forward to the other lessons, in which there is
more arte, and great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r curio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tie. And first of all, hauing
your Horse perfect in these lessons before prescribed, you
shall then teach him to turne readily on both hands, and for
that there be sundry manner of turnes, as some strayte,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> large, some close, some loftie, I will shew you howe
to bring your Horse to doo them all perfectly. First therfore,
you shall teach your Horse to make that turne which wée
tearme (not hauing any apt English word) <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ncauallare,</hi> to
lappe one thing ouer another.</p>
            <p>Thys kinde of turne, is the ground of all other turnes,
and by it, the rest are attained to with more ease: this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of turne, is to kéepe your Horses hinder parts firme in
a place, and make him come about with his fore-partes,
lapping his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> fore-legge ouer his inmost as hee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
in this sort. Trotte your Horse straight downe some
euen furrow, and there stoppe him, and stande still awhile,
then drawing vp your bridle rayne somewhat firme, yéelde
<pb facs="tcp:8345:18"/>
your bridle hand a little, but so little as may be, towardes
your right side, then with the calue of your legge on his left
side, and your rodde on his left shoulder, make him (so stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
without any larger compasse, to turne his fore-parts
that way which his hinder parts were, which if he doo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
cherrish him: and then making that halfe cirkle a
complete round one, sette him as hee stoode before. Thus
as you did on your right hande, doo so likewise on your left,
vsing the like helpes with your right legge, and your r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dde
on his right shoulder, then cherrish him, and so dooing the
like on your right hand againe, that you may ende where
you begunne, light from his backe, and giue him a handfull
of grasse if there be any neere you.</p>
            <p>So walking him vp and downe a while for his ease,
you may take his backe againe, and doo as you did before,
increasing still his turnes, as you see him increase in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectnesse
and willingnes, till such time as you haue him so
readie, as vpon the motion of your legge and hand, he will
flie about so swiftly &amp; so oft, as you shall eyther offer or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
Now for obseruations and notes in this lesson, these be
they: first you shall vnderstande when you offer hym thys
lesson, if he refuse vpon the moouing of your legge and hand
to turne, and will couet to reare, or doo such like dysorderly
acts, that then vpon the first proffer of such disorder, you doo
but slacke the raynes of your bridle, and with your hande
vppon his crest kéepe him downe, offering him againe to
turne, which if neuerthelesse hee will not, then drawe the
right side raine somewhat straiter, then the left, yet in any
case, not so much that his head may goe a hayre breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his body, but moue altogether, at which if he make any
stick, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with your rod on his left shoulder, giue him a good
iert that may make him stir, and doubt not but he will then
turne, which when he offers, immediatly followe him with
your hand and leg til he haue gone halfe about, where you
may then pause to cherrish him. Note furthermore, that
if hee refuse to mooue his fore-partes and offer to come
<pb facs="tcp:8345:19"/>
about with his hinder, that then you méete his hinder parts
so moouing, with your rodde, and vpon his buttocke correct
him, making him keepe his hinder parts firme and fast: if
your rodde be not a correction sufficient, then may you vse
sometimes your spurre in his flancke, both which, if you
finde preuaile not, then must you cause him to pace out a
little narrow ring, not aboue a yarde, or a yard and a halfe
ouer-thwarte, which you must make him treade one while
on one hand, another while on another, sometimes by the
space of a quarter of an houre, sometimes more: and lette
him doo it continually on his foote-pace, and not on his trot.
Thys shall bring him to great lightnes on his fore-parts,
and make him repose such trust to his hinder, that you shal
bring him vnto the <hi>incauallare,</hi> as your selfe would wish or
desire.</p>
            <p>Note that if he doo it willingly on the right hand, and not
without compulsion on the left, that then you alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
and end on your left hand, as you did before on your
right. Note that when you turne him on your right hand,
if he doo not bring his left legge ouer his right, but bringes
it sometimes short, sometimes vnder, and so foorth ilfauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly,
that for such offence you vse no other correction but
still to labour him the more in this lesson: for by such labor
he shall come to vnderstand his faulte, and by the knocking
of one of his legges vppon another, correct himselfe enough
for that vice.</p>
            <p>Note that the more hee lappeth his outmost legge ouer
his inmost, the better and more comely shall his turne be.
Note that the more you follow him in his turne with your
hand and legge, the further you compell him to lap hys legs
one ouer another. When therefore your Horse can set thys
close turne vpon the ground, both swiftly and in perfection,
then shal you procéede to teach him beate a large ring turne
loftily, which at this day amongst our English Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
is most in vse, and it is to be doone in this manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:19"/>You must pace out a little narrow Ring, some 4. yardes
or there abouts in compasse, and vse to walke your Horse in
the same, vntill such time that you perceiue him so readie,
that he will pace it willingly, carrying his head and bodie
both firme together, not offering to flie out, or vse any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
motion: which when you find, then shal you as you
walke him about the Ring, on your right hande, with your
voyce and calue of your left legge, and with drawing your
bridle rayne a little more firme, cause him to aduaunce,
which so soone as he dooth, immediatly by the thrusting of
both your legs forward againe, make him pace forward as
he did before, and in his pacing cherrish him, that hee may
vnderstand he did your will: then hauing so paced awhile,
make him aduaunce againe, &amp; doe in all thinges as you dyd
before. Thus may you doo thrée or 4. times on your right
hand, and then make the like Ring on your left hande, and
with the helpe of your right leg, doo in this as in the other,
not forgetting to make your ending on your right hand, as
you did in other lessons. But by the way note this, that in
any case you doo not end vpon your aduauncement, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his pace or trotte, for if you doe, you shall bring him to
a restie qualitie, that vpon his aduauncement he will stand
still, whether you will or no. When he will therefore pace
this Ring, and with the helpe of your legge, aduaunce and
goe forward, then shall you as soone as he hath aduaunced
and gone a steppe forward, make him aduaunce again, and
so pace the Ring about, and doo the like at your second go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about, which if he doo in good order, you shal then cherish
him, but not stand still, for in this lesson, horses wil couet to
stand &amp; be slothful. When this is perfect, then make him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance,
and goe a step or two forwarde, three or foure times
together, increasing this lesson still by degrées, till through
your daily labor &amp; vse, you bring your horse to that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that as you couch your leg to his side, so wil he aduance,
and as you thrust forwarde your legges, so will he follow
with hys hynder legges euen together, beating the Ring
<pb facs="tcp:8345:20"/>
with such aduauncements round about, both so oft, so large
and so straite as your selfe wil, still kéeping that tyme with
his legges and body, that you doo with your legs and hand.
And this knowe, that the chéefest arte and grace in horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,
is true time kéeping.</p>
            <p>Note that in this lesson, if the Ryder be discréete, and
will take time and leysure with his Horse, there will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
no vice, vnlesse it be such as are before specified in the
former lessons, together with corrections due to the same.
But if the Ryder be an vnskilfull man, which will force his
Horse to doe that in a day, which shoulde aske a fortnights
labour, then be you sure there will happen more mischiefes
in this one lesson, then in all the other mencioned before, as
restinesse, running away, writhing his heade awry, check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the bridle, and such like: the least of which will aske
a Monethes worke to reclaime them. And sith they come
rather through the vnk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lfulnes of the man, then eyther the
vntowardnesse or badde disposition of the beast, I will
heere omit them, meaning to treate thereof in another
place.</p>
            <p>Note that this turne, of all other turnes is most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
most gallant, and most assured and strong, both for
man &amp; Horse, it is most in vse in seruice, especially in that
manner of fight, which our Englishe Souldiers tearme
fighting at the croope. Note, that if in thys turne you finde
your Horse at any time slothfull, or that he wil leaue before
you would haue him, that for such offence, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se the euen
stroke of both your spurres, and a little to checke him in the
mouth with your bridle hand, which is a present helpe: yet
would I not haue you vse it oft, but at some speciall tymes,
when other corrections faile.</p>
            <p>Héere could I spende a great deale of wast paper, and
more idle time, in telling you of sundry other turnes, and in
distinguishing of halfe turnes from whole turnes, &amp; whole
turnes from double turnes: héere could I speake of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> turne
which <hi>Grison</hi> calleth <hi>Volta raddoppiata<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> also of that which
<pb facs="tcp:8345:20"/>
he calleth <hi>Lacrambetta,</hi> and our English Riders <hi>Chambet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
and when I haue doone, conclude of nothing els but that
which I haue before sette downe, for why all commeth but
to that end and perfection. Therefore sith they be so need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
I will let them passe, and come to those other lessons
which are fit for a Horse to learne, and are founde most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in seruice.</p>
            <p>Hauing your Horse perfect in what is before expressed,
you shall then teach him to manage truly, iust and well: I
neede not héere to interprete vnto you, the signification of
this worde manage, neither howe néedfull a lesson it is in
seruice, because both are sufficiently doone, in another more
absolute Author. Of manages there he thrée kindes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
with halfe rest, manage with whole rest, manage
without rest: for the two former kindes of manages, I
find no reason why a man should bestow any particuler la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to traine his Horse onely vnto them, sith they be of no
such vse as the last is, neither doo they carry the like grace
that it doth. And for mine owne part, sith I vse them but as
introductions or guides to the latter, and sith euery Horse
that can manage without rest, can manage eyther wyth
halfe rest or whole rest, I will heere conclude them all three
in one, vnder the tytle of managing without rest.</p>
            <p>To make your Horse therefore to manage perfectly and
well, you shall take thys order: beeing come into some
graueld hie way, of breadth sufficient for a large Ring, and
long enough for a managing course, you shall first on your
right hande pace out a Ring, containing the circuite of ten
or twelue yardes compasse: hauing markt that out so as
you may sufficiently discerne it, pace then your Horse
straight forward, some fortie or fiftie yardes, and there on
your left hande, marke out another Ring of lyke compasse
to the first, according to the manner and order of thys fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:21"/>
               <figure/>
Thys doone, put your Horse into his trot, and make him
trot downe your euen furrow to your first Ring, at which
when he comes, make him stop &amp; aduance, and then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
vpon his aduaunce, thrust him forward, &amp; make him
trot about your right hand Ring, then trot downe the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to your left Ring, at which when you come, first stop
and aduance, and then trot about the Ring, and so backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
not suffering your Horse by any meane to stande or
stick vpon his aduancement, but presently to goe forwarde
withall.</p>
            <p>In this sorte exercise your Horse two or thrée dayes,
after which time, I woulde haue you when your horse hath
trotted your Ring about, to put him into a gentle galloppe,
and to gallop down the straight furrow to the other Ring,
where, vpon your gallop make him stop and aduance, and
then trot the other Ring about, and to gallop backe againe,
stopping, aduauncing, and trotting about the Ring. After
he will doe this perfectly, you shall then make him, hauing
gallopt downe the furrow and made his stop and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to gallop the Ringes also, in which I woulde haue
you exercise him a weeke at the least.</p>
            <p>Thys weekes exercise, will bring your Horse to such
perfectnes, that he wil doo all this of himselfe, without any
helpe of his Rider: that beeing perceiued by you, you may
then safely aduenture to bring those your Ringes into a
more straite and narrowe compasse, according to the forme
of thys figure following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:21"/>
               <figure/>
Euery day making them lesse and lesse, till such time that
you bring it into so small a ring, that as soone as you haue
stopt, (which stop must not be perceiued by the standers by)
you immediatly ease your hand again, and putting him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with your legs, turne him roundly as it were in the
<hi>Incauallare,</hi> saue that this must be doone more loftily, and so
hauing made this turne on your right hand, gallop backe to
your left ring, and doo the like on your left hand, continuing
these turnes, no longer then you shal find your Horse to doo
it with a good grace and courage. This kinde of manage, is
of all lessons in horsmanship most needful and artificiall, for
in it, your Horse must stop, aduaunce and turne, all in one
instant.</p>
            <p>Note, that in this lesson aboue all other, your Horse must
vse the least disorder with his head or body, but in it kéepe
hys rayne most perfect and gallant: therefore during the
tyme that your Horse doth manage, be sure to carry a more
strong and sure hand then in any other lesson. Note that in
managing you must kéepe as iust time in your gallop as in
your turne, and that the time you kéepe in each, be all one.
Note that as in your turne you draw vp you bridle hande,
to make your horse stop, and ease it again to make him goe
forward in his turne, so in his galloppe you must drawe vp
your hand, to kéepe his head in his true place, and also ease
it again to swéeten his mouth, and make him to ryde with
more pleasure, whereas if you holde your hande awaies in
one stay, you wil not onely dull and make dead his mouth,
but also make him ride vnpleasantly, and when you offer to
stop him, make proffer to breake away with you. Note that
in this lesson, you carry your body straight &amp; vpright, your
legges in their true place, your rodde as it were your
<pb facs="tcp:8345:22"/>
sword, on the right side of your heade, and be carefull that
you vse no vncomly motion, for any vnséemelinesse in the
man, is a disgrace to the Horses dooing.</p>
            <p>When your Horse can make this manage, you may
then if you please, make him manage in a larger sort, which
is very comely, in this manner. Pace out a Ring of fiue or
sixe yardes compasse on your right hande, and then pacing
downe the furrow as is before saide, marke out another on
your left hand of the same compasse, then put your Horse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a gentle galloppe, and beeing come to your right hande
Ring, there making a slight kind of stop and aduancement,
force your Horse to beate the Ring about, in such sort as I
showd you before, where I tell you how to make your horse
to beate a large turne loftily: helping him with the calues
of your legs, your hande and your rodde, then gallopping
downe to your left Ring, doo the like there. This kinde of
manage, though it be some-what more painefull then the
other, yet if the Horse be of mettall that dooth it, it carrieth
such a good grace, that to the standers by which shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it, it will be wonderful pleasing.</p>
            <p>Nowe when this is perfected, it resteth that you teache
your Horse to passe a swift and strong cariere, which you
shall doo in this manner. Béeing come into some graueld
hie way, the length of a good cariere, which shoulde be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
according to the disposition of the Horse, yet sith it
shall not be amisse to sette downe some certaintie, I thinke
sixe score yardes a very fitte cariere, as well for the heauie
slugge Horse, as also for the puissant and fine mettald beast:
for as the one may runne it without wearines, so the other
may show in it his puissaunce and swiftnes. Beeing come
(as I said) into such a place, first pace your Horse twice or
thrice about a small Ring, and then trotte him forward sixe
score yardes, at the ende whereof pace another Ring: and
then setting your Horses heade straight downe the way hée
came, make him stand still a good space, during which time,
looke that his body stand straight and firme, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you
<pb facs="tcp:8345:22"/>
haue found it dooth, then giuing him your bridle hande, ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
your body a little forward, and thrusting out both your
legges with a good strength, force him suddainly with a
good courage, to enter into a swift gallop, which with the
euen stroke of your spurres, encrease, till hee be at the verie
vttermost spéede hee can runne, in which continue him, till
he come to your first Ring, where, by drawing vppe your
hand hard and firme, make him stoppe vpon his buttockes,
and then with the helpe of your legges, make him aduance
twice or thrice: then trotte him about the Ring, and stande
still a good space, cherishing him, and no more.</p>
            <p>Note that when you starte your cariere, to make your
Horse d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o it with greater life and courage, you may vse the
helpe of your voyce, by crying <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>hey</hi> very loud. Note
that when you starte your cariere, it is not good to spurre
your Horse, for feare you make him yarke out behinde,
plunge, or vse other disorder, which such violent corrections
doone suddainly, will bring a Horse vnto. Note that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere
would not be past aboue once in a fortnight at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> most,
nor so oft neither, if your Horse bee not come to his full
growth.</p>
            <p>Thus much haue I thought good to write as touching
the instructing of Horses to matters of seruice, for more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I haue before sette downe, is néedlesse in seruice, and if hee
doo any thing lesse, hee is not fitte to serue vpon. Heere I
could trouble you with a long discourse of other Rings and
other manages, as namely the <hi>Caragolo,</hi> the manage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
to the letter <hi>S.</hi> or that called <hi>Serpeggiare,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
others: yet sith there is no Horse, but if hee be perfect
in what is before written, must of force doo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
because there is no alteration of arte, but only change
of forme, I meane héere therefore to omitte them, wishing
those that are desirous to vnderstande them, to looke into
Maister <hi>Claudio Corte</hi> his workes, a man péerelesse in the
arte of horsemanshippe, who of those matters hath written
absolutely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:23"/>And now to pursue my former purpose, hauing your
Horse ready in all these lessons belonging to seruice, that he
will doe them vpon his Trench, and martingale in perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
carrying hys heade round, comely, and in good forme,
you shall then bitte him, in this manner. Marke when hée
standeth in his pride, and carrieth his head in the most gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantest
fashion, and then measure him from the neather lyp,
to the fore-poynt of his shoulder, which is equall with the
height of his breast, and take a plaine smooth cannon Byt,
with a flying trenche, whose cheekes may bee of the same
length, after the manner of thys figure following, and put
it in his mouth.<figure/>
            </p>
            <p>Yet by the way note, that according as your Horse is
of fashion, so must the cheeke of your Bytte carry his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion:
if your Horse be in shape grosse, that is, shortnec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
thicke chauld, and harde mouthed, you shall then haue
the cheeke of your Bytte, made vppon three degrees, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thys figure following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:23"/>
               <figure/>
But if he be of fine shape, as long necked, wide chauld,
and gentle mouthed, then shall the cheeke of your Bytte be
made but vppon one degrée, according to the manner of
thys figure following.
<figure/>
            </p>
            <p>The difference and nature of these two cheekes is this,
the first, which standeth vpon thrée degrées, bringeth in the
musell of the Horse, and maketh him perforce rayne well,
that otherwise would thrust out his nose ilfauouredly: the
reason whereof is, because it carrieth a greater compasse
then any other Bytte, insomuch that a Horse cannot rest
vpon it vnlesse hee drawe in the nether parte of his heade:
whereas the second that standeth but vpon one degrée, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
<pb facs="tcp:8345:24"/>
a Horses head vpright and aloft, neither dooth it suffer
him to thrust out his nose, but correcteth him if at any time
he couet to put his head downeward.</p>
            <p>A Horse that is short neckt and narrow chaulde, reason
telleth yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, cannot couch his head in so good a place, as hée
that hath a long necke and a wide chaule: because alwaies
in a good rayne, he must hide his thropell or weison within
his chaule: therefore if you shall sette him vpon a byt, that
dooth not carry great compasse in the chéeke, as of three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
at the least, you shall neuer place his head well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the straight cheeke wil keepe vp his necke, and thrust
out his nose, and he should haue his necke forced to yeelde,
and his nose kept in.</p>
            <p>So on the contrary sort, if to a Horse of large long fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
you put a Bytte of much compasse, you then bring
downe his necke and put out his nose, by reason of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of the cheeke, which he cannot chuse but folow, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he should haue his necke kept vp straight and stiffe, and
onely his head brought downe to answere it. Therefore as
I said, byt your Horse according to his proportion. It shall
be good that for a day or two, you let him stand vpon his bit
in the stable, to play &amp; feele the kyrbe, then after, for other
two or thrée dayes, you shall in your hand trot him abroad,
making his Kyrbe somewhat straite, and rayning him so
as he may haue a good féeling both of the Bytte and Kyrbe.
After this, you shall take his backe, and beeing well seated
and hauing pausd awhile, take vp your Bytte raynes into
your left hande, and holde them in this manner: Put your
little finger and your ring-finger, betwéene the two raines,
and lay your thombe iust vpon the raines, opposite to your
fore-finger and great finger, the brawne of your thombe
being turned towarde your Saddle pomell: then take the
left rayne of your flying trenche, &amp; lay it vnder your thomb,
carrying it somewhat more straiter then your bitte ray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e.
Then in your right hand in which you carry your rod, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
the right rayne of your flying trench. In this manner
<pb facs="tcp:8345:24"/>
pace forth your Horse, bearing him most-what vppon your
flying trenche for thrée or foure daies, offering little or no
labour, vnlesse it be trotting forwarde, or pacing and trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Rings, and stopping, all which you must put him
vnto in gentle manner, for feare of distempering his head.
And as you finde him frame himselfe to his Bytte, so by
little and little, let him feele it euery day more then other,
till such time that you find, he bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> vnderstandeth the bytte,
and hath his head well staied thereon.</p>
            <p>Then may you euery day exercise him in all the foresaide
lessons, with all those helpes and corrections <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efore menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
till you haue him in that perfection, that without anie
other helpe saue the offer of your hand, he will doo what you
shall require.</p>
            <p>Note, that the true place where the Bytte should lye in
the Horses mouth, is aboue the tuske of his nether chappe:
as for any other quillet or stratageme in horsemanshippe,
which the curious are desirous to vnderstand, I refer them
to Maister <hi>Blundeuils</hi> booke, which will instruct them suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently.</p>
            <p>Nowe, to come to those lessons which though they bee
néedlesse in seruice, yet showe they great arte in the Ryder,
together with much strength, courage, and nimblenesse in
the Horse, and those I tearme lessons of pleasure, because
they be more pleasing to the eye, then necessary for any vse,
and first of all to make your Horse bounde aloft, you shall
thus instruct him. Hauing him well staied vpon his Bitte,
that he is both certaine of head and mouth, you shall trotte
him forth into some euen sandie way, and hauing trotted
him a dozen yardes, you shall stoppe him, and vpon his first
or second aduauncement, giue him the euen stroke of your
spurres, at which if he will not bound, strike him again the
second time, if that preuaile not, then trotte him forwarde
againe, and doo as you did before, continuing this manner
of labour, till hee leape with all his foure legges from the
ground, which so soone as he dooth, immediatly make much
<pb facs="tcp:8345:25"/>
of him, and vpon his first bound, let him be sette vp in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>table, that he may thereby be encouraged the next tyme,
and the better vnderstande what your will is. Then haue
him out the second day, and doo as you did the first, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his leapes as you sée him increase in vnderstanding,
till he be so perfect, that vppon the offer of your spurre, hee
will ryse on all foure.</p>
            <p>Note, that if he rise not so hie with his hinder partes as
with his fore-parts, that then you accompany with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
stroke of your spurres, a good lash with your rodde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his belly, and néere vnto his sheathe or yard. Note that
if in bounding he doo not keepe his ground, but presseth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and dooth not fall where he riseth, that then so much
as he presseth forward, so much you make him retire back,
by beating him vpon his fore knees, and then beeing in the
former place, make him bound againe.</p>
            <p>Note that when your Horse will bound aloft lustily and
well, you shall make vse of it thus. When you gallop your
Horse before any assembly, as soone as you haue made your
stoppe and aduaunced, if then for a close you make hym
bound, it will be very comely. Also in your manage, if you
make your turne onely with boundes, it will be very séem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
When you beate a large turne, if for a close or ending,
you make your Horse bounde on all foure, nothing can be
more séemely, and then to stande still, thus much for boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Coruett,</hi> you shall doe it thus: Ryde your
Horse downe some desending grounde, and hauing trotted
two or thrée yardes, stoppe him, and make him aduaunce
twice or thrice together: then put him forwarde halfe so far
as before, and there make him aduaunce three or foure
times together. In this manner make him goe a steppe or
two and aduaunce, till of himselfe he will rayse his hinder
parts, and in stéede of going forwarde, stande aduauncing
both behind and before of an equall height. When hee will
doo this well, then may you vpon his third aduauncement,
<pb facs="tcp:8345:25"/>
giue him the euen stroke of your spurres, to make hym
bounde aloft, which manner of salte, our English Ryders
tearme the Gallop galiard.</p>
            <p>Another manner of leape there is, which we call the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priole,</hi>
or Goates-leape, it differeth nothing at all from the
<hi>Coruett,</hi> but that your Horse in it must presse more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
then in the <hi>Coruett,</hi> and raise his hinder parts a great
deale hyer. Therefore you shall teach your Horse to doo it,
as you taught him the <hi>Coruett,</hi> adding thereunto this one
helpe more, that is, to turne your rodde in your hand, so as
the poynt thereof, may be iust ouer the midst of your Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
buttocks, then sette your hand fast to your side, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
vpon his aduaunce, as you put him forwarde with
your legge, so hit him vppon the buttocks with your rodde,
which will force him to raise his hinder parts, obseruing to
kéepe that time with your rodde, that you keepe with your
hande and legge. And thus for the making of a Horse for
seruice or pleasure, I haue shewed both my practise and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>

will declare, (since not any els hath vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the like Treatise) my knowledge in the dyeting and
ordering of those Horses, which we tearme Hunting Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
because the pleasure wee enioy by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Houndes: an arte euery way equall with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb facs="tcp:8345:26"/>
and as necessary in some kind of seruices in the warre,
(especially vpon desperate exploytes to be doone suddainly,
or vpon occurrents or discoueries, or any other kind of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
wherein eyther the toughnes, or swiftnes of a Horse
is to be tryed,) as the former. Yet sith the former hath béen
alwaies of hyer price, and more searcht into, and sith what
Horse soeuer is perfect vpon his bit, and can wel performe
all those lessons mencioned in the former Chapter, must of
force be perfect vppon his Snaffle, and if his Maister so
please, be after made a Hunting-horse: where contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
if a Horse be from his beginning traynd to a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
loose kind of gallop, as Hunting-horses are, he will aske
great labor and arte to be sette vpon a Bitte, &amp; made proud
and gallant.</p>
            <p>I will therfore, not make them two artes, but one, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this latter, an apendex to the former, concluding him
(in my foolish iudgement) not an absolute horseman, which
hath not vnderstanding in them both: for if he haue arte to
make his Horse proude of gate and countenaunce, and so
nimble, light, and deliuer, that with his round turnes and
quaint saltes, he amazeth the ignorant beholders, yet wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
arte so to dyet him, that he neede not feare either mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his grease, breaking his winde, or foundring hym, all
which are doone instantly if he be vncleane, without any
shew of extremitie, what auaileth his former skill? Or if
he haue arte so to diet his Horse, that if he be ridden whilst
he is able to sette one foote before another, if he haue all the
grease molten within his body, if hee be in that extremitie,
that some suppose he cannot possibly liue an houre, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two or thrée houres after, be so fresh and couragious, as
if he had neuer béene labourd, if he haue this arte, I say, yet
want arte, to make his Horse haue either faire counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
comely gate, or any agilitie or nimblenes with his
bodie: insomuch, that the most honorable &amp; puissant beast
in the world, is made to show like the most dul &amp; vnseeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
creature, what auaileth his arte in dyeting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:26"/>Some will say (yet but the ignorant) that the trayning
and dyeting of these which I tearme Hunting-horses, is
the onely marring and spoile of good Horses: Fie, say they,
thys extreame chasing and ryding of them, makes them
lame and vnsounde, and this curious dyeting them, makes
them so tender, neshe, and sickely, that they be good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Immitating heerein a Philosopher, who seeing a
Gentleman extreamely troubled with the Tooth-ach, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all his owne téeth to be drawne out, for feare in after
time he shoulde feele the like payne, saying all men were
subiect to that disease: so they, hauing séene some one lame
olde hunting Horse, presently conclude all are subiect to the
like infirmity, therefore not necessarie any should hunt.</p>
            <p>For myne owne part, extreame ryding I as much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alowe
as any man: yet in great wagers, where the horses
value is farre excéeded, I see no reason but (for tryall) they
may well be put to extreamitie, and if they be well dyeted
and cunningly ridden, not one hayre worse afterward, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I wishe such extreamitie, shoulde be as much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
as may be. For this slaunder of lamenesse raisd vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Hunting-horses, I thus confute it, that there be some,
and many Hunting-horses lame I not deny, yet for euerie
such one lame Horse, I will finde twenty more lame, that
neuer knew what hunting meant, so that Hunting-horses
be not onely lame.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is well knowne, especially to those that haue
skill, that Hunting-horses are neuer lamed through theyr
immoderate ryding or labour, if they haue a good Keeper:
but now and then through gréedines of sport, and ouer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines
when they ouer-reach and fall, they many tymes
chaunce vpon a straine, by which they halte a little, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
in a leape or slyppe, may happen mischiefe, which
is very seldome, or rarely seene. Where, on the contrarie
part, who is so simple that hee knoweth not, if a Horse be
kept in the stable and want exercise, his hoouses wil straiten,
his sinewes dry vppe, and he proue lame vncurable? Who
<pb facs="tcp:8345:27"/>
knoweth not that trauailing in the hie way, will beate a
Horse, make him put out windgalles, and lame him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly.
What trauailing Horse is he that wil not stumble,
and if he stumble, he may fall, and if he fall, why not conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
proue lame as well as a hunting Horse?</p>
            <p>Your great Horses which are for seruice, whom to
traine &amp; bring to perfection, euery one almost of any gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemanly
disposition, will endeuour himselfe vnto: Why
those I say are as subiect to lamenes as any Hunting-horse
whatsoeuer, for there is neuer a turne you sette, if it be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teficiall,
but it straines your Horses backe &amp; hinder loynes,
as much as a Hunting-horse straineth himselfe in running
ouer a furlong of the déepest earth. Sith then all Horses
are as subiect to infirmitie as Hunting-horses, why not
then the Hunting-horse as tollerable as any other Horse.</p>
            <p>Now for this vnworthy blame they impute to the dye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Horses, you shall sée howe groslie theyr ignoraunce
makes them coniecture, first they shall sée in the sequel, that
there is no meate, drinke, or any other thing whatsoeuer,
appoynted for a Hunting-horse, but it shall by good &amp; suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reasons, be prooued most excellent, and most healthful
for the Horse, then consequently it must be tollerable. Some
will say this dyeting is but newly come vp, and that men,
whose nature is to be gréedie of nouelties, being new-fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
are inamored with this vaine toy. Their forefathers
neuer knewe what the dyeting of Hunting-horses meant,
yet they had good Horses. As though former blindnes shold
banish ensuing knowledge. Or because <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi>
(who were the Parents of all Parents) were naked (saue
for Figge leaues,) therefore we should refuse to weare clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
this were wonderfull absurd. There is no arte, but
the more a man wadeth into it, the more substantiall and
intricate he shal finde it, and be forced to cry with <hi>Aristotle,
ô ens ensium miserere mei,</hi> the depth and end of arte is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable.</p>
            <p>Now that all men may be the more willing to endeuor
<pb facs="tcp:8345:27"/>
themselues to haue insight in this arte of dyeting, beholde
what profit insueth thereby. First, there is no disease nor
infirmitie in a Horse, especially within his heade or bodie,
which be secrete and vnseene, and therefore most dangerous
and mortall, but a man skilfull in this arte shall both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
it before it come to extremitie, and also recure it.</p>
            <p>Thys maketh a Horse long winded, tough, harde, and
stoute, insomuch that a poore Nagge of sixe or seauen pound
price, well traynd and dyeted, will not onely tyre, but also
kill outright, a Courser worth a hundred pound, if he be fat
and foule fedde: whereas if such a Courser were in good
diet, he would tyer twenty such Nagges. Some peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will allowe of dyeting, but dislike the sport of hunting,
for looke what contrarieties are in mens faces, the like may
be in theyr fancies: therefore I say it is not necessary, that
Hunting-horses onely be dieted, but other Horses as well:
yet must they haue extraordinary ryding, because in dye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
exercise is as néedfull as meate. But for such as ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loue hunting, nor haue occasion to ride further then
from market to market, they may sette theyr Horse to a
bottle of hay, and giue him pease pulse. The reason why
men vse theyr dyeted Horses to the hunting of the Hayre, is
because it is a swift chase, and a continuing sport: yet not
without some stoppes and staies, in which a horse may take
winde, and reuiue himselfe againe, which those from whom
I learne mine experience, tearme defaultes in the dogges,
and sobbes for their Horse.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the cry of the dogges, is as pleasant to the
horse as the man, and addeth to him both a courage to run,
and a willingnes to continue his labour: whereas to gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
a Horse vp and downe the fielde after nothing, makes
him weary of his labour, and willing to giue ouer ere hee
haue in a manner doone any thing. Thus much in defence
of this arte which the ignorant condemne, and nowe to my
purpose.</p>
            <p>When you make choyse of a horse to trayne to hunting,
<pb facs="tcp:8345:28"/>
as néere as you can, let him haue these properties, shapes,
and vertues. First for his inward part, which is his mind,
disposition, and mettall, let him be of nature gentle, louing,
and familiar to the man. Let him not be disposed to dogged
sullennesse, to strike or to byte: let him be of quick &amp; liuely
mettall, but not hote nor firie, for they be neuer good, then
for his outward shapes, thus if it may. Of colloures these
be the best, Browne daple bayes, Bright bayes, Daple
grayes, or White lyards, or blackes, so hee haue eyther
white rache, white starre, or white foote. His head if it bée
somewhat bigge, but not monstrous, so the chaule be thinne
and wide, it is the better. A small prick eare, or if it be long
and stand vpright like a Foxe, it is a good token of mettall
and toughnes.</p>
            <p>Hys fore-head woulde be broade, hauing as it were a
rysing bunche in the midst like a Hare: for to be playne
smooth faced, which we tearme Mare-faced, is ilfauoured,
and a signe of no induring spirite. Hys eye woulde be large
and bright: his nostrelles very wide, for that is a token of
long winde. If hee be bearded all vnder his chappes like a
Goate, it is passing good, for that is a signe of great swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and goodnes. In generall, all his head would be leane,
for if it be ful and fat, doubtles the horse is dul and vnsprity.
His thropell or wind-pipe, would bee big to a mans féeling,
and straight to his eye, for it when he raineth, it haue a bent
like a bow, which we cal Cock-thropled, it is very ill, and a
signe of great straitnes of wind. For his lyms in generall,
they would be big, cleane, flat, straight, and very shorte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
ioynt and ioynt, especially betwéen the pasterne &amp; the
hoofe, for if he be long in that part, he must of force be weak
there, and if he be weake footed, he cannot possibly endure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wette earth, yet some that be a little sickle hoght, proue
very good. His body would be round and large, and his ribs
wold stand a little outward. In briefe, the longer your horse
is from the eare to the sterne of his taile, the better it is, so
that his chiefest length consist not in his chine, but in hys
<pb facs="tcp:8345:28"/>
hinder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oynes, depth of fore-hand, and length of necke: for
otherwise, to be long backt, is a signe of weaknes.</p>
            <p>When you haue gotten a Horse as néere as yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> can to
these shapes, looke that before you trayne him to hunting,
he be at the least past foure yéeres old, and going on his sift,
and that he be well wayd, and lightly trauaild. This done,
you shall thus trayne and dyet him: Hauing taken him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
graffe at Bartholmewtide or there abouts, (for then the
pride and strength of grasse is gone, and the flesh they get
after, is but vnsound and naught, being excéeding fatte, as

take him and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tte him vp in your stable, which sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
must be made close and darke, yet with such windowes
and lights as at your pleasure you may let in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fresh ayre,
and make it so coole and warme as you please: the reason
why it should be close and darke, is, that when your Horse
hath endured a dayes labour or hunting, being set in a close
stable, as soone as he hath fild his belly, he will lye downe
and take his rest, as well on the day as night, which is as
wholsome as any meate he can eate: where if the stable he
open and lightsome, vnlesse he be an olde beaten horse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
will not lye downe.</p>
            <p>Let the plaunchers of your stable, be layde euen and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
not as many doo, hyer before then behind, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that your Horses can neuer stand at ease, but resting
altogether vpon theyr hinder legges, prooue often lame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.
Neyther can they lye but at much payne, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them seldome to take rest. Let the ground &amp; your plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
be of an equall height, that if your horse at any tyme
goe backward off your plaunchers, yet that he may stand e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
both before and behind. Let your Maunger be made
close, with bordes onely, and not lyned within with eyther
lyme or plaister, for the smell of lyme is suffocating and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome,
and plaister will yeeld great store of dust, which
is more vnhealthfull. Let there be no mudde wall within
your stable, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> your Horse may reach vnto with his mouth,
<pb facs="tcp:8345:29"/>
for by nature they wil couet to gnaw an eate them down,
and nothing can be worse for a Horse. Hauing sette your
horse (being very fatte and newe taken from the grasse) in
such a stable, lay your hand vpon his side neere to his short
ribbes, and there you shall feele his fatnesse, which wil bée
vnder your hand very soft and tender: which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you féele,
be you well assured all that fatte is naught, for beeing so
loose and soft, the smallest trauaile that may be will melt
it, and then being molten before it be hardned by good dyet,
the outward fatte falleth into the horses legges, &amp; maketh
him haue swolne legges, and lame neuer to be cured, which
secrete but few at this day vnderstand: and the inward fat
which is within his stomack, bagge and guttes, putrifies,
and bréedes those diseases which kill the horse out-right,
though it be halfe a yeere, or perhappes three quarters of a
yeere after. Insomuch that the owner, who hath neyther
skill to discerne such a chaunce when it is hapned, nor arte
to giue him any medicine to purge him of that grosse mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
sayth he dyed suddainly he knoweth not of what, when
himselfe long before, had willingly giuen him his death,
which mischiefe to auoyde, you shall vse this meane.</p>
            <p>First for two or thrée dayes, you shall let your horse
stande in the stable vnclothed, and giue him nothing but
Wheate-straw and water, twise a day, morning and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
being ledde thereunto in his Kéepers hand, til you sée
his doung (which at the first will be a darke blacke greene)
be cleane changed to a palish yellow: then may you (not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
before layd any curry combe on him, but onely rubde
him morning and euening with a hard wispe) bothe currie
him, rubbe him, picke him, and dresse him, and also cloathe
him in a single cloth made of sack-cloth, and let the sursin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
be stopt round about with bigge soft wispes, as well for
warmth as ease of the horse.</p>
            <p>Thys shall you doe euery morning very earely, as by
sixe of the clock, then put a small snaffle in his mouth, and
lighting vpon his back, walk him a fayre foote-pace to some
<pb facs="tcp:8345:29"/>
fayre Riuer or rundle, being at least halfe a myle, and there
water him, and so walke him home againe, and set him vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that doone, take a quarter of a pecke of Oates, and sift and
dust them well in a small siue, and then sweeping the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
cleane, giue them him, then put a sheafe of wheat straw
well thresht into the Racke, and putting downe hys lytter
vnder him, let him stand so till one of the clock in the after
noone, at one of the clocke in the after noone come to him,
and turne vp his cloth, and with a harde wispe, rub downe
his necke, face, buttocks and legges, then sift him two or
thrée handfuls of Oates more, and so turning downe hys
cloth, let him stand till thrée a clocke, at which time come to
him, and first put away his doung, then shake vp his litter,
and after you haue vncloathed him, curry him and dresse
him in thys sort.</p>
            <p>First, after you haue curried him all ouer with your
curry combe, which raiseth vp the dust, then shall you with
some dead horse tayle nailed to a sticke, dust him, and strike
away that which the curry combe hath raysde: then take a
wispe of straw wrethen hard together, and with it rubbe
him cleane ouer, especially his legges, which the more they
be chafte, the better and more nymble will the horse be, then
take a hayre-cloth, and with it rubbe him ouer, for that wil
cleanse away the dust, and keepe his coate smooth &amp; cleane.
Then wette your hands, but not too much, and with them
so wet, rubbe him all ouer, especially his face, which must
chiefely be kept cleane: thys rubbing him with your wette
hands, will leaue vpon hym neuer a loose hayre, nor anie
other filthy thing.</p>
            <p>Then with a cleane cloth that is not dustie nor foule,
though it be course, clense him all ouer, for it will make his
coate shyne, insomuch that you shall almost discerne your
face therein: then looke about his eyes and if you see anie
great hayres growing about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eyther aboue or beneath,
as all horses haue, pull them away, for they be perilous for
a horses sight. Then take out his yarde, which of it selfe
<pb facs="tcp:8345:30"/>
will gather much durte and filthines, and with your hande
clense it, then combe downe with a wet maine combe, hys
mayne and taile, and so clothe him vp and stop him round,
then as you did before, take his backe, and vppon a gentle
foote-pace, walke him forth to his water, and bring him
home againe, giuing him two or thrée handfuls of well sif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Oates, then if he haue no wheate strawe in his racke,
put him a little in, and then throwing downe his lytter, let
him so stand till it be eyght a clock at night, at which tyme
come to him, and after you haue turnd vp his cloth, rubde
him, and chaft his legges, giue him a handfull or two of
Oates, and a fresh sheafe of Wheate straw into his Rack,
and more newe litter, and so let him rest till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>In this sort kéepe him for the space of thrée weekes or a
Moneth, onely with Wheate-straw and Oates, putting
him to no further trauaile then the fetching of his Water,
in which space, you shall sée his belly will be cleane taken
vp, and he will shew himselfe comely and gaunt, and you
shall féele his fatnesse more firme, hard, and sad then it was
before at his first taking vp: which alwaies the harder it
is, in the better case is your Horse. Now, if your Horse be
such a grosse f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ding beast, that his fatnesse and pursinesse,
rather increaseth with this manner of keeping, then ought
at all deminisheth, as some Horses, who will féede as sore
vpon straw, as if they had Hay and prouender, which wée
call Kettie Horses: or if you haue made promise for anie
match, so that you cannot well stay to take such long tyme
as in trueth you should, or as arte woulde require, then to
inseame your Horse the sooner, you shall vse during thys
first moneth, for to ryde out your Horse euery night, two
howers after Sunne sette, &amp; abide abroade with him three
howres at the least, not exceeding foote-pace, which we call
night ayrings.</p>
            <p>And if this be doone alongst some Riuer side, it is the
best, because the sharpe ayre which commeth from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:8345:30"/>
is colde and pearcing, and neuer a one of these eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
but takes as much of a Horse as if he had endured a
dayes hunting: wherefore I admonish all Keepers, not to
ayre their Horses in the night, but with great discretion,
because it brings lowe, and weakens a Horse verie much.
When you haue ayred your Horse thus and brought him
in, let his legges be well chafte and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ubd downe, and then
giue him his Oates, and so let him rest till morning, not
forgetting but alwaies when you haue brought in your
Horse, to picke his fore-féete cleane, least any pible stones
or grauell shoulde be gotte within the shooe, or worne into
the hoofe.</p>
            <p>After you haue spent your first month thus, onelie in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vp his belly, and hardening his flesh, then shall you
beginne to cleanse him in this sort. In stedde of Wheate-straw
which before you gaue him, you shall giue him Hay,
and the courser such hay is, the better it is (so it be sweete
and well gotten) for the horse will not féede on it to groslie
as otherwise he would: and a Horse will many time vpon
very sweete and fine Hay, eate so much that he will breake
his winde. Hauing thus chaunged his strawe to Hay, you
shall then adde vnto his Oates, Bread, which breade shall
be thus made.</p>
            <p>Take a strike of Beanes, two peckes of Wheate, and
one pecke of Rye, grinde these together, sift them and knead
them, with water and Barme, and so bake them thorowly
in great loaues, as a peck in a loafe: and after they are a
day olde at the least, your Horse may féede on them, but not
before. Some peraduenture, that neyther loue thys sporte
of hunting, nor make any care of a good Horse, will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
this Breade for too costlie, and say that common Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
Horse breade, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but if they
dyd knowe howe many inconueniences is founde by thys
common Horse-breade, they would (without doubt) alter
theyr opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:31"/>First, the substance whereof it is made, is but branne
or chissell, and this branne is nothing but the outmost shale
or huske of the Corne, the meale and strength whereof is
taken away: now when y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vertue is bereft, what remaines
but a dry haske thing, without eyther nutriment or spirite?
And what can that I pray you preuaile with a horse that
must endure extreame labour? Then they kneade it with
nothing but colde water, which makes it so heauy and sad,
that it lyes in the stomacke of a Horse, and neyther turnes
to good blood, nor any other nutriment, but onely to putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and grosse humors, which commonly come to the
<hi>Anticor,</hi> consumption of the lunges, painein the lyuer, the
yellowes, and diuers other such like diseases, all which bée
mortall.</p>
            <p>Againe, Branne is extreame hote and dry, therefore
the horse that shall much féede thereon, it will enflame hys
blood, scalde his stomacke, and breede in him many filthie
diseases: as the scabbe, itch, or farcin and such like. Some
againe will aske me, sith I disalowe this common Breade,
why in the other breade I bidde them take Beanes, &amp; not
Pease? My answere is, because Beanes are a more strong
and cleane foode then Pease, and lesse purssie, and the meale
they make, is a great deale finer.</p>
            <p>If they demaund why I put in the Wheate, my answer
is, because it is comfortable and full of spirite, it bréedeth in
a Horse lust, courage and liuelinesse. If for what purpose
the Rye, then for this, because the two former graines bée
of great strength, and altogether bynding, therfore I put in
the Rye, which is altogether loosening and scowring, that
being ioyned with the former, it kéepeth the Horse coole and
in good temper in his body. Nowe why I kneade it with
Barme, that is to make the breade light and fine, that it
may be easie of disgestion, and not lie too long in the Horses
stomack.</p>
            <p>Hauing such breade as this, and hauing taken awaie
your Wheate strawe, you shall then alter your Horses ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb facs="tcp:8345:31"/>
in thys manner. Earely in the morning, by fiue or
sixe a clocke, after your Horse is drest and trymd, sift thrée
or foure handfuls of Oates cleane, and giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, which
so soone as he hath eaten, then immediatly bridle him vppe
and tye him to the bare Racke, then saddle him, and after
he is sadled, throw his cloath ouer him, &amp; so let him stande
till the Houndes be ready to goe forth a hunting, at which
tyme take his backe, but in any case no spurres on your
héeles, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nely a switching rodde, and so goe foorth with
them, and spend that day in hunting, till three or foure of
the clocke in the euening, prouided alwaies that you gallop
him not but onely thwart and crosse, from Hyll to Hyll, to
make in with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ogges, exceeding not his trotte at anie
time: and this order see you daily obserue for a fortnight at
the least.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> When you haue thus spent the day and are come home,
sée that there be ready in your stable fresh litter enough, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
sette him vppe, and tye him in his bridle to the bare Racke,
and all to rubbe and chafe him, insomuch that if hee be ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wette with sweate or any other thing, you leaue hym
not till he be as dry as may be, then vnsaddle him, rub hys
backe thorowly, &amp; with all hast clothe him vp warme, and
stoppe hym round with hard wispes: then picke his feete
cleane and chafe his legges, and so let him stande on hys
brydle a quarter of an howre, after which time come to him
and gyue him a handfull of Oates, &amp; halfe so much Hempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séede
mingled together.</p>
            <p>Thys Hempe-seede, is the most gentlest and easiest
scowring that can be gyuen to a Horse, the vertue whereof
is this. If in the dayes hunting you haue eyther disolued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
grosse humors in the Horse, (as labour wil alwaies doo)
or melted any of his grease, it will clense and bring it away
from the Horse, as you shall perceiue the next morning by
his doung, which you shold alwaies regard, and looke vnto
very much, for it will be greasie and full of slimie matter.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus gyuen him Oates and Hemp-seede, bridle
<pb facs="tcp:8345:32"/>
him again, and let him so stand halfe an houre, or an houre.
After which tyme vnbridle him, and put into his Racke a
little bottle of Hay, like a halfe-penny bottle in an Inne,
and let him for an howre or there abouts, eate his Hay,
then gyue him such a quantitie of Breade as you in discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall thinke fitte: neyther so much as you may cloy
him and make him refuse it, nor so extreame little that you
ease his hunger nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Then let him stande hauing Hay in his Racke, til nyne
of the clocke at night, at which time come to him, and rub
him well all ouer, then hauing faire water in the house,
water him: then sift him foure or fiue handfuls of Oates,
and mingle with them a good quantitie of Bread, and giue
it him. Then shaking his lytter about him, leaue him for
that night.</p>
            <p>As soone as you come to him the next morning verie
earely to dresse him, the first thing you doo looke what
doung he hath made, if it be greasie, darke coloured, and
foule, then it is a signe the Horse is foule within, full of
glut and purssinesse: if it be well coloured, that is to say of
a pale yellow hauing no grease in it, then is it a signe that
your former dayes hunting did take nothing at all of him,
but that his grease remaineth in his body vnwasted: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the next day you may take the more of him, yet not so
much that you force him to gallop.</p>
            <p>The second thing you looke vnto, must be whether hée
haue left any prouender in the Manger vneaten or no, if he
haue left any, then shall you sweepe it away and bridle him
vp, giuing him no meate at all till night that he come from
hunting, for that dayes gentle exercise and fast, will gette
him a stomacke, and make him eate his meate with lust
and greedines.</p>
            <p>If he haue eaten all cleane and left no prouender, then
shall you giue him thrée or foure handfulles of Oates, or
els some Breade, (whether of them you please,) to eate
whilst you are dressing him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:32"/>Lastly, looke in the Racke what Hay he hath left, if hée
haue left neyther Hay nor prouender, then the next nyght
giue him the same quantity of Hay, but a good deale more
prouender, for it is a signe he had not before halfe enough.
If he haue eaten vp all his Hay yet left his prouender vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten,
(which is commonly the property of a great féeding
Horse,) then the next night giue him but halfe of much hay,
and the same quantity of prouender as before, that not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
hay enough to fill his belly, hee may be forced to eate
his prouender or els fast: which if he doo one night or two,
be sure he will not the third.</p>
            <p>Then dresse him, saddle him, and haue him abroade, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him in all poynts according to the manner afore-sayd.
Prouided alwaies by the way, that during the time of this
fort-night, you may euery morning, either before you goe
out, or as you goe, water your Horse, so that you suffer
him not to drinke full so much as he would desire. Hauing
spent thys fort-night thus, the next fort-night following,
you shall aduenture to gallop him a little after the dogges:
but in any wise no meane out right chase, but gently nowe
and then for twenty or forty score, and no more without a
sobbe, and let it be vpon an ouer-thwart ground, I meane
plowed lands, or lay lands hie ridged.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let him galloppe so softly and leysurel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e as
you can possiblie make him, first that he may therby learne
howe to vse his legges and body nimbly, secondly, that hee
may strike his furrow cleane without stumbling, and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that he may haue knowledge and vnderstanding of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
owne faultes if he chaunce to committe any, and thereby
seeke to amende them.</p>
            <p>For any fault whatsoeuer he chaunceth to committe in
gallopping vppon a deepe earth, in any wise you must not
spurre hym, for if you doo, you shall vtterly spoyle him for
euer beeing good hunter, the reason here of is this: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> young
Horse that hath neuer béene vsed to gallop on déepes, wil at
the first be rashe and hastie, and put him selfe foorth more
<pb facs="tcp:8345:33"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iercely then hee can possible continue, then waxing a lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
weake, he will snapper and stumble, or els ware sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
for any of which faultes if you spurre him, he will then
through terror of the correction rushe so hastily forwarde
without regard, that neyther vnderstanding his error, nor
knowing how to amend it, he will increase it: and so where
he would stumble but once, peraduenture stumble 3. times.
Whereas if you haue no spurres to torment him with, but
that he may take his owne leysure, and when he stumbleth,
both see the occasion, and feele the paine thereof, which is
twice so sore to him as to the man, and farre more loth is
the Horse to fall then the man to haue him, he will become
so cunning, that the déepe earth and the plaine meddowes
will be all one to him: nay, in that he findeth his Rider wil
let him take leysure and tyme thereon, he will rather couet
the deepe then the playne, and for a surety, cunning preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
farre more then speede on a déepe earth.</p>
            <p>As for his dyet this fortnight, let it be in all things lyke
the former fortnight: both the same meate, the same scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and the same times duely obserued. Nowe after these
two fortnights are thus passed, which with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former month
makes iust too monthes, you shal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perceiuing your horse
to be still fat and foule, which you shall vnderstand both by
the thicknesse of his rybbe, by the grosnesse of his leske or
flancke, (which will be full and thicke in your hande) and
also by his chaule, which you shall feele both fat and full of
little knots at the roote of his tongue which stoppeth hys
winde, put him to greater extreamity: that is to say, you
shall then hunt more soundly, following the dogges at the
heeles, yet with such discretion, that you put not your Horse
to aboue a thrée-quarters spéede, for feare you ouer-toyle
him, or make hym gyue ouer before he knoweth what hee
dooth.</p>
            <p>The first day you hunte him in thys sorte, (through
which extraordinary toyle he cannot chuse but sweat much
outwardly, which wasteth his outward grease, and by his
<pb facs="tcp:8345:33"/>
inward heate, disolue the glut and filth which cloyeth hys
guttes and stomacke) being come home, and hauing sette
him vp in the stable, let hym be exceedingly rubd, chaft and
made dry, then if you gyue him no scowring that night, it
shall not matter, but the next morning so soone as the Sun
is vp, hauing kept your Horse fasting an howre, then gyue
him this scowring.</p>
            <p>Take Rosemary and let it be chopt very small, then
take a dysh of swéete Butter, and worke the Rosemary and
it well together, then make good round pellets thereof and
put them into your Horses mouth, and make him swallow
them: so doone put on hys bridle, and being wel clothed an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
stopt round, both with his owne cloth and a single blanket,
take his backe and walke him forth into some close or field,
for halfe an houre or little more: then bring him in and tye
hym vp, and you shall perceiue within an houre after or
thereabouts, he will grow to be exceedingly sick, but haue
you no feare at all, for it is an excellent signe. When you see
him so sicke, be sure to haue a warme Mashe readie, made
with water and Wheate-meale, Maulte, or Branne, no
more then shall collour the water, &amp; gyue it him to drinke.
As soone as he hath drunke, gyue hym Hay into his rack,
and so let him stand all that day and night, beeing sure that
you prouender him soundly both with bread and Oates.</p>
            <p>Thys kynde of scowring, though there be a number of
other scowrings which heereafter I will sette you downe,
yet I haue alwaies found it of most vertue and profit. It
purgeth the Horse of all manner of glut, foulenesse and bad
vmors.</p>
            <p>If hys grease haue beene molten a moneth before, it
wil bring it away in his doung in great aboundance, to the
admiration of those which hath not séene the like before,
whereas if it should remaine, it were eyther certain death,
or if nature were so strong to expell it, it would breake out
into some filthy disease. The next day after thys scowring
thus giuen, take your Horse forth on hunting, yet in anie
<pb facs="tcp:8345:34"/>
wise neither put him to gallop nor any straine, but onely
trotte him after the dogges that he may take the ayre, gette
him a stomacke, and recouer such lust &amp; courage, that looke
what you did that daie you put him to extremitie, hee will
doe twise so much the next time you shall thereunto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
him.</p>
            <p>In this sort twice a fortnight, for two fortnights toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
would I haue you hunt your Horse thorowly after the
dogges, leauing no chase vnrunne, and then resting him a
day after, vse him according to the manner aforesaide: and
the other daies let him but play and sport himselfe after the
dogges, as well to acquaint him with the sporte, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his winde and kéepe him in breath. Some will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde,
since I woulde haue a horse thus heated after the
dogges thrice in a fort-night, why it may not as well bée
doone without dogges in some plaine Meddowe, Moore, or
Fielde, where a man may galloppe him till hee sweate, as
much or as little as one would?</p>
            <p>I aunswere, it is not so good for diuers respects: first,
when a Horse is heated after the dogges, he hath choyce of
many earthes to runne vppon, one while he gallops vppon
déepe plowed landes, another while vpon plaine Pastures
or Meddowes, one while vpon lay lands that haue hie rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and deepe furrowes, another while vppon beaten hye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
or common tracts: which change of earth, bringes a
Horse to cunning speede, nimblenes, and toughnes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the heate a Horse taketh after the dogges,
hée taketh kindlie and in good sort, for if the dogges runne
a myle, without default, stoppe, stay, or double, it is verie
much: nay, you shall haue them in twelue score, sixe score,
and lesse, make stops and defaults, all which giue vnto your
horse new breath, strength and courage, so that hee will be
more willing to run, then you wil be to haue him: wheras
if you shold giue him his heate all in a maine chase, it wold
be both wearisome, painful, and vnwholsome to the Horse,
for suddaine heates are alwaies perrilous, and in stedde of
<pb facs="tcp:8345:34"/>
incouraging your horse to take pleasure in his galloppe and
to increase in toughnes, you shal discourage him, and make
him faint and tyre: and peraduenture vnlesse hee be verie
cleane, hazard the breaking of his winde.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the cry of the dogges is pleasant vnto the horse,
and he will of himselfe couet to follow them beeing in full
cry. And lastlie, the seeing of other Horses to skope and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
with him, will be an encouragement, and an encreasing
of your Horses willingnes. Now by that time this thyrd
Month is thus spent, your horse will be cleane in his bodie,
wel winded, and in good strength, so that you shal both haue
an insight what hee is able to performe, and also adiudge
rightly of his truth, which when you are acertaind of, then
you may according as your fancie &amp; discretion serues you,
eyther hunt him priuatly, or match him for some great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
publiquely.</p>
            <p>If you doo match him for any great wager, and thereby
doe ouer-match him, though no body can be blamed but
your owne folly or fortune, yet since there be many helpes
in matching which may much auaile, I wil as neere as I
can, bréefely set them down. First vnderstand, it is not good
to let your horse ride any match til he be past 6. yeres olde,
and ful 7. for till then he commeth not to his full strength,
growth and perfection. Secondly note, that according as
your horses disposition is, so make your match, or els wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be a looser: wherfore if you find him dead slow, that is
of little spéede, yet wonderfull true &amp; tough, then make your
match to follow the dogs so long as you can, as till 3. or 4.
of the clock, that in that space you may with earnest riding,
and hauing good tryers to keepe your aduersarie within his
law, which commonly is a horse length or two, or as you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée,
so foile the horse that rydes against you, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you
come to run the Wild-goose chase, you may haue as much
speede as he, which if you perceiue and know your Horse to
be true, if then you loose, impute the faulte eyther to bad ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
or to a false iudgement in your horses disposition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:35"/>Also in thys match, gette your law in the Wild-goose
chase, which is most vsually twelue score to bee twentie
score, that if your aduersary chaunce to haue more spéede
then you, yet with your truth and toughnes, you may reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
him: for that Horse that lets another ouer-runne hym
twenty score at the first in a wild-goose chase, it is pyttie he
should euer be hunter.</p>
            <p>If you find your Horse to be wonderfull arrand swift,
yet not so tough that hee will endure to toyle out a dayes
work with extreamity, then woulde I aduise you, not to
make your match to hunt the Hare after the dogges, but
rather to runne trayne sents made with a Catte, in which
strong sente a dogge will seldome be at defaulte, and the
longer you conclude such traynes, to be the better for you.
Also the shorter lawe you make for the winning or loosing
the match, the better hope you shall haue of winning, and
withall, see you conclude to haue the leading of the first
trayne, all which when you haue agreed vppon, then chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such earth as your Horse may shew his speede vppon,
and hauing the swiftest and best sented dogs you can gette,
gyuing them as much space before you as you can, trye if
you can winne the match with a winde, of which if you
fayle, then is your match in great doubt, if your aduersarie
be tough.</p>
            <p>Wherefore séeing that your speede fayles, then loyter
after, and keepe your Horse as fresh as you can, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Wild-goose chase, taking the leading, sée if
with slyppes and turnes you can foyle him that rydes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you. In which slyppes, the cunning of the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
must as much auayle as the goodnes of the horse: and
for that those slyppes shew both a ready Horse, and an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
Ryder, I will teache you héere how to doo them.</p>
            <p>The Wild-goose chase being started, in which the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Horse is bound to follow the formost, and you hauing
the leading, hold a hard hand of your Horse, and make hym
gallop softly at great ease, insomuch, that perceiuing your
<pb facs="tcp:8345:35"/>
aduersarie striue to take the leading from you, suffer him to
come so néere you, that his Horses head may wel nye touch
your Horses buttocke, which when you sée, clappe your left
spurre in your horses side, and wheele him suddainlie halfe
about on your right hand, and then take him vp againe, till
such time that he be come to you againe: thus may you doo
of eyther hand which you will, and in neuer a one of these
turnes, but you shall throw him that rides against you, at
least twenty or thirtie yardes behind you, so that whilst you
ride at your ease, he shal be forst continually to come vp to
you vpon the spur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, which must wearie the best Horse in
the world.</p>
            <p>If your Horse be both swift and tough, yet thicke win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that is that he cannot runne long with a winde, but if
he want staies or sobbes, that he will fainte and yeeld, then
your best play is, vtterlie to refuse the Wild-goose chase,
and onelie to make your triall after the dogges, tho such
tryals be the longer in making. These necessarie helpes in
matching béeing dulie considered, and hauing made your
match with good discretion, prouiding alwaies to haue a
moneth for the kéeping of your Horse, you shall then thus
order and diet him.</p>
            <p>First, beholding your horse to be lustie and full of lyfe,
hauing a cheerefull countenaunce, willing to play in your
hand, and perceiuing by your former labour, that hee is in
reasonable case for ordinarie hunting, yet not so verie pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and cleane as he should be for a match, for the least imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
that may be in his bodie, is the losse of the wager,
and for a man to keepe him in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> temper all the yeere, were
but too costlie, and to little purpose, sith a man may alwaies
in a monethes space, (if he be any thing cleane) make him
fitte for a match: then for the first wéeke, féede him most
what vpon that breade before prescribed, and let hym haue
Oates but now and then for change of meate, yet let him
haue such store of them both, that he may alwaies haue the
one or the other lying in the Manger before him. If hauing
<pb facs="tcp:8345:36"/>
fedde him in the morning, you finde any at noone, sweepe it
away, and giue it to some other Horse, and giue him fresh,
so likewise doo either at euening or night, or at other times.
For this first weeke and the seconde, looke that you hunte
your Horse very sore, and giue him strong scowrings: of
which scowrings, sith there be diuers of sundry natures
and operations, I will before I goe any further, sette
them downe together with theyr vertues, wishing you to
apply them thereafter, least in mistaking of them as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
doe, you rather hurte then profite your Horse.</p>
            <p>Therefore first, as touching these two scowrings before
mentioned, the one of Hemp-séede, the other Rosemary and
butter. These two are of all the easiest, for they search no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of themselues, but onely purge away such matter as
is before disolued. As they purge the body, so they perfume
the head, open the pypes, and make cleere passage for wind,
therefore they be the best for fat horses.</p>
            <p>There is another, which is Garlike stampt and lapt in
rowles of Butter, and so giuen to the Horse: this scowring
onely purgeth the head, breaketh fleame, and preserues a
Horse from any disease that commeth of colde: therefore it
is to be gyuen to a Horse that is eyther thicke winded, or
subiect to take cold. Butter and Saunders mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and made in pellets, is of the same vertue that this is,
and worketh the same effect, onely it is of more strength
and force. Then is there Sallet oyle and Mylke mingled
together, and so luke-warme to be giuen to a Horse, thys
purgeth the stomacke &amp; entrailes of all grosse matter, and
molten grease, therefore it is good for a fatte horse. Also
some vse to giue this scowring to a Horse that is newe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from grasse, as soone as hee is brought into the house.
Also there is Sallet-oyle and Muskadine to be gyuen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this is of the same vertue that Sallet-oyle and Milke
is, saue that it is some-what more comfortable, for as it
purgeth, so it strengtheneth, therefore it is to be giuen to a
sicke and weake Horse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:36"/>If you giue a Hore Musterd-séede in his prouender, it
is very good, for though it clenseth the stomake little or
nothing, yet it purgeth the heade excéedingly: therefore to
be vsed to the same Horses you vse Butter and Garlike.</p>
            <p>Lastly, and the chéefest scowring of all, is this. Take
the leaues of Boxe, and dry them at the fire till you may
crush them in péeces, then mingle with them Brimstone
beaten to powder, and gyue it your Horse in his prouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
yet very discréetly, as by little and little at once, least
your Horse take a loathe at it, and so refuse it. This pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the head, stomacke and entrailes, of all manner of
filthines, leauing nothing that is vnsound or vncleane: it
cureth the cold, it killeth the wormes, grubbes, or bots in a
Horse, and it neuer abateth, but increaseth courage &amp; flesh.
Therefore it is to be giuen eyther to foule Horse or cleane
Horse, but chifely to the cleane Horse, because it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
hym from any foulnes.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I sette you downe sundry scowrings, with
theyr natures, vse them accordingly, and you shall perceiue
their vertues. A fortnight of your monethes keeping being
spent in sound hunting, as is aforesaid, in which I woulde
wishe you to haue a certaine knowledge of your Horses
goodnesse, and hauing vsed such scowrings as you finde to
be fittest for the state of your Horses body, which when
you perceiue to leaue their working, and that there comes
nothing from your Horse but cleane excraments, without
grease or filthines, then may you be certaine and wel assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that your Horse is cleane within, sounde, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anie manner of imperfection, eyther of winde or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.</p>
            <p>Then shall you the second fortnight, endeuour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the aforesaid cleannes: and to augment his strength,
courage, and abilitie, you shall for this fortnight, make him
Breade in thys manner. Take of Beanes a strike, of Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale
two pecks, of Wheate two peckes, and of Rye two
peckes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:37"/>All these being ground together and finelie sifted, let it
be knoden with new Ale, the Barme and all being beaten
together in the fatte. If you put the whites of Egges into
it, it will be the better, and the more wholsome for the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
winde. These being well knoden together, let them for
an houre or there abouts, lye in the kneading tubbe, that it
may haue time to swell: then let it be wrought vp and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in great loaues.</p>
            <p>With this Breade and with Oates, see that you féede
your Horse extreamely, euen so much as hee will eate. As
for his exercise let it be thus: foure or fiue times in a wéeke,
let him goe foorth on hunting, yet in any case let him not
gallop, especially to straine himselfe aboue twise a wéek at
the most. If he be such a kettie horse that you perceiue hée
feedeth too fast, and that you feare he will were pursie, then
may you once or twice a weeke, about foure a clocke in the
euening, after you haue trotted after the Houndes all day,
sending your Houndes home, breake into a mayne chase
with your Horse, and so giue him a good sounde sweate,
which so soone as you haue giuen, then taking him vp both
in good lust and courage, walke him softly vp and downe,
sometimes trotting, sometimes racking, till you haue coold
him well, and then carrie him home and sette him vp in the
stable.</p>
            <p>In this wise exercise your Horse till it be within three
dayes of your match, during which three daies, let your
Horse take his rest, saue that you may if you will, walke
him foorth to gette him a stomacke if it faile him, as it is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ikelie it will: because for those thrée dayes, you must night
and day watch with him, making him to eate all the meate
he eates, out of your hand. And when he hath eaten a little,
offer him a little dish full of water to drinke, and then gyue
him more bread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, then offer him more water, and in thys
manner féede him till he be full. Then let him take his rest
and lye downe, and alwaies when he riseth doo the like, and
in this sorte feede him till his match day: prouided alwaies
<pb facs="tcp:8345:37"/>
that you let hym haue Hay in his Racke, and let hym be
ledde to the Fielde, bequeathing the rest to God, and good
fortune.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE difference betwéene the Hunting-horse
before mencioned, and the Horse for a course
is great, therefore the arte of more estéeme,
and the secretes more woorthy disclosing.
The first, (which is the Hunting-horse) hath
his vertue, consisting in long and wearie toyle, this other
in quicknes of spéede and suddaine furie. And as the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
a whole day for his tryall, so this other in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
must dispatch in a moment. For the choyce of your
running Horse, it nothing differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your hunting, saue
that you may dispence with sundry faults in this Horse for
a course, which may not be tollerable in a Hunting-horse,
as for example. If your Horse be long and loosely made, that
is, not so short and closely knit together as a Hunting horse
should be, yet for a course he may be excellent, and in shorte
races show great swiftnes. Also if hee be small lymde and
weakely ioynted, although these faults I vtterly disalowe,
and mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>like, yet shall you find many Horses of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
spéede, to entertaine these infirmities.</p>
            <p>Nowe, when you haue a Horse, whose shape, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
and demeanure, promiseth assurance of great swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and you addicted onely to that pleasure or exercise, in
this sort shall you trayne and bring him thereunto. First
béeing faire and fatte taken from the grasse, or bought in
the Market, sée that in all poynts you diet, dresse and order
<pb facs="tcp:8345:38"/>
him, as is before prescribed for your Hunting-horse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two
first moneths, onely let his exercise not be thereafter, but in
this manner.</p>
            <p>Euery morning and euening, ride him into some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayre
Meddow, More or Heath, and there for halfe an howre,
gallop him gently vpon the hand, euen so softly as you can
possibly make him sette downe his féete: but if hee be so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
that he will not gallop at his ease, but with too great
vehemencie, then shall you make him gallop tenne yardes,
then trotte as much, and in this sort gallopping one while
and trotting another, exercise him, till hee vnderstanding
your minde, fall of himselfe to a gentle, light, and easie kind
of gallop: which attained to, practise him therein for two
monethes, not by any meanes putting him to matter of
force, or extreamity, nor euer suffering him to vnderstande
his owne spéede: but that all he dooth, he may doo with lust,
courage and strength, still pressing and striuing to do more
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth. The benefit of this exercise is this: the ground
being so plaine, smoth, hard &amp; firme, without eyther feare of
stumbling, or doubt of too great toyle, and your labour so
moderate, your Horse shal learne a true nimble stroke, and
withall, so couche his body thereunto, that when you shall
neuer so little force him, he will launch out himselfe in such
wonderfull manner, that what strength and nature may
possibly bring to passe, arte shall asist in the highest degree
that may be.</p>
            <p>Whereas, if you should exercise him vpon ouerthwarts
and deepe groundes, first as the toyle woulde be so weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
that for want of ease, he would rather loyter then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in swiftnes, so would the vncertaintie, and vneuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the earth so alter and breake his stroke, that not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
meanes to lay his body to his length, or to launch out
his legges to the aduauntage of great spéede, hee shall be
made to frame himselfe to a short idle gallop, which albeit
he may be able long to endure, yet will it be so slowe, that it
will breede little profit for a swift course. Some may make
<pb facs="tcp:8345:38"/>
aunswere vnto mee, and say: that forasmuch as I instruct
them vpon the plainest groundes, not to excéede the slowest
ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lop that may be, that thereby I shall as wel wonte my
Horse to idlenes and to a short stroke, as if I did exercise
him on the déepest orethwarts.</p>
            <p>My reply is this: vpon the faire plaine grounds, gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
my Horse at this ease, if at any time I list (as manie
times it must be doone) to make him spring into some good
round speed, I shall both find the grounde so fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and my Horses willingnes so great, that the more I
offer, the mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he shall desire: where on the other parte, if
vpon orethwarts I shall offer it, neyther will the grounde
serue, vnlesse a man will wilfully breake his neck, nor long
can the Horses strength endure it, be hee of neuer so great
ability. Hauing trained your horse in this sort euening and
morning, for the space of two Moneths, keeping him in good
hunting dyet, and finding his spéede and towardnes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
as there is no doubt but it wil, then being at the least
sixe yeres old, you may aduenture to course him more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly.
And if eyther pleasure or necessity vrge you, eyther
runne bell course, or wager. If you doo make any matche,
haue great respect to the nature &amp; propertie of your Horse,
for if you excéede his ability, there is no doubt but you shall
loose wilfully: therfore in this manner regard it. If your
Horse be quick, hote and firie, then is it impossible he should
be tough, hard and durable, wherefore for him, the shorter,
harder and plainer your course is, a great deale the better.
Yet if it haue as we tearme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either inwithes, vpwithes
or downwithes, that is, either running within the side of a
hil, climbing vp a hil, or desending down a hil, it much auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
as wel for recouery of his wind, as the maintenaunce
of his strength and courage. For a hote Horse that runnes
of an euen leuell, vnlesse he be excéedingly straite helde in,
will not onely spende himselfe too outragiously, but also
runne hymselfe out of winde wilfully, which once too farre
spent, is in a course very hardly recouered: wheras if he
<pb facs="tcp:8345:39"/>
haue eyther desent or clymbing, nature teacheth him as
well to be his owne fauourer, as arte in his Ryder to bée
his gouernour. If your horse be still and heauy of himselfe,
slow, starting, alwaies rather crauing, then oft of frée-will
offering, such Horses I say be tough, strong, and durable,
or els for nothing but a Colliers coale-sack profitable, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
for such Horses, the long, déepe, and tedious course is
most auailable, because what want of speede looseth, trueth
and toughnes may recouer. Hauing made a match, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
well aduised to reserue a moneth at the least to dyet
and make your Horse fit in: nay, if he haue not béen before
in dyet for a course, if you reserue sixe wéekes it shal be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
because a horse newly entred into so strickt a dyet, will
for the first fortnight mourne, and fall away excéedingly,
that a moneth will be little enough to recouer his strength,
and bring him to absolute perfection: wherfore for his dyet
and kéeping, let it be in this manner.</p>
            <p>First looke vppon him, and as néere as you can by hys
doung, thicknes of his ribbe, cleannes of his chaule, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
externall parts, iudge in what temper aud state hys
body standeth, and howe farre he is eyther out of case or in
case, for the running of a course. Some Horses will runne
best when they be hie and full of fleshe, which is the worst
and least to be trusted: others when they be but in indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
case, and somewhat poore to looke vpon, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best,
and most to be estéemed: of which of these kindes your
Horse is of, your experience in his trayning must giue you
knowledge. As for them both they haue but one manner of
dyet, saue that you must haue this care, if hee that runneth
hie be poore, then must you in his dyet pamper him, and get
him into lust and strength, making him to endure no more
labour then you are forced vnto for preseruation of his
wind: and let your strongest scowring be a swéete mash of
Maulte, which as it scowreth, so it strengthneth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth,
to him you may spare sweats and night ayrings, or
any other thing that abateth his strength or flesh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:39"/>If that horse which runneth best lowe and poore, be hye
and fatte, then to him must you vse the contrary meane,
which meane I will expresse in a larger manner, shewing
the true arte of dyeting in him, because hee craueth all the
helpes that may be: wishing you to vse the same manner
to all running Horses of what nature soeuer, onely reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
to your discretion, matters of extremity.</p>
            <p>Hauing therefore made your match, and taken such
sufficient time as in good discretion shall be requisite, enter
well into the consideration of the state of your Horses bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
which finding to be strong, ful of lust, and couragious,
through his great fatnes: yet by that meane so pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie, ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and thick winded, that he cannot show that wonderful
spéed and goodnes which otherwise he would demonstrate,
thus enter him into his dyet. First next his skinne, lay a
faire lynnen shéete, because Horses naturally loue to bee
sweetly kept, and the more neate they are, the more proude
and pleasing to themselues: next the sheete, lay a blankette
or two, and ouer them a housing cloth of Canuas or sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
binde these close before your Horses breast, and then
gyrd them on with a Sursingle, stopping it rounde about
with little wispes.</p>
            <p>Thys doone, let your stable wherein hee standeth, bee
made darke, close and warme, hauing continually great
store of lytter lying about him, the reason for these fore
mencioned things is this. First for the lynnen sheete, as it
is neate and pleasing to the Horse, so it carrieth this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
when nature shall so vehemently striue in the
beast, as what through his extreame fatnesse, vnusuall
warme keeping, and continuall rest, hee shall, (as many
times he wil) breake into great sweats, insomuch as when
you come to him, you shall find him all of a water, the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
being next his skinne, euen as the force of nature shall
leaue his working<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so will the lynnen dry, and be no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
anoyance: whereas if the wollen shoulde lye next hys
skynne, it would not onely force him to sweat vnnaturally,
<pb facs="tcp:8345:40"/>
but also fauster and continue his sweates, till it turne to
faintnesse, and then as the sweates procéeding of naturall
causes, strengtheneth, comforteth, and maketh cleane the
body, so those beeing forced, weakeneth, dulleth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
fainte euery part and member.</p>
            <p>For the many clothes before prescribed, they are for
two causes: first, to be a helpe to nature, and an occasion
now and then to sweate as hee sléepeth or takes his rest, if
he be extreame foule, and most aboundantly full of grosse
vmors: for otherwise the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elfe sweates will not chaunce.
And thys manner of disoluing these vmors, is most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and wholesome. The second cause is, a Horse beeing
pestered and as it were loaden with many clothes, when he
shall come to be stript naked and eased of them, will finde
himselfe so light, nimble and deliuer, that in his course hée
will shew the vttermost abilitie he can possible. Againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kept so warme in his clothes, when hee is naked, the
cold ayre will bee so pearcing, that whereas otherwise a
course of three or foure myle, would thrust him into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
fainte sweate, by this meane, such a course shall
but maintaine a naturall heate without sweate or faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>For the darknes of the stable, I haue rehearsed a reason
in the former Chapter, therefore in this place I will yéelde
no other but this: because the Horse shall not distinguish
the day from the night, but being kept darke, take his rest
in both. My reason for the much lytter I would haue hym
continually stand vppon, is this. First, because it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him from the colde dampishnes of the earth, which is
wonderfull vnwholsome. Secondly, because hee shall not
detaine and holde his vrine longer in his bladder then wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
nature would, which if he haue lytter vnder him, hee
will not doo, but if he want vndoubtedly hee will: because
naturally Horses will refuse to pisse vppon the bare plaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
            <p>Lastly, because it will occasion him to lye downe and
take his rest, when otherwise he would not: and hee that
<pb facs="tcp:8345:40"/>
will expect his Horse should take great toyle abroade, must
prouide that he may rest at home. These foresayd reasons
being well considered, you shall consequently see that the
Maunger wherein your Horse f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>deth, be kept sweete and
cleane, without dust, filth, or any other excrament of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse.</p>
            <p>Also haue regard that his Rack be cleane, without cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webbes
or other anoyance, and that there be not any Mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall
neere him to byte or gnaw vppon. For his ordinarie
meate in his Racke, it shall be nothing but Wheate straw
well thresht, gyuen by a sheafe at once, morning and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s much for these generall things, nowe for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particuler matters, they shall ensue in order.</p>
            <p>First, when you come to your Horse in the morning,
(which would be if he be a very fatte Horse, an howre or
two before day, if leane, not before sunne-rise, if neyther
fatte nor leane, then after day, and before sunne-ryse) put
your hande vnder hys clothes, and féele about hys flancke
and rybbes, whether hée be wette or dry, that is, whether
he haue sweat that nyght in his clothes or no, if you finde
he haue and is not fully dry, then leaue him, and let hym
rest vntill such tyme as naturally he dry of hymselfe. If hee
be dry ere you come, or haue not sweat that night, then see

Horse hath dunged before, and let hym smell thereto,

you haue thus wasted an howre or little more, leade him
home againe and set him vp, this we cal ayring of a Horse,
the reason and profit whereof followeth.</p>
            <p>To a fatte Horse that is ayred before day (through the
sharpnes of the ayre, cold dew, and discomfort by want of
day or sunne-shine,) it abateth his flesh, and dryeth vp pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nes,
it refresheth him if he be dull, and causeth courage: it
getteth him a stomacke, it greatly increaseth his wind, and
addes a great desire vnto him to runne and scope. If he bée
leane, and ayred in the pleasantnes of the morning &amp; fayre
sunne-shine, it prouoketh pleasure, and maketh a Horse
proude in himselfe: by reason whereof his strength (which
want of flesh decayeth) is the sooner recouered. For as ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
before day diminisheth flesh, so this augmenteth, it kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
him from lothing his meate, so that you can hardlie
cloy him, but hys stomacke will be ready to receiue meate
as oft as you offer it him: which is the chiefest thing to bée
regarded in a running Horse, because they will ordinarilie
take such loathings to their meate, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they will refuse what
euer you make proffer of, and is no way to be remedied but
by ayring: this kinde of ayring helpeth the Horses winde,
and giues him desire to endure labor.</p>
            <p>If your Horse be in good state of body, neyther too fatte
nor too leane, then the ayring him after day and before sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise,
shall kéepe him in that state, and neither abate nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his fatnesse, but onely help his wind, preserue his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
and make him willing to endure his course the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Being ayred and sette vp, after his legs haue béen well
rubd and chafed, vnbridle him, and giue him the quantity of
a penny wheaten loafe, or as your discretion shal rule you,
(for in these quantities your owne witte must be your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour)
<pb facs="tcp:8345:41"/>
of that breade which is last prescribed for your
Hunting-horse in the former Chapter, which as soone as he
hath eaten, leaue him swéet Wheat-straw in his rack, shut
vp your stable windowes and the doore, and let him rest till
it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

time, after you haue put away his doung &amp; made your sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

he was before: hauing due regard, that during the tyme he
is naked, you let him not stand still, but be working or doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
somewhat about him: for whilst a Horse dooth eyther
sturre himselfe, or hath his Kéeper labouring about him, so
long the Horse will neuer take cold.</p>
            <p>When you haue finished your dressing, leade him out
in your hand to the water, and let him drinke his fill. Now
for that there is great diuersitie in waters, as namely some
smal some strong, some feeding, some scowring, I wil shew
you which water is for which Horse. First for the fat horse
the smallest water is best, as that whose spring issueth from
the Rocke, and runneth vppon stone or peeble, which to the
eye is pure and cleere as Christall. For the leane Horse the
strongest water is good, as that which runneth from some
dunghill, or that which issueth from some common sewer,
so it be refind and sweetned by his course of running, or the
Riuer into which is cast much garbidge, blood, or other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>raments.</p>
            <p>For the Horse that is in good state of body, as neyther
too fatte nor too leane, a meane betwéene these woulde doe
well, as the standing pond water, which is fedde by a fresh
spring, or that which issueth from eyther chaulke or lyme
stone: for that water which I tearme small, as indeede it

               </gap>risheth little, it altogether scowreth and clenseth both
the body and raynes, it preserueth a Horse from the stone,
and helpeth paine in the kydneis: yet is it to the taste both
vnpleasant and vncomfortable. Those waters I cal strong,
are bynding, pleasant, comfortable, and full of nutriment,
<pb facs="tcp:8345:42"/>
yet béeing taken excessiuely, breede many badde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Those waters which are a meane betwéene th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

particulerly, now in generall thus. The lesse water your
Horse drinketh, the better, so that nature through too much
drought be not inflamed: for by drinking you may kil your
Horse, by want you can neuer hurt him. And sith I am
thus farre entred into the treatise of water, I will in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
shew the discommodities that grew, by letting your
Horse drinke vnaduisedly.</p>
            <p>First, if before you course your Horse, you let him drink,
in his course you shall not onely hazard the breaking of his
winde, but also assuredly endaunger the incording or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
him. Besides, in such a case, hee can neyther showe
spéede, trueth, nor any goodnes. If after he hath cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is hote, you let him drinke, you shall eyther founder him in
hys bodie, (which is a mortall disease,) or els so suddainlie
coole his grease, that it will clappe to his hart, and cloy
him so, as eyther hee will die instantly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or els consume and

vnskilfull Horsemen attribute to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uiltlesse diseases, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in such a case, there is no other remedy but st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ong
scowrings &amp; comfortable Mashes.</p>
            <p>If after you haue courst your Horse, and rested him
two or thrée howres, you then in the hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r and shake, that hee
will be in daunger of a Feuer or worse infirmitie: which
shaking, if at any time you see your Horse vse, immediatly
take his backe, and trotte him vppe and downe till hee bée

of water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:42"/>
Now to returne backe to my purpose, after your Horse
hath drunke and is sette vp againe, his legges beeing well
chaft and rubd, let him stand half<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> an howre vpon his bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
which time being expired, gyue him the like quantitie
of breade as you did in the morning: or if you find he eateth
his bread with no good appetite, you may giue him fiue or
sixe handfuls of Oates, well dusted and sifted in a fine siue,
suffering him so to rest till fiue of the clocke in the euening.
At fiue of the clock come to him, put away his doung with
your foote, and giue him of bread or Oates, which you find
he hath most minde vnto, as you shall perceiue, by offering
him first a little of the one, and then of the other, such lyke
quantity as is before prescribed: vppon which let him rest
till it be two or thrée howres within darke night, at which
tyme brydle him vppe, and leade him forth to ayre, dooing
in all poynts as you did in the morning, saue that as in the
morning you leade him to the height of a Hyll, so in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening,
you must leade him vnto the valley neere the edge
of some running Ryuer, where he may receiue the ayre of
the colde water, which is sharpe and pearcing, working
many good effects in your Horse. Thys manner of ayring
is for the fatte Horse.</p>
            <p>The leane Horse would be ayred halfe an howre or an
howre before Sunne-sette. The Horse who is in good state
of body, would be ayred after Sunne-sette, and before day
part. The reasons for which, are before dylated. Nowe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you haue brought your Horse in from ayring, and haue
chafed his legges well, giue him the former quantitie of
bread, and so let him rest till the next morning, obseruing
to spende all the next day in euery poynt like this. It may
be obiected to mee by some of our stricte Keepers, as I
knowe dyuers of that mynde, that thys manner of dyet
is too grosse, and that it will rather nourishe then any way
diminish glutte, fatte, and pursinesse: yet when they shall
with good iudgement consider the want of Hay, and the
extremity of his earelie and late ayring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, and way them
<pb facs="tcp:8345:43"/>
in equall ballance with his foode, they shall finde it no deale
at all too much.</p>
            <p>Hauing therefore spent two dayes in this sort, the thyrd
morning in stedde of ayring him, leade him in his cloathes
to the place appoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d for his course, where when you come
to the stake let him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ell vnto it, and if he will (as manie
will couet) let him rubbe himselfe thereon, and so leade him
to the place of starte, obseruing to leade him with great ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
&amp; care, forcing him as much as you can, both to doung
and stale. If all the way you leade him he refuse to stale,
then being come to the place of start, vnloose his sursignle,
and breake all the wispes vpon the ground vnder his belly,
then by whistling gently with your mouth, procure him to
stale, which vndoubtly he wil doo insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, if he haue not pist
immediatly before. When he hath pist, vnbind his clothes,
and thrust them back with your hand euen to his buttocks,
and so gyrdon your saddle: then doe your selfe pisse in your
Horses mouth, which will gyue him occasion to worke and
ryde with pleasure, and so gette vp into the saddle.</p>
            <p>In which when you are seated, let some person <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or that
purpose appointed, (who hauing a spare Horse to carry
your Horses clothes after him,) stryppe the clothes from
his buttocks, of which when he is disbourdened, fayre and
gently start hym in his course, and make him runne it ouer
couragiously and spéedily. When you are come to the ende
of your course, turne your Horse gently about, and bring
hym to the stake, where let him a little pause and smell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while,
to giue him vnderstanding that there is the prefixed
end of hys labour, to which knowledge hee will attaine in
short space. That doone, gallop him gently as may bee, to
meete the man who bringeth hys clothes, which presentlie
throw vpon him, and gyrde them with the sursingle, then
leaping vpon hys backe, pace him gently home to the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Where when you haue sette him vp, let his legges and
body be well rubd, but no cloth r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>moued, then s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>op the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>single
round about with great wispes, and so being tyed in
<pb facs="tcp:8345:43"/>
hys bridle to the Racke, and hauing good store of lytter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, let him stande thrée howres, or two houres and a
halfe at the least, at the ende of which time come vnto him
and vnbridle him, making him eate out of your hande two
or thrée handfuls of Wheate eares, of that kind of Wheat
which we call Pollard Wheate, because it is without
aunds, that is, not bearded.</p>
            <p>When hee hath eaten them, offer him a Mashe luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme,
made of ground Maulte and water, béeing both
swéete and strong, which when he hath drunke off, depart
from him, and let him rest. At one or two of the clocke in
the after noone, come vnto him, and if hee be thorowe dry,
and the sweat hard baked vppon his hayre, let him be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed,
curried, rubd, and trimd, and so clothed vp againe
warme as he was before, giuing him a good quantitie of
bread of eate, and for that day no water at all, because hys
Mashe must serue in stedde of it, and a Horse for a course,
is neuer to drinke but once in twenty-foure howres. Thys
doone, let him rest till within an howre of sunne-sette, at
which time leade him forth to ayre for two causes, the one
because considering his course in the morning, which was
full of toyle and labour, it is necessary that in his ayring he
take some pleasure, least wonted altogether to things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable,
his courage decay, and he grow dull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spritie:
secondly, that you may haue great respect to hys
dung, and whether he voyde and grease or no, which if hee
dooth, then may you be well assured of his extreame foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and also vnderstand, that your last course dyd your
Horse great profit.</p>
            <p>Hauing ended your ayring and sette him vppe, gyue
him both Bread and sweet Wheat-straw, letting him rest,
and as you spent these thrée dayes, so spende your first fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
at the end whereof, you shall come to haue almost an
absolute knowledge touching the state of your Horses bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
if you will be circumspect and dilligent, as an excellent
Keeper ought to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:44"/>
If you perceiue by this fort-nights spending, that your
Horse is reasonably cleane within, sounde, strong, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rous
to endure his course, yet through some little pursines
and straitnesse of winde, what his harte in willingnesse
would performe, want of abilitie hindereth, then in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
fortnights kéepe, you shall thus helpe it.</p>
            <p>First let him haue Wheate-straw in his Racke as hée
had before, also obserue the same howres for his ayrings,
the same time for his féedinges, and the same manner of
dressing and watring him as in the former fortnight: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you shall alter hys foode in this manner. When you giue
him bread, let it not be the Breade mencioned before, but
bake hym a batch in this sort.</p>
            <p>Take of fine Oatemeale well dryed, two peckes, of
Beanes one pecke, of Wheate a pecke, and of Rye a peck,
let these be ground altogether, and well boulted through a
boulting cloth, kneade thys meale with nothing but newe
Barme and the whites of Egges, putting therto a pounde
and a halfe of swéet Butter y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hath not béene potted. These
beeing well wrought and laboured together, let it be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
baked in great loaues. Thys breade is more harty
and strong then the other, yet it dooth not cloy and feede so
sore as the other dooth. It is quicke of disgestion, openeth a
Horses pypes, and increaseth wind.</p>
            <p>Also during thys fortnight, when you bring your horse
from ayring, you shall gyue him hys Oates washt in thys
manner. Take two peckes of the best whyte Oates, and
let them lye in the sunne for the space of an howre or more,
which doone, lay them betwéene two cleane clothes, and
with a couple of stickes let them be thorowly batted, then
fanne away the hulles from the Oates, which your bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
will driue off, and take the whites of a dozen or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Egges, and in those whites wash your Oates, which
beeing thorowly washt, dry them agayne in the Sunne,
and gyue them to your Horse according as your discretion
pleaseth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:44"/>
Of all foodes belonging to a running Horse, thys is the
lightest, finest, and most excellent for hys wind. You may
also if you please, (finding your Horse grosse and kettie) in
the morning before you ayre him, giue him a new laid egge
or two rawe at hys mouth, which is very soueraine for a
foule Horse, because it scowreth the stomacke, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
long wind.</p>
            <p>During thys fortnight, let your Horse after euery two
dayes rest, haue a course, yet in all, not aboue thrée cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that may be sore in déede, and the rest in a playing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
not exceeding a good round gallop. After euery course
let hym haue a swéet Mashe, because that will clense and
scowre away all such filthines as shall by his coursing bee
dissolued. If your Horse be eyther so old that you dare not
well aduenture to course him so oft as you would, for feare
of decaying hys courage, or renuing of former straynes,
which might bring hym to lamenes: or if the weather bee
such that you cannot course in it, or there be any other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to hinder that exercise, which should bring your
Horse to perfection, and neuerthelesse, you are both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to holde your wager, and also find your Horse in no
good temper, you shall then to bring hym to perfectnesse,
gyue hym a sweate in his clothes in the stable after thys
manner.</p>
            <p>Fyrst you shall stryppe hym naked, then take a blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and warme it hote against the fire, foulding it in many
fouldes: thys blanket thus heated, wrappe rounde about
your Horses bodie next hys hart, pynning the same verie
close and strayte, then lay vppon him two or thrée other
blankets, and two or three good thick Couerlets, gyrt these
about hym with a Sursingle, and make them fast and close
before hys breast, then stoppe the Sursingle rounde about
with great wispes of strawe, and lay him good store of
lytter vnder hym vppe to the bellie. In thys maner let him
stande a quarter of an howre, your stable beeing made so
close and warme as is possible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8345:45"/>
If in that space he beginne not to sweat, lay some more
clothes vpon him: if all that doo no good, then take him forth
of the stable, and leape vpon his back, trotting him in some
faire Court or Close, til he begin to sweat, and then set him
vp again, and lay a blanket or two more vpon him. In this
manner let him sweat for an howre, or an howre &amp; a halfe,
during which time stand by him, and with a cleane cloth,
wipe away the sweat from his face and necke. When hee
hath sweate sufficiently, you shall coole him by little and
little, as first taking away one cloth, and then within halfe
a quarter of an howre another: and so one after one, til you
haue lightned him of diuers, hauing great regarde to haue
some Kéeper with you, who with wispes and clothes, may
all the while rub his face, his neck, his belly, and flanckes,
till with his rubbing and the abating of his clothes, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to be as dry as euer he was.</p>
            <p>When he is thus dryed, and clothed againe after his v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
manner, giue him a swéet Mashe, and all the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
féede him well with breade. These manner of sweates
be the onely meanes that may be, to bring an extreame fat
Horse to cleannesse, and the hye way to bring a leane horse
to such pouerty, that he will hardly be able to goe. As these
sweats be violent, and of great force, so to a fat Horse that
hath strength to endure them, they adde such lightnes, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and pleasure, that they be wonderfull profitable: one
of these sweates, doth take as sore of a Horse as thrée cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
therefore the seldomer to be vsed, and the greater care
to be taken in vsing them.</p>
            <p>If your Horse in this fortnight (beeing vnacquainted
with dyet, or being inwardly hote of himselfe) shal proue so
costiue or bound in his body, that he can either hardly dung,
or dunge more hard then you would haue him, which is a
great signe of vnsoundnes, and sicknes to ensue: then to
remedy that impediment, and preuent daunger to come,
you shall when you bring him from ayring, giue him hys
Oates, washt in strong Ale, the Ale beeing no more but
<pb facs="tcp:8345:45"/>
draynd from them. Thys kind of foode is coole and loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
it is strong and hartie, yet doth a little increase pursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
therefore more fitte for the leane horse then the fatte,
yet in time of neede conuenient for both.</p>
            <p>If this washt meate preuaile not, but that his costiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
continueth, then it shall be necessary for you, to gue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
him that scowring of Butter and Garlike, mencioned in
the Chapter of hunting Horses, which assuredly will loosen
any Horse, yet but in a reasonable sort neither. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
as it maketh solible the body, so it purgeth the head of
impuritie, and increaseth wind. Yet beware you scoure not
your Horse too much, for as to be too extreame costiue, is an
euill signe of sicknes, so to be too much loosened, is a signe of
weakenes, therefore kéepe him in an indifferent temper ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hard then too soft, so the collour of his dunge be good,
which is pale and white, hot redde and hie coloured. And
thus much for this second fortnight.</p>
            <p>Nowe for this last fortnight, which is all you haue to
kéepe him in before you runne your wager, as I sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
so shall you now obserue the same howres for ayring,
the same times for féeding and dressing him, as is before
mencioned: onely his water you shall giue at no certaine
time, but alwaies when you féede him, after hee hath eaten
a little, giue him a dishfull of water, and then let him eate
againe, and then a little more water: and in this manner
let him haue his meate and water together, but haue care
that hee haue no more water then to quench thirst, not to
glut his gréedie nature.</p>
            <p>For this fortnight, you shall let him haue no Wheate-straw,
nor any other thing els in his Racke, and for hys
heade you shall prouide a mussell of Leather, or Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uas,
made like a bagge to come ouer his mouth, with two holes
before his nostrels for to receiue his winde, which beeing
made fast at the toppe of his heade, it will kéepe him from
eating his lytter, gnawing the Rack, Manger, or Walles
about him, and your selfe shal be assured, he eateth nothing
<pb facs="tcp:8345:46"/>
but what commeth from your owne hands. Into this mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
you shal put thrée or foure times euery day, Annyséedes
finely beaten into powder, for your Horse to smell vppon,
and nowe and then to licke on with his tongue, which is
both wholsome, pleasant, and increaseth wind.</p>
            <p>For thys fortnight you shall not by any meanes suffer
him to eate in the Manger, because it may vsually be foule
and vncleane, although you rubbe it neuer so sore, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
to haue a cleane boule, which you may your selfe dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
keepe neate and swéete, neyther put all the meate
he shall eate at one tyme into the boule, for feare of cloying
his eye, and so consequently his stomacke, but put it in by
little and little at once. Let his meate for this fortnight, bée
the bread last prescribed, and Oates washt in the whites of
Egges. Course him in this fortnight as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former, so you
be sure he may haue two whole dayes to rest in before hée
runne for the wager.</p>
            <p>Also the last course you gyue him, let it be in his clothes,
and let him not excéede a false gallop: nay if hee halfe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,
halfe trotte, it shall not be amisse, but profitable, for the
more gently you vse him that day, the more willing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he will
be the next time to accomplish your desire. The first thing
you giue him to eate after euery course, let it be a handfull
or two of Wheate-eares, and a little Musterdséede sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vpon them, to purge his head, and occasion him to neese,
which is very soueraine.</p>
            <p>If in this fortnight hée shall dry inwardly, or growe
sickly, and that you find washt meate preuaileth not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
him, then you shall not by any meanes gyue hym
any scowring, because whatsoeuer entreth into the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
and scowreth downward, beeing compounded (as
it must be) of thinges in some sorte contrary to nature,
must of force weaken and draw lowe your Horse, and then
you shall want sufficient time to gette him into his former
lust and courage againe: but you shall minister vnto hym
a glyster of Sallet-oyle, Mylke, and the decoction of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<pb facs="tcp:8345:46"/>
thys wyll drawe hys bodie into good temper, and
both coole and comfort him.</p>
            <p>There be some Keepers which I knowe, that in such a
case as this, will gyue theyr Horse a handfull or two of
thrasht Rye, or if it be at the time of the yéere, thrée or foure
handfuls of forrage, which is the younge gréene blades of
Wheate or Rye, being sprung halfe a foote aboue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ground.
I disalow of neyther of these, though for myne owne part
I haue little vsed them: therefore I referre the same to the
discretion of them, which shall haue occasion to imploy
them.</p>
            <p>In thys fortnight, I woulde not haue you gyue your
Horse any sweat in his clothes in the stable, vnlesse it be at
the beginni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g thereof, for feare least you thereby draw him
to greater weakenesse then you can recouer. During thys
fort-night, you shall not let your Horse eate any crustes
of Bread, as well to auoyd filthinesse, as for that they b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
very hard of disgestion.</p>
            <p>Nowe lastly, as touching the day in which your Horse
must runne for your wager, thus shall you vse him. First
the night before, you shall gyue him but a very little sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
so that he may bee passing empty in the morning, on
which morrowe haue hym out, and ayre him an howre or
two before day, taking great care that hee emptie himselfe
thorowly whilst he is abroade, then bring him in, and after
you haue well rubd all his foure legges, and annoynted
them thorowly, eyther with Neates-foote oyle, Treane
oyle, Shéepes-foote oyle, or Lynséede-oyle, all which be the
most excellentest oyles that may be for a horse, especiallie
the two last. Then gyue him this foode, take a good bigge
pennie white loafe, and cutte the same all out into toastes,
and toaste them against the fire, then steepe them in Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kadine,
and lay them betweene hote clothes, and beeing
layde before the fire, dry them againe, and so gyue them
to your Horse.</p>
            <p>These be so pleasant and comfortable, that your Horses
<pb facs="tcp:8345:47"/>
emptines, (as he must be wonderfull emptie when hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to his course) shall little agrieue him. If you haue not
this ready to giue him, if then you giue him halfe a peck of
fine Oatemeale well dryed, it shal be as good, for though it
be not so pleasant, yet being so light a foode as it is, it will
both comfort his stomacke, and be soone digested. When
he hath eaten this, put on his Mussell, giue him great store
of lytter, and vnloose his sursingle, that his clothes may
hang loose about him, and so let him stand to take his rest,
till the howre in which he must be ledde forth to runne hys
wager, not suffering any man to come within your stable,
for feare of disquieting your Horse.</p>
            <p>When the howre is come in which you must lead him
out, gyrd on his clothes handsomlie, bridle him vp, and then
take your mouth full of strong Uineger, and spyrt it into
your Horses nostrels, the strength whereof will search and
open his pypes, making them apt for the receit of winde.
Thys doone, leade him to the race, and when you come at
the end thereof where you must vncloth him, hauing the
Uineger carried after you, doo the like there, &amp; so bequeath
him and your selfe to God, and good fortune. <hi>Chè sera sera.</hi>
