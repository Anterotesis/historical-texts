            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our juſt dealing with your Adverſaries, is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of reall Honour to your Perſon, your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

the ignorant, your rebuking the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate;
your remitting the Penitent, your
protecting the Innocent, your keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and conditions of Articles with all men, have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
your proceedings both of Warre and Peace, to be truly
Honourable to them, but eſpecially to us, who have heard
how <hi>Judah</hi>-like <hi>you have ruled with God, and have been faithfull
with the Saints,</hi> Hoſ. 11. laſt. Your ſilence before the Lord
(when <hi>a cloud</hi> was upon the Campe) had great confidence,
when the Lord went before you like <hi>a Pillar of Fire by night,</hi>
ſhining upon your wayes, and telling you, that you ſhould be
to your enemies, as <hi>Threſhing inſtruments with teeth,</hi> Iſa. 41. 15.
and this your confidence in God, what boldneſſe wrought it
before the Battle? and what humbleneſſe of minde after the
Victory? refuſing honour of men, when God had put glory
upon you, in ſight of all the world. It hath been ſaid, <hi>Before
honour goeth humility,</hi> Prov. 15. 22. That may be an humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as of neceſſity; but that humbleneſſe which followeth
honour, is ever matter of laſting praiſe; for, <hi>Honour upholdeth
the humble in ſpirit,</hi> Prov. 29. 23. and victory over a mans ſelfe
is the greateſt conqueſt:
<q>Fortior eſt qui ſe, quàm qui fortiſſima vincit Maenia.</q>
Yea, this your confidence uttered did put life into your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
courage into your Reſolutions, &amp; made your Forces more
<pb facs="tcp:53583:3"/>
forcible and active, ſo, as they did the work of the Lord <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivè,</hi>
both againſt the Presbyterian intereſt, at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and
the Royall intereſt at <hi>Worceſter, For there fell downe many ſlaine,
becauſe the war was of God,</hi> 1 Chro. 5. 22. <hi>God is the judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi>
to whom both parties at <hi>Dunbar</hi> made their appeales,
God hath pleaded the cauſe of his people, and ſince theſe
appeales hath given ſentence for you now twice, <hi>By this I know
thou favoureſt me, becauſe mine enemies doe not triumph over me,</hi> Pſa.
41. 11. The iſſue muſt no longer paſſe under the vaine titles
of meer events and chances of war: <hi>The Kingdom is the Lords,
and he is the governour among the people, all the ends of the earth ſhall
come and declare righteouſneſſe unto a people that ſhall be borne, that he
hath done this. All men ſhall heare and feare, and declare the worke
of God, for they ſhall wiſely conſider that it is his doing. The righteous
ſhall be glad in the Lord, and ſhall truſt in him, and all the upright in
heart ſhall glory,</hi> Pſal. 64. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>It hath been the wonder of all lands, to hear of <hi>England,</hi>
how the meek of the earth here, have formerly borne all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of yoaks and oppreſſions under Royal and Epiſcopal Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and how they have lately riſen like Gyants and men of
might, for recovering their liberties, to defend their juſt rights
and to bring wrong doers to condigne puniſhment. As if the
judgement (againſt <hi>Moab)</hi> written, had been ſealed upon their
hearts, <hi>Curſed is he that doth the worke of the Lord negligently, and
curſed is he that with-holdeth his ſword from blood,</hi> Jer. 48. 10. Neither
regarding Nature, nor Nations, that they might execute Gods
judgements againſt an <hi>Idolatrous people.</hi> And 'tis obſervable,
God had ſaid <hi>diſtreſſe not Moab, Deut. 2. 9.</hi> til <hi>Moab</hi> had thus ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But after <hi>Moab</hi> had committed Idolatry (a ſin againſt the
Nation of <hi>Iſrael,)</hi> he ſhall beare his curſe, that ſpares <hi>Moab:</hi>
any former command of God to the contrary notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

            <p>Now <hi>England</hi> is delivered from her enemies, and the people
dwell ſafely through the mercy of God under your hand, I
humbly deſire this, that after all publicke expeditions againſt

            <p>For my ſelfe, that which made me write, was, that others

               </head>
               <p>The Law of Nature is, That man ſhould love himſelf; for,
<hi>no man ever yet hated himſelfe, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth himſelfe,</hi>
Eph. 5. 29.</p>
               <p>The Law of Nations is, That a man keep himſelfe againſt
the diſorder of Creatures, not containing themſelves within
the bounds of Nature, <hi>As yee would that men ſhould doe unto you,
do yee alſo to them likewiſe,</hi> Luk. 6. 31. All our National Laws are
grounded on this, and relate to this.</p>
               <p>The Law of God is, <hi>To love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, ſoule, ſtrength and minde; and thy Neighbour as thy ſelfe,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53583:6"/>
Luke 10. 27. Where the love of God, muſt be with the deniall
of a mans ſelfe, and of his neighbour alſo. The love of God
knowes no relations, where men love not God; that God in
all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt. Religion,
rebukes all manner of tranſgreſſions,<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> in all ſorts of men. <q>
                     <hi>A
mans neighbour, is as himſelf;</hi> and <hi>he loves his neighbour as himſelfe.
Diligit in proximo, quod in ſe ipſo diligit, &amp; diligit proximum candem ob
cauſam, propter quam diligit ſcipſum.</hi>
                  </q> He (properly) loves his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as himſelf, who in his neighbour loveth God and Chriſt,
whom he loveth in himſelfe, and who loveth his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for Chriſts ſake, for whoſe cauſe he loveth himſelfe:
God and Chriſt, in himſelfe, and in his neighbour, is the rule
of his love to both. Where the image of Chriſt ſhines more
in his neighbour, he loveth him more then himſelfe; but
Chriſt he loveth moſt. And ſeeing the image of Chriſt defaced
in his neighbour, or by him, he loveth him leſſe, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
love that he bears to God. Like <hi>Levi's</hi> ſon, <hi>who ſaid to his
Father and to his Mother, I have not ſeen him; neither did he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his brethren, nor know his own children, for they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
thy word and kept thy Covenant,</hi> Deut. 33. 8, 9. For that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
they bare to God and Chriſt, above themſelves; <hi>They
mortified all inordinate Affections,</hi> they had to their own kindred
<hi>hating their own life, to follow Chriſt</hi> Luk. 14. 26. And thus <hi>David</hi>
did, who loved perfectly, <hi>hated Gods enemies with perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi>
Pſal. 139. 22. and puniſhed thoſe who hated God, whom
they ought to have loved. <hi>A Slanderer, an high-looker, a proud
hearted man I will not ſuffer: he that worketh deceit, ſhall not dwell
in my houſe; he that telleth lyes, ſhall not tarry in my ſight:</hi> Pſal. 101.

               </head>
               <p>The firſt ſort of theſe Freedomes is <hi>Naturall;</hi> and in perfect
Nature, it was perfect Freedome. Then man loved God, for
that man ſaw in the perfect nature of God, and had man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered
in that perfect ſtate, man had been perfectly free to
this day.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of Freedome, is <hi>Con-naturall,</hi> For though
men be free-borne, yet are they borne under the Lawes of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53583:6"/>
their Nation;<note place="margin">Deſtroy.</note> and the lawes of our Nation do not <hi>annihilate,</hi>
but only determine our naturall freedome.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of Freedome is <hi>ad-naturall;</hi> becauſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
addeth ſome thing to Nature, to regulate, and to order
mans Freedome, The Law of God gives directions to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the freedome of Nature, and of the Nation; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
gives reproofes to correct the imperfectneſſe of them
both. As men failed touching the law of Nature, ſo they
fell under the Law of Nations; and as men failed of the law
of their Nation, ſo they fell under the law of God, and as
their ſin was greater, ſo they fell under the ſorer rebuke and
puniſhment; and greater offenders, the rather ſtood in need
of the blood of Chriſt, <hi>ad redemptionem,</hi> to make a Purgation:
Of the ſpirit of Chriſt, <hi>ad reſipiſcentiam,</hi> to make them know
their ſin and to repent of it: Of the Rod, <hi>In correctionem,</hi> for
a reproofe among men for their ſcandalous offences againſt
themſelves, againſt the people, and againſt God: And when
the ſword of the ſpirit did not cut men off from their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
but they brake all bands; then Nature took the help
of Lawes, and men appealed for juſtice to them that bare the
ſword, to defend their naturall Liberties; and (for recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Nationall Freedome) did with the ſword of the
Magiſtrate puniſh offenders againſt God and the People; and
the rather, when tranſgreſſors continued impenitent, impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
and irreconcileable.</p>

               <p>The Lawes of Nature, Nation, and of God, are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
one to another: God is above the people, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

give place to the Publike Intereſt of the People, and of the

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53583:7"/>
in his policy, Chriſtian Magiſtrates muſt doe in piety. For
thus God himſelf took part with Nature, puniſhing <hi>Caine</hi> for
ſhedding <hi>Abels</hi> blood, <hi>Gen. 4.</hi> Burning <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi>
for injury don to righteous <hi>Lot</hi> by that wicked people, <hi>Gen. 19.

               <p>Firſt, God himſelfe hath preſcribed to all people Lawes to
keep up Nature in Freedome, and to rebuke the unnaturall,
<hi>Gen. 9. 6. who ſo ſheds mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed;</hi> not
by force and violence, but by courſe of Law. It is a Law of
God, that reſpects not <hi>the perſons of man:</hi> his blood muſt be
ſhed, for the blood ſhed by him, who ever he be, <hi>Numb. 35.
30. No ſatisfaction may bee taken for him.</hi> After this, Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to helpe it ſelfe among the people; as in caſe of <hi>Adultery,</hi>
it is ſaid, <hi>It is an iniquity to be puniſhed by the Judges, Job 31. 9. 11.</hi>
Then men made Covenants with one another, and bound
them each to other with Oaths and Proteſtations. As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Gen. 31. 48.</hi> and between <hi>Abraham</hi> and
the families of <hi>Eſcol, Aner</hi> and <hi>Mamre, Gen. 14. 13.</hi> and this, in
order to preſerve the peace of their families, and to recover
their rights from that people, that ſhould infringe them. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
when <hi>Lot</hi> was taken captive by <hi>Chederlaomer, Abraham</hi> and
his confederates made warre upon, and recovered <hi>Lot</hi> out of
their hands verſ. 12, 14, 16. Alſo, <hi>Jonathan made a Covenant with</hi>
David, <hi>becauſe he loved him as his owne ſoule, 1 Sam. 18. 3.</hi> and
ſecured him againſt <hi>Saul</hi> his father, chap. 20. 4. entred a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

doe it for him.</hi> verſ. 12, 13, 16, 17. David <hi>ſware him</hi> v. 23. <hi>The Lord
is between me and thee for ever, 41.</hi> Afterwards it became a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Religion in all ſorts of Men and Nations, to keep their
Covenants, Leagues, and Oathes between them made, and in
caſe of breach, they did right themſelves by puniſhing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders;
even as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did juſtice on his brother <hi>Benjamin, and the
men of Gibeah,</hi> for the rapine and murder committed upon the
<hi>Levites</hi> wife, againſt that brother-hood that was between

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53583:7"/>
and recover their liberties: they did appeale to God to doe

put ſuch principles of Reaſon and common Equity; as might
conform Men and Nations in their dealings each with other,

                  <hi>Libertas (in naturali eſtimatione)
proxime accedit ad vitam ipſam,</hi> and men have this liberty, by
a divers right, <hi>viz.</hi> of Birth, of Purchaſe, and of Gift; and again
men often make forfeiture of their liberties, <hi>viz.</hi> by gift, by
ſale, by force, by tyranny, by ſtealth, and by idleneſſe.</p>
               <p>1 There is a Liberty by Birth, which was <hi>Pauls</hi> freedome,
<hi>I was free borne,</hi> Act. 22. 28. Where a man is born to live, there
he hath right to eate and to drink, that he may live: and he
hath a right to worke, that he may eate and drinke; yea,
and a liberty to buy and to ſel for his living, where he is born.</p>
               <p>2 Some have their Liberty by Purchaſe, this was the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions
caſe, <hi>with a great ſum of money obtained I this Freedome,</hi>
Acts 22. 28. And having purchaſed their Liberty, they are in
all things inabled to doe for their livings, as men free-born,
may doe.</p>
               <p>3 Some have their Liberty by Gift, as when <hi>Abraham</hi> had
reſcued <hi>Lot,</hi> and the <hi>Sodomites</hi> that were carryed captive; the
King of <hi>Sodom</hi> ſaid, <hi>Give me the perſons, and take thou the goods,</hi>
Gen. 14. 21.</p>
               <p>Now looke, as men (thus) obtain the freedome of their
perſons, ſo their goods are their own proper right; to wit,
the goods they poſſeſſe by inheritance, by purchaſe, by
gift, or by their labour procured; no man may take them
away to his owne uſe, without conſent of the owner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For God hath ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale,</hi> Exod. 20. 15.
<hi>The Prince ſhall not take of the peoples inheritance by oppreſſion, to
thruſt them out of their poſſeſſion, he ſhall give his ſonnes inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance

Ezek. 48. 18. Liberty doth not intrench upon Liberty; Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
may not deſtroy the peoples Liberty; the Princes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
cannot aboliſh the peoples Propriety. Naboths
<hi>Vineyard was his owne inheritance,</hi> and he might chuſe whether he
would part with it or no, wherefore King <hi>Ahab</hi> deſired not to
take it by force from him, but offered to buy his conſent, and
to give <hi>Naboth</hi> a better vineyard in exchange for his. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
none but a <hi>Jezabell</hi> would wreſt out of a mans hands,
that poſſeſſion, which God and Nature had made properly
his owne: whether it be a poſſeſſion of his wife, his children,
or his eſtate, which is of leſſe value, <hi>vide 1 King. 21. 1—5. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
jus Divinum &amp; Naturale nihil licet magiſtratui, P. Martyr.</hi> The
Magiſtrate may doe nothing to diſpoſſeſſe a man of any thing
which is the mans right from God or Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Distinctio dominorum &amp; proprietas poſſeſſionum eſt juris divini,
juxta mandatum, non furtum facies, ſicut, non licet ulli regi poſtulare
alterius conjugem. Bucan. loc. de Magiſt. q. 75, 76, 77.</q> The diſtinction
of rights, and the Propriety of poſſeſſion is of divine right, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that commandement <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale.</hi> And it
is no more lawful for a King or any other Magiſtrate, at his
pleaſure, or, and for his own uſe to take away a mans goods
(whereof hee ſtands lawfully poſſeſſed) no more then it
is lawfull for a King to require another mans wife.</p>
               <p>4 There is alſo a liberty by Gods Grace, Which puts the
right of all things under the dominion of beleeving perſons.
<hi>All things are yours,</hi>

Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But however beleevers in Chriſt, have right to all, yet this
right gives them no liberty to ſteale, or to take to themſelves
that which is another mans, nor to poſſeſſe themſelves of any
thing, more then becomes theirs by birth, gift, purchaſe, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or by conqueſt, <hi>Deut. 20. 14.</hi> And in well-doing, the
Lawes of God, Nature, and of Men are their protection in
their juſt poſſeſſions, brethren, <hi>you are called to liberty, uſe it not
as an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another,</hi> Gal.

Againe, Mens Liberties are loſt many waies; 1. Some give

liberties being conquered in war, <hi>Deut. 20. 10, 11, 14.</hi> 5. Some

A Father and a Mother are equally impowered, to bring

imagine the Father ſhould endeavour the deſtruction of the

So here in <hi>England,</hi> even now is Law, the ſame that
Chriſtians in primitive times were commanded by.</p>
               <p>2. Here is a Church in <hi>England,</hi> though without Biſhops;
for in our Saviour Chriſts time, before Biſhops were, there
was a Church, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the rocke</hi> of <hi>Peters</hi> faith confeſſed, <hi>Matth.
16. 15, 16.</hi> And this was before there was yet any ſuperiority of
diſciples or of Miniſters. For what preheminence had the twelve
Diſciples over one another? who were alike called by Chriſt,
alike ſent forth into the world, and had the ſame ſucceſſe to
have the <hi>ſpirits ſubjected</hi> to them, In Chriſt their maſters daies;
and the ſame parity was among the ſeventy Diſciples, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the twelve. <hi>Peter</hi> (as the mouth of the reſt) had the honor
to confeſſe <hi>Chriſt, the ſonne of God,</hi> that rocke, on which the
Church is built. But Chriſt forbids his Diſciples to exerciſe
Lordſhip over one another, as the Gentiles did, ſaying, <hi>Hee
that will be greatest among you, let him be as him that ſerveth,</hi> Matth.
10. 42, 43. Let them be more zealous, active, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in their ſervice, who have received from God more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
parts.</p>
               <p>Againe, there was no Biſhops, nor Biſhops over Biſhops,
when it was ſaid, <hi>The Lord added to the Church, ſuch as ſhould be
ſaved,</hi> Acts 2. 41, 47. Where the Church conſiſted of them <hi>that
beleeved, having heard the word, and were to be ſaved.</hi> No menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Biſhops nor of Officers under them. Then afterwards
we read of <hi>Deacons, Acts 6.</hi> And of <hi>Elders, Act. 14.</hi> and of a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53583:20"/>
                  <hi>Church at Corinth, 1 Cor. 1. 1.</hi> yea, ſeven times mentioned in
<hi>1 Cor.</hi> chap. 14. when in the Church every one ſpake accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his gift, <hi>as any thing was revealed to him that ſat by, ver. 30.</hi>
The Saints made a Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> though yee read not of
any Biſhops there then.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Paul 1 Tim. 3. 5.</hi> doth ſpeake of Biſhops, <hi>Ruling their
owne houſe, and taking care of the Church of God,</hi> and <hi>1 Tim. 5. 17.</hi>
counts them <hi>worthy of double honour, who labour in the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
and <hi>Tit. 3. 9.</hi> he commands that they be able by <hi>ſound
doctrine, to exhort, and convince the gain-ſayers.</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> bids
them, <hi>Feed the flock of God, as much as in you is,</hi> and be not Lords
over (or <hi>over rule not) that heritage,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 2, 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Where note, that there ought to be no Lords
Biſhops over the flock of God; And that the people, called
the flock of God (becauſe <hi>purchaſed with the blood of Chriſt,)</hi>
are Gods Clergy, as much as Biſhops. That Elders are to
feed the flock of God, and by feeding them to exerciſe rule
over them. And the higheſt perſon in the Church, that hath
higheſt place among the people, hath but the power, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
which ſignifieth to <hi>feed,</hi> and <hi>Matth. 2. 7.</hi> to rule, and expreſſe
a kind of ſimple rule, and authority, ſuch as by feeding the
ſheep, ſhepheards have over them. Here it appears, that when
the Church of God had Elders to feed them, no men might
be Lords therein, nor over-rule them, but feed them rather:
And yee may obſerve, that when <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 12. 28.</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>helps in Government,</hi> he names <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Teachers,
Workers of Miracles;</hi> But he names not either Biſhops, Elders,
or Deacons: Shewing, that they are not (that <hi>unum neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,)</hi>
mainly neceſſary in the Church. And however they
are (by ſome) numbred among helps in Church Government;
yet if they be not mainly neceſſary, they are not greatly to be
contended for: for helps in Government, are (but) of the <hi>benè
eſſe,</hi> not of the <hi>eſſe</hi> of the Church; for there was a Church, and a
Church governed, before Biſhops were in being, or once ſo
much as named in the Church of God. And although theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
helps in Government, be taken away from amongſt us,
yet here is a Church in <hi>England</hi> ſtil without Biſhops: For gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
the Biſhops did (but) pretend to help in the Government
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53583:20"/>
of the Church, the moſt of them <hi>found occaſion</hi> againſt both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
&amp; People, <hi>concerning the law of our God,</hi> Dan. 6. 5. who (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a ſnare inſtead of an helpe) were juſtly taken away, the
Church of <hi>England</hi> ſtil abiding a Church without Biſhops.</p>
               <p>And <hi>if your meaning be,</hi> That we have no Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> No
calling to the Miniſtry in the Church, becauſe there bee no
Biſhops to give ordination.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, we muſt ſoberly diſtinguiſh (as before, between
the Eſſentialls and the Circumſtantialls of a Church, ſo
here) between the <hi>Eſſentialls</hi> and the <hi>Circumſtantialls</hi> of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Call.</p>
               <p>The Eſſentialls of a mans Call to the Miniſtry conſiſts in
Chriſts gifting men for the office; or in Chriſts <hi>putting into mens
hearts the word of reconciliation,</hi> to miniſter thereof to men,
<hi>2 Cor. 5. 20.</hi> 2. In his giving ſuch men <hi>willing hearts to preach it</hi>
1 Cor. 9. 16. Ordination it ſelf, is but <q>
                     <hi>an act of conveniency in
reſpect of order, not of neceſſity to give men power to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</hi>
                  </q>
And for ordination by Biſhops, that is a circumſtance
leſſe neceſſary to the Miniſters Call. It had its time, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
expedient for ſuch as would enter in by the door (which
is Chriſt;) but ordination by Biſhops was never abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to a Miniſters Call.</p>
               <p>The Circumſtances convenient to the Call of a Miniſter, be
divers, 1. Some be <hi>primo neceſſariae,</hi> and precedaneous to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
in this Call. As 1. <hi>Nomination</hi> from among belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<hi>ſuch as have gone in and out with us,</hi> this <hi>Juſtus</hi> and <hi>Matthias</hi>
alſo had, <hi>Act. 1.</hi> 2. <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> with prayer, which
came inſtead of caſting of lots. 3. <hi>Examination</hi> of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
<hi>1 Tim. 3. 9, 10.</hi> 4. <hi>Separation</hi> to the worke of the
Miniſtry which <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> had, <hi>Act. 13.</hi> Which alſo,
is called (of ſome) by the name of <hi>Ordination;</hi> and indeed,
hath been in uſe (as here we ſee) before there were Biſhops to
uſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>2. Some Circumſtances, be ſuccedaneous to this Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Miniſters. As 1. <hi>Recommendation</hi> from knowne Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
which <hi>Titus</hi> had, <hi>1 Cor. 16. 10.</hi> 2. <hi>Election</hi> to ſome place,
which <hi>Paul</hi> had to <hi>Macedonia, Act. 16. 4.</hi> 3. <hi>Approbation</hi> of the
people, in that place, <hi>Who gave up themſelves firſt to God, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53583:21"/>
then alſo to us by the will of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 5. All theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
doe reſpect the <hi>Bene eſſe,</hi> or the good conſtitution of
the calling to the Miniſtry; but the <hi>eſſe</hi> of their Call, requires
them not, ordination is no part of the Miniſters Call from
God; for Chriſt is the doore, Chriſts gifting men for it,
and his inclining gifted men to miniſter of that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
is that <hi>unum neceſſarium</hi> to a Miniſters Call. Such an
one <hi>glorifies not himſelfe, to be called a Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> but, <hi>hee
that is called of God</hi> Heb. 5. 5. For this cauſe, the Biſhops (at the
ordination of Miniſters) had in uſe to move this Queſtion, <hi>Are
you perſwaded, yee are truly called to this Miniſtration? Vide, Book of
making Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons.</hi> Other men have ſent forth
Miniſters to the work, as well as Biſhops, and other people
have called Miniſters to the places of their miniſtration;
As hath been already proved. From all which premiſes, it is
plaine that the people of <hi>England</hi> have a Church, and have
Miniſters lawfully called, even now, though there be no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of Biſhops to make them ſuch.</p>
               <p>3. Here is a State, though without a King, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old had,
before there was any King in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And when that Common-wealth
(after <hi>Joſhua)</hi> ruled by Elders for three hundred ſeventy
nine years together. See <hi>the book of Judges:</hi> and thoſe <hi>Elders obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a good report through faith,</hi> Heb. 11. Al this was don before (yet)
<hi>God gave them a King in his wrath,</hi> and before King <hi>Saul</hi> plaid
the Tyrant over that people, as an executioner of Gods wrath,
which was ſpoken of him, <hi>1 Sam. 8. 11—18.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True Kings, Biſhops and their Laws were ſet up by men for
<hi>helps in Government</hi> of this State, Church, and Commonwealth;
but the people lacking help of them, and being ſnared by them,
they have been rooted out by the Truſtees of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
yet in want of a King, here is a State ſtill: In the
want of Biſhops, here is a Church ſtill; And in the want of
(the Statutes of <hi>Omri)</hi> the Biſhops Lawes, I mean, their lacks
not Lawes to Rule and Governe the people by, even now;
though lawleſſe perſons grudge, and acknowledge them not,
for even the Souldiers, or ſome of them have (by law) ſuffered
for their own evill doing.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if men doe onely that is right in their own eyes,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53583:21"/>
it is not for want of Rulers, nor with the toleration of the
Magiſtrate, let not our State beare blame for that.</p>
               <p>But why may not he <hi>(meaning the King of</hi> Scots) deſire his
owne,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">objection </seg>5</label> his owne inheritance?</p>
               <p>No man can be right Heire to any earthly Kingdome,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſince
Chriſt <hi>the Heire of all things</hi> was deprived, and Crucified; Duke
<hi>William</hi> got his power over this Kingdome, not by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but by Conqueſt, and the Heire was (in this Family)
put beſides the Crowne, and many more ſince that, as <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therus
Philodemus</hi> largely ſheweth; Now the King of <hi>Scots</hi> (for
whom you plead) muſt either plead Conqueſt from the
Conquerour, or ſucceſſion from his Father (becauſe you ſay
this Common-wealth is his owne) whereas indeed, neither
Victory, nor Succeſſion gives any man right to reigne over a
people, only <hi>Reddit idoneos,</hi> it makes men fit, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ti Rex Jac.</hi>
Moreover, the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> were formerly ſuch as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did chuſe, as Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> in his Appeale hath obſerved,
from the forme of their Oath; for when King of <hi>England</hi>
were Crowned, they bound themſelves by Oath to rule the
people according to the Lawes of this Nation; alſo, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
either choſe, or accepted them for their Kings, hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
engaging their Allegiance to them. The old King <hi>Charles,</hi>
by his Hoſtile Breaches of his Oath, diſſolved the people
from their Bond, and from their Obedience too; he forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Kingdome, and ceaſed to be King. As for the King
of <hi>Scots,</hi> he had neither election, nor approbation from this
Common-wealth, nor from the Repreſentative thereof, the
Commons in Parliament; and his claime without the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
conſent, gives him no more title to reigne here, then
<hi>Abſalom</hi> had to rule <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who deſigned to be King, while
<hi>David</hi> was King there, and ruled well alſo; for ſo the People
of <hi>England</hi> have choſen, or accepted other Governours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Liberty; their Liberty being, as theirs was in
the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who <hi>deſired Elders,</hi> Judg. 8.
22. Chap. 11. 6—11.</p>
               <p>Ah,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">objection </seg>6</label> they have taken away the life of the former King, a vertuous
King, a Divine King; and they will have none of his Race to reigne
after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:53583:22"/>
If his life be taken away, it was not for his vertue, nor for
his Divinity neither. Where were his vertues ſeen, in his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
governing? he proclaimed, and waged warre againſt his
beſt Subjects, the Parliament, and his good People; was this
a vertue in a King, ſet up to fight for the People? for this,
the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament have declared him a
Tyrant: now Tyranny is no vertue; and when (in the face
of Death) he uſed a forme of Prayer taken out of Sir <hi>Philip
Sidny's Arcadia,</hi> he proved himſelfe neither Vertuous, nor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;
and if his Sonne walking in his Fathers ſteps, be alſo
caſt off from reigning in <hi>England,</hi> it is according to Gods
Law. <hi>If he beget a Sonne that is a ſhedder of bloud—ſhall he then live?
he ſhall not live, he hath done all theſe abominations, he ſhall ſurely
dye, his bloud ſhall be upon him,</hi> Ezek. 18. 9—13. by which Law, he is
caſt out of this Kingdom, and out of the Land of the living too.
Thus <hi>Jehu</hi> rooted out murderous <hi>Ahab,</hi> and all his race; ſo
Jehu <hi>ſlew all that remained of the houſe of</hi> Ahab <hi>in</hi> Iezreel, <hi>and all his
great men, and his Kinſ-folke, and his Prieſts, untill he left none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,</hi>
2 King. 10. 11.</p>
               <p>True it is, Kings were of old <hi>Divine,</hi> being promiſed of
God to <hi>Abraham, Kings ſhall come out of thee,</hi> Gen. 17. 6. And
ſome were by Gods appointment anoynted Kings, as <hi>Saul,</hi>
and <hi>David;</hi> but of all Kings ſince Chriſts death, it may be
queſtioned, <hi>Whoſe are all theſe?</hi> For after the Scepter departed
from <hi>Shiloh,</hi> what man, after Chriſts death, was ever Anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
King by Gods Command? After the <hi>Jewes</hi> had killed the
Heire, they ſaid, <hi>So the inheritance ſhall be ours,</hi> Mat. 21. 38. It
became (indeed) theirs by force of violence, becauſe they
ſeized on it, not by courſe of Nature, nor by inheritance,
nor gift, but Conqueſt made Kings; Kings indeed were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame,
