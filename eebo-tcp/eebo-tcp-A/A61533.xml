            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

petty enmities: and each of these quoting Bible to palliate his mad, and exorbitant opinions; I sigh'd, and it grieved mee to see popular easinesse, and well-meaning abus'd by Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous self-seeking men; for there is a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is born to bee the plague, and disquiet, and scourge of the Age it lives in; that gladly sacrifice the publike peace to

private interest; and when they see all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with joy warme their hands at those unhappy flames, which themselves kindle, tuning their merry Harps; when others are weeping over a kingdomes fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
            <p>But above all, it pierced my heart to see the Clergy in such an high degree accessory to the civill distempers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb facs="tcp:100856:6"/>
that have every where shak'd the Foundations of Church and State; so that (as a Catholike noted) there hath been no floud of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, but did spring from, or at least was much swel'd by their Holy-water. I search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Evangelicall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and there was nothing but milde and soft Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, I inquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the breathings of

the Spirit, and they were pacificatory; I wondered from what Precedents and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture incouragements these men deduc'd their practises; and at last was forced to conclude, that they were only pretended Chaplaines to the Prince of Peace; Those Torches that should have been for saving Light, were degenerated into fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands; Those Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets

to the favour &amp; advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of private ends; for the people are to the Polititian like tools to the Mechanick, he can performe nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, they are his wings, his wheels, his Im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plements, the properties that he acts with.</p>
            <p>That this may be done effectually, there must be an excellency in these following slights.</p>
            <p>First, To assign such a cause of grievances, and such a course for redress, as may open a way to the alteration he ayms at: as if he means to alter the Government', or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross
<pb facs="tcp:100856:23"/>

               </note> he must doe it gradually, and by peece-meale; for
<pb facs="tcp:100856:23"/>
that which at one view would bee a Mormo to fright them, give it them in small parts, and they will digest it well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hee must compose his very garbe and gesture: 'tis a great matter to tell a lye with a grace; as, if Religion be the Mode, he must in his tales knock his breast, attest God, and invoke imprecations upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, if hee does not doe that, which hee never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
