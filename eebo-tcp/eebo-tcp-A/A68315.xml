            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Queſt. 2. Wither he thinketh that any Leitourgies / or preſcript formes of prayer may be impoſed vpon the church: and whither al read and ſtinted prayers be mere babling in Gods ſight? Anſ. I finde in the worde of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Q. 4. Whither he thinketh that the Sacraments which are publikly adminiſtred in the church of England be true Sacramentes or no? A. I thinke that the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes as they are miniſtred in theſe publike aſſemblies / are not true Sacramentes: and ſeale not the fauour and bleſſing of God vnto them. Q. 5. Whither he thinketh that the lawes and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church of England now by authoritie eſtabliſhed be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Antichriſtian / or no? A. Becauſe the lawes decrees and canons of your church are ſo many and infinite / I can not iudge of them al / becauſe I know not al: but this I ſay / that many of them / as alſo your Eccleſiaſtical courtes and gouernours / are vnlawful and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian. Q. 6. Whither he thinketh that ſuch as haue bene baptiſed in the church of England / ſince Queene Eliſabethes reigne / haue bene rightly baptiſed / or ought to be baptiſed againe? A. I thinke as before of yowr Sacramentes / that they haue not bene rightly baptiſed / according to the inſtitution of Chriſt: Yet that they need not / neither ought to be baptiſed againe. (I doubt leaſt the Arch B. hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my anſwer of rebaptiſing / cauſed it to be left out of the queſtion and my anſwer / taking that which might beſt ſerue their owne turne / to bring vs into ſuſpicion of error / and hatred.

Then Judge Anderſon cauſed this queſtion to be moued to me. Q 7. Whither the church of England as it ſtandeth now eſtabliſhed / be the true eſtabliſhed church of Chriſt: and whither the people therin / be the true and faithful people of God / or no. A. I thinke that theſe pariſh aſſemblies as they ſtand generally in England / are not the true eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb facs="tcp:13497:6"/>
churches of Chriſt: and that the people as they now ſtand in this diſorder and confuſion in them / are not to be held the true and faithful people of Chriſt. Here the Judge Anderſon took exception
<stage>(as the B. of Lond. alſo)</stage>
at theſe wordes
<stage>(pariſh aſſemblies.)</stage>
I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered the Judge / that I could not for ſome weightie reſpectes ſpare him that word: for I doubted not / but that the Lord had many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and elect veſſels among them / whom he wil in his good time cal forth / whom it became not me abſolutely to iudge leaſt I ſhould enter into Gods ſeat: Yet I could not in the meane time whiles they ſtand members of theſe aſſemblies / count them faithful.

The chief juſtice of Engl. here ſaide that he thought I anſwered very directly and compendiouſly. Here againe / vpon ſome ſpeech that aroſe / the Judge Anderſon aſked me whither I thought it lawful to hang a theef or no? I anſwered that ther were many kinde of theeues / as ſacrilegious theeues / men ſtealers etc. that theſe ought by the lawes of God to die.

Whither it be lawful for the Prince to alter the iudicial lawe of Moſes / according to the ſtate of her countrie and pollicie / or no? A. I ought to be wiſe in ſobrietie / 
<pb facs="tcp:13497:7"/>
and not to anſwer more then I know. Great doubt and controverſie hath bene about this queſtion a long time / but for my part I can not ſee / that any more of the iudicial law was or can be abrogated by any mortal man or countrie / vpon what occaſion ſoeuer / then belonged to the ceremonial law and worſhip of the Temple / for which we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived other lawes and worſhip in Chriſtes teſtament: but that the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gementes due and ſet downe by God for the tranſgreſſion of the moral law / ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be changed or altered / without iniury to the moral law and God himſelfe. Yet this / as al my other anſwers by proteſtation / that if any man can better inſtruct me therin by the word of God / I am alwayes ready to change my minde. Whervpon the cheif Juſtice of Engl. ſaid I ſpake wel: and therfore ſaid if I were in doubt / mine anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ought not to be taken. I ſaid / I doubted not / but had ſet downe my minde. Yet the Bbs. becauſe my anſwer fitted not their turnes / as I thinke / commaunded the queſtion and anſwer to be blotted out.

<stage>(I aſked whither they meant of a publick reformation of the ſtate / or of a private or perſonal reformation of himſelf and his family: it was ſaid / of a publick refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation)</stage>
A. I thinke that no man may intermedle with the Princes office / without lawful calling thervnto: and therfore it is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnlawful for any priuate man to reforme the ſtate / without his good liking and licenſe / becauſe the Prince ſhal account for the defaultes of his publick gouerment / and not priuate men / ſo they be not guiltie with the Prince in his offences / but abſteine and keep them ſelues pure from doing or conſenting to any vnlawful thing commaunded by the Prince / which they muſt doe as they tender their owne ſaluation. Q. 11. Whither he thinketh that euery pariſh or particuler church ought to haue a Preſbyterie? A. The holy gouernment of Chriſt belongeth not to the prophane or vnbeleeuing / neither can it without manifeſt ſacrilege be ſet ouer theſe pariſhes as they now ſtande in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion / no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce made betwixt the faithful and vnbeleeuing / al being in differently receiued into the body of the church: but ouer euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer congregation of Chriſt ther ought to be an elderſhip / and euery ſuch congregation ought to their vtter moſt power to endeuour thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

During this time / others of my brethren were examined / which being done / I was called for in vnto them where Cant. ſhewed me the ſtatute of ſupremacie / and aſked me if I would take an oath according to the ſame.

I ſaid it was not true / they denyed not / neither defied the Pope: but I was ready to giue and performe as much vnto my Prince as any true ſubiect ought to doe. He aſked me againe whither the church of Chriſt / if the Pruite deny or refuſe to neglect abuſes / may without ſtaying for the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them? I ſaid / that it might and ought though al the Princes of the world ſhould prohibit the ſame vpon paine of death. He aſked me againe whither the church of Chriſt might excommunicate the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce / and who ſhould pronounce it?

Q. We wil then examine yow without an oath. Are yow a miniſter? A. No / I was one after your orders. Q. Who diſgraded yow? A. I diſgraded my ſelf through Gods mercy by repentance. (then after many wordes / they brought forth a paper conteyning certaine articles in manner of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as foloweth) Q. Is is lawful to vſe the Lordes prayer publickly or privatly as a prayer / or no? A. It is a doctrine to direct al our prayers by: but ſeing it conteyneth the doctrine of the holy Scripture / no man can vſe the ſame as a private or publick prayer / becauſe he hath not preſent need to aſke al the peticions therin conteyned / at one time: neither can comprehend them with feeling and faith. Q. Is it lawful or no? I wil heare no pratling. A. It is not lawful for any thing I can ſee by the Scripture for ther is no commaundement to ſay the very wordes ouer: and Chriſt and his Apoſtles prayed in other wordes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their preſent neceſſitie. Q. Is it lawful to vſe any ſtinted prayers either publickly or privatly in prayer? A. They are Apocrypha / and may not be vſed in the publick aſſemblie: the word / and the graces of Gods ſpirit / are onely to be vſed there. Q. Anſwer directly / is it lawful to vſe them publickly or privatly?

I beſeech yow that I may not be vrged by your law: I haue thus long bene cloſe priſoner / and therfore deſire yow to ſhew me wherfore / and not now to entangle me by your law. Q. Is it not yowr law now as wel as ours: it is the Queenes law: Yow are a good ſubiect. A. I am obedient as a true ſubiect. But I took it we had reaſoned of your popiſh canons. Q.

Our meetings are ſecret / as I told yow / becauſe we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbance haue them more open. Our earneſt deſire and prayer vnto our God and our gouernours is / that we might haue them open / and not be inforced to withdraw our ſelues from the ſight of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
