            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Opinion of Witchcraft
VINDICATED.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received yours, and
with it that little treatise
of Witchcraft, which
you were pleased to
send me: which when
I had opened, I found
the Author in his Preface, laying about
him like a <hi>Hercules</hi> furens, or an <hi>Ajax</hi>
mastigophorus, and charging his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
with no less than <hi>Paganisme,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
a plurality of Gods, and ascribing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105893:3"/>
omnipotency to the Devil. This he
doubts not but he shall make good with
the same ease as he asserts it, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
himself and his Reader, to force a
surrender at the first assault. But his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
are not of force enough to effect it,
his strongest arguments being little better
than an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. and his whole Book
standing upon no firmer ground than his
own Supposals. The vast confidence
which he seems to have in the strength
of his Arguments, had made me arm my
self with a more than ordinary care and
circumspection for the sharp encounter I
was like to receive from this great <hi>Goliah,</hi>
but I have since found that I may lay aside
those heavy Arms, and that a stone and
a sling will serve the turn.</p>
            <p>At the entrance of his Book he layes
before you the necessity, in which the
<hi>Eastern</hi> Empire stood, of Juggling tricks
and Impostures, to uphold it's greatness;
and that the heathen Priests were by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
practice arrived to that perfection
in cheating, that they stood not in need
of the Devils assistance: from hence he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105893:3"/>
would infer that the answers given at O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
were no other than cheats put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the people, and the Priests inventions.
But 'tis very improbable that the Devil,
who had the liberty of possessing so many
Bodies (as we find he had by several un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
instances of the New-Testament)
should be debarred that of a wicked Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Priest, or the shrines of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Gods, or, that if he had that freedom,
he would not make use of it, for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of his own Kingdom. After
this he tells you of the great variety of
Impostures used by them, all which he
reduces to four heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Juggling,
Inchanting, Conjecturing, and Divining.
Of these he gives you definitions, <hi>ad ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrium,</hi>
and you must take them on his
word, as if that were as uncontroulable
as the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi>
he sayes that a Familiar was no Devil,
but a confederated person, privy to the
plot, and assistant to the performance. I
do not deny but some cheats of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
have been, and yet are in the World,
but he that from hence concludes that all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105893:4"/>
are so, is but a bad Logician. For my
part, I cannot be convinc'd by such an
Argument, when I find (as I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to prove) both the testimonies
of Scripture and History against it. Nor
indeed, is there any probability, that the
Heathen Priests could so readily give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to all questions (put to them or
the sudden, and <hi>ex improvise</hi>) as to
keep up the credit of their Oracles to that
height they were at for many Ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
neither may we easily suppose that
this miraculous Art of cheating could be
conveyed from one Priest to another, and
not one of so many thousands discover
the deceit to the World; and that of so
great a number, all should be so ready
witted, as to give their answers at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and yet with so much cunning, as
that whatever happen'd, the Oracles
should not be taxed with falshood, which
I believe our Author, if he were put to
it, would find something harder to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
than he seems to think it. Yet all
this he easily believes they did, and by
such tricks magnified their Idols, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105893:4"/>
seduced the common people, for which
cause they were so great an abomination
before God, as that in the Law given by
<hi>Moses,</hi> he so strictly gave in charge to the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> the rooting them out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. To this purpose he quotes
the eighteenth Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth
verses. And this he thinks to be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
a place as any can be brought
from the whole Bible for the proof of
Witches. Here therefore he takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to fall foul with our Translatours of
the Bible, for that, sayes he, they have
falsly Translated the tenth and eleventh
verses, making them more significant to
that purpose than they are in the Original.
Wherefore I think it will not be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
to compare the Authors Translation
of those two Verses and ours with the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> so far as they differ one from the
other: ours runs thus.</p>
            <p>There shall not be found among you
any that maketh his Son, or his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to pass through the fire, or that useth
Divinations, or an observer of times,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105893:5"/>
or an Inchanter, or a Witch.</p>
            <p>Or a Charmer, or a Consulter with
familiar Spirits, or Wizards, or a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the main difference (for I pass
by those of less concernment) is that
instead of a Witch, in the tenth verse
this Author has put the word miracle-monger;
and for a Consulter with fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Spirits, a seeker of an Oracle. Now
in these places he seems much to blame,
for having so peremptorily charg'd the
learned Translatours of the Bible with a
false interpretation, making himself the
only Judge in the sense of the original,
and refusing any translation that suites not
with his fancy, meerly for that reason.
Now the original being rightly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
we shall find but little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
it and our translation, as in that of
a Witch, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
coming from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which
word, if we may believe the best <hi>Hebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
signifies Witchcraft, or fascinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for so <hi>Buxtorfe,</hi> and <hi>Xantes Pagni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
understand it, expounding it by these
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105893:5"/>
words, <hi>fascinum, maleficium,</hi> and <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigium:</hi>
and so <hi>Pagninus</hi> in his transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bible, in which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to come as near the sense of the
original, as was possible for him, has in
this very place expounded the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Maleficus,</hi> which is the same with
our word Witch; <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi>
render it, <hi>Praestigiator,</hi> which has the
same signification with the other, though
our Author takes it for no more than a
meer Juggler, or to use his word, a
miracle-monger. But the word has
more in it than so, for though it be true,
that every <hi>Praestigiator</hi> is a miracle-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
a Juggler, or a Coozner, yet as
we find it alwayes used in Authors, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
a doing of those deceits by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.
As for what he sayes of the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> that it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
an Impostor, I cannot at all conceive
why he should so positively assert it, or
at least why I should believe it, except
he could prove from good Authors, that
the genuine signification of the word is so;
for I do not at all find it any otherwise
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105893:6"/>
than our word Witch has that significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for it is certain that Witches are the
greatest Impostors of the World: and
he were extremely irrational, that would
believe that the Devil does really those
things which many times he seems to do,
and that it is in his power to transform
the bodies of men and women into those
of Dogs, or Cats, or any other Creatures.
Yet as we cannot deny but the Devil,
having a greater insight into natural Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
than ever yet any man has attain'd
to, may perform those things by natural
means, which will yet be beyond the
reach of those who are in the highest rank
among us, and have gone farthest in the
wayes of nature, so we may easily believe,
that he is more cunning in his tricks,
whereby he deceives the senses, and that
many times he seems to change the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
forms of bodies, when he only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the sight by the interposition of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and condensation of air, between
the eyes of the beholders and the object,
or many other wayes which to us are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unknown: But for us to deny
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105893:6"/>
that the Devil can do such things, only
because we cannot tell how they are done,
or to say that he must be omnipotent, to
deceive our weak senses, is so far from a
rational argument, that nothing but the
want of reason can produce such ridiculous
fancies. But to proceed, the <hi>Greek</hi> word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, sayes he, in this place signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
an Impostour, not a poysoner, for it
is ridiculous to think that King <hi>Manasseth,</hi>
and Queen <hi>Iezabel,</hi> exercis'd the Art
of poysoning. Now I find it not at all
necessary to say that they used the Art of
poysoning, though we deny that they
were meer Jugglers: yet I see nothing so
ridiculous in that assertion as he does;
for it may with reason enough be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that Witches do, by their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Devils, infuse poysonous and noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
humours into those bodies which they
desire to hurt: and 'tis likely that <hi>Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth</hi>
and <hi>Iezabel,</hi> being practitioners in
that Art, were not wanting in any thing
that belong'd to their profession. Now
where he sayes that these miracle-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
(as he calls them) were so severely
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105893:7"/>
prohibited in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they acted strange things in the sight
of the people, to confirm them in a false
Religion, I can easily grant him that this
was one cause, but that it was the onely
cause I cannot readily believe, since the
Art was in it self wicked, and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable;
and by consequence so displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God, that he would not suffer it
among his people: and besides, I do not
think that it was the design of all those
that professed this Art, to establish a false
Religion, but rather that they did it for
gain, by fore-telling things to come, as
'tis likely the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> did. As
for what he objects of their being coupled
together with Sooth-sayers, many times
in those places of Scripture, where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made of Idolatry, it is not at all
strange, for where should we so reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
expect to find those wicked Artists,
as with an Idolatrous and ungodly people.
And we may easily think, that the Devil
when he finds a people inclin'd to Idolatry
will not be wanting to the farther deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, so far as his false miracles
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105893:7"/>
and lying wonders can conduce to it:
But to conclude from hence, he seems to
do, that they were prohibited meerly for
upholding it, I see no colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>But here I find my Author endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to perswade the World that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
Magicians were nothing else but
Jugglers, and brought Serpents in their
sleeves or pockets to make a fool of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
by conveying them into the place of
their sticks by some slye trick of Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.
But I find much difficulty in this
cheat; for first, I cannot possibly believe,
that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> told the Magcians
before hand what it was they intended to
do, and if not, how it came to pass that
they were provided of necessaries for such
a cheat; and were so ready at <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s
call, without so much as desiring time to
catch the Serpents, and to pull out their
stings, for fear of the worst (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it had been a kind of jeasting with
edged tools.) But to be so quick at it,
was I believe an Art beyond the reach of
modern Jugglers, But suppose they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105893:8"/>
were furnished with all things requisite,
I cannot see how that could serve their
turns, for we read in the Text, they did
as <hi>Aaron</hi> had done, for they cast down
every man his Rod, and it became a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
and in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is the same,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>et projacerunt unusquis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,
virgam suam,</hi> and the <hi>Septuagint</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> By these
I think it plainly appears that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
cast down Rods, which afterwards
became, or at least seemed to be turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Serpents. Now I believe, our Author
will have enough to do, to show by
what means those miracle-mongers could
make their Rods seem to the eyes of
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the other Spectators, after
they had thrown them down, to be
chang'd into Serpents, and to think that
when they had once cast them out of
their hands, they could recover them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and lay Serpents in their places
(except they could have shown <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
and his attendants, some pretty thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Wall, to employ their eyes in the
mean time) is a whimsey beyond the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105893:8"/>
reach of imagination. And though we
suppose, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Nobles
were such fools, yet <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
were wise men, and one would think,
being concerned themselves, might have
so carefully observed them as to discover
it. But if we could possibly conceive,
that notwithstanding all those difficulties,
it might be a meer Juggle, the Gordian
knot is yet behind, which I will present
to our Author to unty (if he can) which
is that he would be pleas'd to tell me by
what kind of Legerdemain these men
could turn the waters of the Rivers into
blood, or if by any pretty slight of hand
they could make the Frogs come up from
the Waters upon the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and
if they could, why they were to seek at
the bringing of Lice, for to humane reason
this seems as easie as either of the other
two. Here methinks I find mine Author
at a stand; and because he has not his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
ready, I would advise him in the
mean time to say; that certainly that these
Magicians dealt with the Devil, by whose
assistance they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thus far in opposition
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105893:9"/>
to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but that here God
(without whose permission the Devil can
do nothing) thought good to set his
bounds that he might go no farther. And
this, 'tis probable, made them say that
the finger of God was in it, because they
found that power by which they acted,
restrain'd by a greater: for if they had
done these things by slight of hand, they
would only have thought that <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> were more cunning Jugglers than
themselves, without acknowledging that
it was the finger of God that did it. But
I find him yet very unwilling to yield, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
sayes he, whosoever believes that
the Devil could turn these staves into
Serpents, ascribes to him an omnipotent
creating power: But if this be all he sticks
at, I shall quickly remove that obstacle,
by showing upon how little reason it is
founded; for first let him consider the vast
difference which is between creating all
things of nothing, and changing one
thing into another: for by creating we
understand the giving of the first being,
and making not onely the thing, but the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105893:9"/>
matter also, of which it is compos'd.
Now I see nothing of this ascribed to the
Devil by that opinion. Secondly, let
him observe that many times such chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are seen in nature, Serpents being bred
of the corruption of other bodies, even
of rotten Trees and sticks: and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
having had time enough to search into
the wayes of Nature, might probably
follow the same steps which she treads in
changes of this kind, though he might go
faster, and be sooner at his journeys end:
and seeing no man has yet attain'd to that
perfection in Natural Philosophy, as to
know the thousandth part of what may
be done by natural means, it is but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in any one to measure the time which
is requisite, for such a production being
wrought by Supernatural Agents, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seeing no man knows the means by
which it is done (for would not that
man make himself extremely ridiculous,
that should with an ignorant confidence
affirm that 'tis impossible to take the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of a Book by any means sooner than by
writing, because he never knew the Art
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105893:10"/>
of Printing?) Now if he grants that the
seed of a Serpent is in a stick, and that
the Devil of this seed may produce a
Serpent (as he seems to do) and that
sooner than they are form'd by Nature,
for he confesses that Devils may strangely
promote the generation of several Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
if I say this be granted, I may as
well say that he can do it in a minute.
For if by his great skill he can find out
wayes of accelerating generation, why
may not he improve those wayes, by the
greatness of his skill so far as to do that in
an hour, which nature does in a year:
for to say, that in regard the Devils do
these things by application of matter to
matter, they cannot produce a Creature
of it's seed without such a space of time
as to us seems convenient, is to measure
the Devils knowledge by our own, and
to fathom the depth of Nature by the
short line of our understandings. But I
see no necessity of believing that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
chang'd those Rods into Serpents,
neither do I believe it, but rather think
that it was a meer illusion and deceit of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105893:10"/>
the Devils, who might either deceive
the lookers on with an appearance of
what was not really there, or by placing
true Serpents instead of the staves. And
now I would not have this Author take
me up, and say that if I once recede from
the letter of the Text, he may as well
say 'tis a Juggle of the Magicians, for I
have already said that it is not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
that it was possible for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians
to do it by meer humane Art, in
regard that when they threw them down,
they were yet staves; but though we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that it could be done by them, we
may yet believe that the Devil has both
agility, and subtilty enough to effect it.
But if he will, after all this, believe that
the Magicians might, by slight of hand,
conveigh away the staves, and lay Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
in their places, certainly he cannot
think that they turn'd the waters into
blood, and brought up Frogs by slight;
for I cannot see how they could carry
Frogs enough about them to strew the
Land with, neither do I believe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
himself can guess how it might be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105893:11"/>
done, because he silently pass'd by this
place of Scripture. As for the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
which he has given to the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by their tricks, (thinking
from thence to infer that they were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that the tricks of the Magicians,
though such an inference is of small force,
it properly signifies by their Inchantments;
and so <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius, Arias
Montanus,</hi> and <hi>Pagninus</hi> expound it, all
three in the same words, <hi>Incantationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
suis,</hi> and in this his exposition of it he
differs from most, if not all Translatours.
I am of the same opinion with him where
he sayes the Scripture speaks oftentimes
according to the deceived apprehensions
of men, and I cannot deny but it may be
so in this expression of the slaves being
turn'd into Serpents; but that it is so, as
he affirms, in that of <hi>Samuels</hi> being
raised when <hi>Saul</hi> came to consult the
Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> I cannot say, for the
Scripture sayes not that the Witch raised
<hi>Samuel,</hi> and that he was sent by God, is
not so very improbable as he would make
it: for though God to shew his displeasure
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105893:11"/>
against <hi>Saul,</hi> had refused to answer when
he enquired of him, there is no reason
from thence to conclude that he did not
at this time send <hi>Samuel</hi> to him, seeing
God might do it for many reasons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to us: And 'tis probable that if he
had at first answered <hi>Saul</hi> (though he
had received the same answer as he did
now from the mouth of <hi>Samuel</hi>) he had
not been stricken with so great a sence of
his sin, and of Gods anger against him,
as by being first reduced to the extreamity
of not knowing what to do, or whither
to go for counsel, because God had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to answer him. And to say that 'tis
unlikely that God would answer him
when he sought in a forbidden way, is
vain, for we see that he did the same, in
sending <hi>Elijah</hi> to meet the Messengers of
<hi>Ahaziah,</hi> when they were going to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> in the first Chapter of
the second book of the <hi>Kings.</hi> But we
must not look for a reason of all Gods
actions; we find that many times his
great wisdom sees good to do those
things which to us seem very strange, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105893:12"/>
unaccountable. Besides 'tis no small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to perswade us that it was <hi>Samuel,</hi>
that the Witch cryed out, as at some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
accident, being, it may be, frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd
at the sight of one whom she so
little expected: and this, 'tis probable,
made her say that she had seen a God
coming up from the Earth, meaning a
blessed Spirit. As for his Argument
drawn from <hi>Samuels</hi> words, <hi>Why hast thou
disquieted me?</hi> That he was not sent by
God, seeing that could have been no
trouble to him, it is of no force at all,
for those words were spoken to <hi>Saul's</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
and as being words of course, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
no more than if he had said, why
hast thou not suffered my Body to rest?
that is, lye still in the grave: and the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> word in this place implyes no
more than, why hast thou mov'd me to
come up: So this phrase of dead bodies,
resting, and being disturbed, is usual
with us, though we know that they are
not at all sensible of repose, or disquiet.
But if it were not <hi>Samuel,</hi> 'tis very irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
to believe that it was either the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105893:12"/>
Witch, or any confederated person, for
two reasons; first, because it is said in
the Scripture, that <hi>Saul</hi> knew that it was
<hi>Samuel,</hi> and he bowed himself; for it is
not imaginable that any man could so
change his face, as that <hi>Saul,</hi> (who que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless
was well enough acquainted
with <hi>Samuels</hi> countenance) could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by it: and to think that <hi>Saul</hi> saw
him not is as ridiculous, for then why
did he bow himself? Secondly, because
he foretold <hi>Saul's</hi> Death; for if, as this
Author supposes, it had been said by the
Woman at a venture, the more cunning
way had been to have told him that he
should live, for then if he had died, who
could have accused her of falshood? If
he had liv'd she had told the truth: But
to tell him positively that he should dye,
and not only himself, but his Sons too,
and this with a limitation of time, to
morrow, was something too much to be
spoken at a venture.</p>
            <p>The second difference between our
Translation and the Authors is, where he
puts a seeker of an Oracle, for a Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105893:13"/>
with familiar Spirits. Here he tells
you that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is taken in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
sometimes for the gift of Oracling,
sometimes for the person that has such a
gift: this is as much, and no more, than
if he had told you that he is pleas'd to
understand it so; I confess as an Oracler
may be understood, that is, for one that
takes and gives answers from the Devil,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, may have that signification; for
<hi>ob</hi> properly signifies a <hi>Daemon,</hi> or an evil
Spirit, and so the best <hi>Hebricians</hi> expound
it: now this being the true sence of the
word <hi>ob,</hi> I see no reason for blaming our
Translatours, who have not at all erred
from the Original in this place. But he
understands an Oracler otherwise, to wit,
for one that gave answers at a venture,
and only followed the dictates of his own
fancy, counterfeiting strange voices,
thereby to deceive the people, &amp;c. And
so he interprets the <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but how they came by
that signification I cannot tell, for I find
it no where but in his Book. And from
the Scripture I think the contrary may be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105893:13"/>
gather'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>ob</hi> and Python, are
taken for an evil Spirit that possess'd the
person Divining, and not for the person
himself; we read in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Chapter, and the twenty seventh
verse, and a Man or a Woman <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
when there is in them a <hi>Python;</hi>
which words [in them] seem to imply
something of this Nature, and that the
<hi>ob</hi> was some distinct being from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in whom it was, for he could not be
in himself. And we find in some old
Translations, where mention is made of
<hi>Saul</hi>'s turning the Witches out of <hi>Israel,</hi>
'tis said, <hi>Et qui Pythones habebant in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</hi>
But whosoever reads the sixteenth
Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
will be fully confirm'd that this is
the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, except
he himself be possessed with a spirit of
contradiction, for he there shall find
that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was walking he met a
Maid, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> having a
Spirit of Divination (as our Translation
renders it) and in the eighteenth verse,
<hi>Paul</hi> turning himself <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105893:14"/>
said to the Spirit, I command thee in the
name of Jesus Christ to come out of her,
and it came out that same hour. This
methinks shews plainly to any body but
our Author, that this kind of Divining
was done by the help of the Devil. But
it may be he will say (for I know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way that he can answer it) that she
did but deceive the people by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
strange voices, and speaking in a
bottle, or some such Juggle, and that
where St. <hi>Paul</hi> bid the Spirit come out
of her, it is to be understood, that he
bid her Juggling tricks come out of
her.</p>
            <p>But to those that rightly consider
this place, it will plainly appear that
this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was no other than a
Devil; and this being true, I see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to deny that the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> was
possessed with the same Spirit; or that
the <hi>Pythons</hi> of <hi>Manasses</hi> were Familiar
Spirits. Thus I have almost done with
his first Chapter. But I cannot pass by
one argument which he uses, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of it; for I cannot tell, sayes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105893:14"/>
he, how Witches come in here, no, not
how Devils neither, except you believe
that the Devils made answer at Heathen
Oracles, which if you do, I must crave
leave to dissent: truly no man can deny
him this leave, and he may dissent when
he pleases, but I do not conceive my self
obliged to follow his example; for if
they were, as he supposes, onely Jugling
tricks of the Priests, I cannot imagine
how it came to pass that they ceas'd so
suddenly after our Saviours time: begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
sensibly to fall away at the time of his
Birth, and since his Death being wholly
extinguish'd. For the first, we find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
considerable in <hi>Suidas,</hi> who writes
that <hi>Augustus,</hi> who liv'd at the time of
our Saviours Birth, as he enquired of an
Oracle concerning his Successour, had
this answer given him.</p>

at the heathen Oracles, and this
answer is not at all like the fancy of a

Priests Interest, nor the credit of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.
Thus we see how soon they began
to decay upon our Saviours coming: and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105893:15"/>
we find another story to this purpose,
which happen'd at the time of his Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion,
in <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Morals, that part
which is intituled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
why Oracles are ceased, where
he sayes, that a certain company sailing
from <hi>Greece</hi> towards <hi>Italy,</hi> were sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becalmed, and heard a voice calling
one <hi>Thamus,</hi> who was an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and
at that time in the Ship; but he being
called twice gave no answer, but at
the third time he said here am I; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the voice bid him, when he came
at the (<hi>Shelves</hi> in the <hi>Ionian</hi> Seas which
are called) <hi>Palodes,</hi> to publish that the
great God <hi>Pan</hi> was dead; then the Ship
going forward, he did as he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
for coming to the <hi>Palodes,</hi> he publish'd
it from the poop of the Ship; after which
immediately followed a great noise of
many shreeking and lamenting together.
This being told to <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour,
he enquired of the wise men of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
who this great God <hi>Pan</hi> should be,
but they could give him no better answer,
than that he was the Son of <hi>Mercury</hi> and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105893:16"/>
               <hi>Penelope.</hi> But the circumstances being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
it was thought by the wiser sort
to be our blessed Saviour, this happening
just at that time when he dyed upon the
Cross; the Devils making this great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
for that they were from that
time to quit those Oracles by which they
had so long deceiv'd the World. But
however it was, we are certain that from
that time they began to decay extremely,
and in a short time came to nothing; and
the famous Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> was silent
in <hi>Iuvenal</hi>'s time, as we may see by that
expression of his, <hi>Delphi Oracula cessant:</hi>
This their general silence is no small Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that there was something more in
them than our Author supposes; for if
they had been no more than such deceits
as he speaks of, I see no reason why they
might not have been acted as well since
our Saviours time as before, for we do
not find that men are debarred the liberty
of cheating, or that they are less cunning
now than they were then. But it is
probable that God would not suffer the
Devil to stand in such open opposition to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105893:16"/>
his Sons Kingdom, and to carry on the
interest of the Kingdom of darkness, where
the Sun of Righteousness was risen, and the
light of the Gospel was made manifest.</p>
            <p>Now by the Title of his second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he would make you believe that he
there proves, that the Opinion of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
had it's beginning from the Heathen
fables, but when you come to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it self, there is no such thing; indeed
he tells you a story of one <hi>Lamia,</hi> whose
Children were killed by <hi>Iuno,</hi> and that
she out of spight used to kill those of other
Women, and that from thence Witches
(being called <hi>Lamiae</hi>) had their Original:
thus, a man who had never seen a Swan,
might dispute against their being, and say
that the fancy of Swans had it's first rise
from <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Metamorphosis, because he
there speaks of one <hi>Cyenus,</hi> who was
chang'd into the first Bird of that name.
But the weakness of this Argument is so
obvious, that it stands not in need of a
confutation: then he tels you how far the
folly of men (as he calls it) has procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their belief concerning the Actions
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105893:17"/>
of Witches, as if, says he, they could
transform Men and Women into Beasts,
as if they could destroy the fruits
of the Earth, and the fruit of the
Womb, &amp;c. I am of opinion that the
most rational assertors of Witchcraft are
as far from believing that the practisers
of it can change the bodies of Men and
Women into those of Beasts, as he is,
though the common people that search no
farther than the outward senses can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
may believe it. But I see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why we should not allow the Devil
a little more cunning than <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians,
for he grants that they by meer
humane Art could so far deceive the
Spectatours, as to make them believe
that their Staves were turned into Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents;
and I think the Devil may go far
beyond them in the Art of Juggling, as
to do the same with the bodies of Men
and Women: Besides, the Devil has
those advantages which they had not, for
being a Spirit, he can take to himself a
body of what form he pleases, which he
may afterwards transform to any other
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105893:17"/>
shape; so that when we think we see the
body of a Witch transformed, it may be
only the Vehicle of the Devil in her like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And that he can destroy the fruits
of the Earth, or of the Womb, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
or disenable in matters venerial,
seems not at all hard to be believ'd, seeing
humane Art can reach so far: as for his
raising of Winds and Tempests, we
need no other Argument than that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
we have in the first Chapter of <hi>Iob,</hi>
to convinee us of it: Besides, that he is
called in Scripture the Prince of the Air,
is something considerable to this purpose;
and 'tis probable that he may as easily
cause Lightnings and Thunder, as he
could bring down fire in such abundance
upon <hi>Iob</hi>'s Servants and Cattel, as to
consume them: now when we find in
Scripture, that Winds and Tempests
have been rais'd by him, I think it is a
sufficient warrant for us to believe that he
can do it. Then he tells you that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of this prodigious power are scatter'd
up and down the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, and
quotes you two whole sides out of <hi>Ovid,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105893:18"/>
Virgil, Horace, Tibullus, Propertius,</hi>
and <hi>Lucan,</hi> and alas, all this stir to very
little (or to speak more truly, to no)
purpose; but onely to shew that these
Poets did speak of those things, and that
indeed he has very clearly demonstrated:
But I will not so much as suppose that he
meant from hence to conclude that nothing
of this Nature is true, for then I might
think that he would say, the World had
no beginning, because <hi>Ovid</hi> writes of it.
But sayes he, the ingenious Poets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
nor the wiser sort of Heathens,
did not believe these things; and what
then? I hope he will not say that we
must believe no more than the wiser sort
of Heathens did; for if he does (to use
his own words) I must crave leave to
dissent. He says he could instance in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more of the Ancients (and all, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
to as much purpose as these.) But
he will conclude with <hi>Nero</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
who having studied the Art of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
did at last despise it as vain, and
promising more than it can perform. But
what is this to the purpose, for it is no
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105893:18"/>
Argument to say, <hi>Nero</hi> could not be a
Witch, <hi>Ergo,</hi> there are no Witches;
it may be the Devil thought <hi>Nero</hi> sure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
without a contract, and 'tis likely
that he will not engage himself in such
bargains when it is no advantage to him.
Besides, the Devil will not appear to
Atheists, for fear of undeceiving them,
and it may be he took this course to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<hi>Nero</hi> in the belief that there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God nor Devils; and it may be that
if he had made a contract with <hi>Nero,</hi>
he would have required more at his hands
than our Witches do, or then he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to perform; for his ambitious mind
could not have contented it self with such
petty practices as theirs are; for he had
already wherewithall to satisfie himself
in the enjoyment of Worldly pleasures,
and he stood not in need of the Devils
help or any tricks of Witchcraft to wreak
his fury upon those that had offended
him: But the Devil usually takes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of poor silly wretches, over-ruled
by malice and desire of revenge, and
wanting means to execute their malicious
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105893:19"/>
designs, whom if he can satisfie in this
particular, and in the accomplishing of
their inordinate lusts and pleasures, they
aim no farther. But I need not insist
upon this; it is enough to say, that his
not being a Witch, is no Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the being of Witches in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
            <p>His third Chapter is nothing but the
story of the first setting up of the inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of their proceedings; where he
tells you what a great number of Witches
were then discover'd, and supposes them
to have been all innocent, having their
confessions extorted from them by extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of torment: truly I cannot say any
thing to the contrary, but weak spirits
may by torture be brought to confess any
thing; and I verily believe that many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
persons suffered by this cruel way
of proceeding, as well as those which
were guilty; but I cannot from thence
conclude that none were guilty, either
there or any where else, no more than I
can say that because many at <hi>Amboyna</hi>
were forced by torture to confess that they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105893:19"/>
had conspired against the Governour,
there are no Traytors in the World; so
that I think I may pass by this Chapter,
and come to the fourth, which by the
Title seems more considerable; for that
tells you that there are Arguments to
prove that there is no such thing as a
Witch in Scripture, as also to prove that
there is no such thing as a Witch at
all.</p>
            <p>Now because he has yet said nothing
towards it, I suppose he has reserved his
greatest strength for this Chapter; so
that if I can come off here without harm,
I shall think my business done; wherefore
it will not be amiss to take these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into consideration.</p>
            <p>The first, says he, shall be taken from
the difference which is between our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
reputed Witches, and those which
our Translatours of the Bible call so; for
who be they, but the Kings, Queens,
and Princes of this World? Whereas
now adayes, they are poor, silly, and
contemptible persons. Now let any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
person judge if there be any force in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105893:20"/>
this Argument: for supposing this to be
true, there will follow nothing from
hence to his purpose; for his Argument
rightly considered sounds thus,
<q>Our Translatours of the Bible call none
but Kings, Queens, and Princes,
Witches.<lb/>
Our Witches now adayes are poor,
contemptible persons.<lb/>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is no such thing as a Witch
in Scripture.<lb/>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a strange sort of Argument to
be brought by a rational man, and stands
rather in need of pity than an answer:
yet to satisfie him I will say thus much;
that he ought to consider that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
mentions the Witchcrafts of Kings
and Queens, as being the more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and such as concern'd all <hi>Israel</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
and also, that in writing their lives,
these practices of theirs could not be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Now it was not at all requisite that the
Scripture should speak of every old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in <hi>Israel,</hi> that was a Witch, since it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105893:20"/>
was nothing pertinent to the story: this I
say might serve to answer him, supposing
his assertion to be true, that the Scripture
makes mention of no other Witches but
Kings and Queens; but that is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent;
for where the story required it,
we find that the Scripture does take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of meaner persons that practised this
Art, as in that passage of the Witch of
<hi>Endor;</hi> as also where it is said that <hi>Saul</hi>
turn'd them all out of <hi>Israel,</hi> for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
suppose that he turn'd out so many
Kings and Queens; but we may easily
think that many of them were poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
persons, as well as some of
ours.</p>
            <p>But seeing there is nothing in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to stop me, I will pass to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
which is drawn from the Sadduces,
who denyed Spirits, and the Resurrection
of the Dead, yet had the five Books of
<hi>Moses</hi> in great esteem among them;
wherefore, sayes he, either they did not
understand <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or the notion of
a Witch does not appear in Scripture.
This Argument is as weak as the other,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105893:21"/>
for if he means that there is no mention
of Spirits in Scripture, the contrary is
easily proved, what ever the Sadduces
thought; and it is very manifest from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places of Scripture that there were
both good and evil Spirits: in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the first
verse, it is said that two Angels came to
<hi>Sodom;</hi> so in the thirty second Chapter,
and the first verse, <hi>Iacob</hi> went on his
way, and the Angels of God met him;
so we read that <hi>Iacob,</hi> in his dream, saw
a Ladder that reacht from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the Angels of God ascending
and descending on it: many other places
there are where mention is made of the
Angels of God: Now in the seventeenth
of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and the seventh verse, it is
said, and they shall no more offer their
Sacrifices unto Devils; and in the thirty
second of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
they Sacrificed to Devils, not
unto God; and other examples of this
kind might be produced; yet by his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
nothing of all this should be found
in Scripture. Now if he once yields (as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105893:21"/>
he must do) that the notion of a Devil
appears in Scripture, for what end serves
his Argument drawn from the Sadduces,
but to shew that they were in an errour,
and mis-understood the Bible: But I
cannot be convinced that the Sadduces de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the being of Spirits in general,
though we read that they deny'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
or that there was either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
or Spirit, for that has reference only
to the Spirits of Dead men; for if they
had denied all Spirits and Angels, 'tis not
likely that our Saviour would have told
them, as he did, that men in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
should be as the Angels of God,
for what would such a comparison have
signified to those who denied that there
were such things as Angels. Now if we
believe that they acknowledged any Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
whence can we draw an Argument
to prove that they denyed the being of
Devils. But whatever the opinion of
the Sadduces was, we are not to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by their Judgment, in deciding
whether or no the notion of a Witch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in Scripture, but by our own; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105893:22"/>
have we any great reason to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their understanding of the Scriptures,
though this Author sayes much for it;
seeing our Saviour tells them that they
erred, not knowing the Scriptures. Now
for his third and last Argument, which is
taken from the different practices of those
whom our Translatours call Witches, and
those which are vulgarly supposed to be
so; for sayes he, our modern Witches
practise an occult and secret Art, and 'tis
great Art to discover them, by several
strange signs and horrid tortures; but the
others practis'd what they did openly and
in the face of the World: I have this to
answer, that he is extremely deceiv'd in
this point, for that the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi>
practis'd openly, is not to be imagined,
seeing she was so cautious when <hi>Saul</hi>
came to her, that she durst not do any
thing till he had sworn to her that she
should have no harm, but asked him why
he laid a snare for her Life. And since
the Law was so strict against them, as
it is in the twentieth of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and
the twenty seventh verse, where it is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105893:22"/>
said, <hi>A Man or a Woman that hath a
Familiar Spirit thou shalt not suffer to
live, but shalt stone him with stones, his
blood shall be upon him</hi> (I say where
such a Law was in force) it is not likely
that this Art was practised openly, and
in the face of the World, as he sayes,
but that they were as private as ours are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but, sayes he, if they were so, how
impossible was it for <hi>Saul</hi> to turn them all
out of <hi>Israel?</hi> 'Tis true indeed, it was
impossible for him, neither did he, for
the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> was yet there; and
if one remained, there might be as well
a hundred, or a thousand, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his objection of the first of <hi>Samuel,</hi>
and twenty eighth Chapter, where we
read that <hi>Saul</hi> had put away those that
had Familiar Spirits out of the Land,
which must of necessity be understood,
that he put the Law in Execution against
them, putting all those to death which
were discovered, so that they durst not
practise openly; and so he might well
be said to put them out of the Land,
though there were hundreds yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105893:23"/>
which practised secretly and by
stealth, because he used all possible means
for the rooting them out of <hi>Israel;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can he certainly say that <hi>Manasses</hi>
practised this Art openly, for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
onely sayes that he used Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Divinations, and dealt with
Familiar Spirits, which he might do pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
though he was a King: yet I can
easily grant that when both King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were wholly given up to Idolatry,
and all other wickedness, any thing might
be practised openly; wherefore that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not but it might be the same Art
which our Witches use now adayes,
though practised in a different manner.
Thus I have done with his Arguments,
by which he endeavoured to prove that
there is no such thing as a Witch in
Scripture, and am now come to those by
which he undertakes to prove that there
is no such thing as a Witch at all.</p>
            <p>To his first I perceive I shall not need
to say much, it being onely this; that
seeing there is no such thing in Scripture,
it follows there is no such thing at all:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105893:23"/>
therefore I shall onely say, that seeing the
force of this Argument depends wholly
upon those which went before, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already answered, this may keep them
company. Now he objects, that the
Law of <hi>Moses</hi> being so strict against be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
and incestuous Concubinage, it
would seem very strange, the Opinion of
Witches being true, that it should not so
much as mention Diabolical. To this I
answer, that it is not at all strange that it
should not mention particularities, when
the whole Art is forbidden upon pain of
Death; for in that Law [thou shalt not
suffer a Witch to live;] this and all other
their wicked Actions, were included.
So that, whether it was Diabolical Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or killing of Men or Beasts by
Witchcrafts, or any other Action of this
Nature, all was punish'd when the
Witch was ston'd to death. His second
Argument is taken from the miserable
poverty of our vulgarly reputed Witches;
for, sayes he, I am not willing to believe
that they have such a power with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
as to make him do wonderful things
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105893:24"/>
at their command, when they cannot
command him to fetch them money, &amp;c.
To this I answer, that certainly the Devil
deludes these people with the enjoyment
of all sorts of pleasures which they desire,
if not in reality, at least in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is all one to them, as if they
were real. Now riches not being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for themselves alone, but onely as
they conduce to a pleasant life, if they
can obtain this without them, I see no
reason why they should command the
Devil to fetch them money: Besides, as
they are people of a base and degenerate
spirit, having no aim but malice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and the satisfying of their beastly
lusts, and coming as near as is possible
to the Nature of the Devils themselves,
such a sordid way of living may be more
suitable to their temper; as also they may
out of policy choose such an obscure and
contemptible life to avoid suspition, and
that they might have the greater freedom
to practise their wicked Arts, their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
not being so much pryed into, as those
of more considerable persons. These
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105893:24"/>
reasons may suffice, though many more
might be given for the removing of this
objection. In the third place he sayes,
that the opinion of Witchcraft is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
either with irrationality or impiety,
for that it is irrational to think that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
being so full of malice, and breathing
nothing but mischief against men, should
suffer any man to live, when he can so
easily kill us at the command of a Witch:
To this I say, that the Devil cannot go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his Commission, and that it is in
Gods power to stop the course of the
Devils malice, when, and where he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Besides, 'tis very probable, that
the Laws by which the Devils are gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
do not allow them that freedom;
for by that means the interest of the dark
Kingdom would not be carried on, seeing
it is the ruine of the Souls of men, not
the destruction of their Bodies, by which
it is established. So that cunning and slye
temptations are more advantagious to
this end, than open violence; for if the
Devil should take this course to wreak
his malice upon men, they would be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105893:25"/>
more sensible of his mischievous practices;
and finding themselves too weak to make
resistance, it might be a means to draw
them from their evil courses, and make
them run to God for succour. This I
say may be suppos'd, and it is enough to
clear this opinion of irrationality, if we
can guess at a reason why the Devil would
not take this course, though he had his
liberty of hurting whom he pleas'd; but
it is certain that neither Devils nor
Witches can hurt us without Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
But I see no such impiety in
saying that God does many times permit
such Actions (as the Author seems to
think there is,) for then it were as impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to say that God suffers us to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to sin; yet we are certain that the Devil
cannot do it without his permission; as
appears by that expression of St. <hi>Paul,
He will not suffer you to be tempted
above what you are able,</hi> &amp;c. So if we
acknowledge that God is omnipotent, we
must confess that no wickedness could be
done in the World without his permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
seeing it is in his power to prevent
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105893:25"/>
it; and there is no impiety in affirming
that though God of his great mercy may
preserve any man from falling into sin,
yet he is not bound to do it, neither does
he, as we see by daily experience; and
if we once grant that he suffers men to sin,
where lyes the impiety of saying that he
permits Witchcraft? If we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that God suffers one man to murther
another, why should we not, without
impiety, confess that he suffers Witches
to do the same thing? Certainly no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can be given why it should be more
impious to say that he permits one sin,
then another; and if not, I see none,
why this opinion should be charged with
either irrationality or impiety.</p>
            <p>His last objection is as malicious as it is
frivolous; for, sayes he, the opinion of
Witchcraft being true, no man can be able
by the light of reason to know if Christ
were a Witch or no. But if he had conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the difference between the miracles
wrought by the Holy Jesus, and the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
of Witches; if he had considered the
different ends to which they tend, if he had
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105893:26"/>
had any regard to the life and conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Blessed Saviour, and that of
an Impostor, the holiness of the one, and
the wickedness of the other, if he had
weigh'd the words of our Saviour, <hi>You
shall know the Tree by it's fruit; can one
gather Grapes of Thornes, or Figgs of
Thistles?</hi> he might have spared this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>Who ever believed, of all the rational
assertors of VVitchcraft, that an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
could infallibly cure all diseases by a
word of his mouth, or a touch of his
hand? That he could raise the dead to
life, after they had been so long buried
as to stink in their Graves? That he could
feed five thousand with five loaves and
two fishes; that he could cause the Earth
to tremble, and the Sun to be darkened
at his death? The graves of dead men to
be opened, and their Bodies to arise to
accompany him at his Resurrection; final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he could raise himself after three
dayes burial, and converse for some days
with men, and at last gloriously to ascend
up to Heaven in the sight of several wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:105893:26"/>
Methinks the manner of our Saviours
Birth is enough to satisfie us in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
that he was born of a Virgin,
that a glorious Star appeared over the
place of his birth, that a company of
Heavenly Angels were sent to proclaim it,
as tidings of joy to the whole World;
and that the wise men being led by his
Star, which they had seen in the East,
came so far to worship him, and bring
him presents. Much more might be said
to shew the great difference between
them; but I think it is so visible to those
who have read the life of our Saviour in
the four Evangelists, that I shall not need
to insist upon it; I will onely add, that the
sweetness of his disposition, the sincerity
of his Doctrine, the holiness of his life
and conversation, his transcendent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
his zeal for the glory of God,
and the Salvation of men, are infallible
Testimonies to prove that he was no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poster:
So that, if whatever has been
by the common people ascribed to
Witches, which seems miraculous,
were really true, and that they had done
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105893:27"/>
all, or more than has ever been believ'd
of them; yet should we have no reason
to doubt of our Blessed Saviours Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and his faith that thinks so, is but
weakly grounded, and in danger of being
shaken by every strange Action, which
is beyond the reach of his understanding.
Our Saviour himself has told us that false
Christs shall come, with signs and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
able to deceive, if it were possible,
the very Elect, which is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us, notwithstanding this Authors
objection, that such miraculous Actions
may be performed without a Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
as may carry with them a great
shew of Divine power; but he is in a
deplorable condition that from thence
concludes that Christ Jesus might be an
Impostor. Thus I have done with his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;
after which he tells you his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Nature and power of Devils;
I believe, sayes he, that the Devils are
aërial Creatures, and though they have
more skill, strength, and agility than
men, yet they act as men do by applying
Natural Agents and Patients, one to the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105893:27"/>
other, in this sublunary VVorld; but as
for the VVorld aetherial, or coelestial, I
suppose they have no power there, but
consequently that the wind bloweth when
and where it listeth; and that the seasons
of the year are neither promoted nor
hindred by them, or the fruits of the
Earth: To this I answer, that I think it
is apparent out of the first Chapter of <hi>Iob,</hi>
that the Devil may raise winds and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests;
but I am of his opinion, that he
cannot promote or hinder the seasons of
the year, or alter the course of the Stars
and Planets; as for the last, touching the
fruits of the Earth, he himself has said
enough against it, in the eleventh page of
his Book, where he sayes that men by
their well ordering the seeds of Plants
may strangely promote the generation of
such Plants, and the ripening of their
Fruits; therefore he adds, the Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more skilful than men may strangely
promote the generation of several Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Thus having answered himself,
he has sav'd me the labour; and I see very
little, or no reason that he has, to tax the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105893:28"/>
affirmers of Witchcraft, with approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the opinion of the <hi>Persians,</hi> of two
great principles of good and evil, both
Almighty; for by the opinion of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
nothing of omnipotency is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the Devil, as he supposes; and
by this saying, he seems not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what is meant by omnipotency; for
any one Action, how strange soever it
seems to us, cannot be an Argument to
prove an omnipotency in the doer; so to
say, if the Devil can raise a wind, he must be
omnipotent, is ridiculous, as much as if
he said, I can blow with a pair of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> I am omnipotent; I can do
one thing, <hi>Ergo,</hi> I can do all things: if
the Devil raises a wind, he does but Act
upon natural Bodies, and by natural
means, which requires nothing of omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency.
So if he causes Thunders, or
Lightnings, or if he changes one Body
i<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to another, he has still matter to work
upon, and so long we may suppose any
thing to be done without omnipotency,
b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cause we know not how far the Laws
of Nature are intended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:105893:28"/>
Now for what he quotes out of the
<hi>Ancyran</hi> council, it is not much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
for it seems not to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
against the opinion of Witches
in general; but to shew the folly of those
Witches which believ'd the illusions of
the Devil to be realities, and professed
that in the night time they conversed with
<hi>Diana,</hi> or some other heathen god, or
goddess: for they feared lest by this
their folly the common people might be
led to the old errour of the heathens,
in believing a plurality of gods: this
seems very plain from the words of the
Council;—<hi>Quod quaedam scele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratae
mulieres retro post sathanam conversae,
daemonum illusionibus, &amp; phantasmatibus
seductae, se nocturnis horis cum Diana Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum
Dea, &amp;c. super quasdam bestias e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitare;</hi>
and a little after, <hi>nam innumera
multitudo hac falsa opinione decepta, haec
vera esse credit, &amp; credendo, a recta fide de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat,
&amp; in errorem paganorum devolvitur,
cum aliquid numinis, ant divinitatis extra
unum Deum arbitratur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that Witches are deluded by the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105893:29"/>
Devil, and made to believe those things
which are many times false, is not to be
question'd; but it does not follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are deluded, that they are no
Witches; neither can I find o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e sentence
in all this decree to prove it: 'tis true,
they have endeavoured to shew that these
nocturnal pleasures and recreations are
onely imaginary, and delusions of the
Devil, and this seems to be the scope of
the whole decree: and the other decree,
—<hi>Siquis credit quod Diabolus aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
creaturas in Mundo facerit, et tonitrua,
et fulgura, &amp;c. sua authoritate fecerit,
sicut dixit Priscillianus, anathema sit;</hi> It
was made against that errour of <hi>Priscilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
that the Devil has a power in the
things of this World, equal to that of
God, and can do these things at his own
will and pleasure; wherefore these words,
<hi>Sua authoritate,</hi> are put in; but it does
not at all deny that he can do those things
with Gods permission; and if it had,
I think the authority is not so great, but
that of the Scripture is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it. As for that which he objects
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105893:29"/>
that the Devil did no more in the case of
<hi>Iob,</hi> than <hi>Elijah,</hi> or any mortal man
may do when he receives a commission
from God, I think the contrary may be
gathered from the Scripture, I mean,
that it was wholly Sathans doing, having
only obtain'd leave from God, for,
God said to him, <hi>all that he has is
in thy power;</hi> and the same expression is
again used in the second Chapter, and
the sixth verse; <hi>Behold, he is in thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi>
by which expressions we may gather,
that God left it to him, and acted nothing
of it himself; and it immediately follows,
<hi>Sathan went out from the pr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sence of the
Lord, and smote</hi> Job <hi>with sore boyls from
the head to the foot;</hi> it is not said, the
Lord smote him; now if this last was
done by the Devil, why not all the rest?
Besides, if God had been the Actor,
the limitation, <hi>onely upon himself stre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch
not forth thine hand,</hi> had been altogether
needless. Thus I have done with his
fourth Chapter, and am come to his fifth,
which he intitles, An answer to their
Arguments which endeavour to prove,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105893:30"/>
that there are Witches, where I find the
Arguments which he produces against
himself, to be these: first, that Drums
and Trumpets have been heard when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Drummer nor Trumpeter was near.
Secondly, that the persons tormented
have fallen into their fits upon the sight
of the suspected VVitches. Thirdly, that
immediately upon the threatning, or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of this or that person, such an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
has happened to the party threatned
or cursed. And lastly, that the VVitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
themselves have confessed it. The
first he yields to be true, being unwilling
(as he sayes) to gainsay the authority of
so many in the world, who affirm it to be
so, but he denys that from hence the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of VVitches may be proved: it is
easily thought this Author would not raise
a Devil which he could not lay again; and
that of so many Arguments as may be
brought too for the proof of VVitches,
he would only make choice of such as he
could answer, or at least would so order
the matter, as to leave out the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
circumstances, thereby to render
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105893:30"/>
the Argument invalid; for it is true (as
he sayes) that onely to hear Drums and
Trumpets, and to see Chairs and Stools
move about a Room, and no body touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the one or the other, proves no more
than the being of Spirits; but (because
he seems to allude to that story of Mr.
<hi>Mompesson</hi>'s house in <hi>Wiltshire</hi>) I will
thus answer him; that if these things
shall happen in a Gentlemans house,
which was formerly undisturb'd, meerly
upon the taking away of an idle fellows
Drum; if the Devil by such and such
signs being demanded, shall declare that
the Drummer employ'd him; if upon
the Drummers being condemned, and
sent to the Islands, shall be quiet, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his return these disturbances shall be
renew'd, these circumstances will render
the Argument of no small force to prove
contracts with the Devil. Now if he
has ever heard the true Relation of the
foremention'd story, he will find in it all
this that I have said. The second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that upon the sight of the
Witch the party has fallen into his fit,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105893:31"/>
&amp;c. he answers thus: first, he objects
that these stories are different from the
former, in this, that those are attested
by several persons of Credit, and these
are grounded onely in the Juggling delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Impostors, and the foolish mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
of the vulgar: to which I answer,
that he speaks with too much haste, and
considers not that these things have been
sworn by innumerable, and many of them
persons of credit, before Judges of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>size,
and in the face of the Countrey;
and that Judges are not generally so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of what they do, as to take away
the lives of so many hundreds, upon no
better ground than the foolish mistakes of
the Vulgar. Secondly, he sayes, that if he
grants these things to be true, he yet sees
no reason to grant that there are Witches,
but rather to conclude that these Spirits,
which are so gamesome, in doing us mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
when they perceive that any are
suspected to have set them on work, use
these tricks to confirm the suspition, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it their sport to see poor innocent
people hang'd. Here I will make him
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105893:31"/>
the same objection as he made against the
being of VVitches, which is, that if the
Devil could by such tricks as these so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
deprive innocent people of their lives,
'tis irrational to think that he would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any body to live, considering his great
malice; and if he answers, that he cannot
do it without Gods permission, I will say,
in his own words, that 'tis impious to
concern the great God with these designs
of the Devil to take away innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
lives: thus by denying of VVitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
he is fallen himself into the same
irrationality, or impiety, of which he
accused the assertors of it. But if, as he
sayes, the Devil should by such tricks en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the ruine of poor innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
'tis not probable, that he could
make those persons Actors in their own
ruine, so that all their words and actions
should contribute to it; as it happens for
the most part, for it is seldom known that
people are hanged, because others fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their fits at the sight of them, without
any other evidence against them, but some
suspitious actions of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105893:32"/>
To the third, which is, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their threatning or cursing such things
have happen'd to the party cursed, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
that it is not to be wondred at,
if in the VVorld there has often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a notable concurrence of Events,
&amp;c. this I suppose he said, meerly for
want of something else to say; for it is
not at all conceivable (though once in a
hundred years such a thing may come to
pass, as that upon an Old VVomans cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a man may immediately fall sick,
or dye) that it should be so frequently
done, and that such events should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
attend the curses of some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
persons, more than others. The last
Argument is from the confession of the
VVitch; and he answers it thus;
that the wisest man in the world may
by torture be brought to confess any
thing, whether it be true or false: this
answer seems very weak, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that this way of forcing confessions
by torture is not in use with us, and by
consequence, that can be no reason why
our Witches should confess themselves
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105893:32"/>
to be so, except it were really true. But
that answer not sufficing, he has another,
which is, that he believes, that some silly
Old Women overgrown with melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and dotage, have really believ'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be Witches, and to have done
those things which not onely their foolish
Neighbours, but worshipful men in the
VVorld, have charged them with. But
suppose some one, or two, have been so
extreamly foolish, as to be perswaded into
that belief against their own knowledge,
can it be thought that all were so? Or if
we could conceive that any persons by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accus'd could be made to believe that
they were VVitches, what is that to those
who have freely accus'd themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
so much as being suspected by others?
Or what to those, who after they had past
the danger of being perswaded into this
folly, and had stood it out to the last
with a stiff denyal, notwithstanding the
clear evidences brought in, and sworn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, after, I say, that they had past
all this, without confession, have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
penitently acknowledged all upon
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105893:33"/>
the Ladder? To such as these his answer
reaches not; yet, that many such have
been, is evident to any but those who
believe no more than they have seen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Now, to suppose that an Old
Man or VVoman, sunk in melancholy,
may be perswaded to think themselves
VVitches, is excusable, if that were
all; but to believe, that not onely the
Old man or woman, but the Judge, the
Jury, and the whole Assize, should be
thus abus'd, the witnesses forswearing
themselves, only to hang poor innocent
people that have done them no harm;
and that not onely one Judge, one Jury,
and one Assize, should be so fool'd, but
thousands of each, and all with nothing;
and to imagine that whole Countries, nay,
all the Christian world, should be so
over-spread with folly, as to establish
Laws against a sort of people which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were in being, is a madness of which
whosoever is guilty, wants but one step
more to become a Sceptick, and reject
the Testimony of his own senses.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have answered, I think,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105893:33"/>
what is most considerable in this Book;
I will pass by the sixth Chapter, as having
nothing in it which requires an answer,
it being little more than what has been
said before, and onely to shew his fancy
touching the first entrance of this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of VVitchcraft into the world; so that
the truth of this assertion being once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
the ground upon which that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
stands is taken away. And now
Sir, it is time that I free you from this
trouble (if you have had the patience to
