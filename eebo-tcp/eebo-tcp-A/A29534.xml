            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

AN ABSTRACT OF THE DISCOURSE ON THE Late FUNDS of the <hi>Million-Act, Lottery-Act,</hi> and <hi>Bank of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Together with PROPOSALS for the ſupplying their Majeſties with Money on eaſy Terms, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting the Nobility and Gentry, &amp;c. from Taxes, enlarging their Yearly Eſtates, and enriching all the Subjects in the Kingdom.</p>

            <p>I Have in a larger Treatiſe ſhewed, that no Place is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſituated for Trade than <hi>England;</hi> but that the great Encouragements given to ſuch who advanced Money on the Funds of the Million-Act, Lottery-Act and Bank of <hi>England,</hi> were very prejudicial in that they increaſed the Intereſt of Money, which I demonſtrated to be very deſtructive to the Trade of the Kingdom. I proved that for the Million raiſed in 1692, (had the whole been paid in upon Annuities with Survivorſhip) the Nation would have paid 9314216 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> more than the Principal and Intereſt, and Intereſt upon Intereſt, at 5 <hi>l. per Cent. per Annum;</hi> and that for advancing a Million of Money on the Lottery-Act, the Nation will pay 1129174 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi> in ſixteen Years time more than their Principal and Intereſt, and Intereſt upon Intereſt; and that the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> if they ſhall be continued for ſixty Years, will be paid for the 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> advanced by the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butors to their Majeſties, above 14 Millions more than their Principal and Intereſt, and Intereſt upon Intereſt. I have ſhewed that theſe great Encouragements to advance Money on the late Funds will ruin the Trade of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that Tradeſmen who trade with their own Stocks draw their Money out of Trade to advance on theſe Funds; and thoſe who lend Money to Tradeſmen where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to drive their Trades, call it out of their Hands, or force them, (if they continue it with them) to give a higher Intereſt to their undoing, by reaſon they can make a greater advantage by advancing their Money to the Government; that this high Intereſt will fling the Trade of the Nation into the Hands of Foreigners, who pay leſs Intereſt, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29860:3"/>
who can therefore under-ſell us at Foreign Markets; and that theſe Funds divert the Genius of the Subjects from their Buſineſs, while our Neighbours keep cloſe to their Trade, and take that ineſtimable Jewel out of our Hands. I alſo proved that it is no leſs deſtructive to the Nobility and Gentry, &amp;c. of the Kingdom, in that it would bring Land to 12 or 14 Years Purchaſe; that a Perſon who hath 50 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in Land, if he ſell it for 600 <hi>l.</hi> being 12 Years Purchaſe, he may purchaſe 50 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in the Bank, free from Taxes, whereas he muſt pay for the Tax of 4 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound laid on his Land, and Charge of the Militia, &amp;c. at leaſt 12 <hi>l. per An.</hi> And that he may have 500 <hi>l.</hi> at an hour's warning of the Bank upon the Security of his 600 <hi>l.</hi> whereas he cannot without great Difficulty, loſs of Time, and Expence in examining Titles, Procuration, Continuation, &amp;c. raiſe ſo much upon the Credit of his Eſtate; and that the very Bank-Bills will be preferr'd before Land, becauſe a Man may have 60 <hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d. per Annum</hi> Intereſt for 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Bank-Bills, and have 2000 <hi>l.</hi> always lying by him; whereas 2000 <hi>l.</hi> laid out in Land will not bring him in more Profit, upon which he can hardly raiſe 1000 <hi>l.</hi> without great Trouble, Charge and loſs of Time. Theſe Conſiderations put me upon conſidering of other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for the Supply of their Majeſties, and for the Eaſe of the Subject, which I laid down in ſeveral Propoſals, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        </q> To which if we add all the Money in private Hands, we cannot well ſuppoſe that there is leſs, if ſo little as 50 Millions Sterling in <hi>Holland.</hi> The ſame Author tells us alſo in <hi>page</hi> 5. <q>That about an hundred Years ago the King of <hi>Spain</hi> paid the Bank of <hi>Genoua</hi> more than twenty Millions of Crowns (which is almoſt as much Money as we have in <hi>England)</hi>

the Profits accruing by the Loan of ſuch Bills of Credit for the Benefit of him who hath the Fee or Remainder, by which means his Eſtate will be encreaſing every Year more and more, till he comes into the Poſſeſſion of it.

And if the Parliament think fit, Gentlemen who have Eſtates in Land, may eaſily, and that in a few Years, raiſe a Bank without any Money, other than by their accruing Profits out of the ſaid Annuities, which Bank will have both plenty of Money, and the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Eſtates of the Kingdom for a Fund; which will be the greateſt, moſt famous, and moſt glorious Bank that is or ever was in the whole World: nor will any Nation in the Univerſe be ever able to cope with us, or be capable to erect the like.</p>

I think it not amiſs alſo to acquaint the Parliament with a Method I ſhowed to an Honourable Member of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe of Commons, about ſix Months ago, which I laid aſide, as not being near ſo deſirable as this my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Method; which becauſe ſome Perſons ſeem'd then to have an Opinion of, I ſhall alſo acquaint this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe with the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I propos'd that a Gentleman of 150 <hi>l. per annum</hi> Eſtate in Land, ſuppoſed to be worth 3000 <hi>l.</hi> might ſettle his Eſtate, and that 3000 <hi>l.</hi> Value in Bills of Credit ſhould be iſſued out thereupon; that their Majeſties ſhould have 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the ſaid Bills, and that the Perſon who ſettled his Eſtate ſhould have 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Bills; and for the diſcharging the 3000 <hi>l.</hi> Bills of Credit he ſhould be obliged to pay 100 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for 30 Years. This indeed would have cleared all mortgaged Eſtates; the Bills of Credit iſſued out would not have exceeded the Fund ſettled for Security of them; and a Gentleman would have ſold a Rent-charge of 100 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for 30 Years, for as much as he can ſell the Fee of 100 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> Several other Advantages I propoſed by the ſaid Method; but all things conſidered, I found it ſo far ſhort of what Advantages their Majeſties and the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might reap by the preſent propoſed Method, that I totally declined it.</p>
                     <p>I fear being too tedious, and to tranſgreſs the Limits of an Abſtract: But ſuch of the Members of the Lords or Commons who will honour my Treatiſe with their Peruſal, wherein what I have herein barely hinted at is more fully handled, ſhall be preſented with the ſame by,</p>
