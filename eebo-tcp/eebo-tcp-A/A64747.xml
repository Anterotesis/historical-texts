            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>PRaying! and to be married? It was rare,</l>
               <l>But now 'tis monstrous; and that pious care</l>
               <l>Though of our selves, is so much out of date,</l>
               <l>That to renew't, were to degenerate.</l>
               <l>But thou a Chosen sacrifice wert given,</l>
               <l>And offer'd up so early unto heaven</l>
               <l>Thy flames could not be out; Religion was</l>
               <l>Ray'd into thee, like beames into a glasse,</l>
               <l>Where, as thou grewst, it multiply'd, and shin'd</l>
               <l>The sacred Constellation of thy mind.</l>
               <l>But being for a bride, sure, prayer was</l>
               <l>Very strange stuffe wherewith to court thy lasse,</l>
               <l>Had'st ne'r an oath, nor Complement? thou wert</l>
               <l>An odde, corse sutor; Hadst thou but the art</l>
               <l>Of these our dayes, thou couldst have coyn'd thee twenty</l>
               <l>New sev'rall oathes, and Complements (too) plenty;</l>
               <l>O sad, and wild excesse! and happy those</l>
               <l>White dayes, that durst no impious mirth expose!</l>
               <l>When sinne, by sinning oft, had not lost sence,</l>
               <l>Nor bold-fac'd custome banish'd Innocence;</l>
               <l>Thou hadst no pompous traine, nor <hi>Antick</hi> crowd</l>
               <l>Of young, gay swearers, with their needless, lowd</l>
               <l>Retinue; All was here smooth as thy bride</l>
               <l>And calme like her, or that mild Evening-tide;</l>
               <l>Yet, hadst thou nobler guests: Angels did wind,</l>
               <l>And rove about thee, guardians of thy mind,</l>
               <l>These fetch'd thee home thy bride, and all the way</l>
               <l>Advis'd thy servant what to doe, and say;</l>
               <l>These taught him at the <hi>Well,</hi> and thither brought</l>
               <l>The Chast, and lovely object of thy thought;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62492:10"/>But here was ne'r a Complement, not one</l>
               <l>Spruce, supple cringe, or study'd looke put on,</l>
               <l>All was plaine, modest truth: Nor did she come</l>
               <l>In <hi>rowles,</hi> and <hi>Curles,</hi> mincing, and stately dumbe,</l>
               <l>But in a frighted, virgin-blush approach'd</l>
               <l>Fresh as the morning, when 'tis newly Coach'd;</l>
               <l>O sweet, divine simplicity! O grace</l>
               <l>Beyond a Curled lock, or painted face!</l>
               <l>A <hi>Pitcher</hi> too she had, nor thought it much</l>
               <l>To carry that, which some would scorn to touch;</l>
               <l>With which in mild, chast language she did wooe</l>
               <l>To draw him drinke, and for his Camels too.</l>
               <l>And now thou knewst her comming, It was time</l>
               <l>To get thee wings on, and devoutly climbe</l>
               <l>Unto thy God, for Marriage of all states</l>
               <l>Makes most unhappy, or most fortunates;</l>
               <l>This brought thee forth, where now thou didst undresse</l>

               <l>Her wearied wings, which so restor'd did flye</l>
               <l>Above the stars, a track unknown, and high,</l>
               <l>And in her piercing flight perfum'd the ayre</l>
               <l>Scatt'ring the <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> and Incense of thy pray'r.</l>

               <l>Here of this mighty spring, I found some drills,</l>
               <l>With Ecchoes beaten from th' eternall hills;</l>
               <l>Weake beames, and fires flash'd to my sight,</l>
               <l>Like a young East, or Moone-shine night,</l>
               <l>Wich shew'd me in a nook cast by</l>
               <l>A peece of much antiquity,</l>
               <l>With Hyerogliphicks quite dismembred,</l>
               <l>And broken letters scarce remembred.</l>
               <l>I tooke them up, and (much Joy'd,) went about</l>
               <l>T' unite those peeces, hoping to find out</l>
               <l>The mystery; but this neer done,</l>
               <l>That little light I had was gone:</l>
               <l>It griev'd me much. At last, said I,</l>
               <l>Since in these veyls my Ecclips'd Eye</l>
               <l>May not approach thee, (for at night</l>
               <l>Who can have commerce with the light?)</l>
               <l>I'le disapparell, and to buy</l>
               <l>But one half glaunce, most gladly dye.</l>

               <head>The Retreate.</head>
               <l>HAppy those early dayes! when I</l>
               <l>Shin'd in my Angell-infancy.</l>
               <l>Before I understood this place</l>
               <l>Appointed for my second race,</l>
               <l>Or taught my soul to fancy ought</l>
               <l>But a white, Celestiall thought,</l>
               <l>When yet I had not walkt above</l>
               <l>A mile, or two, from my first love,</l>
               <l>And looking back (at that short space,)</l>
               <l>Could see a glimpse of his bright-face;</l>
               <l>When on some <hi>gilded Cloud,</hi> or <hi>flowre</hi>
               </l>
               <l>My gazing soul would dwell an houre,</l>
               <l>And in those weaker glories spy</l>
               <l>Some shadows of eternity;</l>
               <l>Before I taught my tongue to wound</l>
               <l>My Conscience with a sinfull sound,</l>
               <l>Or had the black art to dispence</l>
               <l>A sev'rall sinne to ev'ry sence,</l>
               <l>But felt through all this fleshly dresse</l>
               <l>Bright <hi>shootes</hi> of everlastingnesse.</l>
               <l>O how I long to travell back</l>
               <l>And tread again that ancient track!</l>
               <l>That I might once more reach that plaine,</l>
               <l>Where first I left my glorious traine,</l>
               <l>From whence th' Inlightned spirit sees</l>
               <l>That shady City of Palme trees;</l>
               <l>But (ah!) my soul with too much stay</l>
               <l>Is drunk, and staggers in the way.</l>
               <l>Some men a forward motion love,</l>
               <l>But I by backward steps would move,</l>
               <l>And when this dust falls to the urn</l>
               <l>In that state I came return.</l>

                  <l>There above noise, and danger</l>
                  <l>Sweet peace sits crown'd with smiles,</l>
                  <l>And one born in a Manger</l>

                  <l>He is thy gracious friend,</l>

                  <l>Did in pure love descend</l>
                  <l>To die here for thy sake,</l>
                  <l>If thou canst get but thither,</l>
                  <l>There growes the flowre of peace,</l>
                  <l>The Rose that cannot wither,</l>
                  <l>Thy fortresse, and thy ease;</l>
                  <l>Leave then thy foolish ranges;</l>
                  <l>For none can thee secure,</l>

               <l>He shin'd a little, and by those weak Rays</l>
               <l>Had some glimpse of his birth.</l>
               <l>He saw Heaven o'r his head, and knew from whence</l>
               <l>He came (condemned,) hither,</l>
               <l>And, as first Love draws strongest, so from hence</l>
               <l>His mind sure progress'd thither.</l>
               <l>Things here were strange unto him: Swet, and till</l>
               <l>All was a thorn, or weed,</l>
               <l>Nor did those last, but (like himself,) dyed still</l>
               <l>As soon as they did <hi>Seed,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>They seem'd to quarrel with him; for that Act</l>
               <l>That fel him, foyl'd them all,</l>
               <l>He drew the Curse upon the world, and Crackt</l>
               <l>The whole frame with his fall.</l>
               <l>This made him long for <hi>home,</hi> as loath to stay</l>
               <l>With murmurers, and foes;</l>
               <l>He sigh'd for <hi>Eden,</hi> and would often say</l>
               <l>Ah! what bright days were those?</l>
               <l>Nor was Heav'n cold unto him; for each day</l>
               <l>The vally, or the Mountain</l>
               <l>Afforded visits, and still <hi>Paradise</hi> lay</l>
               <l>In some green shade, or fountain.</l>

               </l>
               <l>And he was sure to view them.</l>
               <l>Almighty <hi>Love</hi>! where art thou now? mad man</l>
               <l>Sits down, and freezeth on,</l>
               <l>He raves, and swears to stir nor fire, nor fan,</l>
               <l>But bids the thread be spun.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:62492:30"/>I see, thy Curtains are Close-drawn; Thy bow</l>

               <l>Nothing now to man is lacking,</l>

               <l>Of daies, from thee look for new strength,</l>
               <l>And Infants with thy pangs Contest</l>
               <l>As pleasant, as if with the brest;</l>
               <l>Then, unto him, who thus hath thrown</l>
               <l>Even to Contempt thy kingdome down,</l>
               <l>And by his blood did us advance</l>
