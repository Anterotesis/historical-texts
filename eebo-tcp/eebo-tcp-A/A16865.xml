         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Pardon then the desire of your deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

he shall endeauour in all humility, to witness
his thankefulnesse vnto the Lord of heauen,
and to his Annoynted, by seeking to adde
somewhat vnto the Honour, and deserts of
his royall progenie: euen of you, who are the
rich gifts of the heauenly bountie, and the
flourishing branches, of that happy sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Cedar. And what is it, which might
still more aduance you in the eyes and hearts
of all the people of your most noble Fathers
Dominions; then if now from your first
yeares, you might beginne to be the blessed
instruments of the Almighty, of an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
benefite to the present and all succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
generations? whereby you might knit
all hearts more surely vnto the holy God,
and his supreame deputy here amongst vs; as
also to your selues his Regall issue, and vnto
yours for euer. Accept therefore, to this
purpose (I beseech you) this weake labour
thus begun, of searching out, and inquiring
of all the speediest, surest and most easie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
and way to all good learning in our
<pb facs="tcp:6954:3"/>
Grammar schooles. To the end, that those
rare helpes of knowledge, which the Lord
hath graunted to this last Age (some of the
principall wherof haue been scarce knowen,
or very little practiced, so farre as I can find;
and most of the rest haue bin only knowen
amongst some few) might by your Princely
fauours, be made common vnto all, for the
publique good of the present Age, and of all
times to come. The Lord God hath giuen
vnto your Highnesse and Excellency, to be
born, and to liue in the time of most glorious
light, and knowledge; in which, if the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
of sundry of the learnedest, &amp; most
happily experienced Schoolemasters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
were gathered into one short sum, all
good learning (which is the chiefest glory of a
nation) would daily flourish more &amp; more,
and be conueyed to all places &amp; times; that
not only this age present, but also al posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
should haue iust cause euermore to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the God of glory for you: for how must
this needes oblige all sorts, if this heauenly
gift of learning, might thorough you be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with much more ease, delight, &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
and also in shorter time, with lesse
charges to Parents, without that extreame
<pb facs="tcp:6954:4"/>
sharpnes vsed ordinarily in schools amongst
the poore children? How shall it increase
your lasting comfort &amp; honour, if by your
Highnesses fauours, the work thus entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
shall soone come to an happy end! For as
some very learned and of much experience,
haue begun already to help herein; so others
of the chiefest gifts and imploiments in this
kind, shall not disdaine to lay-to their hands
to bring it in time to some perfection. Why
should wee the liege subiects of IESVS
CHRIST, and of this renowned kingdome,
be ouergone herein, by the seruants of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ?
many of whom bend all their wittes
and ioine their studies, for the greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of their learning, euen in the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
schooles, onely to the aduancement of
Babylon, with the ouerthrow of this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
nation, and of all parts of the Church of
Christ; to bring vs vnder that yoake againe,
or else to vtter confusion. Or why should
we omit any time or opportunity, which the
Lord offereth hereunto? The hope therfore
of your poore seruant is, that your Highness
and Excellency will not impute anie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
to this indeuor, (though thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken

<pb facs="tcp:6954:4"/>
but that you will accept it, according
to the desire that hath bin in me, to do good
thereby to this Church and Nation. And the
rather, for the vndoubted assurance of the
exceeding benefit, which must needs come
in time, by the best courses once found out
and made publick: and for that though such
a work haue bin long talked of and wished,
yet it is still generally neglected. The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
also which the Lord hath shewed,<note place="margin">In the true Watch and Rule of life, made farre more perfect and plaine in this 5. Editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> in
the readinesse of sundrie very learned, in a
worke of not much lesse difficulty, to helpe
most louingly, with their best aduices, to
bring still to better perfection, dooth giue
your seruant certain hope of the like cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
assistance herein. Howsoeuer; yet it shall
remaine for a further testimony of duety to
the heauenly Majesty, of thankfulnesse and
loyall affection towardes our Liege Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
and you his Royall Progenie. That
as you are the worthy sons of a Father most
renowned of all the Kings of the earth, for
singular learning, and for holding vp, and
aduauncing by all meanes the glorious light
therof; and as you are not inferior to anie of
the Princes of the world in your education
and first yeeres: so all sorts may thorough

you receiue an increase of the same shining

thrice happy Prince, I offer it most humbly,

And to you right noble Duke, the study of
your seruant, if he might but in any one thing
further you in that sweet and pleasant way of

Finally, I trust that it shal euer stand
as a true witnesse of an vnfained desire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
the perpetuall flourishing of this

And in this humble desire, I commend

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Rts are the only helpes towards humane
perfection. Those therfore which are
the helps towards the easinesse, maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
perfection of Arts, deserue best of
mankinde. Whence it is, that God would not suffer
the first deuisers, so much as of shepheards tents, of
musical instruments, of Iron-works, to be vnknown
to the world:<note place="margin">Tubal-cain.</note> the last wherof euen heathen Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
hath in common iudgement continued, without
much difference of name, till this daie; although I
cannot beleeue that anie of the heathen gods were so
ancient. Yea, hence it is, that the holy Ghost chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
the faculty euen of manuary skill, to his
owne gifte; as beeing too good for Nature, and too
meritorious of men. That Bezaleel and Aholiab
can worke curiously in siluer and golde, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
Tabernacle, is from Gods spirit, and not
theirs: How much more is this true, in those scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which are so essentiall to the spirituall house of
God? As Arts are to perfection of knowledge; so
is Grammar to all Artes. Man differs but in speech
and reason (that is, Grammar and Logicke) from
<pb facs="tcp:6954:6"/>
beasts: wherof reason is of Nature; speech (in respect
of the present variation) is of humane institution.
Neither is it vnsafe to say, that this later is the more
necessary of the two: For we both haue, and can vse
our reason alone; our speech we cannot, without a
guide I subscribe therfore to the iudgement of them,
that think God was the first Author of letters (which
are the simples of this Art) whether by the hand of
Moses; as Clement of Alexandria reports from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polemus:
or rather of the ancienter Progeny of Seth
in the first wotld; as Iosephus. Hee that gaue man
the faculty of speech, gaue him this meanes, to teach
his speech: And if he were so carefull to giue man
this helpe, while all the world was of one lip (as the
Hebrews speak) how much more, after that misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
confusion of tongues? wherein euery man was a
Grammar to himselfe; &amp; needed a new Grammar, to
be vnderstood of others. It is not therfore vnworthy
of obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that God (knowing languages to be the
carryage of knowledge) as in his iudgement he diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the tongues of those presumptuous builders; so
contrarily hee sent his spirit in clouen tongues vpon
the heads of those master-builders of his Church.
What they were suddainly taught of God, we with
much leasure and industry learne of men; knowing
the tongues so necessarie for all knowledge, that it is
well, if but our younger yeeres be spent in this study.
How seruiceable therfore is this labor, which is here
vndertaken, and how beneficial, to make the way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all learning, both short, and faire! Our Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were so long vnder the ferule, till their beards
were growen as long as their pens: this age hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried
<pb facs="tcp:6954:6"/>
a neerer way; yet not without much difficulty,
both to the schollars, and teacher: Now, time, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and painfulnesse (which are the meanes to
bring all things to their height) haue taught this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
yet further, how to spare both time and paines
this way vnto others; and (that which is most to bee
approoued) without any change of the receiued
grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. It is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon enuy of men, by how much
richer treasure they haue found, so much more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale it. How commendable is the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
of those spirits, which cannot ingrosse good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
to their priuate aduantage? which had rather
doe then haue good: who can be content to cast at
once into the common Bank of the world, what the
studious obseruation, inquisition, reading, practice
of many yeeres haue inriched them withall: That,
which this Author hath so freely done; as one that
feares not, least knowledge should be made too easie,
or too vulgar. The Iesuites haue won much of their
reputation, and stollen many hearts with their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in this kinde. How happie shall it be for the
Chnrch and vs, if we excite our selues at least to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
this their forwardness? We may out-strip them,
if wee want not to our selues: Behold here, not feete
but wings, offered to vs. Neither are these directions
of meere speculation, whose promises are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as large, as the performance defectiue; but such as
(for the most part) to the knowledge of my selfe,
and manie abler Iudges, haue been, and are daily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in his experience, and practice, with more
then vsuall successe. What remaines therefore, but
that the thankfull acceptation of men, and his effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb facs="tcp:6954:7"/>
labors should mutually reflect vpon each-other?
that he may be in couraged by the one, and they by
the other benefited: that, what hath been vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and furthered by the graue counsell of many,
and wise; and performed by the studious indeuours
of one so well deseruing; may be both vsed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the common good of all, and to the glorie
of him which giueth, and blesseth all.</p>

               <item>23 To pronounce naturally and sweetly, without vaine
affectation; and to begin to doe it from the lowest

               <item>24 To make right vse of the matter of their Authours,
besides the Latine; euen from the first beginners: as

of Sententiae and Confabulatiunculae Pueriles, Cato,
Esops fables, Tullies Epistles, Tullies Offices, Ouids Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosis,
&amp; so on to the highest. To help to furnish
them, with varietie of the best morall matter, and
with vnderstanding, wisedome and precepts of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as they growe; and withall to imprint the Latine
so in their minds thereby, as hardly to be forgotten.</item>
               <item>25 To answere concerning the matter contained in
their Lectures, in the Latine of their Authors, from
the lowest fourmes and so vpward.</item>
               <item>26 To construe any ordinary Author <hi>ex tempore.</hi>
               </item>

to translate leasurely, &amp; with some meditation, both
into English and Latine, as before in the <hi>Sect.</hi> or <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
10.</hi> and 11; but more also, to reade any easie Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
forth of Latine into English, and out of a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of the same Grammatically translated, to
reade it into Latine againe. As, Corderius, Terence,
Tullies Offices, Tullie <hi>de natura Deorum,</hi> Apthoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.
To doe this in Authors and places which they are
not acquainted with, and almost as fast as they are
able to reade the Author alone.</item>
               <item>28 To write fayre in Secretary, Romane, Greeke, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue;
as they grow in knowledge of the tongues.</item>
               <item>29 To know all the principall and necessarie Radices,
Greeke and Hebrue; and to be able to preceede in all
the learned tongues of themselues, thorow ordinarie
helps, and much more by the worthy helps &amp; meanes,
to be had in the Vniuersities.</item>
               <item>30 To be acquainted with the grounds of Religion, and
the chiefe Histories of the Bible. To take all the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Sermons, for Doctrines, proofes, vses,
<pb facs="tcp:6954:10"/>
if they be plainely and orderly deliuered: and to set
them downe afterwards in a good Latine stile, or to
reade them <hi>ex tempore</hi> into Latine, out of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish:
To conceiue and answere the seuerall points of
the Sermons, and to make a briefe repetition of the
whole Sermon without booke.</item>
               <item>31 To be set in the high way, and to haue the rules and
grounds, how to attaine to the puritie and perfection
of the Latine tongue, by their further labour and
practice in the Vniuersitie.</item>
               <item>32 To grow in our owne English tongue, according to
their ages and growthes in other learning: To vtter
their minds in the same both in proprietie and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
and so to be fitted for diuinitie, lawe, or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
calling or faculty soeuer they shall bee after im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in.</item>
               <item>33 Finally, thus to proceede togither with the tongues
in the vnderstanding and knowledge of the learning,
or matter contained in the same. To become alike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,
in all good learning meete for their yeares and
studies; that so proceeding still, after they are gone
from the Grammar schooles, they may become most
exquisite in all kinds of good learning to which they
shall be applied.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These things may be effected in good sort, thorough Gods
blessing, in the seuerall formes, as the schollars pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede,
by so many in each forme as are apt and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious,
onely by the directions following, if they be
constantly obserued; If the Maisters being of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
sufficiencie, will take meet paines; and if the
schollars being set to schoole so soone as they shall be
meete, may bee kept to learning ordinarily, hauing
<pb facs="tcp:6954:10"/>
bookes and other necessary helps &amp; encouragements.
That so all schollars of any towardlnesse and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
may be made absolute Grammarians, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way fit for the Vniuersitie, by fifteen yeares of age;
or by that time that they shall bee meete by discretion
and gouernment. And all this to bee done with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and certaintie, both to maisters and schollars,
with strife and contention amongst the schollars
themselues; without that vsual terrour and cruelty,
which hath beene practiced in many places, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
somuch as seueritie amongst good natures.</p>
            <p>How greatly all this vvould tend to the furtherance of
the publique good, euery one may iudge; which yet it
will doe so much the more, as the Lord shal vouchsafe
a further supply, to the seuerall meanes and courses
that are thus begun, by adioining dayly the helps and
experiments of many moe learned men, of whom wee
conceiue good hope, that they will bee ready to lend
their helping hands, to the perfiting of so good a

minde for their good. And take this first impression
as not set forth: but chiefely to the end, to haue store
of copies, to goe to many learned wel-willers to the
Worke, for their help: like as it hath heretofore, to
sundry much reuerenced for their learning and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Of all whome, I humbly intreat their kinde
assistance, for amending that which is amisse; by
adding what is vvanting, cutting off whatsoeuer is
superfluous, changing what is vnbefitting, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
euery thing into the right order: That it may
speedily come forth more plaine and perfect; and
thereby, if not themselues, yet their friends may
reape some benefit of their labours. For the liberty
and boldnesse vsed in it, consider that it is but a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
to incite and encourage others; as, I tooke it,
farre more profitable and delightsom to reade, then a
<pb facs="tcp:6954:12"/>
bare narration. All who are friendly and vnfained
fauourers of good learning, will I hope thinke so
of it. It shall wrong no man willingly: farre be that
from mee. I will right them againe, so soon as I know
it. Be the faults neuer so many, thorough my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and want of meete leasure (as they must needs
bee the moe, by my absence from the Presse) yet
time, I trust will reforme them. In the meane while,
let my trauell and the good things weigh against the
rest. For the length of it, remember for whome I
write, euen the meanest teachers and learners: with
whom though I sometime vse repetitions, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee ouer-plaine; sith they commonly get so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of short Treatises, be they neuer so learned. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
also that I would hide nothing, which GOD
hath vouchsafed mee in my search: that out of all,
the most profitable may be selected, and in the meane
time the best onely vsed. And for the matter of the
Dialogue, take it as that which is desired to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in time; and which I hope all shall finde, when
once the helpes belonging hereunto, shall bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
and perfected.</p>
            <p>Account this, but as a meere entrance into the
worke: which if seuen yeares shall bring to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fully to accomplish that which is wished, I shall
thinke my paines most happily bestowed, if GOD
so farre forth prolong my daies. I seeke not my self:
if I may do some little seruice to God and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
I haue enough. I oppose my selfe to none.
Shew my ouersight in loue, and I will amend it. I
prescribe to none: no, not the meanest; but onely
desire to learne of all the learned, to help the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned.
<pb facs="tcp:6954:12"/>
In the worke I take nothing to my selfe, but
the wants. What I receiued of others, I receiued to
this ende; after full triall made of them to publish
them for the common good. This I haue professed
from the beginning of my trauell. I would also giue
euery one his due particularly, what I haue had of
him; and will, if it shall bee thought meete. I haue
promised nothing but my labour: that I haue and
doe desire to performe to my abilitie and aboue.
The vveaker I am, the fitter shall I bee to apply my
selfe to the simplest: and the more honour God shall
haue, if hee shall giue that blessing vnto it, which I
doe humbly begge. If any man shall oppose, and
detract from these my labours; forasmuch, as hee
shall therein (as I take it) shew himselfe an enemie to
the common good of the present Age, and of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie
(the benefite whereof, as God is my witnesse,
I haue intended principally in these my endeauours)

both of his owne, and other mens doings, what

            <p>This way, as he sheweth, is by causing the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

secondly, to construe truely: thirdly, to parse exactly:
fourthly, to translate into English plainely: fiftly, to
translate out of the English into the Latine of the

how neere he came vnto it. Finally, by much
translating both wayes, chiefely out of the English
into Latine, as hee setteth downe in the beginning of
his second booke; and hereby hee saw those strange
experiments of the increase of learning, which hee
reporteth of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Whitney,</hi> and others. Now,
whereas these things are very hard to bee performed
in the common schooles; especially for lacke of time
to trie and compare euery schollars translation, and
euer giuing them new peeces to translate, and those
such as are meete for euery forme; by the meanes
of these translations of our first schoole Authors, all
these things may bee performed in euery Author
and forme, most certainely and constantly, and with
much ease and delight both to Maister and Schollars;
as I trust will be found. The manner hereof I haue
set downe in the 8. Chapter, and others following.
Therfore since the time that God made these knowne

the parricular vses and benefits of them: Thirdly, to
finde out and set downe such directions, as whereby
to frame the translations to serue for all the vses most
plainely: Fourthly, to translate so many of our first
Authors after the same manner, as since that time I
<pb facs="tcp:6954:14"/>
haue had occasion for my schollars in each forme to
reade: Fiftly, to haue certaine triall and experience of
euery thing, so much as in this time I could; and vpon
triall to commend them to Schooles, to help hereby
to bring into Schooles that excellent way of learning,
which hee so highly commendeth, and whereof I
haue very great hope; and so by them a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
benefit to all schooles and good
learning: which I vnfainedly
wish and pray for.

                  <p>The matter (if you will giue mee leaue) is this. I

and that of late yeares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you haue set your selfe wholly to this
happy kinde of trauell; to finde out the most plaine, easie,

in this behalfe. Now my long iourney hath bin for this

For, I my selfe haue so long laboured in this moyling and

I finde any delight therein: whereas, notwithstanding, I
heare of some others, and euen of our old acquaintance,
whom GOD blesseth greatly in this calling; though such

                  <p>Indeede I haue trauelled in this too vnthankefull a
calling (as you doe most iustly complaine) and that in all
this time, since we liued together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the greatest part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I haue beene well acquainted with your griefes and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations;
which are no other then doe ordinarily waite vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this our function: yet this I thankefully acknowledge
(according to your former speech, and to giue you likewise
some reuiuing) that now of late, since I set my selfe more
conscionably and earnestly to seeke out the best waies of
teaching, by inquiring, conferring and practicing constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all the most likely courses, which I could heare or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise,
God hath graunted vnto mee, to finde so great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and ioy of this same labour in my schoole, that it hath
swallowed vp the remembrance of all my former grieuances.
For I doe plainely see such a change,<note place="margin">More true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

labour in my place vsually without griefe, or any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse
at all, but that I can take ordinarilie more true
delight and pleasure in following my children (by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the earnest strife and emulation which is amongst
them, which of them shall doe the best, and in the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
increase of their learning and towardnesse) then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
one can take in following hawkes and hounds, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other the pleasantest recreation,<note place="margin">The fruit of this trauel is euer the swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it after.</note> as I verely perswade my
selfe. And the rather because after my labour ended, my
chiefest delight is in the remembrance thereof; and in
the consideration of the certaine good, that I knowe shall
come thereby, both vnto Church and Common-wealth:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6954:17"/>
and also that my labour and seruice is acceptable to the Lord,
though all men should be vnthankfull. So that now I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so well, as when I am most diligent in my place. Yea I do
seeme to my selfe to finde withall so great a blessing vpon my
labours,<note place="margin">Knowledge &amp; practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had done ten times more good, and my whole life had beene
full of much sweete contentment, in regard of that which it
hath bin. Although my labours haue neuer been vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
but that I haue still sent forth for euery yeere,
some vnto the Vniuersities, and they approoued amongst the
better sort of those which haue come thither: yet this hath
been nothing to that good which I might vndoubtedly haue
done.</p>

                  <p>There was contained, in it, a briefe summe of sundrie
particular benefits, which may bee brought to Grammar
Schooles, to make schollars very perfect in euerie part of

and Schollars may proceede with ease, certaintie and

by fifteene yeeres of age. Concerning which seuerall heads,
although it were a most happie worke if they could be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto (all of them beeing in my minde verie excellent,
and indeede the whole, such a worke as must needes bring a

and that not onely to the present but to all succeeding ages)
yet that I may speake freely, what I conceiue of them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them seeme very strange vnto me. And, although I
will not say that they are vtterly impossible: yet indeede I
take them to be altogether vnlikely; considering the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall

assistance and blessing, through constant diligence
they may be all effected; for that I haue knowne so much

besides that they do all stand vpon plain &amp; sure grounds, as I

they may be done. Neither doe I doubt but to satisfie you in
euery point, and to cause you to yeelde vnto the euidence
hereof, before wee part, if you will but onely aske and still
shewe mee wherein you are not satisfied. Moreouer, I am so
verie confident herein, not onely vpon mine owne reason
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6954:18"/>
and experience, but because I haue knowne the iudgements
of sundrie verie learned and experienced both Schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

and haue thought as you doe, yet within a quarter of an
hower after that they haue taken a little triall, in some of
the most vnlikely, and seene the reason of them, haue rested
fully satisfied and assured of the whole, that all might bee
done, as standing on the like grounds. And therefore I

                  <p>I finde that therein first is a very great want gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally;
for that the childe if hee be of any ordinary toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

or sooner rather. My reasons are these:</p>
                  <p>1 Because that then children will begin to conceiue of
instruction,<note place="margin">1. Because they are then meete to conceiue of learning and to delight in it.</note> and to vnderstand; and bee able not onely to

they not as well fit to learne those things which are good
and profitable for them, if they bee entred and drawen
on in such a manner, as they may take a delight and
finde a kinde of sport and plaie in the same. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
may and ought to bee in all their progresse, and
most of all in the first entrance, to make them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to goe through all the whole course of learning, and also
sith our labour is to finde out the meanes, whereby to

be obserued in spelling; that before (on) you spell or write

                  <p>If you pronounce the word false, which you would haue

a strea, (as in many places the countrey manner is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it) hee will spell strea or stre: but aske him how hee
spels a strawe and so pronounce it, and he will spell strawe.</p>

                  <p>In ioining syllables together,<note place="margin">4. Ioyning syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables together.</note> they must bee taught, to

                  <p>Thus they may goe through their Abcie,<note place="margin">Bookes to bee first learned of children.</note> and Primer.
And if they reade them twise ouer, that they may bee very
perfect in them, it will bee the better for them. For, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

haue sayd herein, it standeth all with so great reason: chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to make children so perfect in the hardest syllables. For,
they being perfect in these must needs attaine all the rest in
a short space. Except onely one thing which you vttered;
which indeede seemes a strange Paradox to me: Namely,
that some wise &amp; experienced, would haue children taught
to call and pronounce all their letters, and to spell any syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable

                  <p>This is very true which you say; it may seeme a
Paradox to them who haue not tryed it. I my selfe was of

your minde when I heard it first.<note place="margin">6. To teach lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their letters, and to spell before they know a letter, is the pleasantest way</note> Yet setting my selfe to

whom I heard it, and for that he shewed me experience of it
in a child not fowre yeeres olde; I found it the easiest, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santest
and shortest way of all, where one would begin in a
priuate house with little ones playing. The manner is thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
1. You must teach them, as I sayde, to call their fiue vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
and to pronounce them right: Which they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
learne,<note place="margin">How little ones will presently pronounce their fiue vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</note> if you do but only cause them to repeat them

                  <p>2 Then teach them to put the consonants in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

as thus: to begin with <hi>b,</hi> and to say ba, be, bi, bo, bu. So <hi>d.</hi>
da, de, di, do, du. <hi>f.</hi> fa, fe, fi, fo, fu. Thus teach them to
say all the rest, as it were singing them together, la, le, li, lo,
lu; The hardest to the last, as ca, ce, ci, co, cu. and ga, ge,
gi, go, gu. In which the sound is a little changed in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third syllables. When they can do all these, then
teach them to spell them in order,<note place="margin">To teach to spell these thus, putting the consonants first.</note> thus; What spels b-a? If
the child cannot tell, teach him to say thus; b-a, ba: so put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
first <hi>b.</hi> before euery vowell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to say b-a ba, b-e be, b-i bi,
b-o bo, b-u bu. Then aske him againe what spels b-a, and
he will tell you; so all the rest in order. By oft repeating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him he will certainly do it. After this if you aske him,
how he spels b-a, he will answere b-a ba. So in all others.</p>
                  <p>Next these teach them to put the vowels first, as to say,
ab, eb, ib, ob, ub. Then thus, a-b ab, e-b eb, i-b ib, o-b ob,
u-b ub. After; what spelles a-b, e-b, &amp;c. Thus to goe with
them backward and forward, crosse, in and out vntill they
can spell any word of two letters. Then you may adioine
those of three letters: Afterwards, all the hard syllables, to

will bee found in the end as you truely sayde. Yet there
is another matter that comes vnto my remembraunce, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which I haue taken no small griefe and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
manie a time, concerning this point of reading Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.
I will mention it here, and desire your iudgement how
to redresse it, although it might happely come-in-fitter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
                  <p>The trouble is this. That when as my children doe first
enter into Latine, manie of them will forget to reade
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6954:25"/>
English,<note place="margin">8.

                  <p>Now if you could teach me how to helpe this likewise,
that they might as well goe forward still in reading English
as in Latine, I should account this a very great benefit. For,
some of their Parents, who vse me the kindliest, will bee at
mee that their children may euerie daie reade some Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Bible, to helpe their reading of English. Now
this I cannot possibly doe, but they must needes bee hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in their latine, in some lessons or necessarie exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and eyther be behinde their fellowes, or else trouble
all their fellowes very much, that they cannot goe so fast
forward as they should, but stay for these readers. Others
being more ignorant or malitious, vpon euery light occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
are readie to rage and raile at me, for that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as they say, doe get no good vnder mee, but are worse
and worse. For, wheras they could haue read English per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
(it may be) when they came to mee, now they haue
forgotten to do it. Thus am I grieued on euery side, and

in our owne tongue,<note place="margin">Our chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauor should be for our own tongue.</note> and to increase in the practice of it,

that language which all sorts and conditions of men

of our owne language is to be esteemed a chiefe part of
the honour of our nation: which we all ought to aduance
as much as in vs lieth. As when Greece and Rome and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nations haue most florished, their languages also haue
beene most pure: and from those times of Greece &amp; Rome,
wee fetch our chiefest patterns, for the learning of their
tongues. 3. Because of those which are for a time trained

in comparison of them that follow other callings.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6954:27"/>
Onely I haue seen the bookes of construing Lillies rules,

it would rather make them idle, being but a truants booke.

imagine.<note place="margin">The chief fault of the children going backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding English, when they first learne latine, is in the Parents themselues.</note> Experience makes me confident: Yet to returne
vnto your selfe, concerning the complaint of the Parents,
for their children going backward in reading English, when
they first learne latine; the chiefe fault in truth is in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
themselues; although we poore schoolemasters must
be sure to beare all. For if such murmuring Parents, would
would but cause their children, euery day after dinner or
supper, or both, to reade a Chapter of the Bible, or a peece
of a Chapter, as leasure would permit, and to doe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly;
therby to shew their loue to the Lord, and his word,
and their desire to haue the word dwell plentifully in their
houses, to haue their children trained vp in it, as young Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy
was; then I say, this complaint would soon be at an
end: for they should either seethen, their children to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in this, or else they should discerne the fault to be in
their childrens dulnesse, and not in our neglect. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
sith that they are so very fewe of whome wee can
hope, that they haue any care of this duetie in their houses,
in respect of all the rest who omit it, and yet all the blame
must surely rest on vs, it concerneth vs so much as we can
to redresse it; and therefore vse all good meanes, to cut off
all occasions of clamours, and of discrediting our selues,
and our schooles, and to contend for the greatest profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of our children, aswell in this, as in any other part of
learning; the vse of this being, as we heard, most generall

                  <p>You haue directed mee very rightly how to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
such Parents: now I shall be able to shew them where
the fault is, and bee calling vpon them to redresse this at

home. I shall also indeuor to put all this in vre, and more as
you make the particulars more fully known vnto me; and
as I shall finde by triall the fruit heereof. But now, that you
haue thus satisfied me in all these my doubts; I cannot but
demand yet one other point, wherein I finde another great
want, though not comparable to the former; because there
is not so much vse of it: which is about the ordinary num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
or numbring. For I am much troubled about this, that
my readers and others aboue them, are much to seeke in all
matters of numbers, whether in figures or in letters. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they heare the chapters named in the church,
many of them cannot turn to them, much less to the verse.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>This likewise is a very ordinary defect,<note place="margin">An ordinary fault, that most schollars are to seek in matters of common numbers, which they may bee taught in an hower or two.</note> &amp; yet might
easily be helped by common means, in an howr or two. I
call it ordinary, because you shall haue schollars, almost rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to goe to the Vniuersity, who yet can hardly tell you the
number of pages, sections, chapters, or other diuisions in
their books, to find what they should. And it is as you say,
a great &amp; a fowle want; because, without the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of these numbers, schollars cannot help themselues
by the Indices, or Tables of such books, as they should vse,
for turning to any thing of a sodaine: although it be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wherof they should haue vse all their life long. And to
conclude, it is a great neglect, because it is a thing so easie, as
that it may be learned in so short a time, only by most vsuall
meanes, as by these following. For numbers by letters, vse
but only to appose them,<note place="margin">Numbers by letters knowen easily, yet oft neglected.</note> according to the direction in the
latine Grammar at <hi>Orthographia,</hi> &amp; they will do them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.
As if you aske what I. stands for, what V. what X.
what L. &amp;c. And back againe, what letter stands for one, so
what for fiue, or forten. But specially if you desire to haue
them very ready herein, cause them to haue these written, &amp;
then to practice to read them ouer often, vntil that they can
answer any of them perfectly. Warn them also to remember
alwaies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that any number set after a greater, or after the same
nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, doth add so many mo, as the value of that later nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
is. As, I. set after X. thus, XI. doth make eleuen. XV. fifteen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:6954:28"/>
XX. twentie. But being set before, they doe take away so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
many as they are: as I. before X. thus, IX. nine.</p>
                  <p>If you wish an example more at large this may serue; let
each of them that should learne haue a briefe of these, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this maner, to shew them all the chiefe numbers. I. one,
II. two, III. three, IIII. or IV. fowre, V. fiue, VI. six, VII.
seauen, VIII. eight, IX. nine, X. tenne, XI. eleuen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> XII.

thirtie, XL. fortie, L fifty, XC. ninetie, C. a hundreth, D.
fiue hundreth, M. a thousand. And thus much shortly for
numbring by letters.</p>
                  <p>For the numbers by figures,<note place="margin">Numbers by figures.</note> this rule must also be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
That the figures do signifie in the first place so much

                     </gap>ly, as if they were alone, or one time so many. In the 2.
place tennes, or tenne times so many. In the third place,
hundreths, or a hundreth times so many. In the fourth
place thousands, or a thousand times so many. In the fift
place ten thousands. In the sixt place hundreth thousands;
the places being reconed from the right hand to the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These beeing learned backewards and forwards, so that
your schollar be able to know each of them, to call them
or name them right, &amp; to find them out, as the child should
finde any letter which he is to learne: in a word, to tell what
any of these numbers stand for, or how to set downe any of
them; will performe fully so much as is needfull for your
ordinarie Grammar schollar. If you do require more for
any; you must seeke Records Arithmetique, or other like
Authors and set them to the Cyphering schoole.</p>

cleere; which wil not run abroad, nor blot: their paper good;
that is, such as is white, smooth, and which will beare inke,
&amp; also that it be made in a book.<note place="margin">Writing books kept faire.</note> Their writing books would
be kept faire strait ruled, &amp; each to haue a blotting paper to

the making,<note place="margin">4. Euery one to learne to make his owne pen.</note> and mending of pens, will be a very great
hinderance, both to the Masters and to the Schollars. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that, when they are away from their Masters (if they
haue not a good pen made before) they wil write naught; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they know not how to make their pens themselues.</p>
                  <p>The best manner of making the pen,<note place="margin">The manner of making the pen.</note> is thus:</p>
                  <p>1. Choose the quil of the best and strongest of the wing,
which is somewhat harder, and will cleaue.</p>
                  <p>2. Make it cleane with the backe of the pen-knife.</p>
                  <p>3. Cleaue it strait vp the backe; first with a cleft,<note place="margin">Cleft of the penne.</note> made
with your pen-knife: after with another quill put into it,
riue it further by little and little, till you see the cleft to be
very cleane: so you may make your pen of the best of the
quil, &amp; where you see the cleft to be the cleanest, &amp; without
teeth. If it doe not cleaue without teeth, cleaue it with your
pen-knife in another place, still neerer the backe: for if it be
nor strait vp the backe, it will very seldome run right. After,
make the nebbe and cleft both about one length, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
aboue a barley corne breadth, &amp; small; so as it may
let downe the inke,<note place="margin">The neb of the pen.</note> and write cleane. Cut the nebbe
first slant downewards to make it thinne, and after strait
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6954:30"/>
ouerthwart. Make both sides of equall bignesse, vnlesse
you bee conning to cut that side, which lieth vpon the long
finger, thinner and shorter; yet so little, as the difference can

the surest.</p>
                  <p>The speediest and surest way to learne to make the pen,<note place="margin">The surest way for making the pen.</note>
is this. When your Shollar shall naue a good pen fit for his
hand, and well fashioned; then to viewe and mark that well,
and to trie to make one in all things like vnto it. It were
good for the learner to procure such a penne made, and to
keepe it for a patterne, to make others by vntill he be very
perfect in it. A childe may soone learne to make his pen;
yet, fewe of age do know how to make their owne pennes
well, although they haue written long and very much: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can any attaine to write faire without that skill.</p>
                  <p>Next vnto this,<note place="margin">How to holde the pen.</note> cause your schollar to holde his penne
right, as neere vnto the nebbe as hee can, his thumbe and
two fore-fingers, almost closed together, round about the
neb, like vnto a cats foote, as some of the Scriueners doe
terme it.</p>
                  <p>Then let him learne to carry his pen as lightly as he can,<note place="margin">To cary the pen so lightly as to glide on the paper.</note>
to glide or swimme vpon the paper. So hee shall write the
cleanest, fayrest, and fastest, and also his pen shall last the
longe.</p>
                  <p>Insteede of setting of copies and to saue that endlesse
toyle,<note place="margin">Copies. In stead of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting copies to haue copie bookes faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the top of their books.</note> let euery one haue a little copie booke fastened to the
top of his writing booke, with a strong thread of a spanne
long, or thereabout; that alwaies when he writeth, he may
lay his copie booke close before him, and that the side of
the copie, may almost touch the line where he writeth, that
his eye may be vpon the copie, and vpon his letter both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
And also, to the end that euer when he hath done
writing, he may put his copie booke into his writing booke
againe; so that the copie may neuer bee out of the waie,
nor the Schollar write without it.</p>
                  <p>The fittest volume for their writing a booke is, to haue
them in <hi>quarto.</hi>

Moreouer, the copie bookes would be made thus.<note place="margin">Maner of the copie bookes.</note> Not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

                  <p>1 One line of small letters, of each letter one, except

letters, after the same manner; and vnder them both a line
or two of ioyning hand, containing all the letters in them.</p>
                  <p>Examples of both sorts for the present vntill better can
bee found may be these. I meane copies both of Secretary

                  <p>Respect not the verse, but the vse.</p>
                  <p>Vnder all these, may be fitly set in very little room those
characters or letters, out of which all the rest of the letters

The often change &amp; following of diuerse hands,<note place="margin">Inconuenience of following diuers hands.</note> doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

may be.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time,<note place="margin">The best writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten copies to be procured.</note> vntill such copies can be had, some

                  <p>Otherwise when for lacke heereof,<note place="margin">Inconuenience of the lacke of such bookes.</note> the Master, or Vsher,

mentioned, of change of hands, and that few Masters or V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers
are fit pen men, to write such copies as were necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, because thorough want of such copies, schollars
do write ordinarily without direction or pattern, in all their
exercises; whereby they either grow to very bad hands, or
do profit in writing,<note place="margin">Faire writing to be practiced by all the schollars once euery day.</note> little or not at all.</p>
                  <p>This exercise of writing faire, would be practiced by all

                  <p>Now those that write exercises, may take the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie

                  <p>In al writing this general rule would be obserued streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

                  <p>Great care would bee had withall, to make euery

be made ouer sharpe, nor pressed downe ouer hard in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
because they wil then race the paper, and make it that
it will not beare inke. They are moreouer to rule but a few
lines at once: because the lines being drawen but lightly,
will soone go out, and not be seene before that the learners
come to write in them.</p>
                  <p>Also this care must be had in ruling, to cary the ruling
pen so euen and straight forward,<note place="margin">☜</note> that both the lines which

                  <p>Cause your schollar to drawe his lines, on which hee
wil write his copies, of the very same length with the length
of the line of his copie: and then if he write iust so much
in his line as is in the copie, it is very like that he makes his
letters of a good proportion, not too bigge nor too little,
and the compasse euen, not one ouer neere, or far off from
an other. But if hee write more in a shorter space, then is
in like space in the copie, he either makes his letters too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
or sets them too neere one another; letters, or words, or
both. And so on the other side, if he write lesse in a line,
then is in his copie in the same space, and length, then hee
makes his letters too bigge, or too wide asunder.</p>

                  <p>For writing straight without lines (after that they haue

that they haue their faults shewed them, by pointing them to

1. That Schollars be taught to do all things with

matter which they learne. And so in euery lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which they learne in any tongue, first to vnderstand
the matter of it, and the lesson will bee learned presently.</p>
                  <p>But before I speake any more of this, I pray you let

                  <p>This first obseruation seemeth strange vnto me,<note place="margin">The common course to doe all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the reason of them or how to make vse of any thing.</note>
at the very naming of it. I my selfe haue vsed onely this
course, and I thinke it to bee all that is done in most of
our countrey schooles; To giue Lectures to the seuerall
formes, or cause some schollar to doe it. And therin first
to reade them ouer their Lecture, then to construe them,
and in the lower formes to parse them. So when they come
to say; to heare them whether they can read, say without
book, construe and parse. More as I take it, is not much
vsed, for the vnderstanding and making vse of them.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>I know it to be as you say; and do hold it to bee a
verie great defect in schooles generally:<note place="margin">The defect hereof excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great.</note> yea a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hinderance to learning, then that of letting them to
lose so many yeeres, before they begin to learne. For this
is a matter which of all other concerneth the credite of
schooles, and furthereth learning wonderfully; to teach
schollars to vnderstand whatsoeuer they learn, &amp; to be able
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6954:36"/>
to giue a reason of euery thing why it is so; and to doe this
from the lowest to the highest. My reasons are these:</p>
                  <p>1 Because if it were rightly knowen,<note place="margin">To doe all things by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, brings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most double learning.</note> &amp; constantly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
in schooles, it would bring forth very neere double so
much good and sound learning, as is now gotten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly.</p>
                  <p>2 It would bring withall, so much ease, pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
both to all teachers &amp; learners and also so much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
&amp; cause them to go forward with such cheerfulness,
boldness and contention, as will hardly be beleeued vntil it
be tried by experience. In a word; It would cause at things
to be gotten much more speedily, layed vp more safely, and
kept more surely in memory. Therefore, that olde rule is
true;
<q>Legere &amp; non intelligere negligere est.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To read and not to vnderstand what wee read,<note place="margin">To read with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how to make vse, is a neglect of all learning.</note> or not to
know how to make vse of it, is nothing else but a neglect of
all good learning; and a meere abuse of the means &amp; helps
to attaine the same. It is no other thing but a very losse of
our pretious time, and of all our labour and cost bestowed
therin, in regard of that which is read with vnderstanding.</p>
                  <p>We may see triall hereof sundry waies.</p>
                  <p>1 Let children be examined together;<note place="margin">Triall of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween learning with vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp; without 1. In schollars examined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereof one vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and can giue reasons of things, the other not.</note> I meane such as
of whom one of them alone hath beene taught to do all
things by reason &amp; with vnderstanding; so that he is able to
giue you a plaine reason, and make the right vse of euerie
thing, which he hath learned: the other haue learned only
to say without booke, to construe and parse; then mark the
difference. Although all these learn one and the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;
yet when they come to the triall, you would thinke
that one to haue all learning, when you heare him to giue a
reason of euery thing, and that he can make vse of al things;
all the rest to haue almost nothing at all, or at least nothing
in regard of that one so taught.</p>
                  <p>2 Proue it thus in getting learning:<note place="margin">2. In getting a lesson, how to do it soonest, &amp; in the best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Teach your schollar one lesson which you cause him to
vnderstand perfectly before; another of the same matter,
whereof hee vnderstandeth little or nothing: and then trie
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6954:36"/>
whether he will not doe that, whereof he vnderstandeth the
meaning and reasons, almost in half the time, which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will require. And this also so, as you may euidently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
it, that hee will doe it with much more ease, certainty
and boldnesse, then he can do the other.</p>
                  <p>3 Wee our selues may make triall of it by our owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,<note place="margin">3. In our owne experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struing or stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying out any difficult place in any Author or tongue.</note>
in construing any difficult peece of Latine, Greek,
or Hebrewe, or committing any thing to memorie; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if so be that we doe but vnderstand the matter of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
perfectly, wee shall not do it in halfe the time and with
one halfe of the labour, that otherwise it would require.</p>
                  <p>Or if we would write or speake of any thing, let vs proue
it but thus: If we first vnderstand the matter wel and haue
it perfectly in our head, whether words to expresse our
mindes will not follow as of themselues.</p>
                  <p>To this very purpose, for confirming the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and to keepe a continuall remembrance of this point;
these three verses of Horace were worthie to be written in
letters of golde, and to be imprinted in the memorie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one who is desirous to get the best learning: for so they
would indeed proue golden verses, and make vndoubtedly
golden times;

                  </p>
                  <p>The meaning of the verses, I take it to be this: To at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to this facultie, to bee able to write or speake of anie
matter, and so to come to all excellent learning, the verie
first and chiefe fountaine, and that which is all in all, is to
vnderstand the matter wel in the first place. As for store of
matter, the writings of learned men (such as Socrates was)
will furnish you aboundantly therewith.</p>
                  <p>And when you haue the matter throughly in your head,
words will follow, as waters out of a fountaine, euen almost
naturally, to expresse your mind in any tongue, which you
studie in any right order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:6954:37"/>
This will be found to be true in Latine, Greeke, Hebrew,
and by a like reason in euery other tongue, and in euery fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie:
whether wee would write, speake, learne, resolue, or
remember and lay vp for euer.</p>
                  <p>This was a principall cause that made Tully,<note place="margin">One chiefe cause why Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil and others writ so eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because they were so ripe in vnderstanding, and had such store of matter.</note> Ouid, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,
and some others so to flowe in eloquence; and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Virgil, whom men worthily account the chiefe of all
latine Poets, because they did vnderstand so fully whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they writ of. I might instance this also in Preachers,
by our daily experience; of whom some are better able to
preach powerfully in two daies warning, and hauing words
at will, then other in two moneths; and all because the one
sort are so full of vnderstanding and matter, the other are
so barren thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thus in all these examples, euery man may see a plaine
demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stration of the truth of these verses of Horace, which
he no doubt did write vpon his owne experience, as euerie
man shall find, who will set himself to make triall. Proue &amp;
confirme what tong soeuer your schollar learns,<note place="margin">Trie.</note> euen from
the first reading of English, if he can repeat you the matter,
or the sum of it, or haue it in his head, trie whether hee will
not haue the words presently. The plentifull experience
which I haue seene,<note place="margin">They who find experience will be desirous to make others partakers.</note> of the sweete delight and fruite of this
course, of causing children to doe all things with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

the thing, but also desirous to make all other partakers of

                  <p>My next obseruation is this:<note place="margin">The second ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that as I would haue
them to doe all things with vnderstanding; so to learne on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such bookes and matters, as whereof they may haue the
best vse,<note place="margin">To learne only such things, as whereof they may haue good and perpetuall vse.</note> and that perpetually in all their learning, or in their
whole life. For this is well knowne to euery one; that things
well learned in youth, will bee kept most surely all the life
long; because in that age they are most easily imprinted,
and sticke the longest in fresh memory. And for that cause,
children should spend no time vnfruitfully, in such books,
as whereof they cannot haue both very good and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
vse. This cannot be but a great folly, to mis-spend our
pretious time in such studies, whereof neither our selues
nor others can haue benefite after; or else in such, as the
knowledge whereof will vanish for want of practice: and
much more in those, which will corrupt and hurt in stead
of doing good.<note place="margin">Filthy places in Poets omitted.</note> And therefore all filthy places in the Poets
would be wisely passed ouer, or warily expounded. It were
well if there were an <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> to purge out all

Third rule,<note place="margin">3. To note all hard words, or matters worthy obseruation.</note> and that generall for all Students, is this: that
whatsoeuer difficult words, or matters of speciall obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they doe reade in any Author, be marked out; I meane
all such words or things, as eyther are hard to them in the
learning of them, or which are of some speciall excellency,
or vse, worthy the noting: or which, after that they haue
beene a certaine time in construction, they haue not eyther
learned, or at least they knowe not where they haue learned
them.<note place="margin">Manner of marking.</note> For the marking of them, to doe it with little lines
vnder them, or aboue them, or against such partes of the
word wherein the difficulty lieth, or by some prickes, or
whatsoeuer letter or marke may best helpe to cal the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the thing to remembrance; yet so much as may be,
without marring of their books. To doe this, to the end that
they may oft-times reade ouer these, or examine and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
of them more seriously, vntill that they be as perfect in
them, as in any of the rest of their bookes: for hauing these
then haue they all.</p>
                  <p>This would be vniuersall,<note place="margin">This general in getting all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> in getting all kind of learning;
after that children do grow to any discretion to marke such
things rightly: you will maruel (if you haue not made triall

they will come vnto in any kinde of study; and how
soone by this helpe, more then they can do without it. And
when they haue once gotten it they may as easily keepe it, &amp;
as surely, by oft-times running ouer those things, which are
so noted, aboue all the rest. This is the reason that you shall
haue the choysest bookes of most great learned men,<note place="margin">The bookes of the best stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents thus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> &amp; the
notablest students all marked through thus, in all matters
eyther obscure, or of principall &amp; most necessary vse. And
this is one chiefe meanes, whereby Schollars may haue the
difficultest things in their Authours so perfectly, as that
whensoeuer they shall be examined of a sudden, they shall
be very ready, to their great praise, and to the iust commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Schoole.<note place="margin">To note books of dailyvse with inke.</note> For the manner of noting, it is best
to note all schoole books with inke; &amp; also all others, which

                  <p>The very little ones, which reade but English, may
make some secret markes thus at euery hard word; though
but with some little dint with their naile: so that they doe
not marre their bookes.</p>
                  <p>Of this I shall speake more particularly in the manner
of parsing, Chapt. 9.</p>
                  <p>A fourth obseruation,<note place="margin">4. To learne all so perfectly, as the former may be in stead of a Schoolmaster to the later.</note> is this: That whatsoeuer books
or matter Schollars doe learne, after they beginne to learne
without booke; that they learne them so perfectly, and
holde them so surely, by daily repetition and examination,
that they may haue in their mindes such an absolute know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of al the words, and matters which they haue learned;
as wheresoeuer they shall meete with the same againe, or
shall haue occasion to vse them, they may not neede to bee
driuen to learne them anew; but that they may tell of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
where they haue learned them, or can repeat the place:
and so make their vse and benefit of them.</p>
                  <p>To teach the same things twise,<note place="margin">Not to neede to teach the same things twise or thrise ouer.</note> or thrise, is a double la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and griefe: but to haue all things which they haue
learned, euer in readinesse is a singular benefit, and a rare
commendation. For besides the preuenting of all losse of
labour and time, it shall be to the great delight of all who
heare them tried, and the exceeding furtherance of their
continuall growth in all good learning.</p>
                  <p>And to effect this yet more fully;<note place="margin">To tell where they haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euery hard word.</note> acquaint them in all
their Lectures and exercises, some one of them or other,
who can tell first, to repeat where they haue learned euery
hard word: and that chiefly in their Grammar, if they haue
learned it there, to haue that exceeding perfect; and to
marke surely euery new word, according to the direction
which I haue before giuen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:6954:39"/>
A fift generall obseruation,<note place="margin">5. That the whole Schoole be diuided into so few fourmes as may be.</note> and which is not inferiour
to any of the former, for the good both of Masters and
Schollars, and the very great benefite of Schooles, is this:
that the whole Schoole be diuided into so few fourmes as
may be, of so many as can any way bee fitted to goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
though they be sixteene, or twenty, yea, forty in a
fourme, it is not the worse.</p>
                  <p>The reasons of it are most cleere.</p>
                  <p>1. In most things it is almost the same labour,<note place="margin">Reasons:</note> to teach
twenty,<note place="margin">1. It is for most part the same labour, to teach twenty in a fourme, as to teach two.</note> as to teach two: as in reading all Lectures and rules
vnto them, in examining all partes and Lectures. Like as it
is in Sermons, and Catechisings, where it is the same labour
to teach one, that it is to teach a thousand, if all can heare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
This is very generall, except in exercises of writing;
wherin also great aduantage may be gotten by this means,
if right order be obserued, as we shall shew after.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly,<note place="margin">2. The fewer fourmes, the more labour may be besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning euery title.</note> the fewer fourmes there are, the more time
may be spent in each fourme; and more labour may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
in examining euery title necessary. Which worke
of continuall examination, is a notable quickner and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risher
of all good learning; helping maruellously vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
audacity, memory, and prouoking emulation of
the Schollars:<note place="margin">Examination, a quickner of learning.</note> and therfore a principall part of the Masters
labour, and of the time in the Schoole, would be imployed
in this.</p>
                  <p>3. By this meanes,<note place="margin">Euery one of a fourme shall some way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the others by this means.</note> euery one of a fourme shall some way
prouoke, or incourage the rest of their fellowes. If they be
but dull, the rest will thinke to goe before them; but if they
be more pregnant and witty, or more painfull and diligent,
they shall put spirits into all the rest, and be as a spurre vnto
them. For there is in our nature an inbred desire to ayme
at the best, and to wish to equalize them in each commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
quality; if there be right meanes of direction and
incouragement thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Also euery one of a fourme may some way helpe the rest:<note place="margin">And euery one may helpe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note>
for none are so dull, but they may happely remember some
thing, which none of the rest did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:6954:39"/>
This I haue seene by experience,<note place="margin">Those who but reade, to be put together so many as can be.</note> to be the very best way;
euen for those who but reade the Accedence, to put so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them into a fourm together, as may be: they wil both
further one another very much, in reading it quickly (each
helping and teaching others) and also they may sooner be
heard, when euery one need but to reade his piece of the
same lesson, the rest helping. Thus they will goe through
very fast, and be all ready to enter without booke together.
Trie, and finding the benefite, you will not alter.</p>
                  <p>6 A sixt generall obseruation,<note place="margin">6, To haue a great care that none be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</note> and of no lesse worth
then any of the former, may be this: That there be most
heedfull care, chiefly amongst all the youngest, that not
one of them be any way discouraged, eyther by bitternesse
of speech, or by taunting disgrace; or else by seuerity of
correction, to cause them to hate the Schoole before they
knowe it, or to distast good learning before they haue felt
the sweetnesse of it:<note place="margin">But all to be prouoked by emulation and desire of praise.</note> but in stead heereof, that all things in
Schooles be done by emulation, and honest contention,
through a wise commending in them euery thing, which
any way deserueth prayse, and by giuing preeminence in
place, or such like rewards. For that adage is not so aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
as true; <hi>Laus excitat ingenium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no such a Whet-stone,<note place="margin">Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Whet-stone of the wit.</note> to set an edge vpon a
good wit, or to incourage an ingenuous nature to learning
as praise is, as our learned Master <hi>Askam</hi> doth most rightly
affirme.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose that sentence of <hi>Tully</hi> were worthy to be
written in euery Schoole,<note place="margin">A sentence of <hi>Tully</hi> worthy to be euer before the Masters eye.</note> and to be set vp in such places,
where it might euer stand in the Masters eye, if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
that so euery teacher might at length be brought to
the continuall practice, of the good policy contained in it:
to wit, to bend all his endeauours to prouoke all his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
to striue incessantly, which of them shall carry away
the worthiest praise &amp; commendation. The sentence is this;</p>
                  <p>Pueriefferuntur laetitiacum vicerint,<note place="margin">Cic. 5. de finib.</note> &amp; pudet victos: vt

non perferunt vt aequaliumprincipes sint?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:6954:40"/>
Besides this also,<note place="margin">This strift for Masteries is the most commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable play, and a chiefe meanes to make the Schoole <hi>Ludus literarius.</hi>
                     </note> this same strift for these Masteries, and
for rewards of learning, is the most commendable play,
and the very high way to make the Schoole-house to bee
<hi>Ludus literarius,</hi> indeed a Schoole of play and pleasure
(as was said) and not of feare and bondage: although there
must bee alwaies a meete and louing feare, furthered by
wise seueritie, to maintaine authority, and to make it also
<hi>Ludus à non lude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do,</hi> a place voyd of al fruitless play &amp; loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
the better to be able to effect al this good w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we desire.</p>
                  <p>7. To the end that euery thing in the Schoole may be
thus done,<note place="margin">7. All to haue their aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and so to be matched and placed, that all may be done by strift.</note> by emulation and contention for praise; there
would be a carefull sorting, and matching euery one with
him, who is next vnto him in learning: for this is also a most
true prouerbe; <hi>Marcet sine aduersario virtus:</hi> Vertue loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the vigour and decayeth, where it hath no aduersarie.
So they would be placed as aduersaries, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
in all things, whether of them shall doe the better, and
beare the bell away. Thus the whole fourmes through the
Schoole, should be diuided also into two equall partes; to
striue alwaies, whether side of the fourme should get the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie:
like as it is in games, at shooting, or the like. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
sheweth how this will prouoke them, to be preparing
and fitting for the victory. Euen as Archers will prepare
themselues by exercising, getting the best bowes &amp; arrowes;
and then making first their choyse so equall as they can, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
directing their fellows; thus striuing by all means,
whether side shal beat: so will it be here. But of this I shall
haue more fit occasion, to tell what I thinke, when we shall
speake of the manner of diuiding of the fourmes.</p>
                  <p>8. That we vse euer to appose the worst and most negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

euery thing audibly,<note place="margin">9. Continuall care of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation.</note> leasurely, distinctly, &amp; natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally;

somwhat; &amp; shal speake more in the due place, what a
grace sweete pronunciation giues vnto all learning, and
how the want of it doth altogether mar, or much deforme
the most excellent speech.</p>
                  <p>10. That they haue daily some speciall exercise of the

Apologues or fables, theames, disputations, and the like.</p>
                  <p>The reason is, because the daily practice hereof, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to preuent the ouertoyling, &amp; terrifying of Schollars with
it, and to supply some things better otherwise; I hope I shall
take a fitter place to speake of it hereafter.</p>
                  <p>11. That for whatsoeuer exercises they are to learne,<note place="margin">11. To haue the best patternes, of all sorts.</note>
they haue the best patternes to follow, which can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured:

proue in time, eyther to expresse their patterne very liuely,

with farre greater ease, in lesse time and with much more

soon and readily as you shall teach one. Also to make them
more full of vnderstanding, that they shall be able to make
right vse of their rules, to enter into construction, and goe
forward readily together in construing, parsing &amp; making

                     </gap>
meanes how all this may be effected are these:</p>
                  <p>1 For reading the Accedence.</p>
                  <p>So soone as they enter into the Accedence,<note place="margin">The best means for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to read the Accedence.</note> put so many
of them into a fourm as you can well, to enter together; as
was shewed before. And therein first, reade them ouer
their lesson, telling them the meaning shortly, to make
them a little to vnderstand it: and so they will learne it much
sooner. Then let them one helpe another, as they will doe
learning together,<note place="margin">Euer one to be reading, all the rest marking &amp; helping.</note> and euery one will draw on another; one
of them euer reading ouer the lesson, that all the rest may

heare, and the rest telling where he misseth; and so neuer i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
till all can read it. When they come to say, cause euerie
one of the fourm to read his peece in order, in like manner
the rest to help where he sticks.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes there will not bee much more labour
with twelue, then with one alone. Experience also wil shew,
that they will all goe forwarde more fast and surely then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other way. And although that they goe faster forward,
and not so very perfectly as they thus read it first, yet they
will soone reade most readily, when they come to get with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
booke.</p>
                  <p>When they haue once gone through it within booke,<note place="margin">☞</note> let
them begin to learne it without booke.<note place="margin">Learning the Accedence without book, to take but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at once.</note> Or else if they can
reade well before, you may let them learne to reade thus, as

then some howre or two would bee spent daily in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
in reading,<note place="margin">This rule must be generall of all learning that seemeth hard &amp; of things to be gotten perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but here spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</note> or som day of the week separate therto: els

little on a day; which must be carefully preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. Therfore
it will not bee amisse to reade it ouer speedily once or twise
before. When they learne without book; let them vse this
Caueat especially; That they take but little at a time, so as
they may be able to get it quickly and well, and so go on to
a new lesson: for this will harten them exceedingly to take
paines, in reioicing how many lessons they haue learned
and how soone they haue learned each lesson; Wheras gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them ouermuch, it will put them out of heart, so that
they will either doe nothing at all, or with no life.</p>
                  <p>2 Before they goe in hand with a lesson, doe what you
can to make them to vnderstand the summe of the lesson

will your children vnderstand them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore any long question is to be diuided into as
many short ones as you may, according to the parts of the
question. Hereby the dullest capacities will come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the hardest questions in time, and proceed with more
facility; so that the masters doe enter them thus from the

they wil keep.<note place="margin">Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple how to make the child to vnderstand by shewing the meaning.</note> To make this plain by example. To begin at
In Speech be, &amp;c. First, read them over the words: Then
tell them for the meaning after this manner, or the like as
you please. The meaning is this; That in Speech which
men vtter, there is nothing but words to cal or know things
by, and setting or ioyning of words together. Like as it is
in our English tongue, so in the latine, &amp; so in other tongues.
And of these words which make this speech, are not manie
parts or kindes, but onely eight parts of speech. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
can be spoken belongeth to one of these eight parts.
They are either Nownes, or Pronowns, or Verbs, or one of
the rest. More shortly thus; There is not any word in any
language whatsoeuer, but it is either a Nown or a Pronown,
Verbe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:6954:43"/>
Also of these eight parts, the fowre first onely are such
as may be declined. That is, such as each of them may bee
turned or framed diuerse waies, and haue diuers endings:
as <hi>Magister, magistri, magistro. Amo, amas, amat.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fowre last are vndeclined; that is, such as cannot bee
so turned, and haue but onely one ending: as, <hi>Hodie, cras,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then ask them questions according to the same,<note place="margin">How by asking Questions.</note> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the words of the book, in this manner of the like, as you
thinke good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> How many parts of speech haue you? Or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts are there in Speech?</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> Of these how many are declined, how many vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined?
So, which are declined, which vndeclined?</p>
                  <p>Afterwards to aske the same questions backe againe, the
last first. As, which parts of speech are vndeclined? Or how
many are vndeclined? So in the next.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is a Nowne?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A Nowne is the name of a thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Of what thing?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Of such a thing as may bee seene, selt, heard, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Giue me some examples of some such things?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A hand, a house, goodnesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is the name of a hand in Latine? Or what is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
for a hand? what is latine for a house? and so forth.</p>
                  <p>Then aske the questions as it were backward thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What part of speech is that which is the name of a
thing, which may be seene, felt, heard, or vnderstood?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A Nowne, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus to goe forward in euery rule. 1. Reading it ouer
to the children. 2. Shewing the plaine meaning in as fewe
words as you can. 3. Propounding euery peece of it in a
short question, following the words of the booke, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering

the same questions of them, and trying how them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6954:43"/>
can aunswere them, still looking vpon their bookes.
Then let them goe in hand with getting it amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
vntill they can say and answer the questions without
booke readily; the highest of the fourmes poasing the rest
vntil they can say. By this means it wil seem so easie to them,
that they will go to it most cheerfully, and get it much soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
then you would imagine, both the vnderstanding and
the words: for the vnderstanding of the matter will present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

As for example: the termination <hi>o,</hi> in the Indicatiue mood

<hi>am;</hi> as <hi>amo</hi> is made <hi>amem, doceo doceam lego legam, audio au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam.</hi>

into <hi>sem:</hi> Future tense <hi>bo,</hi> or <hi>am,</hi> into <hi>ro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in the Indicatiue moode, the terminations are these:

<hi>em</hi> or <hi>am, rem, rim, sem, ro.</hi>

ant. bam, bas, bat, bamus, batis, bant:</hi> so in any. And withall
to remember in what letters, or syllables euery person
ends, both in the Actiue and Passiue: as the first persons
Actiue, signifying (I) doe end commonly in <hi>o, am, em; im,</hi> or
<hi>i.</hi> as <hi>amo, amabam, amem, amaui, amauerim.</hi> The second
persons (or thou) in <hi>as, es, is,</hi> or <hi>sti:</hi> as <hi>amas, doces, legis,

in <hi>nt.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>First, the very difficulty of the Latine tongue, is in these.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, these examples set downe in the booke, are
such liuely patternes of all Nounes and Verbes; that Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
being perfect in these, will soone be perfect in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And for the other parts of speech, the very words are
most of them set downe in the Accedence; as Pronounes,
Aduerbes, Coniunctions, Prepositions: Participles, like the
Adiectiues.</p>
                  <p>So that these being gotten perfectly, the Latine tongue
may soone be attained in good maner; euen by the meanes
following: whereas without this perfection it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.
So that the learners shall still goe incertainly and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p>Also by these meanes and helpes named, this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
in them may be very speedily obtained; whereas
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6954:48"/>
onely to be able to say them without booke, without this
vnderstanding, is to little purpose: and to learne them by
practice in construction, and in writing exercises alone, is
most long, hard and wearisome, both to Master and
Schollar.</p>
                  <p>My former toyle and griefe in these, aboue all other
things in Grammar (though I tried all wayes which I could
heare or deuise) with the ease and benefite in this way, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
me confident. For I haue found more profite by this
course in a moneth, then by all other in halfe a yeare. By
this practice also, it is most soone recouered when it is lost,
and most easily kept.</p>
                  <p>Yet my meaning is not to haue Schollars to stay ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to be so exquisite in them,<note place="margin">Yet children not to stay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlong in these.</note> before they go any further;
but to go on so fast as they can well, and to make them so
ready by daily practice; spending each day a quarter of an
houre, or more, in them, vntill they come to perfection.</p>
                  <p>This were not amisse, to be practiced sometimes also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the elder schollars, which are not ready in them; as
also those comming from other Schooles, till they grow
perfect: here should be the beginning.</p>
                  <p>If yet a shorter way can be found out, we shall haue more
cause to reioyce thereof.</p>
                  <p>In the Participles, the chiefe care would be to make them
perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">Participles.</note> to know the seuerall tenses by their signes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
English and Latine, as they are in the booke: for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining,
they are the same with the Nounes.</p>
                  <p>In the Aduerbs, Coniunctions, Prepositions &amp; Interiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Aduerbs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriections.</note>
they would be made so ready, as to giue English to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
&amp; Latine to English, and to tell of what kinds they are;
and also to what cases each preposition serueth: and these
specially.</p>
                  <p>Here it were to be wished (as I take it) that all the rest of the
Aduerbs,<note place="margin">A want in the Aduerbs to be supplied.</note> Coniunctions, &amp; Interiections were also set down
in the Accedences; except only such Aduerbes as are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of other words: by which words they may be knowne,
or by their accents or terminations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:6954:48"/>
Also that some rules were set downe for framing of these
deriued Aduerbes;<note place="margin">Rules of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Aduerbs necessary; and of the Latine in the Accedence Englished.</note> and that all the rest of the Aduerbes
and Coniunctions, with all other wordes and sentences
through the Accedence, were Englished, like as the Prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
are.</p>
                  <p>Hereby all these Latine wordes would soone bee learned
perfectly, and proue a very great helpe, when children
come to construction: for then they should haue but onely
Nounes and Verbes to trouble them withall, as was said;
and those most easie to be knowne, by the meanes aboue
mentioned, and after.</p>
                  <p>For the English rules great care would bee had likewise,<note place="margin">English rules.</note>
to make Schollars very ready in them: for these rules of
themselues with a few other,<note place="margin">Benefit of them well gotten.</note> might serue for construction,
or making Latine. The perfect knowledge of them also,
will make the Latine rules easie, when your Schollars come
at them.</p>
                  <p>In teaching these rules, these two things would be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
generally:<note place="margin">Generall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations in the English rules.</note> first, That the Schollars learne to construe
each ensample; and that without booke. Experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
that those which art apt, wil construe almost as soone
without the booke,<note place="margin">1. To construe the examples.</note> as vpon the booke, or as they will learne
them construed: here by they shal get so much Latin; beside
that it wil be a great helpe to the perfect vnderstanding, and
applying of them.<note place="margin">2. To tell in what wordes the force of the examples doth lie.</note> The second is, to marke out with some
speciall markes, those wordes in which the force of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
doth lie; as the words agreeing, or the word gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and the word gouerned, and to cause the children to
be able to tell them:<note place="margin">See this more plainly, in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Syntax in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</note> and so euer in saying their rules with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
book, to repeat ouer those wordes againe, in all the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
examples. The rules or examples otherwise shall doe
them little good, because they know not how to make vse
of them.</p>
                  <p>But hereby they shall haue perpetuall and sure patternes
and warrants for parsing, making and trying Latine. I
shall shew this more plainly, when we come to the Syntax in
Latine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:6954:49"/>
These two things being obserued,<note place="margin">To make them most perfect in the rules of the principal Verb. Concordes.</note> haue a chiefe regard
in the rules, first, to make them perfect in the rule of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
out the principall Verbe; secondly, in the Concords,
as being of continuall vse; thirdly, in the rules of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And amongst those, to looke specially to the two first
rules,<note place="margin">Relatiue <hi>Qui.</hi>
                     </note> of the case of the Relatiue <hi>Qui:</hi> and namely, the latter
of them, <hi>viz.</hi> But when there commeth a Nom. case; for in
it Schollars most faile.</p>
                  <p>Also in all rules of gouernment, to make them able to
tell you presently where any rule is,<note place="margin">Gouernments. Manner of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining in them</note> and what cases such
wordes gouerne: as, Where beginnes the construction of
Substantiues? What cases they gouerne? How many rules
there are of them? Or asking thus; What case must your
latter of two Substantiues be? What case will such a word
gouerne? As <hi>Opus</hi> or <hi>Vsus,</hi> What cases doe they gouerne?
Where is the rule? So in the rules of the Adiectiues, and all
the rest throughout.</p>
                  <p>In posing, remember that which was first directed: to
marke carefully the drift of the whole rule, and so to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
your question; or else to propound the whole rule
in a question. As thus: when two Substantiues come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
betokening diuers things; what case must the latter
be? and why? or by what rule?</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, to the end to make your Schollars so very
ready in the Accedence,<note place="margin">Other helpes to make Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ready in the Accedence.</note> and to keepe it perfectly; besides
the learning all things so well as may be, there must be also,

to cause them to say a part euery of the fowre first dayes

                  <p>In hearing parts,<note place="margin">Manner of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parts.</note> aske them first the chiefe question or

you in what words the force of the example lyeth,
both gouernour and gouerned; saying the gouernour
first. Where helpe is wanting, to doe it only in the hardest
and most necessary rules and questions, or where we know
them most defectiue: Or else only to repeate the rules and
examples in such sort as was shewed, without further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                  <p>Though, where there is helpe and time enough, it is far
the surest, to cause them to repeate the whole part, and to
examine each peece of it daily, though they say the lesse at
a time.<note place="margin">2. The spending of a moneth or two to make the Accedence perfect, after it is learned ouer.</note> Secondly, the spending of one moneth or two, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>This continuall practice of parsing,<note place="margin">Constancy in poasing till vse bring surenesse.</note> would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly

it, that if this bee once archieued in a school, to haue
the schollars thus made perfect in Accedence &amp; Grammar

as full of ioy and contenment, without wearisomnesse, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>I would therefore thinke it a most profitable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
to set downe this maner of examining the Accedence

not onely the weakest Schoolemaster amongst vs, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
our schollars themselues might bee able so to oppose
and whet one another. I my selfe haue seene diuers books
of questions of our Accedence and Grammar, beeing ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

(so far as I remember) sundry of the principall of these
points.</p>
                  <p>Besides, that no man can so wel examine the Accedence
and Grammar by them; because, first the words of their
Question and Aunswere, doe not arise so out of the words
of the rules as you direct: neither doe they euer keepe
the order of the rules; and they haue moreouer sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hard questions intermixed, and sometimes many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

of some written, togather one in this sort, hauing all
the Questions &amp; Answers arising most directly out of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:6954:59"/>
words of the rules. In which, I haue chiefely followed the
order of the Quest. of that auncient Schoolemaster<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Brunsword, of Maxfield, in Cheshire, so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for his order and Schollars; who, of al other, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
therein the neerest vnto the marke. This I haue stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
to make so plaine, as euery childe may by it both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
vnderstand the meaning of each rule; and, if he can
say the rules, may as soone be able to answere these questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
and wherby they may also poase one another (as you
wish) to make all rules and parts most familiar. I haue in it
tied my selfe strictly to the order and words of the rules,
as it may serue for continual poasing, and speedy examining
Parts: and that from what schoole soeuer they come, if they
can say the Accedence, they may presently answere these
questions. Other questions which I haue thought needful,
I haue set in the margents, directly against the questions, to
be learned after, if you will, without troubling the learner,
and that nothing may be wanting. But, for this book, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre

both for their construing, parsing, and making La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
                  <p>To begin therfore with construction, which is the first
thing that our children enter into, after their Accedence,
and Rules: I desire greatly to heare of you those things
which you affirme may be done by schollars;<note place="margin">Things see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming difficult in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>struction.</note> and wherby
all the way of construction may be made so easie. As name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that children should bee able to take their lectures of
themselues, truely and perfectly; and likewise with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
vpon sure grounds: or at least to do it with a very
little help of their Masters, in such places where they doubt.
So the rest which were mentioned in the note: as that they
should be able to construe, both in propriety of words, and
also according to the right sense and meaning. To do this
at any time, in all that which they haue learned, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue
out of a translation in English, as out of the Latine it

when they construe false to direct them right; That
it were as much ease to mee to giue them, myselfe; and
so I should bee freede from the griefe that I haue, when
they cannot doe it, and from other inconueniences.</p>
                  <p>Besides, to reade the lectures in proprietie of words,<note place="margin">Difficulty in taking lectures in proprietie of words &amp; sense.</note>

                  <p>And for that of beeing able to reade, construe, and

                  <p>Yes indeede sir, there is a speciall rule, and such
translations also: by the constant practice whereof, not
onely the former euils may bee auoided, and the benefites
mentioned may bee obtained; but also the way to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struing,
parsing, examining, making, writing, speaking, and
also trying Latine, may be made most easie and plaine; So,
as children may proceede vpon sure grounds, and doe all
things herein with vnderstanding, and right reason, and far
more speedily, and with more delight, then vsually.</p>
                  <p>And howsoeuer this rule bee vnknowen of most, who
neuer heard of any such particular rule of construing, but
only of such directions, as may be gathered here and there,
out of our Accedence and Grammar, where they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearsed
thorough all,<note place="margin">This rule is set downe by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry learned Grammarians.</note> very hardly to be discerned; yet it is
set downe by sundry learned Grammarians. As by Susen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus,
Crusius, Cosarzus, and our ancient Schoole master
Master Leech, in his little questions of the Accedence and
others, as also lately by learned Goclenius; though in all
of them imperfectly, and differing somewhat each from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
through the diuers exceptions in the Grammar rules
and varietie of Grammars. Crusius hath also examples of
the practice of the rule handled at large. It would be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedious
to set them downe all, or what each of them hath
written thereof.</p>
                  <p>Yet because the rule hath some difficulty, and that wee
may consider the better of it, I will rehearse it briefly out of
one or two of them. And seeing we are to deale for the first

dependeth of it,<note place="margin">1. The Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue case, or whatsoeuer is in place of it, or hangeth of it.</note> that is whatsoeuer agreeth with it;

of Calling, Wishing, Shewing, Exhorting, or Swearing,

is put in stead of the Nominatiue case, and such words
as depend on it; as namely, an Adiectiue or Participle, and

Genitiue, then the Datiue or Ablatiue, with a Preposition,
or without.</p>
                  <p>This is the sum of the rule, as it is most generall and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:6954:63"/>
Yet here these things must be remembred:<note place="margin">Other cautiues in the rule.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. If all these words be not in the sentence which is to be
construed,<note place="margin">1 To take so many words as there are in the same order.</note> to take so many of them as there are, and in this
order.</p>
                  <p>2 That the order is changed by the Relatiue <hi>Qui quae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 The order is changed by Relat. Interrog. Indef. Partit. wordes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and Connexion.</note>
                     <hi>quod:</hi> also by Interrogatiues, Indefinites, Partitiues; because
these (according to the Grammar rule) follow the rule of the
Relatiue; going before the words wherof they are gouerned.
So likewise Aduerbs of likenesse (as, <hi>Quemadmodum, vt, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luti,
sicut</hi>) when they haue <hi>sic</hi> or <hi>ita</hi> answering to them in the
second part of the sentence, doe vse to goe before. As also
Coniunctions Copulatiues, Rationals, Aduersitiues, hauing
their Redditiues following, answering vnto them: so Exple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
and certaine others:</p>
                  <p>Finally, all such wordes as these mentioned (which wee
may call wordes of dependence, because they depend on
something going before or comming after in the same
sentence) or else wordes of Connexion, seruing to knit new
sentences to the former (as these Coniunctions) are to bee
placed next the Vocatiue case: or in the first place, where
there is no Vocatiue case.</p>
                  <p>3 That in stead of the Nominatiue case,<note place="margin">3 To take for the Nominat. case whatsoeuer is put in place of it, or inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it.</note> we take whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
is in place thereof, as a whole sentence, a peece of
a sentence, an Infinitiue moode, an Aduerbe with a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue
case, two Nominatiue cases singular or moe, ioyned
with a Verbe plurall, or sometimes a letter set by it selfe,
or moe, or any word put for it selfe; which we call a word of
arte: as <hi>Amo est verbum. Amo</hi> is here taken for the Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
case: for all such wordes or sentences are supposed to
bee the Neuter Gender vndeclined.</p>
                  <p>So whatsoeuer includeth the Nominatiue case; as, a
Verbe Impersonall, an Ablatiue case absolute; Gerunds

                  <p>5. Coniunctions or other wordes of dependance in new
clauses of the sentences,<note place="margin">5 New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions and wordes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence serue to ioyne new sentences.</note> serue to ioyne together the later

                  <p>6. That the Aduerbs be placed before or after the Verb;<note place="margin">6 Aduerbs to be placed to the best sense.</note> as the sense will most conueniently beare.</p>
                  <p>7. That the Latinismes bee obserued,<note place="margin">7 To obserue Latinismes, and ioyne phrases.</note> to ioyne the

                  <p>The reason also of the rule, that euery one may conceiue
each thing,<note place="margin">The reason of the rule.</note> is this:</p>
                  <p>1 That the wordes must bee placed in order,<note place="margin">1 The wordes to be placed in naturall order.</note> as they
should stand; according to the plaine and proper nature

that is, it causeth the word following to agree
with it, or to be gouerned of it; except in oblique cases of
Interrogatiues, Relatiues, Indefinits, Partitiues, which doe
commonly goe before together with the Substantiues or
Antecedents, with which they agree; and are gouerned or

chiefely to marke the principall Verbe, because that poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
out the right Nominatiue case, and directeth all the

the order goeth thus:</p>
               </sp>

               <p>2 To take the Nominatiue case of the principal Verbe,
or whatsoeuer is put in steede of it, and to adioyne to it
whatsoeuer hangeth of it: as the Adiectiue or Participle, and
such words as they gouerne.</p>
               <p>3 To take the principall Verbe, and whatsoeuer hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

case which the Verbe properly gouerneth (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the Accusatiue case) &amp; whatsoeuer hangeth on that.
Lastly, all the other cases in order: first the Genitiue, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
the Datiue, and lastly the Ablatiue.</p>

                  <p>6 This translation directeth the schollar also for making

the words, according to the order of the Author, by the

must bee so: and in short time to doe the same in things

be very auaileable to the purposes, which
you haue mentioned: the very propriety alone, I meane
the knowledge of words, in their first and proper significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is a singular helpe to learning. For reason will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
teach, both the change of the signification by the
circumstances of the place, &amp; also the cause of the change.
But I pray you, how might my Schollars vse these Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
so, as that I might finde the benefits of them.</p>

                     <p>You may cause them to vse them after these dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
following:</p>
                     <p>1 First,<note place="margin">1 To see that euery one can giue the summe of the rule of construing.</note> you are to see that euery one who is to vse them,
can repeate the rule of construing, and answere the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof, according to the briefest forme of it at least.
And if your leasure will serue, to heare your selfe how they
can take their Lectures of themselues, according to the
same.</p>
                     <p>2 Where your leisure will not well permit you to see all
Lectures giuen,<note place="margin">2 In the lower fourmes one to reade ouer the translation, to giue some light, and look on the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> you may appoint at the taking of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
that some one or two of the best of each fourme, doe
looke vpon the Translation; and in the lower fourmes doe
first reade ouer the Translation once, onely to giue them
some light, for the meaning and vnderstanding of their
Lectures; the rest looking on their Authours, or onely
harkening to the meaning: although in the higher fourms
which vse them, they will not neede so much as once rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ouer before, vnlesse in some difficult places: onely he
who looketh on the Translation, may reade the Translation
after, for their more full vnderstanding of the Lecture, and
more easie remembrance of it.</p>
                     <p>3 After that to appoint another,<note place="margin">3 To construe according to the rule, of themselues.</note> first, to reade ouer
their Lecture in the Latine distinctly, as it is in the Author,
and to trie how he can construe; beating it out according

to the rule.<note place="margin">He who hath the Translation onely, to direct where they goe false.</note> In the meane time cause him who hath the
Translation, to be in stead of your selfe amongst the rest, to
see that they goe right; and where the construer sticketh,
or goeth amisse, to call him backe to the rule, and wish the
rest to helpe to finde it out by the same rule.</p>
                     <p>And when al the fourme are at a stand,<note place="margin">To doe as the cunning Hunts-man.</note> and none of them
can beat it out, then onely he who hath the booke, to do it;
as the cunning Hunts-man, to helpe a little at the default, to
point and to direct them where to take it: and thus so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to construe ouer, or so oft, vntill all of them can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time your selfe or Vsher,<note place="margin">☞</note> in the middest, both
to haue an eye to them,<note place="margin">The assistance of the Master or Vsher herein</note> that they take this course; and also
to helpe yet further, where neede is: And after the taking
of the Lecture, to note out vnto them al the difficult or new
wordes in their Lecture, to examine and direct them, for the
parsing of them: and also to cause each of the fourme to
marke out those wordes, to take speciall paines in them; to
make them perfect aboue all the rest: because they haue
learned the rest before, and haue but so many new wordes to
get in that Lecture.</p>
                     <p>4 According to the order as they construe,<note place="margin">☞</note> cause them
to parse,<note place="margin">To construe &amp; parse out of the Translation, is the surest and most profitable way.</note> as we shewed; eyther looking vpon the Authour,

and better, in al who are able, both to construe and parse
out of the Translation: because thereby they are learning
continually, both to make and proue their Latine; and so
doe imprint both the matter and Latine, more firmely in
their memory. So also all of ability, to construe and parse
onely out of the Translation, when they come to say; and
out of it to giue the reason of euery thing. This they will doe
most readily, with a little practice.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:6954:71"/>
after that they haue said their Lectures,<note place="margin">To construe or reade oft all which they haue learned, out of the Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to make and keepe all perfect, by oft repetions.</note> cause each fourme
which vse these translations, to goe immediately to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struing
ouer all which they haue learned, each day a peece,
euery one a side of a leafe, or the like in order, vntill they
haue gone through all; construing it only out of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
to spend an houre or more therein, as time will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit:
one or two who sit next vnto the construer, to looke
on the Translation with him,<note place="margin">Manner hereof.</note> to helpe where hee sticketh;
the rest to looke on their Authours. Appoint withall some
of the Seniors of the fourme, to examine shortly the harde
wordes of each page as they goe; I meane those wordes,
which they marked when they learned them.</p>
                     <p>And when they become perfect in construing out of the
English,<note place="margin">☜</note> cause them for more speedy dispatch, but onely to
reade their Authours into Latine, forth of the Translation;
first in the Grammaticall order: after as they are in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
They will thus soone runne ouer all which they
haue learned, without the least losse of time: for this will be
found the best bestowed time, to keepe perfectly that which
they haue gotten. And what they can so construe or reade
out of the English into Latine, they can also doe it out of
the Latine into English ordinarily.</p>
                     <p>Then,<note place="margin">To reade ouer other Authours after the same manner.</note> as they waxe perfect in that which they haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

of themselues by the same meanes, to reade ouer the rest of
their Authour, which they learned not, or some easie Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
which they haue not read; as first <hi>Corderius,</hi> or the
like, by the helpe of the same translations: first to construe
<hi>ex tempore</hi> amongst themselues, after to reade out of the
Translations; according to the same manner as they did in
that which they haue learned:<note place="margin">☜</note> wherein they will do more
then you will easily beleeue, vntill you see experience.<note place="margin">So in higher Authours trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, as they come to higher fourmes, and more
iudgement,<note place="margin">Practice will make them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prompt, both in English and Latine.</note> they may be appointed likewise to reade <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi>
some other Authour, whereof they haue the Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

good English stile: afterwards out of the English into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
both wayes, both in Grammaticall order, and after in
Composition, according to the Authour. And within a time
that they haue beene thus exercised, they will be able to doe
this, almost as easily and readily, as that which they haue
learned. I finde <hi>Tullies</hi> sentences, and <hi>Tully de natura Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>

                     <speaker>Obiect.</speaker>
                     <p>1. Translations in Schooles haue not bin found
to bring any such benefite, but rather much hurt; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the best and wisest Schoole-masters haue not beene
wont to suffer any of them amongst their Schollars.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                     <p>I will first answere you for the benefites:<note place="margin">These vses and benefits cannot be made of any other Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Schoole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but the Grammatical, and why.</note> That it is
true indeede, that these vses and benefites cannot bee made
of any other Translation of any one of our Schoole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours.
The reasons are euident: first, because none of the
Translators haue followed, nor so much as propounded to
themselues to follow this Grammaticall rule in Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
which you see is the meane foundation of all true
construing, parsing, making and trying Latine: and of all
these benefites, to keepe Schollars to goe surely. Secondly,
none of them which I know, haue laboured to expresse the
propriety and force of the Latine, in the first and natiue sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification;
which this intendeth continually: and how
much lieth vpon the knowledge of the propriety of the
wordes for the certaine getting of any tongue, euery Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
knoweth. Thirdly, none of them haue indeauoured by
a double Translation to make all things plaine, as these do
euery where; labouring to expresse with the wordes, and
Grammar, the sense and meaning also in all obscure places,
with variety of English wordes or phrase: to the end to
teach children thereby, Grammar, propriety, sense with
variety of phrase to expresse their mindes in English, as wel
as in Latine: and all vnder one, that nothing bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>The Translators haue seemed to ayme eyther onely or
principally,<note place="margin">What the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, haue ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at.</note> at the meaning and drift of the Authour,<note place="margin">The Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Schoole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors extant do perform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> none of the benefites which these Grammaticall Translations doe aime at chiefly.</note> which
benefite alone they doe in some sort performe: but for the
rest of the benefits and vses, or for the most of them (as for
true construing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> parsing, making and trying Latine, which
are the chiefe things here mentioned) they eyther set the
learner at a <hi>non plus,</hi> or carie him ordinarily cleane amisse.
And therefore there is no maruell, if in that respect they be
vtterly disliked. Triall in any of them, compared to the
rule and the other limits, and especially how in construing,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:6954:73"/>
parsing, and the like, they carry the learner vtterly out of
the way, will presently shew the truth hereof, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <p>Besides that they leade Schollars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
very ordinarily in construing, almost in euery sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
they are found also to make Schollars Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,

worse.</p>

                     <p>For the first part, that they leade Schollars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse,
I haue answered; that, that is onely in such Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:6954:73"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">Grammaticall translations se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Latine, cannot indanger any to make them truants, if they be rightly vsed.</note> for making truants, I aunswere; that these
Grammaticall translations being thus meerly English, and
separate from the Latine altogether, can neuer indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
any waie to make truants, if they bee vsed according
to the directions prescribed. For first, for construing latine,
there can bee no likelihood hereof, if the translation bee
onely vsed; first to giue some light and vnderstanding of
the lecture amongst the younger; after, to bee onely in
place of the Master, where he cannot be himselfe.</p>
                     <p>Also, where all of the fourme cannot beat out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struing
by the Grammaticall rule, there to direct and point
it out how to take it. Likewise, to giue propriety of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and to guide the schollars in place of the Master (who
cannot bee alwaies with euery one) to the end, that in all
things they may goe surely. Secondly, for construing and
making the Latine out of the translation, it chiefly consists
vpon vnderstanding and conceit; and shall more stirre vp
the wit and memory to get propriety and copie of words
and phrases, then all getting without booke can possibly
doe. In getting without book alone, words and sentences
may bee learned, as by Parats, without any vnderstanding:
hereby children must needes vnderstand them: For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
nothing but the bare translation, they must be driuen
of necessitie to beate out the latine, by learning and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
with diligence; and so stirre vp their memories continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
Also, hereby whensoeuer they shall haue againe the
same English words or phrases to make in Latine, to write
or to speake; the verie same Latine words and phrases,
which they learned in their Authours, doe come straight
wayes to their memories to expresse their mindes. And
in what things they can giue Latine to the English, in
that, as was sayd, they can ordinarily giue English to the
Latine.</p>
                     <p>Indeede,<note place="margin">There is great difficulty to vse an interlineall translation, or latine ioined to the English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> where the translation is ioined with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
and so they are set together answerably word for
word, eyther as the Interlineal set ouer the head, or the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
word or phrase set after the Latine; there the eie of the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6954:74"/>
childe is no sooner vpon the one, but it will be vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and so the memory is not exercised, neither can this
mischiefe be auoided. Yea, where the Author is of the one
page, the translation is on the other ouer against it (like as
it is in Theognis, and some other Greeke Poets) there must
be much discretion for the right vsing of them; otherwise
many inconueniences must needes follow amongst chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
But in these bare translations so by themselues, these
surmised daungers are preuented; if they bee vsed as
hath been shewed. Although for them who are of full dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
to vse them (as those who would study priuately
for the reoouering their Latine, or increasing therin) it may
bee the most profitable of all, to haue the translation ouer-against
the latine, directly on the other page, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as Theognis is printed; that folding the booke, they
may looke vpon the one, when they would finde out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and yet haue the other euer at hand, as a master, to
helpe in an instant, where they need.</p>

let the master vse any diligent circumspection, and they
cannot possibly be idle in this, of all other; no not one in
any fourme. For, let but the Master or Vsher haue an eye to
all in generall, though they bee in hand in hearing any
fourme; and where they do marke or but suspect any one
of all the fourmes to bee carelesse, or not to attend; there
let them step to such a one of a sodaine, and bid him set his
finger to the last word which was spoken: and so if any bee
idle, he may bee catched presently. Prouided alwaies, that
no one keep his finger at the book, lest by them the truants
see where it is; but euery one to vse only his eye and his eare.

and much other imployment about the same, which

and directing in euery other fourm which I cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
or as so many helpers. And by the help and benefit of
these, all my younger Schollars doe seeme to attaine
almost double learning to that, that by mine owne paines
being farre greater, and my griefe much more, I was euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bring them vnto before. For, before the time that I
came to the knowledge and vse of these, as I taught at one
end, my children would forget at an other; and bee as rawe
in that which was learned a quarter or halfe a yeere before,
as if they either had not learned it, or neuer learned it well;
which was no small griefe vnto mee whensoeuer they were
examined: but now take them where you will of a sodaine,
in all the Authors which they haue learned; and they shall
be able in good sort, not onely to construe or parse, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to reade out of the English into the Latine and proue it:
at least so many of them as are apt, and the rest in better
maner then I could haue expected of them, vnless the fault
be in my selfe; and that without any losse of time: and to
goe faster forwarde in their Authors then euer they were
wont to do; and without any such fretting or vexing to my
selfe, though I haue but some one written copie in a fourm.
Now trie this amongst your schollars, whether they be able
to doe the like at any time of a sodaine, by all your labour.
For mine owne part, I could neuer by all meanes attaine
vnto it in any measure, especially hauing many fourmes:
neither can I see how I could haue done it, vnlesse I had had
so many bodies, or so many to haue bin continually in my
place, in each fourme one.</p>

hearing them eyther my selfe, or by some other very
sufficient, how they can doe it; and posing onely some hard
things as they goe forward: noting also the harder wordes
and more difficult places, as was shewed. Also in those
bookes, where of they haue Translations, I cause them by
course sometimes to construe or reade the same, out of the
Translations: as at other times to reade out of the Authour

                  <p>Herein,<note place="margin">How to teach children to parse of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues most surely and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</note> after long and much labour, I haue found very
little fruite, through the hardnesse of it, and the weakenesse
of the childrens memories to carie away that which I tolde
them: much lesse haue I beene able to make my litle ones,
no not in the second or third fourmes, so to parse of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
as to giue a true reason of euery word why it must be
so; according to that which I saw in the note, what might
be done in parsing. Now if you haue seen the practice ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
let me heare it of you, I intreate you; and that in so few
wordes as you can.</p>

                  <p>Yes indeed, I haue seene the practice hereof &amp; do
know it, that children will doe very much, to ease &amp; delight
both the Master and themselues exceedingly. Besides some
of the best of those which you mention (as the shewing the
youngest how to parse euery word) I haue learned to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
these things following,<note place="margin">The certaine direction for parsing.</note> and finde maruellous light,
easinesse, surenesse and helpe of memory by them:</p>
                  <p>1 To cause the children euer to parse as they construe,<note place="margin">To parse as they construe, euer marknig the last word.</note>
according to the Grammaticall rule of construing and the
Translations; alwayes marking the last principall word
which went before in construing: wherein (as I shortly she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
you before) the very childe may see euery principall
word going before, gouerning or ordering that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth;
and so he hath therein a guide leading him by the
hand for all the Syntax at least: except in the exceptions
mentioned in the Grammaticall rule; as of Interrogatiues,
Relatiues, &amp;c. which they will soone know: and where one
word gouernes diuers things; as in that example.
Dedit mihi vestem pignori, tepresente, propria manu.
where the word <hi>Dedit</hi> gouernes most of the rest in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
consideration.<note place="margin">2 To remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber if they haue not learned the words before.</note>

                  <p>3 For the Etymologie;<note place="margin">3 To marke in Nounes, Verbs, Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, what examples they are like, The rest are in the booke.</note> al the difficulty is in these three
parts of speech, Nounes, Verbs, and Participles; the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
set downe in the Accedence, or easily known, as was she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
before. And in all words of these three parts, do but tell
them what examples they are like in the Accedence: which
examples being knowne, will presently bring to their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
all the questions depending on them and their
answers. As, of what part of speech the words are; of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clension
or Coniugation: so the declining, Case, Gender,
Number, Person, Mood, Tense, &amp;c. Also with a litle practice
they wil soon ghesse at them, themselues; &amp; that very right,
to shew what examples they are like, eyther by the English,
or Latine, or both. The same would be also for the Syntax,
both in agreements and gouernements,<note place="margin">Paralleling by examples in the Syntax likewise An example of parsing set downe at large, to direct the rudest.</note> euer to shew what
examples they are like. The example makes the rule most
plaine, and imprints all in the childes memory.</p>
                  <p>To make this plaine to the capacity of the simplest,
I will adde one only example, particularly examined out of
the two first verses of <hi>Qui mihi discipulus puer es, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">First construe truely.</note> be sure that the childe know the meaning of them,
and can construe them perfectly, as thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Puer</hi> Oh childe, <hi>qui</hi> who, <hi>es</hi> art, <hi>discipulus</hi> a Schollar, <hi>mihi</hi>

                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>

                     </hi> and, <hi>cupis</hi> dost couet (or desire) <hi>doceri</hi> to bee

                  <p>In this sentence,<note place="margin">Parse as they construe.</note> parse the childe after the same manner;
and examine him accordingly. As aske, where he must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to parse;<note place="margin">Examining in parsing.</note> he answere that <hi>Puer,</hi> Oh boy, because he began
to construe there. And if you ask why he began to construe
there; he answers by the rule of construing, which biddeth,
If there be a Vocatiue case to begin commonly at it. Then
aske what <hi>Puer</hi> is like; he answereth, like <hi>Magister:</hi> which
being knowne of him &amp; he perfect in his examples can tel
you by <hi>Magister,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Puer.</note> what declension it is, how to decline it, and
the number; and also by the increasing of it short in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue

the third speciall rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:6954:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For the case; that it is the Vocatiue, knowne by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or speaking to the childe. And if you aske, why it may
not be <hi>pueri</hi> not <hi>puero,</hi> but <hi>puer;</hi> he answereth, because it is
the Vocatiue case, which is like the Nominatiue.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards,<note place="margin">Qui.</note> demaunding what must be parsed next; hee
answereth <hi>qui;</hi> because <hi>qui</hi> is next in construing: and also
that <hi>qui</hi> is a Pronoune Relatiue, set down in the Accedence,
and there declined. Also that it is the Nominatiue case,
comming before the Verbe <hi>es,</hi> following it next, by the rule
of the Relatiue; When there commeth no Nominatiue
case: as, <hi>Miser est</hi> qui <hi>nummos admiratur,</hi> qui admiratur
So qui es. For the Gender likewise; that it is the Masculine
Gender, because so is his Antecedent <hi>puer</hi> going next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in construing: with which the Relatiue agreeth, by the
rule of the Relatiue: The Relatiue agreeth, &amp;c. as <hi>vir sapit qui
pauca loquitur:</hi> vir qui. So puer qui. Also hee can shew it,
to bee the Masculine Gender, because in wordes of three
terminations, the first is the Masculine, the second the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine,
the third is the Neuter. Likewise he can tell why it
must be <hi>qui,</hi> not <hi>cuius,</hi> nor <hi>cui,</hi> nor any other; because it
must be the Nominatiue case to the Verbe, by the rule of
the Relatiue; because no other Nominatiue case commeth
betweene them. So all other questions. For Person; it is
made the second person here, by a figure called Euocation,
because it agreeth with <hi>puer,</hi> which is made of the second
person; and by the same figure Euocation, as euery Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
case is, by reason of <hi>Tu</hi> vnderstood.</p>
                  <p>Then followeth <hi>es,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Es.</note> art: of which word the childe can
giue you all the Questions; because hee hath learned it in
his Accedence, and is perfect in it. If you aske why it must
be <hi>es,</hi> and not <hi>est,</hi> nor any other word; he answereth, because
it is Thou art, not He is, nor I am: and also because in that
place <hi>qui</hi> his Nominatiue case is of the second person, as
was said.<note place="margin">Discipulus.</note> If you then aske what is parsed next; he answereth
<hi>discipulus,</hi> because hee construed so: and <hi>discipulus</hi> is like
<hi>Magister.</hi> Which being knowne, the childe can tell the
questions of declining, Gender, Case, Number, and the rest
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:6954:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
appertayning thereto. If you demaund further, why it
must be <hi>Discipulus</hi> and not <hi>Discipulum;</hi> why it must be a
Nominatiue case after the Verbe, and not an Accusatiue
according to the rules, The Accusatiue followeth the
Verbe; and also that rule, Verbes Transitiues are all such,
&amp;c. He answereth, because this Verbe <hi>Sum es,</hi> is a Verbe
Substantiue intransitiue, not a transitiue; and therefore will
haue such case after it as it hath before it: as <hi>Fama est ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi>
est malum. And that other rule for the Accusatiue
after the Verbe, is of Transitiues, whose action passeth into
another thing. So to proceede throughout for short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
thus:</p>
                  <p>Mihi] is parsed next, because it it next in construing.<note place="margin">Mihi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> It
is a Pronoune set downe in the booke. All the questions
are plaine in it, except why it must bee the Datiue case:
which is, because it is gouerned of <hi>es,</hi> the principall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
going before, by the rule of the Datiue case after
<hi>sum,</hi> Also <hi>sum</hi> with his compounds, except <hi>possum, &amp;c.</hi> and,
for that, one word may gouerne diuers cases; or it may
be gouerned of <hi>Discipulus</hi> the Substantiue, by the rule of
the later of two Substantiues, turned into a Datiue: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the English rules are defectiue. The rule in Latine, is

                  <p>After a little time cause them to doe it, looking onely
vpon the English Translation.</p>
                  <p>Then (which is the principall,<note place="margin">☜</note> and wherein you will take
much delight) cause them amongst themselues to construe
and parse out of the translation vntill they can say, or out
of their Authours, whether they can sooner: but when they
come to say, cause them to say each sentence, first in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
then to construe and parse them; and all with their
bookes vnder their armes: what they cannot repeat so, they
will doe it if you aske them questions of it. You shall finde
by experience, that with a little practice, all who are apt will
do this as soone, readily, &amp; perfectly, as looking vpon their
books (if so that they but vnderstand the matter wel before)
and so they will make all their owne most surely. Thus I
would haue them to do in <hi>Sententiae, Confabulatiunculae</hi> and

                  <p>Surely Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this way of parsing is most direct and
plaine; and the benefits must needes bee exceeding great:
but giue me leaue yet to aske one thing of you, concerning
this parsing amongst the younger. I haue heard of some,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6954:81"/>
who would teach their enterers to know by the very words,<note place="margin">How to know by the wordes what part of speech each word is.</note>
what part of Speech each word is. How may that be done?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>This may very well be done, euen according to this
ensample aboue, when euery thing is examined at large.
As for example, Cause your Schollar to doe this:</p>
                  <p>1 To marke out all those wordes, which they haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
being set downe in their Accedences; as Pronounes,
Aduerbes, Coniunctions, Interiections: that they knowe
all those. Then haue they nothing to trouble them with;
but they may know that all the rest are eyther Nounes,
Verbes or Participles, or else Gerunds or Supines belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Verbes, or some other Aduerbs.</p>
                  <p>2 For those partes of Speech, when your Schollar can
construe perfectly, they may bee knowne by their Latine
and English together, whether they be Nounes, Verbs, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiples,
or such Aduerbes; chiefly, when they are very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in their parts of Speech in their Accedence, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
thereof.</p>
                  <p>1 The Noune Substantiues, that they are names of things,
to which you may put to <hi>a,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Substantiues, and how to know them.</note> or <hi>the,</hi> as was said; as A boy, A
Schollar: but cannot put to the word Thing, in any good
sense. And morefully, when the Latine is put to the English;
as <hi>puer</hi> A boy, like <hi>Magister: discipulus</hi> a schollar, like <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Noune Adiectiues contrarily,<note place="margin">How Adie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiues.</note> though they signifie
a thing; yet they cannot stand by themselues in sense, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
you put to (Thing) or some other word expresly or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
nor you cannot in proper speech put to <hi>a,</hi> or <hi>the.</hi>
As we cannot say properly, A good, An euill: but wee may
say A good man, A good house, An euill thing. And when
they are put Substantiuely, yet Thing is properly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood:
as <hi>bonum</hi> a good thing, <hi>summum bonum</hi> the chiefest
good thing; though wee call it the chiefest good.</p>
                  <p>These Adiectiues also may be more fully vnderstood,<note place="margin">By the Latine adioyned. In <hi>us</hi> or <hi>er</hi> like <hi>bonus,</hi>
                     </note> by

                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, if the childe but knowe his word to be like any
of the examples of a Nown Substantiue, as <hi>Musa, Magister,
Regnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Lapis, Manus, Meridies,</hi> he knoweth it to be a Nown
Substantiue. If like <hi>bonus, vnus, foelix, tristis,</hi> a Nown Adiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</p>
                  <p>Verbes also may be knowen most plainly by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and Latine together.<note place="margin">How Verbes may be known.</note> As, the words signifying, doing,

doceor, legor, audior,</hi> or any person comming of them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Moode or Tense, and signifying like to them, are Verbs.
So by the signes of the tenses; do, did or didst, haue, hast,
hath, had or haddest, shall or will. By the signes of the
moods; Or signes of the Passiue: as am, are, art, was, were,
wert, be or beene: where any of these signes are, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Verbes.</p>
                  <p>And finally, this is generall for the Verbes, as for the
Nownes; that if either the childe can tell of himself, or you
but shewe him what person in a Verbe it is like, hee can tell
presently that it is a Verbe, and most questions belonging
to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As, knowing that <hi>cupis</hi> thou couetest, is like <hi>legis</hi> thou
readest, he knoweth presently, that it is a Verb of the third

                  <p>The like may bee sayde for Gerunds of Verbes,<note place="margin">Gerunds.</note> and

                  <p>Participles<note place="margin">Participles.</note> also may bee plainely knowen by the verie
same manner; and chiefly by their endings in English and
Latine both together. As, the words that ende in [ing]
in English, and in Latine in <hi>ans</hi> or <hi>ens,</hi> are Participles
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:6954:82"/>
of the Present tense.<note place="margin">Present tense Preter tense.</note> Words in <hi>d, t,</hi> or <hi>n,</hi> and their Latine in

to doe,<note place="margin">Future in <hi>rus.</hi>
                     </note> of the Future in <hi>rus.</hi> And in <hi>dus,</hi> signifying to

                  </p>
                  <p>Aduerbes (besides those in the booke,<note place="margin">How to know other Aduerbes besides those in the bookes.</note> or which
should bee set downe in the English Aduerbe as they are in

                  <p>To conclude, they are also marked commonly in all
bookes which are well printed, with graue accents ouer
them, to distinguish them from other parts of Speech,
and that they may be knowen to bee Aduerbes: as <hi>doctè</hi>
learnedly, to bee knowen from <hi>docte</hi> the Vocatiue case of
the Adiectiue: so <hi>doctiùs.</hi> And thus are all Aduerbes of like
nature; as <hi>quàm</hi> then, to be distinguished from <hi>quam</hi> which,
the Pronowne.</p>
                  <p>And also sundry Prepositions are so marked: as <hi>ponè,

                  <p>I approue and see the reason of all this, that the
parts of Speech may bee knowen or neerely ghessed at:
and I doe still go on with you, reioycing in this our confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding, there is one thing I haue heard, that a
child may not only be taught to know what part of Speech
each word is, but also of what Coniugation any Verbe is,
if hee heare but onely the first person of the Indicatiue
Mood; that is, if he heare but onely the Verbe named. Now
this seemeth to me vnpossible; there being so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
Verbes all ending in <hi>o,</hi> and they so like one another;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:6954:82"/>
and especially those of the first and third Coniugation, so
hard to bee distinguished,<note place="margin">A child may know of what Coniugation any Verbe is.</note> that this may oft trouble a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man, and much more a young schollar.</p>

by the Master) then can bee performed in the common
Schooles.</p>

But the shortest, surest, most pleasant &amp; easie waie both
to Master and Schollar, I touched before, if you marked it:
and it is this. After that they haue been entred, and trained
vp some twelue-month in the lowest fourme by questions,
as the example was shewed out of <hi>Qui mihi;</hi> then, when
they goe into the next fourme,<note place="margin">To parse euerie one his peece, as reading a lecture.</note> as into <hi>Cato,</hi> to begin to
parse euerie one of themselues, as reading a lecture, each
his peece. I meane chiefly, when they come to say their
lectures.</p>
                  <p>For example:<note place="margin">Example.</note> To take those two first verses of <hi>Qui mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi,</hi>
because they are parsed before.<note place="margin">☜</note> First let them construe
perfectly in the Grammaticall order, as was sayd: then let
each parse his word or two, as they construed, euer marking
the last word, and in all things iust in the same manner, as is
set downe before; but only to doe it of themselues without
any question asked, for the sauing of time: Onely the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
or he who heareth them, is to aske where they do omit
any necessary question in any word, or where they misse.</p>
                  <p>As thus:<note place="margin">Example.</note> The childe hauing construed, beginnes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Puer</hi> oh child: It is to be parsed first because it is first in
construing. <hi>Puer,</hi> is like <hi>Magister.</hi> A Nowne Substantiue
common of the second Declension; and so he declines it,
so farre as the Master thinkes meete, at least giuing the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue
case; for if they be wel entred in the Accedence, they
will easily decline any regular word, when they knowe the
example. After he shews the rule when he hath declined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nown or Verbe. As <hi>Puer pueri,</hi> is a graue increaser; and
therfore of the Masculine Gender. <hi>Nomen cresentis penulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masi
Genitiui sit grauis &amp;c.</hi> Also the Vocatiue case knowen
by calling or speaking to, as <hi>ô Magister,</hi> ô Master. <hi>Qui</hi> is
next, a Pronowne Relatiue, &amp;c. So euery thing in the same
order as before.</p>
                  <p>To help your schollars to do this:<note place="margin">☜</note> Remember first when

                  <p>Or aske by a distribution thus; Whether must you helpe

them. Then bid him to giue you a sentence; he answereth,

                  </p>
                  <p>Or thus by Comparison; Whether ought you to helpe

When the childe hath answered, euer bid him to giue his

                  <p>The more plainly you can propound your question, that
the childe may vnderstand it, and may answere in the very
wordes of his Lecture, the better it is: so to examine the
wordes seuerally: How say you Helpe? he answereth <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulare.</hi>
Friends, <hi>Amicis.</hi> But of this more after.</p>

vse to examine both in English and Latin together: I mean
propounding the questions first in English, then in Latine;
and so let him answere, that the matter and English may
bring the Latine with them: which they will certainly doe.
The manner I shewed in examining in the Latine rules: I
will set downe one other example, in the sentences of three
wordes; <hi>Amor vincit omnia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of this sentence I examine thus:</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Amor vincit omnia.</p>
                  <p>Or thus: Is there any thing that can ouercome all
things?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Loue.</p>
                  <p>Or thus more particularly, to put delight and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is that which will ouercome learning, &amp; make

Latine; as it were causing them euery day to make the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
of their lectures, and giue a reason why each word must
be so, and not otherwise, their bookes being shut. I set you
downe the manner before, in the vse of the Grammaticall
rule for making Latine, in that example; <hi>Aptissima omnino
sunt, &amp;c.</hi> Yet to repeate you a word or two for your little
ones; take that first sentence, <hi>Amicis opitulare:</hi> when you
haue made them to vnderstand the meaning, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it,<note place="margin">Example re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</note> so as was shewed; Aske but thus:</p>
               <p>How can you make this in Latine; Helpe friends? How
say you, Helpe thou?</p>
               <p>A. Opitulare.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Like <hi>Amare amator,</hi> be thou loued.</p>
               <p>So all the questions for parsing: Then aske, why is it
helpe thou, and not, be thou helped, as <hi>Amare amator,</hi> be
thou loued. He answereth because it is a Verbe Deponent,
and signifieth Actiuely, to help; and not, to be helped.</p>
               <p>After aske the next word:</p>
               <p>Q. Whom must you help?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Our friends.</p>
               <p>Q. How say you friends?</p>
               <p>A. Amicis.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:6954:90"/>
So the questions of declining and the like. Then aske,
why not <hi>amici</hi> nor <hi>amicos,</hi> the Accusatiue case after the verb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because the Verb <hi>Opitulor,</hi> to help, wil haue a Datiue

in the Grammaticall order in the Latine, the Substantiue is
to be set before the Adiectiue; as the childe is to beginne to

construe it into Latine without book, or to repeat the Latin
as they haue made it: but to construe it without booke is far
the surest, or to reade &amp; construe it out of the English. And
according to these as they pronounce, and are shewed their

to correct so, or to haue omitted his exercise, to haue his due

I haue hardly beene able to bring them to a
shew of that which you speake of, I meane so to imitate
and resemble Tully; but that they will frame them of
long sentences, matters vnfit for an Epistle, flash and to
little purpose; but very childish, and more like vnto a
Theame or an Oration, then to an Epistle. Thus I see it to
be also amongst the chiefe of the Schollars, of sundry of
those who are much accounted of, and wherin the schollars
seeme to doe the best.</p>
                  <p>As for inditing Letters in English,<note place="margin">Inditing Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Letters lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle exercised in Schooles.</note> I haue not exercised
my schollars in them at all; neyther haue I knowne them
to be vsed in Schooles: although they cannot but bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
necessary for schollars; being of perpetuall vse in
all our whole life, and of very great commendation, when
they are so performed. Therefore I still craue your helping
hand to direct me, how to bring my schollars to the attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that faculty.</p>

                  <p>Let me first heare what way you haue taken in
these, like as you shewed me in the former kinds; and then I
shall relate vnto you how this may bee done, so shortly as I
can.</p>

                  <speaker>Spoud.</speaker>
                  <p>I haue done this:<note place="margin">The ordinary meanes of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Schollars to make Epistles</note> I haue read them some of Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
Epistles, and also some part of Macropedius or Hegen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorphinus
<hi>de conscribendis Epistolis.</hi> I haue directed them
that they are to follow the rules set downe in the seuerall
kindes of Epistles there mentioned, and made the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6954:98"/>
examples plaine vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, I haue vsed oft to put them in minde of this,
that an Epistle is nothing but a Letter sent to a friend, to
certifie him of some matter, or to signifie our mind plainly
and fully vnto him. And therefore looke how wee would
write in English, so to doe in Latin. These and the like are
the helpes which I haue vsed: and I take them to bee the
most that are done in ordinary Schooles.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>I like well of your reading of Tullies Epistles,
which indeed is the very foundation of all: but for Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedius
and Hegendorphinus, although their paines were
great; yet I cannot see, but that they will rather require an
auncient learned Master to vnderstand, and make vse of
them, then a younger schollar, who is to be taught how to
speake.<note place="margin">Hard for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who haue no reading, to inuent variety of matter of themselues.</note> Also for telling a childe that he must inuent variety
of matter of his owne head, to write to his friend; this is a
taske ouer hard to ordinary wits. For what can a childe
haue in his vnderstanding, to be able to conceiue or write
of, which hee hath not read or someway knowne before?
according to that Maxime: <hi>Nihil est in intellectu quod non
prius fuerat in sensu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore omitting these, wherein I my selfe haue also
found a great deale of toyle, with small fruit; I will set you
downe plainely the very direct way, so neere as yet I haue
beene able to learne; and whereby I am out of doubt,
that that same faculty may be easily gotten, of writing such
Epistles; fully expressing Tully, as was said, and of inditing
Letters like vnto them, which are our vsuall Epistles, as the
Latine were of the Romanes.</p>
                  <p>The way may be this:</p>
                  <p>1 When your young schollars haue gone through
<hi>Sententiae pueriles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Helpes for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Epistles.</note> 
                     <hi>Confab. Cato,</hi> or the like; and can begin
to make Latine in some such good sort as was shewed; let
them then reade Tullies Epistles, gathered by Sturmius;<note place="margin">1 Reading Tullies Epistles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> as
being of the choysest of his Epistles, and most fitte for
children. This one booke rightly vsed, may sufficiently
furnish for making Epistles, so farre as shall be needfull
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:6954:99"/>
for the Grammar Schooles. It would be read by them twice
in the weeke at least, vntill they had gone through a good
part thereof; vnlesse they be able to reade it of themselues
<hi>ex tempore,</hi> or by the helpe of the translation.</p>
                  <p>2 As they reade euery Epistle,<note place="margin">☞</note> or before they are to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
any one,<note place="margin">2 Making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very perfect in euery Epistle.</note> make them as perfect in it as you can, and as
time will permit: not onely in construing, parsing, reading
out of the Grammaticall translation into the Latine; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to be able to giue euery phrase, both Latine to English,
and English to Latine.</p>
                  <p>Also cause them to make you a report what the summe
of the Epistle is; and this if you will, both in English and
Latine also, as was said of the Fables.</p>
                  <p>3 Cause them for their exercise to make another Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
in imitation of Tullies Epistle,<note place="margin">☞</note> vsing al the phrases and

each way most familiar to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fully their owne.</p>
                  <p>And first let them doe this in a good English stile, as was
said; I meane in making an English Letter first: setting it
after the manner,<note place="margin">To do this first in English, then in Latine.</note> as they did their English Translation; of
that page of their booke towards the left hand, or on the
first columne, the Latine on the other ouer against it, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for sentence.</p>
                  <p>Herein they are only to differ from the Translations,<note place="margin">To set the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles after the manner of the Translations.</note> that

to answere word for word both English and Latine; as to
write purely and sweetly, as well in English as in Latine, and

imitated. Be sure that they know perfectly the matter and

                  <p>I haue according to the custome in Schooles,<note place="margin">The ordinary manner of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Schollars how to begin to make Theames. According to Apthonius rules.</note>
read them some of Apthonius rules, and so it may be, haue
begun with Apologues or Fables, or rather with a Chreia:
and in their Chreia, I haue first made the seuerall parts of it,
or of their Theame so handled, very plaine vnto them, with
the manner of the proofes of it; and of gathering reasons
to amplifie it, according to the same.</p>
                  <p>I haue then giuen them a Theame to make, following the
example in their booke, to prosecute the same parts of the
Theame; as <hi>Exordium, narratio, confirmatio, confutatio,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:6954:101"/>
conclusio,</hi> and also to follow the seuerall places, to amplifie
each thing by. I haue withall shewed them how to doe it:
as to trie what they could gather of themselues; and withall
to seeke Tullies sentences what they could find out of it,
or out of other bookes to their purpose.<note place="margin">The inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of this course.</note> But yet (alas!) that

iudgement; and ordinarily so rudely, as I haue been asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that any one should see their exercises. So as it hath
driuen mee into exceeding passions, causing me to deale o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
rigorously with the poore boies. Whereby some of
them, whose Parents haue been more tender, seeing their
children heauy and vnwilling to the Schoole, haue suffered
them to leaue off the Schoole, and so to lose all which they
had gotten before; others also haue beene made so feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that they would rather desire to go to any base trade or
drudgery, then to be Schollars, &amp; hereby haue very much
reproached my schoole: Because, as they haue ouer-right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complained, they must bee beaten for not doing that,
which they knew not how to doe; so that this feare is worse
to them, then the first for making Latines.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithstanding, in their entring to make
Theames, and so likewise into versifying, I haue not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
how to auoid it, but I haue bin enforced to vse so much
sharpnesse, as to make them to call all their wits together,
and to stir them vp to all diligence and paines; or otherwise
I should haue done no good at all.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon very great inconueniences haue insued:

                  <p>I doe not see how by this course,<note place="margin">This way hard enough for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters.</note> these euils could
be auoided. As I said of Macropedius for Epistles, so I may
here; that this way of entring your schollars is hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to many a Schoolemaster, thus to follow euery
part of the Theame and those places of Apthonius, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
matter and reasons to proue and illustrate euery thing,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6954:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and to do it in a good stile. That which is said of Epistles,
that children must be acquainted by reading,<note place="margin">Difficulty in making Theams, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause schollars are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the matter of them.</note> with matter &amp;
phrase fit for Epistles, before they can euer bee fit to make
such Epistles, is much more true concerning both theames
and verses; inasmuch as the matter of them is harder, being
of such things as they haue neuer read of, nor been any way
acquainted with, or at least very little. Besides, to follow the
Logicke places in Apthonius in a Philosophical discourse,
doth require both some insight in Logick, and reading in
such Authors as haue written of such morall matters. And
therfore herein many a Master deserues rather to be beaten
then the schollar,<note place="margin">The Master oft deserues to bee beaten rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the schollar.</note> for driuing the childe by cruelty, to doe
that which he himself can see no reason how the poor child
should be able to do it. It must of necessitie either driue the
schollar to vse all deuises to leaue the schoole, or else cause
him to liue in a continual horror &amp; hatred of learning; and
to account the schoole, not <hi>Ludus literarius,</hi> but <hi>carnificina,</hi>

                  <p>I acknowledge it too true which you haue said:
I pray you therfore shew me your best aduise &amp; experience
how to free my selfe &amp; my children from these euils; that I
may both so enter them in these &amp; also draw them on after,

                  <p>Herein I my self am desirous to be a learner, as in all
the rest. Although too much experience hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled me
to seek out all meanes to redress this; notwithstanding also
that I haue euer been afraid of vsing cruelty in my schoole.
And the rather haue I bin careful to seek out the easiest and
plainest way, that I might allure &amp; draw on my schollars in
this exercise, as in all other, to proceed as in a scholasticall
play, with vnderstanding, loue and delight. So much as I
haue attained, I shall willingly impart vnto you.</p>
                  <p>1. We are to consider,<note place="margin">1. To consider the principall end of making Theams.</note> what is the end &amp; purpose of their
making Theams; and then to bethink our selues, which way
they may the soonest attaine vnto the same. The principal
end of making Theams, I take to be this, to furnish schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6954:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with al store of the choisest matter,<note place="margin">The principall end of making Theams.</note> that they may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
learne to vnderstand, speake or write of any ordinary
Theame, Morall or Politicall, such as vsually fall into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
amongst men &amp; in practice of life; and especially co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
vertues &amp; vices. So as to work in themselues a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
loue of the vertue and hatred of the vice, and to be able
with soundnesse of reason to draw others to their opinion.</p>
                  <p>The best means to effect this most soone and surely,<note place="margin">The means to furnish them.</note> are
these so far as yet I know.</p>
                  <p>1. To see that by perfect learning,<note place="margin">1. Making them very perfect in all their first school Authors. Reasons.</note> &amp; oft repeating they
be very readie in their first Authors, which they learned, of
such morall matters; as their <hi>Sententiae,</hi> Cato, Esopsfables:
For some one or mo of these haue the grounds of almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Theam, which is meet to be propounded to schollars
to write on. So that by these they shal be furnished with the
iudgements of may Wisemen, what is truth, what is false in
most matters, with som words to expresse their minds, and
also some reasons; as with the sentences or testimonies of
the wisest, Similitudes, or Apologues in Aesop, and some
graue reasons out of Cato, which they may cal to mind. All
these may be done by the courses set downe before, and as
soon as the bare learning of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>struing &amp; parsing alone.</p>
                  <p>2. Add to these the oft reading ouer of Tullies sentences
out of the Gram.<note place="margin">☜</note> translations,<note place="margin">2. Reading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer &amp; ouer Tullies senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> &amp; the sentences of the other
Authors adioined with the same. As also the reading them
forth of Latine into a good English stile. Thus yoush I find
by experience, that after that children are perfect in their
first schoole Authors, they wil also read this book of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
by the help of the translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone, to go ouer &amp; ouer
it, euery day thus reading a peece of it amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues,
with little or no hindring any of their school exercises.</p>
                  <p>3. To the end that they may haue presidents and
patterns for Theams,<note place="margin">3. Presidents or examples.</note> like as they had for their Epistles and
for making Latin, some book is to be chosen which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to this purpose, and such a one as is most easie, both for
the sweetest Latine and choisest matter.</p>
                  <p>These presidents are of two sorts: some are to furnish

them still,<note place="margin">Presidents for matter.</note> with more variety of the best matter; others, for
the whole forme and frame of the Theame.</p>
                  <p>Of the first sort,<note place="margin">☞</note> for singular matter notably compact
together,<note place="margin">Reusneri Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</note> 
                     <hi>Reusners Symbola</hi> doth seeme to me most famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
and plaine: wherein the Poesies or sentences of the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Emperors, both Italian, Greek, and Germane are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:

vp young Gentlemen,<note place="margin">Reusner worthy to traine vp young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and all of any good sort and condition.</note> and all others whom we would haue
to become wise men, &amp; good Common-wealths men. It is
full of most singular precepts and instructions concerning
dueties and vertues; and for framing and ordering the
whole course of our life, and managing all our affaires with
wisedome, safetie and commendations. So as any one may
receiue many wise directions, for all occasions of life, and
withall much sweete delight, in it. And for this matter of
Theames, it is fraughted full of the graue testimonies and
sentences of many of the auncientest, wisest, and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced;
all fitly applyed, without any matter to corrupt
or offend, and in a most familiar, easie, and pleasing stile.</p>
                  <p>The manner of the vse of it for the first enterers into
Theames,<note place="margin">☞</note> where they haue bookes, and the Teacher would
specially apply them to Theames,<note place="margin">How Schollars may vse Reus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Symbola for Theames.</note> and that they haue time
enough, may be this:</p>
                  <p>To take the<note n="*" place="margin">The words or Mottoes.</note> Poesies or Theams of it in order: or if any
of them seeme ouer hard for childrens capacities, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the matter of them, to make choyse of the most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and familiar, first: to reade vnto them euery night a
peece of a Theame of it, as a side of a leafe, or more or lesse;
according to the abilities of their Schollars. In reading, first
to make the Theame or generall matter of it very plaine
vnto them. They are commonly expounded for the sum
of them vnder the Poesie, in verse, or with som short glosse,
or both. Afterwards, to shew your Schollars the chiefe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:6954:103"/>
reasons and sentences, as you do reade, and in what words
the force of each Argument or reason lieth. Also to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
al the phrases which are either more difficult or pure,
or most fit to that purpose in hand.</p>
                  <p>And thus to make euery thing plaine vnto them; first
opening them, after examining the same, and so causing
them to vnderstand, and to be able to answere euerie point
therof in Latine, or to giue the hard phrases to the English.</p>
                  <p>This poasing by short questions, with the other things
mentioned, will make the obscurest peeces of it very eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and cause both weaker Masters and schollars to profit
greatly in vnderstanding. After all this, if you will, cause
them to construe it amongst themselues and to giue the
sense, and so make it as perfect as they can euery waie: Or
if they bee able, heare them to construe it themselues first,
or to read it out of the Latine into English, and then make
it plaine to them. Then let each seuerally see how hee can
gather a short Theam out of that; choosing out all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
sentences and reasons, and composing them in good
order: following, if you thinke good, the parts of a Theam:
<hi>viz. Exordium, Narratio, Confirmatio, Confutatio, Conclusio,</hi>
though their Theame be not aboue 12. or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to their time &amp; abilitie. To these they may adioine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reasons or sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, as they can, either what they haue
learned, or what they can gather fitly to the same purpose.</p>

short questions of the faults, and causing them to answere
them, and to shew how they should be amended; and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a dash with a pen vnder euery falt, or the letters where
the falt is, to leaue them to them to correct them after. Yet
your selfe somtimes to peruse the exercises after againe, to
see that they haue corrected them; as I shal shew in another
place. By this means the first enterers may haue choise of

matter gathered to their hands, which otherwise they
were to seeke in other Authors they knewe not where no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wel either the thing it self, Causes &amp; Effects of it: or if it
be a Proposition, as in this (Children are to obey their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents)

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:6954:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
called; and the one part wil surely afford some reasons.</p>

downe in their Theame, as they will haue them, to ranke
them in their minde or in writing; so as they doe purpose
to set them in their Theame: setting some stronger in the

a deeper impression in the minds of the hearers; &amp; so out of
them to conclude most firmly. And thus much may serue
for the direction in generall for making the Theame.</p>

And in the later side of the page, towards the right hand, to
set the seuerall tropes or figures, but in two or three letters.

beeing thus plainely guided and directed from point to
point.</p>
                  <p>Yet to proceede a little further herein, if you will giue me
leaue: I haue heard of some schollars marueilously praised

it would be exceeding profitable: to wit, such Common-place
bookes as did but only containe the generall heads

when time will not permit to peruse the writing of euery

any difficult question of Grammar, euen beside those which
are in the rules, which are commonly learned; and also how
to oppose or dispute schollar-like in Latine, of any good

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>The plainest,<note place="margin">How to answer any difficult question of Grammar.</note> shortest, and surest way, I finde to be
this:</p>
                  <p>1 See that they be very ready in all the vsuall and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
questions of Grammar,<note place="margin">1 To be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> by daily examining at Parts.</p>

right place whither it appertaines: as to the Noune, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noune,
Participle, and so the seuerall heads thereof.</p>
                  <p>When as young schollars waxe perfect in all the former,
which are in the Accedence; then a little paines in teaching
them these, making them plain vnto them, and examining
them some halfe side at time (in stead of the time spent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in examining the former) will very soone make them
as ready in these also.</p>
                  <p>3 After these,<note place="margin">3 In the Latine questions dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed through the Grammar, not learned vsually.</note> you may (if you please) goe through the
questions of Grammatica, and make them plaine; exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

which are scattered here and there, through the whole
Grammar: directing them to marke out the questions, or
the speciall wordes wherein the questions are, and how to
be propounded; that they themselues may oppose one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
or one to oppose all as neede is.</p>
                  <p>But this as you shall thinke necessary;<note place="margin">Caueat.</note> and so as it do not

in few words, both English and Latine, as need requires,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:6954:116"/>
and teaching them to answere in a word or two.</p>
                  <p>By going through these, they may be able to answere all,<note place="margin">☜</note>
or most of those which are set together in the end of his

bring the whole disputations of M. Stockw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to dispute in

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Nothing less: for you see how after that they haue
bin exercised this way for a time, then I would haue them to
trie their owne wits &amp; inuentions also; first abbridging their
Author,<note place="margin">Necessity of being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the best exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> then bringing their owne: But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for following this

as in all other learning, so in this (like as we obserued
in generall before) to let them haue first the most excellent
patterns, &amp; neuer to rest vntil they haue the very patterns
in their heads, and as it were euer before their eies; for then
they wil be able to go forwards of themselues with delight &amp;
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations.<note place="margin">The euils of in forcing schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, wherof they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the examples first.</note> Wheras, otherwise to inforce them by feare,

rigor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I say no more of it, &amp; which must needs worke a
maruellous distast in the schollar, as I haue noted. Besides,
to cause such young ones to dispute without hearing or see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such presidents, is al one, as to teach them to write only
by precepts or some direction without copie. For euen as
therin they shal both write very il fauouredly if any thing at
all, and learn so bad a hand, as they shal be much troubled
to forget, which they must doe before they can come to a
good hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so is it here. 1. They shall dispute very weakly
&amp; childishly, both forwords &amp; matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if any thing at all, &amp;
2. they shal get barbarous phrase, to make them to be skor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and which they shall hardly forget againe.</p>

                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:6954:120"/>
But of the otherside,<note place="margin">Benefits of the contrary; <hi>viz</hi> of hauing the best patternes.</note> they being trained vp thus, shall
make not onely the matter of their learned Authour their
owne, but also his phrase; and be so furnished, that any man
wil take delight to heare them. And that which I say of this,
the same I affirm of all excellent patterns, whether for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Theames, Verses or whatsoeuer; that the more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
their Presidents are, and the more cunning they are in
them, the more singular they shall vndoubtedly proue.</p>
                  <p>This is the very maine reason, why all would haue the
children to learne each Author so perfectly, as to say euery
worde without booke, as much as is possible, that the verie
phrase and matter of their Author may bee their owne to
vse perpetually.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point,<note place="margin">Triall by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note> triall and experience may teach
vs. Let two children be taken, one of a more pregnant and
sharpe wit, the other of a slower and duller capacity: cause
him of the sharpe wit, to do all only by precept and his own
Inuention in making Epistles, Theames, Verses, disputing;
but let the other of the duller capacitie be trained vp, not
only by precept and his own inuention; but principally by
being kept strictly to imitate the most excellent patternes
in all things: then make the triall, whether he of the duller
wit shall not expresse the sharpnesse, learning, grauitie, of
the most learned and wise men, with certaine assurance to
iustifie what hee hath done: whereas in the other; shall be
found by a learned and a iudicious examiner, nothing but
froth, childishnesse and vncertaintie, in the greatest ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening
of wit and learning; and whether the duller and
harder wit shall not do it with farre lesse labour.</p>

The first of them,<note place="margin">The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</note> that is, Pronuntiation, beeing that
which either makes or mars the most excellent speech. For
al speeches are vsually esteemed euen as they are vttered or
pronounced; the finest schollar without this is accounted
no bodie: and a mean schollar hauing attained this facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
is ordinarily reputed and commended aboue the best.
Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you know how that famous Greek Orator, when

Grammar schollars of any yeers. To the end, to fit them to

also to traine them vp to be able to speak purely when they

                     </gap>ained to speake.</p>
                  <p>As for example: In the <hi>Confabulatiunculae pueriles,</hi>
Cause them to vtter euery dialogue liuely, as if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
were the persons which did speake in that dialogue,
&amp; so in euery other speech, to imagine themselues to haue

your selfe the absurdnesse of their pronuntiation, by
pronouncing foolishly or childishly, as they do: and then
pronounce it rightly, and naturally before them likewise,
that they may perceiue the difference to be ashamed of the
one, and take a delight in the other.</p>
                  <p>So cause them to do it after you, vntill that they can do
it in good sort, tuning their voices sweetly. When they can
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6954:121"/>
doe it in English, then cause them to doe it iust in the same
manner in Latine; and thus they will vndoubtedly come
vnto it very easily.</p>

or Terence as they did in <hi>Confabulatiunculae.</hi> For E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops
Fables, we haue shewed before the manner, for making

the benefite thereof.</p>
                  <p>So after when they shall come to Virgils Eclogues,<note place="margin">☜</note>
cause them yet still more liuely, in saying without booke,
to expresse the affections and persons of sheepeheards; or

and others in Ouids Metamorphosis, Iuno, Neptune,
Aeolus, Aeneas, Venus, Dido, &amp;c. Virgils Aeneids.</p>
                  <p>So in all Poetry,<note place="margin">Poetry to be pronounced as prose, except in scanning.</note> for the pronuntiation, it is to be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

done what I could continually: and yet of late time I grow
to this certaine assurance, that Schollars may be brought
to talke of any ordinary matter which can be required of
them, both in good Latine, and also most readily and
easily.</p>
                  <p>Herein hath beene a great part of my errour and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,<note place="margin">The generall errour for the time when schollars are to begin to speake Latine.</note>

                  <p>1 You must remember that which I said, concerning
the manner of the examining both of their Grammar rules

For the particular manner. I referre you to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>If you were not able so to vtter euery thing before them,

marueilous helpe heereunto; especially the reading of
bookes of Dialogues: as of <hi>Confabulatiunculae pueriles,
Corderius, &amp;c.</hi> For if there they can presently expresse their
mindes in Latine, of any such matter as is there handled;
why shall they not be able to doe it likewise, of any such
thing falling into their common talke.</p>
                  <p>4 As they learne these Dialogues,<note place="margin">☜</note> when they haue

                  <p>So you shall be sure that they shall not goe by rote (as we

Latine so talking together. And moreouer, euer thus with
the English, the Latine will easily come to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,

                  <p>Euen the same which I would vse to help a whole
Schoole: which if I should take a course for a wager, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
others, I would vse specially, to cause them daily to
spend some quarter, or halfe an howre, each in his order,
reading Corderius first out of Latine into English, after out
of English into Latine, euery one a little peece; where one
failes another to helpe; and the booke or Master where all
faile: and also the Master to cause them to vary each hard
phrase (and chiefly all which are of most common vse) so
many waies as they can, trying who can doe best; himselfe
to adde moe where they faile. After Corderius gone ouer,
to do the like in other easie Authors, as Terence, or <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Christianus,</hi> and the like. So I would haue the priuate
learner to practice daily the same, reading Corderius first
out of Latine into English, by help of the translation; after
trying how he can read it out of English into Latine, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
where he fails, to vse the help of the Latine book lying
by him. The continual exercise in this, if they labor to be
perfect in the examples of Nowns &amp; Verbs, and somwhat
in knowing the Rules of the Accedence, as was shewed, shal
most speedily effect this desire. For thus may any one soon
learne to vtter all that booke: And in it is the substance of
most things falling out in ordinary speech. After this, hee
may do the like in other easie books by the same helpe of
translations. And lastly, practicing to translate other books
of dialogues (as, Erasmus <hi>Colloquium,</hi> or the like) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
reading them forth of English into Latine againe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

I cannot thinke any paines ouer-much, for the finding out
the readie waie to the perfect knowledge of it. Hee in one
place hauing mentioned sundrie of the renowned Greeke
Authors, as <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Zenophon, Demosthenes, Iso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
and others, whom he names there (the matchlesse
masters in all manner of learning) addes these words in
praise of the Greeke tongue, and the learning in it.</p>
                  <p>Now let Italian, sayth hee, and Latine it selfe, Spanish,
French, Dutch, and English bring forth their learning, and
recite their Authors, Cicero onely excepted, and one or
two more in Latine; they be all patched clouts and ragges
in comparison of faire wouen broad cloathes. And truely,
saith he, if there bee any good in them, it is either learned,
borrowed, or stolne from som one of those worthy wits of
Athens. Thus far M. Askam.</p>

2 Besides the Greeke Testament, I would haue euery
one to haue his English Testament, or Latine, or both;
and euer in their entrance before they learne a lesson, to
haue read it ouer in the translation, and to bee able
eyther to say it without booke, or make a report of it
in English or Latine: but better to say it without booke,
euen in the English; which with a little reading ouer,
especially before bedde time, those who are of good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
will get quickely. This same done with vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
will exceedingly bring the Greeke with it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that thus they shall haue much opportunity and
furtherance, to get the English text almost by heart, as we
tearme it.</p>
                  <p>3. In reading a Lecture to them, euer tell them what
example each Noune and Verbe is like vnto, and for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounes,
Aduerbes, and the like: if they bee not perfect in
Grammar, tell them in a word, or point them where they
are in the Grammar; iust after the manner as in the Latine.</p>
                  <p>4 Shew them carefully al the hard words, &amp; those which
they haue not learned; and for those which you thinke they
cannot remember otherwise, or wherin there is need of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
labour, cause euery one to write them in a little paper
book, made for that purpose, with sundry columnes in each
page, to write at least the Greek word &amp; Latin or English in,
in each Chap. &amp; the Verse against them: to the end to take
most paines in those, &amp; to run oft ouer them: and so euer to
see after where they haue had those wordes before. And
thereby also to account how many new wordes they haue
in euery Lecture: for all the rest learned before in any
place or which are very easie, are not to be accounted for
any new wordes.</p>
                  <p>Thus shall you prouoke and encourage them to more
paines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they haue not ouer fiue or sixe new words in a
douzen or twenty Verses, and in time happely not two in a
Chapter. So that they will haue the most of the hard words
in a short time, and be able easily to proceed of themselues,
without any reading, throgh these &amp; other helps following.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:6954:131"/>
5 When they learne to construe, let them doe it by the
helpe of the translation; obseruing wherein the translation
seemes to differ from the wordes of the Greeke, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the reason thereof; and after to trie of themselues how
they can construe, looking onely vpon the translation,
beating the Greeke out of it, as formerly they did the Latin.
Those who are of any aptnesse, will doe it presently.</p>
                  <p>And thus by practice, euery day going a piece, and oft
reading ouer and ouer, they will grow very much, to your
great joy.</p>

                  <p>But giue me leaue to aske of you two or three
doubts.</p>
                  <p>1 Why you would haue them to write down their hard
wordes in a booke:<note place="margin">1 Why to haue the hard words written downe.</note> will not making some markes at the
wordes serue as in their Latine Authours, according to the
generall obseruation?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>This was obserued before, as I remember to mark
their hard wordes eyther in their bookes, or setting them
downe in a paper. But here I thinke it to be better, thus to
write downe the principall; First, because schollars now will
be carefull to keepe their Greeke Testaments faire from
blotting or scrauling, although a booke were well bestowed
to make them perfect in it, though it were neuer so marked.
Secondly, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>use when they are fit to reade Greeke, they
haue commonly good discretion to keepe their notes, and
to make vse of them; going oft ouer them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Spoud.</speaker>
                  <p>But might there not be some other meanes for
the getting of the hard wordes aforehand? for this must
needes be some labour, and aske care and diligence thus to
write them down.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes verily, if it be looked to in time; all these may
be so prepared aforehand, that most of this labour now
may be spared, and onely speciall difficulties to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
                  <p>The maner of it is thus: That wheras there is nothing in
getting any tongue, but to get wordes,<note place="margin">☞</note> and Grammar for
framing and setting those wordes together, and afterwards
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:6954:131"/>
practice; I hold it to be farre the speediest course,<note place="margin">The speediest way, to get the Greeke Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the schollars to haue learned the Greeke <hi>Radices</hi> or Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
words, before that they goe to construction; or at least
to be well acquainted with them.</p>
                  <p>This course some famous Grecians haue taken:<note place="margin">How it may be done easily, without losse of time.</note> wee may
doe it most easily, and without any losse of time, or very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
if any; as I haue made triall: First, hauing gathered the
Greeke <hi>Radices</hi> out of <hi>Scapula,</hi> after the manner of that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement,
called <hi>voces primogeniae,</hi> I haue heretofore cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
such as I haue thought fit, to write it out, and to bring
me a side (or so much as I thought good) euery morning
at my entrance into the Schoole, or presently after; and so
haue vsed to examine those wordes amongst them all, once
or twice ouer, and where they haue learned the principall
Latine wordes. (Of late I haue seene the Greeke Nomencla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
vsed, not without fruit; though it be vnperfectly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.)</p>
                  <p>The manner of getting the wordes may bee most easie,
thus:<note place="margin">Manner of learning them.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hauing these in this manner with the English adioyned:
if you would make triall herein; when you haue examined
a side, reade them ouer as much more against the next day;
reading first the English word, then the Latine, and Greeke
last: shewing them some helpe how to remember, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the Greeke with the Latine, or English; and so the
English will bring the Latine to remembrance, and both of
them the Greeke.</p>
                  <p>And in examining them,<note place="margin">Manner of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining them for speed and memory.</note> to aske them the English word;
and to cause them to giue both Latine and Greeke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
both backeward and forward againe.</p>
                  <p>As, posing thus: How say you, I loue? He answereth, <hi>Amo,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, amo,</hi> I loue: so they will be perfect each
way. Thus within the space of a twelue moneth they may
goe through the whole; spending not much aboue a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an houre in a day or half an houre at most of schoole
time. Those who are diligent may get them in good sort,
onely (as I haue oft admonished) making some little pricks
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:6954:132"/>
or markes at the hardest to runne oft ouer them: and when
they haue once gone ouer them, you may cause them to
bring you a leafe at a time, or more; as those who are apt
will doe readily.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes, besides that they shall learne very many
Latine wordes,<note place="margin">Benefit hereof.</note> chiefly most of the Primitiues to further
them greatly in the Latine, and to counteruaile all the
time and labour bestowed in them: they may also, when
they come to construction, eyther haue euery <hi>Radix</hi>
in their head, or turne to it with a wette finger, and make
it perfect in an instant; and thereby haue such a light to
all other wordes comming of these, as presently by them,
to conceiue of and remember any word.</p>
                  <p>And thus by them and their readinesse in the Grammar,
to goe on in reading by the helpes mentioned, faster then

                  <p>For hauing these <hi>Radices</hi> perfect,<note place="margin">Hauing Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la in the school to run to, they shall presently haue any thing.</note> they will conceiue

onely one worde in each signification, lest the volume
should proue ouer-great: though (if the volume would

to furnish with copie of <hi>Synonimaes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, by setting downe also the English in one
proper word, or iust as the Latine; onely to expresse it,
and without variety: except in some speciall things which
haue diuers names in our owne tongue, not commonly
knowne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, setting downe also the Articles in the
Nounes, at least in all which are hard to distinguish. The
Future and Preterperfect tenses of the Verbes may be
known by their figuratiue letters: Anomalyes are set down
in the Grammar for most part.</p>
                  <p>I also intend (God willing) to set in the Margent of it
all the Hebrew <hi>Radices,</hi> against euery <hi>Radix</hi> in Greeke;
at least so many as can be found: which I presume vpon

Hebrew.</p>
                  <p>Thus young schollars, and all others who are desirous
to get the tongues, may make a most easie entrance
into them, and goe forward with much pleasure in all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:

and they translated <hi>verbatim</hi> into Latine or English, or
both: and the translation to be made in a booke separate,
or in seuerall pages; as in the one page the Greeke, in the
other ouer against it the Latine or English, line for line, and
so many words in a line: like as is the translation of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,
and the other small Poets adioyned, with Sylburgius
annotations; that so looking onely on the Greeke, they
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:6954:133"/>
might learne first to construe into Latin, and after looking
onely on the translation they might beate out the Greeke
(as I shewed before in the vse of the translations) and onely
vse the helpe of the Greeke text where they could not finde
it out otherwise.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes, when they were able to reade these
both wayes, both the Greeke into the translation, and
the translation into the Greeke readily (as they might
soone doe, by oft reading ouer, and by vnderstanding

doth not sufficiently expresse the force of the Greeke

it very profitable. Or if you will, you may take Bezaes

this meanes of hauing the bookes separate.</p>
                  <p>The reason also is euident; because when the bookes are
so seuered, the mind it beates out the words, and makes
them its owne: yea, and also imprints them; and doth vse
the Translation but onely as a Schoolemaster, or a Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,<note place="margin">The Interlineal is continually a prompt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where it is not able to finde out the words of it selfe;
and also to try after, that it haue gone surely. But when both
are ioined together, as in the Interlineall, the eye is as soone
vpon the one as the other: I meane, as soone vpon the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
as vpon the Greeke; and so likewise vpon the Greek as
vpon the Latine, because they are so close ioined one vnto
the other. So that the booke insteed of being a Master to

out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it becommeth a continuall prompter and maketh the

they be to get it themselues, or to be examined; yet still will
their eye be vpon the helpe, where it should not be.</p>

when he would reade it into Greeke, and so can vse them as
was sayd, without hindring the mind to studie and beat out,

                  <p>Here are indeed very many and singular helpes:
most of which, I may truely say as before, that I haue not
so much as heard of. But if I would haue my schollar to

                  <p>If you mean for the tongue,<note place="margin">How to write purely in Greek</note> to be able to write true
and pure Greeke, the sure meanes are euen the same, as for
writing Latine.</p>
                  <p>1. The continuall practice of construing,<note place="margin">☜</note> parsing, and
reading forth of the translation into the Authors, is making
the Greeke continually.</p>
                  <p>2. To come to the stile and composition, and so for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thography,
to doe as for the Latine. As I directed you to
giue them sentences in English, translated Grammatically

both your selfe and they may haue a certaine guide for
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:6954:137"/>
them to go surely; so here to giue them sentences or peeces
out of the Testament, or out of Isocrates, as <hi>ad Demom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
or out of <hi>Xenophon</hi> to translate into Greeke, and so to
see how neere they can come vnto the Author. Or else, to
aske them onely the Latine or English of the Greeke, and
to trie how they can turne it into Greek first Grammatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
after in composition: or sometimes one way, somtimes
the other. And to this purpose also, the translations of som
excellent parts of the purest Greek Authors were most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <p>By these meanes they might come in time, to be as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
in writing Greeke for the stile and composition, as
in the Latine. For all other exercises in Greeke, I referre
you to that which hath been said concerning the Latine,
the reason and meanes being the like.</p>

being marked out; and by daily practice in reading some

reduced to such classes, and the oft running ouer them.</p>

being vsed as the English translations, for getting the Latin,
and as the Latine or English for the Greeke, will be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all that we would imagine.</p>
                  <p>And that after this manner:</p>
                  <p>First, as I said for the others, by reading ouer the translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">The manner of vsing these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</note>
to vnderstand the matter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, learning to construe the Hebrew into the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
exactly, and backe againe out of the translation into
Hebrew; looking onely on the translation, to meditate and
beate out the Hebrew. This helpes vnderstanding, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
memory, and all (as I said) to haue the text most
absolutely.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, beginning with the easiest first (as in the other
tongues) as eyther some part of the History (as namely Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis,
the bookes of Samuell) or else the Psalmes; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
specially the hundred and nineteene Psalme, as most
plaine of all other: or rather to beginne with the <hi>Praxis</hi>
vpon the Psalmes, the first, the fiue and twentieth, and the
threescore and eight, set downe in the end of Martinius
Grammar, printed by Raphalengius, Anno 1607. which
will both acquaint the learner with the vnderstanding of
Martinius, and set him in a most direct and ready way, by
the other helpes.</p>
                  <p>For the certainty of this,<note place="margin">Experience of this for assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> besides that the reason is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same with the Latine, and like as I said for the Greeke
also, I haue moreouer knowne this experience in a childe,
vnder fifteene yeares of age; who besides all kinde of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and exercises, both in Latin and Greeke, as those men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before, and his daily progresse in them, had within
the space of lesse then a yeare, gotten sundry of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
and most necessary rules of Grammar. Also a great
part of the <hi>Radices</hi> in <hi>Buxtorphius,</hi> though hee spent not
therein aboue two houres in a day. And besides all this,
hee had learned about foureteene or fifteene Psalmes:
wherein he was so readie, as that hee was able not onely to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:6954:141"/>
construe or reade the Hebrew into the Latine; but also out
of the bare translation, to reade the Hebrew backe againe,
to shew euery <hi>Radix,</hi> and to giue a reason in good sort for
each word, why it was so. Of this hath beene tryall by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                  <p>The which experience with the daily trials of reading the
Latine so exactly and readily out of the English, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it (as it were without booke) by that practice, doefully
assure me that by this daily exercise the very originals of
the Hebrew may be made as easie and familiar as the Latine
is; yea, in time with continuall practice, to be able to say
very much of it without booke:<note place="margin">A Student can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better imployed then in thus imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in his hart, if he haue lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</note> as I shewed before for the

bestow some part of his time in a more pleasant, easie and
happy studie? when there will be no more but reading ouer
and ouer with meditation, and still to be reading the words
and wisedome of the Highest; in whose presence he hopes
to dwell, and to heare the same sweete voyce in the Temple
in heauen eternally.</p>

                  <p>I can see no reason at all to the contrary, but
that these our Latine Classicall Authours being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Grammatically into other tongues, by some who
are learned amongst them, the Latine may as well bee
learned thereby by them out of their translations, in their
own tongues, by such helps of rules as haue bin mentioned,
or the like, as out of translations in our English tongue.
Secondly, the Latine tongue being once gotten, the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

which they are to vs.</p>

if in euery difficult place, or where the wordes see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be out of order, it were set in the margents ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them.</p>
                  <p>The same I say for our English; into which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,

a perfect sense, and might bee learned out of it. Also

aduised for the Greeke, as being most easie; or at Matthew
if you please; and you shall soone finde that through the
familiarnes of the matter, they will so come on both wayes
(both in reading the Latine into English, and English into
Latine) as your selfe will maruell at, and their parents will
reioyce in; and acknowledge themselues bound vnto you
for to see their little ones to be able to reade the Testament
into Latine.</p>
                  <p>Besides that, it will be also a notable preparatiue to learne
the Greeke Testament, when they are so well acquainted
with the English and Latine before.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Such as my Schollars haue: Erasmus or Beza; but
chiefly Beza, as the more pure phrase, and more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the sense and drift of the Holy Ghost. Therein
your selfe, or your schollars marking the peculiar Latine
phrases, when they reade first forth of the Latine into the
English, they will be able of themselues (when they reade
them the second time forth of the English into Latine) to
giue the same phrases againe, and to imprint them for
euer.</p>

leafe at a time (as I said) may serue for that; and another
quarter or not much more, before prayers at the breaking
vp at euening for this; and so neyther to lose time, nor to
omit any thing necessary for their happy growth herein. In
this reading of the Chapters so, you shall finde that they
will get as much Latine, and goe on as fast as in any other
exercise whatsoever; and also will doe it with ease, when
they haue beene first well trayned vp in the Grammaticall
translations, and that each knoweth his night to looke to it
aforehand.</p>

asking them what they remember of that which was
read, or how much they can repeat without booke of it: you
shall see that in a short time they will so marke, or so looke
to it afore hand, as they will (almost any of them) repeate
you a verse or two a peece. If you vse to appose ordinarily
for example, some one whom you know can repeat a great
deale, it will much prouoke the rest, to marke and take
paines; and especially if (as in other things) you vse to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

much for that, how they may get Religion and Latine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

but this I say vnto you againe, and you shall finde it most
true; that for any one who would conceiue of any long
sentence and remember it, let him diuide it into as many
short questions as he can, and answere them (though close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
in his minde; it shall giue a great light. So do with your

schollars in any thing which you would haue them to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand:
diuide the long question or sentence into many

of the long. I shewed the maner in examining young schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,

                  <p>There is indeede the same reason. I will giue you
an instance in a sentence or two in the first Chapter in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis:
and the rather because this is vsed by many, to cause
children to reade a Chapter of the Bible, and then to aske
some questions out of that. For example:</p>
                  <p>1 In the beginning God created the heauen and the
earth.<note place="margin">Examples of asking questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to helpe vnderstanding.</note>

darkenesse was vpon the face of the deepe, and the spirit of
God moued vpon the waters.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; it was voyde or waste.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Was there nothing vpon it?</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; the spirit of God moued on the waters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What said God then?</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Let there be light?</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> Was there light as he commaunded?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; there was light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Was there no light before?</p>

but darkenesse before: darkeness was vpon the deep.</p>

away most of them; whereas reading them ouer hee

                  <p>It is true;<note place="margin">These short questions giue a great light to harder points, how they are to be vnderstood.</note> but yet by this meanes a childe shal haue
a great light and helpe for vnderstanding, conceit and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
in most. And for those things which remaine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
the learner is to marke them out, and inquire them of
others, or of the notes &amp; short Commentaries vpon them;
and so by the other helpes mentioned: and especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the drift of the Holy Ghost, and comparing with
more plaine places where like phrases are vsed. But here it
shal be the safest, in posing to aske those things which arise
clearly &amp; naturally out of the words, &amp; may be fully vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
to omit the rest vntil God shal make them as euident.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:6954:149"/>
The easiest being first learned perfectly, the rest will come

two dayes after. The Masters eye must feede the horse:

and growth of the highest, nor for any other studie

to the supply of the want of an Vsher, by meanes of some

                  <p>Now for the sufficiency of the Vsher,<note place="margin">Sufficiency of the Vsher.</note> it would be such,
as that hee should bee able in some good sort to supply the

                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:6954:151"/>
And to speake further what I thinke in this case;<note place="margin">It were the best if the Vsher medled with no correction at all, vnlesse in the Masters absence.</note> That
although I would haue the Vsher to haue authoritie to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

Masters absence, and all the schollars to know so much: Yet
he shold not vse that authoritie, no not in correcting those
vnder himself, vnless very sparingly; but rather of himselfe
&amp; in his own discretion, to referre or to put them vp to the
Master; so to keepe the schollars from that stomaking and
complaints which will be made against him to the Parents
and otherwise, do he what he can to preuent it: vnlesse it be
where the Vsher teacheth in a place separate from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
there he is of necessitie to vse correction, though with
great discretion, and so seldome as may be. Experience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
sheweth, that the schollars will much more willingly
and submisly take correction of the Master without the
least repining. Neither need this correction to be so great,
as to trouble the Master very much, if right gouernment
be vsed.</p>
                  <p>All this must bee ordered by the discretion of the wise
Master, so as they may stand in awe of the Vsher: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
little good will be done.</p>

what they haue done, and to examine some questions in
each fourme of them vnder the Vsher, to make triall in
some part of that which they haue learned that day, how
well they haue done it; or at least amongst some of them
where there are many. This account will inforce all, both
Vsher and schollars, to a very heedefull care. It may bee

an Vsher, yet your number is so many, as you
are not able to goe thorough them all, in that sort

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>My helpes are of two sorts; generall or particular.
My generall helpes which are common to all schooles, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
where there are Vshers, are these:</p>
                  <p>1. That which was noted amongst the generall obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;<note place="margin">1. Helpe in Schooles, few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the fourmes.</note>
to haue all my schoole sorted into fourmes or <hi>Classes,</hi>
and those so few as may be: though twenty in a fourme or
moe, the better, as was sayd; and my fourmes diuided into
equall parts. This shall gaine one halfe of time, for the
reasons there mentioned.</p>
                  <p>2. In euery fourme this may bee a notable helpe,<note place="margin">2. Seniors in each fourme.</note> that
the two or fowre seniors in each fourme, be as Vshers in
that fourme, for ouerseeing, directing, examining, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the rest euery way before they come to say; and so for
ouerseeing the exercises.</p>
                  <p>Also in straights of time, to stand forth before the rest,
and to heare them. The Master to haue an eie and see care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
that they deale faithfully, and make some short exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:6954:152"/>
after. And in all lectures those two Seniors to be
blamed principally for the negligence of their sides, and
contrarily to be commended for their diligence. This may
bee a second and a very great helpe: like as it is in an army,
where they haue their vnder-officers for hundreths or for
tennes; as <hi>Decuriones, Centuriones, &amp;c.</hi> for the speciall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of all vnder them. These who thus take most
paines with the rest, shall stil euer keep to be the best of the
fourmes.</p>
                  <p>A third might be added:<note place="margin">3. Authority.</note> which is Authority and good
Gouernment, which indeed is aboue all. But of that it will
be fitter to speake by it selfe.</p>
                  <p>The particular help where either an Vsher is wanting,<note place="margin">Particular help.</note> or
else is not sufficient,<note place="margin">Subdoctor in place of the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher, or where the Vsher is not sufficient.</note> is by a Subdoctor, one or mo, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the number of the schollars. The Subdoctor is to
be appointed out of all your highest fourmes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euery one to
be his day insteed of an Vsher, to do those things which the
Vsher should, according to their abilities; and so to obserue
the behauior of all vnder them.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Spoud.</speaker>
                  <p>These cannot but bee very worthy helpes. But
here I pray you resolue me a doubt or two, arising hereon.</p>
                  <p>1. How will you diuide your schoole thus, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
your fourmes, for the appointing of your Seniors, that
euery one in a fourm may be placed according to his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
which I take to be very necessary; so as they shall not
thinke, that any are preferred by the fauour of the Master:
also that all may sit as Aduersaries and fit matches, and so
to haue sides equally diuided, to doe all by that emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and honest strift and contention, which you spake of.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>For my fourmes I would put so many in a fourm,<note place="margin">Sorting the fourmes so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny together as may be.</note>
as possibly can goe together, as was noted: the better will
be continuall helpers to the other, and much drawe on the
worse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the diuision of my fourms, and election
of Seniors, I finde this the only way to cut off all quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and to prouoke all to a continuall contention;</p>
                  <p>1. By voices; all of a fourme to name who is the best
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:6954:153"/>
of their fourme,<note place="margin">Choise &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching each fourme.</note> and so who is the best next him. Those
who haue the most voices, to bee the two Seniours of the
fourme. These they will choose very certainly. Then to
the ende to make equall sides; let the second or Iunior of
those two so chosen, call vnto himselfe the best which hee
can, to make his side.</p>
                  <p>After that, let the first choose the best next; then after,
the second and his fellow, to choose the best next to them
again: And thus to go thorough choosing vntil they haue
chosen all the fourme. The two Seniours, I say, to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
by electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the whole fourm: then they two to choose,
or call the rest of the fourm by equall election; the Iunior
choosing first and so to go by course: If the Senior should
choose first, then his side would euer be the better; which
by the Iunior choosing first is preuented.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes you shall find that they will choose very
equally,<note place="margin">☞</note> and without partialitie,<note place="margin">Benefits of this election.</note> to the end that each may
haue the best fellowes; euen as gamesters will do at mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in shooting, bowling or the like: and euery match shal
be very equall, or small difference amongst them.</p>
                  <p>Also hereby all mutterings shall be cut off, wherby some
kind boyes will bee whispering to their Parents, that their
Master doth not regard no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> loue them, but preferres others
before them. Thus also the painefull shall be incouraged,
when they find themselues preferred by the iudgement of
all their fellowes; and each made to striue daily to bee as
good as his match or aduersary, and for the credite of their
side: and finally, they wil labor that they may be preferred
at the next election; or at least, not bee put downe with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.
This election would be made oftener amongst the
younger, as once in a moneth at least; because their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and quicknesse will much alter: Amongst the Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
fourmes once in a quarter may suffice; yet at the Masters
discretion.</p>

To the end, that out of the schooles, and from the

that which it feares so much, forgets that which it should
wholly intend; whereby in timorous natures, you shall see
some to stand as very sottes, and senselesse through an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of some extreame euil, or by extremity of feare;
wheras they are otherwise as wise &amp; learned as the best. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as all deuices are to be vsed to rid children of that
kinde of ouerwhelming feare; and sometimes correction
for it, when this feare is without cause, and cannot be helped
otherwise.</p>

this loue is well knowne to be the most effectuall meanes,
to increase and nourish learning in them the fastest; and also
that gouernement which consists in loue, is euer the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest.</p>
                  <p>Now this extreame whipping, all men know what a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
it breedeth in the children, both of the schoole, and of
all learning as that they will think themselues very happy,
if the parents will set them to any seruille or toyling busines,
so that they may keepe from schoole. And also it workes
in them a secret hatred of their Masters; according to the

milde and louing gouernement, they shall both haue the
hearts &amp; commendations of the children presently, when
they see in the Masters the affections of fathers towards
them; and also they will euer keepe a sweet and thankefull
remembrance of them, all their life long: that euer when
they haue occasion to speake of their Schoolemasters, they
will doe it with reuerence, and praise God that euer they
fell into the hands of such Masters: whereas of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

after when they come at their owne liberty, they will
then report as they haue found, and it may be farre worse.
So that they can neuer speake of their Master, but as of a
thing which they abhorre: his name is as a curse in their
mouthes; many wishing they had neuer knowne him. For
that then they had beene schollars, if they had not falne
into the hands of so cruell Masters.</p>

And then let those two of them foure, who answered best
(that is, one of either fourm who answered most questions)
bee the victours for that Quarter. Two other of their

to keepe them euer in a holy awe by the feare of it. Yea,

in the anger of Moses &amp; Phineas, so that we te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per it in such

out to reuiling, fretting, chafing, blowes on the head, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to any cruell or vnmercifull dealing with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

                  <p>Now the helpes of repressing this our anger,<note place="margin">Meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse furious and raging an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> are the wise
consideration of those things which I haue mentioned, or
the like. As to keep a continuall memory, whose the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are; what they are; for whom we bring them vp; vnder
whom and in whose place; whether we would haue God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
at vs, &amp; to smite vs, as we do the children, for euery fault
which wee do: how we would haue our owne children dealt
withall: and also Gods iustice to measure to vs or ours, with
what measure we mete to others. Besides, to remember, that
anger will blinde our mindes, that we cannot see to correct
or vse any right moderation.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, to haue euer in mind, the mischiefes that
come of anger; how it will diminish our authority, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
vs extremelie in the eyes of the children, when it is
immoderate, and without iust cause. Also that in our anger,
we may do that euill in a moment, which we shall repent all
our liues long. And the rather, because Sathan watcheth to
get aduantage against vs, to bring vs to some notable euils
in our anger. Into whose hand, it is iust with God to leaue
vs, because we would not watch ouer this passion to keepe
it in temper; when we know that of all other our affections
we mostly open to his malice in this, by reason of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall

                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:6954:162"/>
Therefore to conclude this point, as wee are to vse all
wisdome to preuent these euills; so principally, a constant
course in obseruing all orders, shall preuaile maruellously,
by cutting off most occasions of anger.</p>
                  <p>And finally, when all other meanes faile of conquering

to wit, his heauenly word and praier. To this end
it shall bee necessary, to haue euer in minde, some speciall
places of holie scripture against anger; as these and the
like:</p>

                  <p>Be not of a hastie spirit, to be angrie: for anger resteth
in the bosome of fooles.</p>
                  <p>The angry man is said to exalt folly, to set vp his folly to

                  <p>In a word, that seuere denuntiation of our Sauior for this
vndiscreete anger, breaking out into euill speeches, may
humble vs continually and make vs afraide of this sinne:</p>
                  <p>That whosoeuer is angry with his brother vnaduisedly,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 22</note>

                  <p>By all which words it is most euident, that our vndis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete
and hastie anger which ouertakes vs too oft in our

                  <p>If we will striue earnestly, according to the former

cut off those occasions, and come to this good gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so farre as the Lord shall be well pleased with vs; and

rodde or ferula alwayes in our hands, if we be of hastie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">The danger of hauing the rod of ferula euer in our hand.</note>
I take it to be, as for a furious man to carie euer a

time, when wee will bee sory for it after, if it fall not
out worse. For these lighter faults, proceeding from
lacke of time, yeares, capacity, discretion, or the like,
would rather be corrected by words, and reformed louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then by this continuall whipping and striking: neyther

                  <p>But I account this farre the best, for a Schoolemaster by
his graue and wise carriage,<note place="margin">For the surest, to haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but grauity and authority.</note> and his faithfulnesse in his

to keepe all in a submisse obedience; and that he may
vse the rodde very sparingly, but onely in greater faults,
and on the principall offenders for example and terrour.
This shall be a fatherly and worthy gouernement indeede,
when the children thus obey of conscience; striuing who
shall be the best, and each way most dutifull. And thus in
a short time, when your Schollars are so inured to your

finde that very seldome correction will serue.</p>

will be, vnlesse he or some other of authority be amongst

                  <p>But it is hard for the little children to rise so early,
and in some families all lie long: how would you haue
them come so soone then? You would not haue them bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                  <p>That I take farre too great seuerity, and whereby
many a poore childe is driuen into wonderfull feare, and
eyther to play the truant, or make some deuice to leaue the
schoole; at least to come with a marueilous ill will, and oft
to be dragged to the Schoole, to the reproach of the Master
and the Schoole.</p>
                  <p>The best meanes that euer I could finde to make them
to rise early,<note place="margin">How to make all children to striue who shall be first at schoole without any correction.</note> to preuent all this feare of whipping, is this; by
letting the little ones to haue their places in their fourmes
daily, according to their comming after sixe of the clock:
so many as are there at sixe, to haue their places as they had
them by election or the day before: all who come after six,
euery one to sit as he commeth, and so to continue that
day, and vntill he recouer his place againe by the election
of the fourme or otherwise. Thus deale with them at all
times, after euery intermission, when they are to be in their

them to feare comming to the Schoole.<note place="margin">Intermission at nine and three for a quarter of an houre, or more.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The higher Schollars must of necessity rest to doe their

the knocking of the dore, or some other signe giuen by the

                     </gap> to continue vntill three, or halfe an houre after:
then to haue another quarter of an houre or more, as at
nine for drinking and necessities; so to continue till halfe
an houre after fiue: thereby in that halfe houre to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruaile
the time at three; then to end so as was shewed, with
reading a peece of a Chapter, and with singing two staues
of a Psalme: lastly, with prayer to be vsed by the Master.</p>
                  <p>For the Psalmes, euery schollar should begin to giue the
Psalme and the tune in order,<note place="margin">To sing part of a Psalme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore breaking vp at night; and each to begin in order and giue the tune.</note> and to reade euery verse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>The benefits of such intermissions<note place="margin">Benefits of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termissions.</note> will be found very
great, and to preuent many inconueniences.</p>
                  <p>1 By this meanes neyther Masters nor Schollars shall
bee ouer-toyled,<note place="margin">1 None ouer-toyled, but wits euer fresh.</note> but haue fit times of refreshing. For
there is none (no not almost of the least) but being vsed
to it a while, they will sitte very well in their places,
for two houres together,<note place="margin">The least will soone learne to sit two houres together.</note> or two houres and a halfe;
without any wearinesse or necessity, obseruing duely those
times.</p>
                  <p>2 By this meanes also the Schollars may bee kept e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
in their places, and hard to their labours, without that
running out to the Campo (as the tearme it) at schoole
times,<note place="margin">2 Kept euer in their places at schoole time.</note> and the manifolde disorders thereof; as watching
and striuing for the clubbe, and loytering then in the fields,
some hindred that they cannot go forth at all.</p>
                  <p>But hereby all may haue their free liberty in due time;
and none can abuse their liberty in that sort, nor haue their
minds drawne away, nor stirre abroad all the day at schoole
times: except vpon some vrgent necessity, to be signified
to the Master or Vsher; and so leaue to be gotten priuately,
to returne presently againe. And also in those cases to lose
their places for that day, vnlesse the case be approued very
necessary and sure; to the end to cut off occasions<note place="margin">Leaue to be graunted vpon vrgent occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons besides.</note> from such
as will pretend necessities. If any one be catched abusing
his Master or his liberty, without necessity onely, vpon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of idlenesse or play, he is to be corrected sharpely, for
ensample. By this meanes you shall bring them to that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and obedience in a short time as they will not thinke of
stirring all the day, but at their times appointed, or vpon
very vrgent and almost extraordinary necessity.</p>
                  <p>3 Besides these benefits,<note place="margin">3 The time may be gained daily, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> this will also gaine so
much time euery day, as is lost in those intermissions;
because there is no day but they will all looke for so much
time or more, to the Campo: especially the shrewdest
boyes, who vse to waite for the club, and watch their times;
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:6954:166"/>
these will be sure to haue much more then that. Besides all
the time which they lose in wayting for that idle fit; and
that they will, if they can, be away at Lectures, and shewing
exercises: and likewise they will exceedingly trouble the
Master in asking three or foure sometimes together, what
businesse soeuer he be about.</p>

those of that booke there are some tolerable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
if good choise be made.</p>
                  <p>This exercise may well goe before play: for it is nothing
but a pleasant schoole recreation, &amp; will exceedingly whet
on the schollars to an ingenuous contention.</p>
                  <p>All recreations and sports of schollars,<note place="margin">Manner of their recreations.</note> would be meet for
Gentleman. Clownish sports, or perilous, or yet playing
for money, are no way to be admitted.</p>
                  <p>The recreations of the studious are as well to be looked
vnto,<note place="margin">The recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the studious to be regarded.</note> as the study of the rest: That none take hurt by his
study, either for minde or bodie, or any waie else.</p>
                  <p>Yet here of the other side,<note place="margin">Ouer much play to be carefully auoided.</note> very great care is to be had, in
the moderating of their recreation. For schooles, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
doe not take more hinderance by any one thing, then
by ouer-often leaue to play. Experience teacheth, that this
draweth their mindes vtterly away from their bookes, that
that they cannot take paines, for longing after plaie, and
talking of it; as also deuising meanes to procure others to
get leaue to play: so that ordinarily when they are but in
hope thereof, they will doe things very negligently; and
after the most play they are euermore farre the worst.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:6954:167"/>
And contrarily, when they are most holden to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
looking for any play, in such a course, as wherein they
may take delight, and goe on with ease; then will they do
farre the best, without any daunger of taking hurt thereby;
for that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their learning is for most part as a play to them
who are ingenuous.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Masters are to vse great wisdom in auoiding
this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and answering with mildnesse, all those who are euer
importunate in asking leaue.</p>
                  <p>And whereas such suiters are wont to be instant thus,
That the Schollars will learne the better after; we may say

                     </gap> the worse after. Also, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they think that they do them good; they do both them,
their friends and the schoole very great hurt, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
mentioned. It is continuall applying which brings
learning, and the credit of a schoole. And for this cause it
were not amisse, nor inconuenient (neither for the schoole,
nor the Master himselfe who hath a regard of the profiting
of his schollars) if in such places where both Master and
schollars are hindred hereby that there were some statute
for the helpe of the Master, that he could not giue leaue of
himselfe aboue once in the weeke, without consent of the
Minister, or some man of authority in the towne; vnlesse
very seldome, and vnto some chiefe parties to be yeelded
vnto of necessity, in regard of some speciall dignity or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.</p>

                  <p>ALthough I haue been troubled by that diuersitie,
yet much more by the absence of many of my
schollars,<note place="margin">Euils by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</note> when some of them are away, two or
three dayes in a weeke, and sometimes happely a

and yet the Parents will expect, that they should profit as
much as if they were there daily, and as if they had al neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

                  <p>Also they will bee ready to raile vpon me that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
do no good: whereby both my selfe and my schoole
are much traduced; when the fault is wholly in themselues
or principally, neither can I tell how to helpe it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>I knowe this to bee a common grieuance. The
best waie to redresse it, is this, so farre as I know:</p>
                  <p>1. Parents are to bee admonished, either to keepe their
children to schoole daily, or to keep them away continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For by such absence, though it bee but now and then,
the mindes of the best and most studious will bee much
drawen away, or they discouraged, and made vnable to go
with their fellowes.</p>
                  <p>Other their fellowes also, are often much hindred for
them; Schooles and Masters discredited by them: Besides
that in their absence they commonly learne much euill;

                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:6954:168"/>
Therefore this would bee looked vnto specially,<note place="margin">How redressed.</note> to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided
so much as may be: And order to be taken by the
gouernours and ouerseers of schooles, that all such should
be sent home againe, who are kept awaie aboue a certaine
number of daies; as thirteene in a Quarter (as the statute is
in some schooles) or a like number: vnlesse in case of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or such necessary occasion to be approued by the
Master or ouerseers.</p>
                  <p>Those most seldome absences, to be punished by losse
of their places, and correction too, if the fault be found to
be any way in themselues; or at least to sit still on the play
daies to learne when their fellowes plaie, to recouer that
time againe, and to make them more carefull to come;
or by all these meanes together. This will make the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

Others who haue no priuiledge in the place, will giue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or nothing, in regarde of my paines, or to my meete
maintenance, according to my place, to incourage mee to
take paines: and besides, they will run behind with me two

take away their children, to set them to other schooles, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some quarrell that their children did not profit, or the

labours from God, where the world is vnthankfull. But for
the help of this, my aduise is, that first we labour to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in our places, in the best courses and kindes; chiefly to
make our schollars good Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marians: and then we may be
bold to cause them who are of abilitie to paie accordingly
in some sort, for the instruction of their children. They
will better esteem the worth of learning, and of the seruice
we performe to them (in those in whom they are to liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their time) and also to the Church &amp; Common-wealth.
And if God doe blesse vs, that our schollars profit indeede,
we shall in time haue schollars enow; such as will be willing
to pay well, how basely soeuer learning be esteemed of.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, to preuent all such shifting and detraction,
it is wisdom euer to cal for our due at the Quarters end; and

in euery part. But yet, that I may both returne vnto

to the end: I pray you let me haue your iudgement in these
two points:</p>
                  <p>1. What children you would haue set to learning, and

                  </p>
                  <p>To the first: I would haue those who after good time of

                  <p>Finally, all generally of whom I can heare in the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
doe assent hereunto. Many would haue them 17. or

and namely sound Grammarians, that the Tutors
need not to be troubled with teaching them to make or to

or other studies meet for the Vniuersitie. For such a schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
as is able to vnderstand well what hee reades, or what is
read vnto him there (I meane in regard of the Latine) shall
doe more good in a yeere, then a weak schollar shall do
in two or three; chiefly, if hee haue discretion to gouerne
himselfe, and abide close to his booke.</p>
                  <p>For when as the schollar is faine to turne his Dictionary

for euery word, or hearing a Lecture read doth come away
as he went; vnlesse he be placed vnder a most painefull Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
how is it possible that he should profite any thing, in
