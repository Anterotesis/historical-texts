         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

NARRATIVE
OF
A Gent. of Grays Inn,
Relating to
Mr. Turbervill's Laſt NARRATIVE
Concerning the
<hi>Horrid Popiſh-Plot,</hi>

               <q>Parce PUER Stimulis, &amp; fortius utere Loris:</q>
               <bibl>Ovid.</bibl>
            </epigraph>
            <p>'TIs a piece of Jeſuitiſm to do
evil that good may come
thereof, but it is the duty of
every good Chriſtian to do
good for evil: To tell a Lie politickly
to clear a man's ſelf, is an evil of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a ready way to
prove a man a Jeſuit; But if that falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
is deſigned for the ruine of our
Neighbour, it carries a more ugly aſpect,
and is a poſitive contradiction to the
purity of that Doctrine which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us, <hi>To render good for evil, and
to love our Neighbours as our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot therefore, when I ſee a Lord
beheaded, or a Traytor hanged, refrain
from pity, or with-hold my Prayers, and
I am not of the humour of the rabble, to
inſult and glory in anothers miſery, I
know that it is an argument of a villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
diſpoſition to tyrannize and abuſe
thoſe wretched ruines, which are under
the mercy of the Law, whoſe ſeverity is
bitter enough without aggravation: A
noble mind; doth (out of native good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
ſhew a kind of ſweetneſs in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
which, if not the man, doth
pity his misfortune, but never doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
his ſorrow, by baſer uſage than
doth become his Juſtice.</p>
            <p>In the Title-page of a late Narrative,
which bears the Name of Mr. <hi>Turbervill,</hi>
here are theſe words; <hi>An Account of the
Gentleman of</hi> Grays-Inn, <hi>who appeared
in Court before the Lord High-Steward to
invalidate Mr.</hi> Turbervill<hi>'s Evidence,</hi>
which words are the Prologue to an after

Tragedy, of the ſaid Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's

take it, there is ſome difference betwixt
ſummoning upon a Deſign to invalidate,
and appearing upon a Deſign to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,

that I am abuſed.</p>
            <p>'Tis not the leaſt of our happineſs, as
<hi>Engliſh</hi>-men, that every man is allowed
(by the wholſom Laws of this Kingdom)
the liberty of being heard, before he can
be legally condemned: I therefore, as
my Birthright, claim that Freedom, and
humbly begg of all the World, eſpecially
all good Proteſtants, not to wreſt or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force,
the plain meaning of this my juſt
and abſolutely neceſſary vindication of
my ſelf, to deviate from its true Deſign,
to the ſervice of Malice or Popery.</p>
            <p>And I do ſincerely profeſs, That I do
not here intend to detract from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi>'s Teſtimony; but if
any thing herein ſhall efface the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
uglineſs of that Character he is
pleaſed to give me, and falſifie what he
ſays in my particular, I humbly beg that
it may not be conſtrued to invalidtae his
Evidenc; What his Narratiue ſpeaks in
relation to the truth of that, does not
concern me further, than that I am a
Proteſtant, and highly obliged to himſelf
and all the reſt of thoſe worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who (by their timely Diſcoveries)
have been bleſſed Inſtruments in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of our Lives, Religion and
Government.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> is pleaſed to ſay, <hi>That
without doubt I had large promiſes from
the Popiſh party, which I thought would be
prevalent:</hi> 'Tis beyond a <hi>Petitio principii,</hi>
and ſome ſort of Preſumption in him, to
determine what I thought, Heaven has
reſerved that as the peculiar buſineſs of his
own Omniſcience: And whether it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to be right gueſs'd, or not, I muſt
leave to the judgments of ſuch as know
me better, however, it is an uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtabbing cenſure. The Evidence I
gave was about a Diſcourſe that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
betwixt Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> and me,
which you may ſee in the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s
Tryal, page 121. I am not here about
to vindicate the Truth of my Teſtimony,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95124:2"/>
I leave that to the World, to believe as
they pleaſe. It's ſtrange to me that Mr.
<hi>Turbervill</hi> ſhould imagine that I was bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to give that Evidence, which I muſt
needs know (being a Barriſter at Law)
would be improper for the Priſoner's
purpoſe: Or that if I had been bribed, I
preſume no man will believe but that the
<hi>Roman</hi> party would have made a better
bargain, than for me to declare an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
Evidence.</p>
            <p>But yet I do ſay, That if what I ſpoke
had greater weight than I believe it had,
and was received by every Body as an
undoubted Truth, even that could not
abate the due credit of Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi>'s
Evidence; for if he was (as I believe)
a Papiſt at that time, when he ſpoke to
me, it was then his Principle to conceal
any thing that might tend to a Diſcovery
of their <hi>Helliſh</hi> Plot: And now, good
Mr. <hi>Turbervill,</hi> why ſo angry?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Impetit animum, nec poteſt cernere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would faign know how my Wifes
Fortune concerns his Credit? What he
now means by ſmall or great? And why
he ſeems to ſummon me to an account, by
ſaying that the ſame is now almoſt ſpent?
O impertinent inſulting Tyranny! 'twill
be good to remember,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Altius evexit quam te Fortuna, Ruinam</l>
               <l>Majorem timeas.—</l>
               <bibl>Juven</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>Too great a care improperly expreſt,
doth often loſe the cauſe it ſtrives to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>But that Mr: <hi>Turbervill</hi> ſhould know,
(and make it as part of an undoubted
Truth, in his Narrative,) that I was
firſt called to the Bar, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
upon the credit of that, married
a Wife, ſeems wonderful to me; and in
that, I may ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is more than Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient;
for he knows that, and declares
it as a poſitive Truth, which really ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was, (as I believe, for I dare not be
poſitive, ſince he affirms the contrary.)
I take it chst I was firſt married in <hi>April,</hi>
and afterwards called to the Bar in <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity-Term</hi>
1679. Perhaps <hi>Trinity-Tirm</hi>
might be before <hi>April!</hi> who can tell?
No, no, there is ſomething in this more
than I underſtaud, 'tis a kind of a charm
upon my intellects, and (I may ſay)
that I am almoſt brwitched not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
my own ſenſes, and yet I do not
hold the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe I had been married upon
the credit of my being called to the Bar,
what is that to his purpoſe? or how
does it ſtrengthen his or weaken my
Evidence? The Long Robe is no mean
Foundation to build a good Fortune on.</p>
            <p>Had my condition ever been as cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous
as Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> would make the

endeavours are not now wanting to

me to the hatred and fury of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
And I need not fear (the more's

manner to the rabble. Temptations are
the Works of the Devil; And if at any
time he aſſaulted me, ſo as to draw me
in to be guilty of my own murder, I
heartily thank Almighty God for his
Grace, that I am ſtill living, and do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thee Satan.</p>
            <p>I was never yet guilty of any ſort of
<hi>TREASONS, Murders, Felonies,
Perjuries, Forgeries,</hi> &amp;c. So that if I
was once poor, I kept my ſelf honeſt.
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, <hi>That a man's
poverty is no objection againſt
his honeſty:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>L.</hi> Stafford<hi>'s Tryal, p.</hi> 130.</note> And when, not
very long ago, I ſaw Mr. <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervill</hi>
in a low condition (as I thought)
I pityed him, and would now fain know
how he comes to daſh Poverty in the
Teeth of Evidence? If a man (as he ſays)
would do much to gratifie a perſon that
had preſerved him from ſtarving, I do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believe he would do much more to
keep himſelf from ſtarving: But that a
man ought to perjure himſelf, on a point
of Gratitude, or upon any other account
whatſoever, I thank God is none of my
principle, nor indeed had I ever any
temptation that way; which I proteſt
to be true upon my hopes of Salvation.</p>
            <p>What Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> deſigns to do with
me I cannot tell, he renders me a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled,
and in that a Beaſt; (as far as
in him lies) yet when I think on God's
providence, in my preſervation, againſt
the hatred of froward men, I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
