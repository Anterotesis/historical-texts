         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from the Spirit of the Lord; Sent
unto the whole Flock of God, now in this
their day of Tryal, and hour of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp;c.</head>
            <p>DEar Friends and Brethren, who have been called to believe
by the Holy Calling of the Lord unto Sanctification and
Holiness, that ye might inherit the Promises of God, and
and that your souls might live in the land of the living,
and partake of his goodness; that you might admire him, and praise
his name for ever: And seeing the Lord out of his rich Love and
Mercy hath visited you, who sometime sate in the Region of the
shadow of death, and were cast out of his presence in the time of
Unbelief, seeing he hath caused his Miraculous Light to shine upon
you, in his gracious Visitation of you; and hath given you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in his name, prise his love unto you: and let not his gracious
Benefits slip out of your mindes, least your hearts be filled with
other things that will corrupt your hearts, and make you an unmeet
habitation for the Lord to dwell in and among. Dear friends hear
my Brotherly Admonition and Exhortation, for the Lord moved
in my heart to write unto you, and in the bowels of his kind and
tender Love, and motion of his Heavenly Spirit, to stir up your
pure Minds and Consciences unto stedfastnes in the faith of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and so much the more that you all be watchful, seeing
the times be perillous, for now the Adversary goes about Roaring
and Ravening, on the right hand and on the left, to destroy and
devour that which God hath brought forth-in-you, that so he might
re-gain you too under his power and government; and that ye
might revolt from the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, that stands
in Power and Righteousness, which is come and hath been of a
truth manifest in great glory, and this is an hour the power of
darkness is let loose to try the faith of them that dwell upon the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99803:3"/>
earth, and he is let loose for a season (Blessed are they that hide
themselves under the shadow of the Almighty, and under the wings
of Christ Jesus, who is given for a Redeemer, a Saviour, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
of men) that the wicked one touch them not; and now the
Devil Rages because he knows his Kingdom is but short, and but for
a small time is like to stand in many, because a stronger then he that
rules in the world, is come, and hath began to dispossess the strong
man, and bind him, and cast him out; and now he Rages and stirs
up all the temptations within and without, and all his Instruments
to joyn with him, to make war for him, that he might not Rule who
is the Heir of all things, and given for a Leader, and to be the
Head of the Body his Church, in which alone he hath right to Rule,
because the Lord of the whole earth, ye of Heaven and earth, hath
put all power into his hands, to bind and to loose, to bring out of
Captivity, and to lead Captivity Captive, that life and Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
might again inhabit in the sons of men, that truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
might sway, that mercy and love might sit on the Throne,
that his salvation might take hold on the ends of the earth, and his
power made known from Sea to Sea, that all that wait for him, and
love his appearance now when he is made manifest, might rejoice in
his goodness and life, and may be made glad as <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Neptha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> in the days of old, upon whom sprang up a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
light, that the whole earth might be filled with his praise
and glory, that hath been filled with darkness, violence, and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in the time of the Devil and Antichrists Reign, which hath been
long and great in the earth: So that the hearts of the sons of men
have been corrupted, and they are gone backward from the Lord,
and have been degenerated into a strange nature, and hath brought
forth evil and corrupt fruit, like that of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and they that do
evil are not at all ashamed, neither do they blush, but are become
Impudent, through the long custom of evil, and hard and Impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable,
upon whom the hammer of the Lord must come, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
be poured forth: But you whom God hath called out of
this estate into a state of Redemption and purity, by his Son the
light of the world, who hath Illuminated the eyes of your minds,
Consciences and Understandings, that you might bear witness unto
him that is true, a testimony against the world that lies in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and pleads for it, and lives in it, as though it were the way
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99803:3"/>
to felicity, hold fast your liberty, hold fast your faith, hold fast your
hope, hold fast your testimony, let none take your Crown, and so
much the more, as you are compassed with temptations, and the
times be perrillous so much the more, you had all need to keep near
the Lord, for now Father would betray the Son, and the Son the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
the Mother her daughter, and the daughter her Mother, and
Brother, and Kinsfolks betray one another, and them that exercise
authority would bertray who are not in the power of God, and
through flattery and threats and fair promises, and frowns, and gifts,
&amp; rewards, &amp; ease, and liberty, and the glory of the world, and what
not to lead your hearts away from the Lord, and then glory over
you, and rejoyce that your feet should slip and you fall into the mire
and dirt, and gross abominations, and pollutions of the world, that
lyes in wickedness, dearly beloved never heed none of these things,
let not the Philisti<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

for then they would make you grind like <hi>Samson</hi> &amp; you might perish
in the drought for lack of moisture, and then your dayes would be
miserable, and your years full of sorrow, for the Lord will perform
his promise, and keep Covenant with them, that keep covenant
with him, but if you forsake him in your hearts, in what is made
manifest, then he will forsake you, and then you are left to
the mercy of your adversary which will be cruel. Therefore heed
not the pride, of <hi>Moab</hi> nor the reviling of the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> for
they are uncircumcised in heart, and the moath shall eat them up as
a garment: oh if any draw back from following of the lamb, through
suffering they will be smitten, and the Lord will have no pleasure
in them, and what will <hi>Amaleck</hi> say, when Israel turnes their backs
in the day of Battel, but where is their God, in whom they trusted,
and he that brought them forth was not able to deliver them to the
end, oh that such things may never be spoken of now in <hi>Gath,</hi> or
<hi>Ashkelon</hi> as in the days of old, lest the Sons of the <hi>Philistines</hi> triumph,
&amp; the Daughters thereof rejoyce in their wickedness, &amp; this would
make the hearts of Israel of God to mourn, this is the day of the

and his followers be not Carnal but Spiritual, and there is none

out, and is resolved to continue with him in his sufferings, but will
shake off these things that incumber, last he should not obtain the

victory, and come short of the promise, and the victory, and crown,
which all that endure hardship unto the end shall receive; oh dear
friends look above all visible things, and stand out of them all, and
loose from them, that the enemy do not ensnare you; <hi>What is not
the earth the Lords and the fulness thereof?</hi> and hath he not given the
utmost part of the Earth for a possession unto his Son? What was
not <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father blessed, when he was faithful and obeyed
the voice of the Lord, and went out of his own Country he knew

death of the Cross and the contradiction of sinners, and condemned
by the most? did not the believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> who were banished,
wander in sheep skins and goat skins, in holes, dens, and caves of
the Earth for the hope they held, and the Country they looked for?
did not <hi>Moses</hi> through faith forsake <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court and became a
Companion of poor brick-makers in captivity, a cloud of witnesses
might be brought, even of them who died in the faith and yet were
not made partakers of the promises, who many of them saw not
what you have seen, nor hear those things that you have heard, nor
injoyed that which God hath made many partakers of; and have
we not a great cloud of witnesses in this our own Age, some who
have not loved their lives unto the death for the testimony they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
believed, and held fast to the end unto death; hath not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
died in prison with hard usage, hath not some been hanged and
died a shameful death, and finished their course with Joy and Peace,
have not many endured great, hard, and long Imprisonment for
years, and are they yet weary; nay, have not many suffered great
spoil of their Goods, and have not they a reward seven fold into
their bosom. Oh let the consideration of these things dwell upon
your hearts, and provoke you unto suffering, and long-suffering
with joyfulness, that in the midst of all Tribulations as it abounds
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99803:4"/>
you may feel according to the promise of God your joy much more

the heard of swine in o the sea of common pollution must perish
there, and indeed there is no place for halting, if God be God follow
him, and if <hi>Baal</hi> be he go after him; and therefore let none draw
you aside from that you are perswaded of in your consciences by
the Spirit of the Lord, neither to joyn with that you know he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alows,
and in the obedience you will have peace and joy; look not
at them that draws back, for they go to perdition, but rather after
them that continues faithful, that shall receive honour, and glory,
immortality and everlasting life, in the fresh heavenly power of
God meet together and worship him as at other times, though the

refreshed, and comforted, and edified; and let none perswade you

see the deceits of the subtile serpent, and the empty dead formes
and inventions of men, which have been set up in the night of
darkness and Apostacy, which have been over people of all sorts in
that part of the world called Christendom, since the days of the
Apostles of Christ and not onely so, but by the vertue of the same
light shining in your hearts, he hath revealed and manifested the
great and deep things concerning his kingdom, and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and glorious excellency of his house, and of those things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
unto life and peace, the sight whereof hath kindled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
the hearts of many with holy desires after the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that glory, life, and peace, which in the light is set before
them, and true breathings and strong cryes hath passed through
many to him, who hath power to dispose of this kingdom, crying
Lord what shall we do that we may be heires of thy kingdom, and
the Lord hath hearkned and heard the cryes of such as have drawn
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99803:6"/>
near unto him in nakedness and humility of heart, and by his
light hath shewed them those things which are evil, which they
ought to refrain; and also those things which are pure and good,
which they ought to imbrace, and as many as in the light have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him to them he hath given power, not only to resist the evil
in all its appearances, but also to embrace and obey the good in
its appearing within. Thus the Lord begun his work even his
great work of Reformation in us, making a separation between
the precious and the vile, laying the axe unto the very root of the
evil tree, and by it cut down sin and iniquity within: which all
profession without could never do, and as you and we did sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
feel and know the Lords power revealed within, making a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
there the same power did lead and draw us to a separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without from sin and all sinful persons, so that we could not
pertake, (nor joyn) with them in any bad thing, nor go with
them to the same excess of Riot, and foolish vain pleasure, which
wicked men that know not God delight in, and as we were drawn
out of the worlds wicked ways, into holiness and Righteousness,
to follow Christ our Saviour in the way that he walked in, oh
then how did the enemy rage, and appear as a flood to swallow us
up, and stirred up his instruments to Scoff, Scorn, Revile, Stone,
Beat, and persecute us, and through a great fight of afflictions we
passed, through all which the Lord led the faithful and put a stop
to the raging sea dividing of it, and brought his children safely
thorow. Thus hath it been with us, in all our travells since we
were called out of Egypts dark Land, the enemy hath been very
busie going about like a roaring Lyon, seeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure,
which is no new nor strange thing, for from the dayes of
righteous <hi>Abel</hi> unto this day and age wherein we now live, the
righteous holy people have suffered and been persecuted by the
wicked and ungodly, as the Scriptures of truth and other ancient
ecclesiastical writings do declare, oh what cruel mockings, stonings
and many deep exercises, and great persecutions did gods people
Endure in every age and generation, through which the Lord led
them, and by his holy power revealed in them did uphold them,
and preserve them, and made all things easie unto them, so that
they were Conquerors, yea more then Conquerors through the
Lord Christ that loved them. And now dear hearts its the same
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99803:6"/>
hand and Arm of power that was stretched forth and revealed in
them, which preserved them, and gave them dominion and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that now is held forth and revealed in us, which is able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
defend and uphold us in the greatest tryalls and exercises
which we may meet withal or be exercised with for his names sake
And therefore am I moved and stirred up in Gods holy zeal by his
own pure Spirit, to admonish you in true brotherly love to hold
fast your profession and what ever you have received from God
through the son of his love, oh treasure it up in your
hearts, that you may have abundance of durable riches, which
none can take from you, for now is a day of great tryal, and the
devil rages because his time is but short, yea very short, for as sure
as God lives he shall be taken and all that joyn with him to uphold
his kingdom of pride and oppression, and they all shall be cast into
the burning lake that never shall be quenched there to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
for ever and ever, the day is dawned wherein the Lord
will accomplish and fulfil all these good things which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
by his holy Prophets in former times, and in this day pride
and oppression, cruelty, and persecution shall have an end, the
Lord hath said it, who is able to perform it, and the Righteous
shall be delivered from all their heavy yokes and oppressive bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and the Land shall be cleansed and swept, and evil-doers
shall have no place, but the holy people who have followed the
Lamb of God in the Regeneration, who have given up their all
into the will of God, and have not loved their lives unto the
death, they shall inherit the kingdom, and Christ over all shall
rule and Reign, and so the kingdoms of this world shall become
the kingdoms of our God and of his Christ, and this great work
shall not be effected and brought to pass by sword, or any weapon
of War by the Arm of flesh but onely and alone by the spirit and
power of the mighty God the great Jehovah who has all power in
his hand, who has power to set up and throw down at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
who is a consuming fire, and all the proud and those that do
wickedly, (though they may say well, and profess high things)
they shall be like unto the dryed stubble, and shall surely be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
root and branch. And I know assuredly by the testimony
of God in my heart, that the Lord is able even in a moment of
time to make all his enemies his footstool, for he who hath wrought
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99803:7"/>
mightily in our hearts by his spirit and power, wounding and
bruising the head of the serpent, and destroying the devil and his
works in us, as many can truly experience, he is the same unto all
that wait upon him, and can work the same work in every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
person in the whole world. Therefore all you deer friends
of truth, who have been quickned by the word of life, and raised
up unto a lively hope, who have made an open confession and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the holy name of the Lord be encouraged, and put on
strength even the streagth of God whereby you may stand against
all the assaults of the devil, and may also be enabled to bear and
suffer all things patiently, which for the name of Christ, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon you, be faithful to God in his requirings and do his
will, and you shall know more of his mind and doctrine, and as
you are faithful to God in the obedience of Righteousness, you
cannot be unfaithful to man for obedience to God, in the Light is
the ground of all faithfulness unto men, and so herein we stand
approved before the Lord, and in due time shall be manifest unto
the consciences of all men, though for a time we may be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and branded with foul names of heresie, error and sedition, as
the holy people formerly were, and though for a time we may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
let us bear it with patience without murmuring or contriving,
(or without the least desiring) the hurt of those who persetcute us,
for herein the spirit of christianity will appear, and shew forth it
self in us, and the Lord in due time even as the day approaches
will wipe away all these reproaches, and scandalous termes and
names which are cast on us, and we shall appear as we are cloathed
in the Lambs innnocency, meeknesse, and gentlenesse, and true
sincerity of heart, let every dear babe and Lamb of God keep
their habitations of innocency, and dwell under the shadow of the
wing, the arm of the Lord and there you shall be preserved. And
whereas some term us to be a stubborn and rebellious people that
is also false, for we cannot rebel against any man, neither King nor
any under him, for the ground of rebellion is disobedience to God
and rebellion against him by sinful deeds, for whosoever rebells
against the light of God in his own heart, will soon rebel against
the highest of men if he be provoked therunto &amp; have opertunity,
and though in words high things may be pretended, and flattering
titles given unto men, its all deceit and iniquity, and in the time
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99803:7"/>
of tryal it will manifest it self. But truth and the sincere lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of it can call nothing holy, but what is really so, neither
can they give the titles of pious, sacred and good to any man,
or people, who are not really holy and good, for that were
but flattery and deceit which God did ever: (and doth at this
day) abhor so let none of these things trouble you, but walk
in the light as Gods dear beloved and redeemed people for
their stands our union with God and one with another, and
mind the drawings of the fathers love which will more and
more draw you out of all Carnal fading visible things where no
lasting peace is, &amp; bring you home to the true peace and centre
of life, where fulness of joy is, and all spiritual blessings to refresh
you day by day, &amp; this is the priviledge of Gods suffering peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
at this day even their free access unto the throne of
grace, and free liberty to eat and drink at the Lords Table,
where there is bread of life that nourishes unto eternal life;
and where there is living water, that sweetly refreshes the thirsty
souls, oh come dear hearts eat and drink abundantly, that you
may be filled and abound that so you may communicate unto
others, that may be refreshed with you, and you with them in
the love of the Lord. And dear friends as it was the saints pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in former times to meet together in the holy name of the
Lord to wait upon God, and worship him in spirit and truth,
and as it hath been our practice, since we were acquainted with
the Lord to meet together likewise to wait upon God, and to
declare and speak of those great things which he hath done for
us, and wrought in us, accordingly as the good spirit of God
doth move in any, and give utterance, so dear friends keep
your Meetings in the name of God, for you well know that we
have no other end in our Meeting but to serve God, and to
turn people from the devil, and the service of sin unto God, that
they together with us may glorifie God, and serve him in the
new life of righteousnesse, and by this way and means many
have been convinced of the evil of their wayes, and also of the
deadnesse and emptinesse of mens invented Customary formes
and worships, and so have joyned and sate down with us in
stilnesse to wait upon God in spirit, to receive spiritual food and
refreshment to their souls. And this hath greatly troubled the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99803:8"/>
people, and Rulers of this Nation, and now they strive to put
a stop, and have made a law to hinder us in our Meetings, but
in this case knowing it to be our duty to God, and if neglected
we should provoke the Lord and kindle his anger against us, we
chuse rather to obey the Lord, though we provoke man, and
we chuse rather to suffer such punishments as can be inflicted
on us by man, being assured that God will be with us and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
us, and give us peace in our hearts and consciences in our
sufferings, which none can take from us, which if either for
fear of man, or love to this present world we should neglect,
and so provoke the Lord, we know that no man can give us
peace, or make an atonement for us; for we have known Gods
terrours for sin and disobedience, and have known his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
judgments revealed, and we know it is a fearful thing to
fall into the hands of the living God, who though he have
long patience, and waits to be gracious, yet he will not always
strive with man, but will suddenly come and render venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in flames of fire upon all that knows him not, and that
doth not obey the Gospel; who shall be be punished with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the
glory of his power, when he shall come to be glorified in his
Saints; therefore continue in his fear and love, and in true
and sincere obedience of the Gospel of peace unto the end,
even untill all your enemies be conquered, so shall you be
Crowned with life as you do overcome; but unlesse there be a
Conquest over Sin, Hell, and Death, yea and over that nature
which is unwilling to suffer there is no Crown, therefore its
said be faithful unto death, and thou shalt have the Crown of
life. Dear hearts mind these weighty things, and be faithful,
bold, and valiant for the truth, and great shall be your reward.
These things was I moved in the spirit of pure love to write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you by way of Remembrance to stir up your pure minds,
that you may go on with boldness and courage in the way of
the Lord which he hath called you into, with the tender

desiring and heartily praying that bowels of mercy, true love,
