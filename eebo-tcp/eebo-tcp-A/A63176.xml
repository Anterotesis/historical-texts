            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>My Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> the King being acquainted that you ſtand accuſed of High Treaſon, not by common Report or Hearſay, but by a Bill of Indictment found againſt you by Gentlemen of great Quality, and known Integrity within the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Palatine of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the place of your Reſidence, has thought it neceſſary in Tenderneſs to you, as well as Juſtice to himſelf, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you a ſpeedy Tryal.</p>
               <p>My Lord, if you know your ſelf innocent, in the name of God, do not deſpond, for you may be aſſured of a fair and patient hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in your proper time a free Liberty to make your full De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: and I am ſure you cannot but be well convinced, that my Noble Lords that are here your Peers to try you, will be as deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ready to acquit you, if you appear to be innocent, as they will to convict you if you be guilty.</p>
               <p>But, my Lord, if you are conſcious to your ſelf that you are guilty of this heinous Crime, give Glory to God, make amends to his Vicegerent the King by a plain and full diſcovery of your Guilt, and do not, by an obſtinate perſiſting in the Denial of it, provoke the juſt indignation of your Prince, who has made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the World, that his Inclinations are rather to ſhew Mercy than inflict Puniſhments. My Lord, attend with patience, and hear the Bill of Indictment that hath been found againſt you read. Read the Bill of Indictment to my Lord.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THE ſaid Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> ſaving to himſelf all benefit of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of any further or other matter of exception to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, Incertainty or Inſufficiency of the ſaid Indictment, and all matters and things which do or may concern the ſame, for Plea hereunto ſaith,</p>
               <p>That he was by his Majeſty's Writ Summoned to this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which began the Nineteenth Day of <hi>May</hi> laſt, and attended his Duty there as a Peer of this Realm.</p>
               <p>That for High Treaſon ſuppoſed to be committed by him, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Sitting of the ſame Parliament; he was the Twenty ſixth Day of <hi>July</hi> laſt, committed, by Warrant of the Earl of <hi>Sunderland</hi> one of his Majeſty's Principal Secretaries of State, to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Peers in Parliament aſſembled, taking Notice by his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Ninth of <hi>November</hi> laſt, of his being abſent from his Attendance in Parliament, ſent a Meſſage to his Majeſty to know the reaſon why he the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> a Peer of that Houſe, was abſent from his Attendance there.</p>
               <p>Upon the Tenth Day of <hi>November</hi> laſt, the Lord Treaſurer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his Majeſty's Anſwer to the ſaid Meſſage, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> was abſent from his Attendance in Parliament, becauſe he ſtood committed for High Treaſon, for levying War againſt the King this laſt Summer, teſtifyed upon Oath, and that his Majeſty had given directions that he ſhould be proceeded againſt with all ſpeed according to Law.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of Peers not being ſatisfied with this Anſwer, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate thereof was adjourn'd till the Monday morning following.</p>
               <p>On which Day the Lords reſuming the Debate concerning the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> and the King's Meſſage; after ſome Debate, the Lord Chancellour, by his Majeſty's Command, gave the Houſe an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what Proceedings had been againſt the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> ſince his Majeſty's Anſwer to their Addreſs concerning his abſence from the Houſe, which was to this Effect:</p>
               <p>That the King had given Order for a ſpeedy Proſecution of him: That the Treaſon whereof he was accuſed was committed in <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>; and that being a County Palatine, the Proſecution ought to be there, and not in the King's Bench; as it might be if the Treaſon had been committed in another County: and that therefore his Majeſty had given Order for a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> into <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> in order to the finding of an Indictment againſt him for the ſaid Treaſon: And that accordingly a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> was already ſealed; and if the Indictment be not found before the end of the Term, the ſaid Lord <hi>Delamere</hi>'s Prayer being entred in the Kings's Bench, he ſhould be Bailed.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Afterwards, that is to ſay, upon the <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the ſaid Parliament was Prorogued by his Majeſty unto the Tenth Day of <hi>February</hi> next, as by the ſaid Journals it doth alſo appear.</p>
               <p>Upon all which Matters, the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> doth hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tender this his Plea to the Juriſdiction of your Lordſhips in this Cauſe, and doth humbly conceive your Lordſhips ought not to proceed in the Tryal of him upon the Indictment of High Treaſon now before you: And that for theſe following Reaſons,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Inaſmuch as it appears by the ſaid Petition of the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> and the ſeveral Orders of the Lords, and the King's Anſwers to the Meſſage of the Lords thereupon, That the ſaid Houſe are already poſſeſſed of his ſaid Cauſe, which is for the ſame ſuppoſed Treaſon for which he was at firſt committed, and which is the ſame Treaſon for which he now ſtands indicted before your Lordſhips. And for this Reaſon your Lordſhips, as he humbly conceives, by the Law and Cuſtom of Parliament, which is part of the Law and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Land, ought not to proceed againſt him upon the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment; but his ſaid Cauſe ought wholly to be determined and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in the ſaid Houſe of Peers, and not elſewhere, as in like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes has been formerly done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas it is the Right and Privilege of the Peerage of this Realm, That no Peer thereof ought to be tryed or proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt for High Treaſon during the continuance of the Parliament, except in the ſaid Houſe of Peers, and before. the whole Body of the Peers there. And whereas the aforeſaid Parliament is now conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing by Prorogation until the tenth day of <hi>February</hi> next aboveſaid, the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> humbly conceives that by the Law and Cuſtom of Parliament hitherto uſed, which is part of the Law and Cuſtom of the Realm, he ought not, nor can be tryed before your Lordſhips for the ſaid Treaſons, becauſe the ſaid Parliament is ſtill continuing, and not diſſolved.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, The ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> doth further ſay, That he is the ſame <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> mentioned in the Commitment, Petitions, Meſſages, Anſwers and Indictment now read unto him, and the ſaid Treaſon for which he was committed is the ſame Treaſon mentioned in the Commitment, Petition, Meſſages, Anſwers, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>To which ſaid Indictment he humbly conceives he is not bound by Law to make any further or other Anſwer.</p>

               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace, and you my Noble Lords, I do not offer this Plea out of any diffidence or diſtruſt in my Cauſe, nor out of any diſlike I have to any of your Lordſhips that are here Summoned to be my Tryers; I cannot hope to ſtand before any more juſt and Noble, nor can I wiſh to ſtand before any others; but your Grace and my Lords will pardon me if I inſiſt upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53536:7"/>
it, becauſe I apprehend it a Right and Priviledge doe to all the Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>England,</hi> which, as it is againſt the Duty of every Peer to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray or forgoe; ſo it is not in the power of any One, or more, to wave it, or give it up without the conſent of the whole Body of the Peers, every one of them being equally intereſted.</p>
               <p>This, my Lord, I humbly demand as my Right and Priviledge as a Peer of <hi>England,</hi> and ſubmit to the direction of your Grace and my Noble Lords.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Attor. General.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace; This Plea that is here offered by this Noble Lord, is a Plea to the Juriſdiction, but, with ſubmiſſion, it needs very little anſwer, for it has very little in it: The Force of the Plea is, That he ought to be tryed by the whole Body of the Houſe of Peers in Parliament, becauſe the Parliament is ſtill continuing, being under a Prorogation and not diſſolved; and becauſe there was ſome agitation of the matter concerning this Proſecution, upon his Petition, in the Houſe of Lords; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concludes, That he ought not to be tryed by your Grace and theſe Noble Lords upon this Commiſſion, but by all the Lords in Parliament. With ſubmiſſion, my Lord, This is contrary to all the antient Precedents, and againſt the known Rules of Law; for the Law is, If the King pleaſes to try a Peer in Parliament, then the Record may be brought into the Houſe, and there they proceed as in other Caſes, and all the Peers are Judges. Thus it is in the time of a Seſſion of Parliament; but if the Parliament be prorogued, there are many inſtances (and indeed none to the contrary) that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Prorogation, the Proceedings are before the High Steward by Commiſſion. And as to the other part of the Caſe, I have this to ſay to it, That there is nothing at all depending in the Houſe of Lords that can ouſt this Court of the Juriſdiction; for there was not ſo much as any Indictment returned there, no, nor ſo much as found du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Seſſion of Parliament. All the agitation was only upon my Lords Petition, and the King's Anſwer; that he intended as ſpeedy a Proſecution as could be: Beſides, my Lord, your Grace ſees it is a Plea in paper and in Engliſh, without any Councels hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope your Grace does not expect that I ſhould formally demur to a Plea in this form, and that contains no more of Subſtance in it. But I muſt deſire your Grace to over-rule it, and that the Priſoner may plead in chief.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I humbly pray that I may have Councel, aſſigned me, to put my Plea into Form, and to argue the matter of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> I am ſure I ought and ever ſhall be as tender of the Priviledges of the Peers of <hi>England,</hi> as any other Perſon whatſoever: For I am concerned, as well in intereſt as inclination ſo to be, having the honour to be one my ſelf: But I know your Lordſhip will not think the Priviledge of the Peers is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this matter; nor will your Lordſhip, I dare ſay, inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on matters that are purely dilatory, if your Lordſhip be ſatisfied that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53536:7"/>
they are ſo: And therefore give me leave, my Lord, to mind you of a few things, whereby your Lordſhip will eaſily ſee. That the chief things on which you inſiſt are grounded upon miſtakes: Firſt, You ſay, The Houſe of Peers was poſſeſſed of the Cauſe; which could not be, and I will tell you why: Becauſe there was no Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ever removed thither, or lodged there. Which plainly proves that the Lords were never poſſeſſed of the Cauſe. Nor indeed was the Bill found upon which you are now arraigned till after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the Parliament. So that they could never come to be poſſeſſed of this matter. Theſe are miſtakes in Point of Fact, and your Lordſhip cannot but well know them to be ſo.</p>
               <p>And there is as great a miſtake in the Law, That during the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a Parliament (though it were prorogued, yet if not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved) a Peer cannot be tryed but by the Houſe of Lords. This certainly is a very ſtrange Doctrine, and is not only againſt the reaſon and methods of Law, but contrary even to your Lordſhips own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. For your Lordſhip cannot but very well remember, that during the continuance of the Parliament, after a Prorogation, the Lord <hi>Cornwallis</hi> was tryed before the High Steward, and ſuch a number of Peers as were then ſummoned, upon ſuch a Commiſſion as I now ſit here by. But indeed during the Sitting of the Parliament, then all the Peers are both Tryers and Judges, as was in the Caſes of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi>; they being a Court of Judicature, then actually ſitting; and therefore this Plea is grounded as upon miſtake in Fact, ſo, upon a miſtake in point of Law. So that though, as I ſaid at firſt, it is both my duty and intereſt to preſerve the priviledges of the Peers, yet I muſt take care that no injury be done to the Law; and truly I take this Plea to be altogether dilatory, and I ſuppoſe your Lordſhip is ſatisfied of it, and will not inſiſt upon it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>If your Grace pleaſe, It was alledged and agreed in the Caſe of my Lord of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that the Cauſe of a Peer in time of Parliament properly belong'd only to the Houſe of Lords; And that which poſſeſſed the Houſe of Lords of his Caſe, was, as I apprehend, no more than is in my Caſe, a petition upon the account of being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and there the Lords claim the cognizance of the whole Cauſe, and nothing was done but in the Houſe of Lords. And as to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances your Grace has mentioned of my Lord <hi>Cornwallis,</hi> (and there was another of them, my Lord <hi>Morley</hi>) this Queſtion was never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Debate in thoſe Caſes; therefore I ſuppoſe they cannot be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Precedents.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>But, my Lord, it would have been an Errour in the whole Proceedings, if this Court had not Juriſdiction: And ſure the Judges, who are always called to aſſiſt in ſuch Caſes; and who, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life, even in the Caſes of common perſons, are ſo tender and careful, that there be no irregularity in the Proceedings, would not have let things paſs in that manner, had they been erroneous.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I think no other Precedents are produced but thoſe two, and there the Queſtion was never debated.</p>

               <p>No, my Lord, If your Grace will hear Councel, I for the King muſt pray that it may be done preſently; for a Plea to the Juriſdiction is never favoured, nor is the party to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time to maintain it, but he muſt be ready at the time it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>

               <p>Pray, My Lord, how was it done in the Caſe of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> his Plea was a Plea to the Juriſdiction, and he had four days allowed him to put his Plea in form, and to inſtruct his Councel.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>L. H. Steward,</speaker>
               <p>I am not able at preſent to remember what was done in ſuch or ſuch a particular Caſe: But according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral method and courſe of Law, the Plea to the Juriſdiction is not favoured, nor time allowed to it, but the party muſt be ready to maintain it preſently.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Attorn. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But, with Submiſſion, my Lord, That Caſe of <hi>Fitz Harris</hi> is nothing to this Noble Lord's Caſe neither: There was a formal Plea put in in Writing, and drawn up in Latine, and a formal Demurrer joined; and thereupon I did take time to ſpeak to it. But, with your Grace's favour, by the Law, the Priſoner muſt be always ready to make good his Plea, if he will ouſt the Court of their Juriſdiction.</p>

               <p>My Lord, You cannot, by the Courſe of Law, have Councel allowed You in the Caſe of a Capital Crime, till ſuch time as the <hi>Court,</hi> where You are called to Anſwer, is apprized, that there is ſome Matter of Law in your Caſe, that may need Councel to be heard, to Inform their Judgment, and which they may think convenient to hear Councel to: For if in caſe any Priſoner at the Barr ſhall before-hand be allowed to have Councel to ſtart frivolous Objections, ſuch as this (and we all know, that there are ſome who will be eaſily prevailed with, to endeavour to pick Holes where there are none) and to offer Matters foreign from the things whereof the Party ſtands accuſed; and upon the Priſoner's bare Requeſt, Councel muſt be heard to every trivial Point, the Courts of Law would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be at an end in any Tryal; but ſome dilatory Matter or other, would be found to retard the Proceedings: But it does not conſiſt with the Grandeur of the Court, nor your Lordſhip's Intereſt, to let ſuch a frivolous Plea interrupt your Lordſhip's Tryal.

No, my Lord, it is not for my ſelf, but for the whole Body of <hi>Peers,</hi> of which I have the Honour to be a Member: And if my <hi>Lords,</hi> here, are ſatisfied it is

               <speaker>Lord H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, I know You cannot but well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what unjuſt and inſolent Attempts were made upon the rightful and unalterable Succeſſion to the Imperial Crown of theſe Realms, under the pretence of That, which has been ſo often found to be the Occaſion of Rebellion; I mean, the ſpecious Pretence of <hi>Religion,</hi> by the fierce, froward, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical Zeal of ſome Members of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> in the laſt <hi>Parliaments</hi> under the late King, <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Scond, of ever Bleſſed Memory.</p>
               <p>Which, by the wonderful Providence of Almighty <hi>God,</hi> not prevailing, the Chief Contrivers of that horrid Villany, conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together how to gain that Advantage upon the <hi>Monarchy</hi> by open Force, which they could not obtain by a pretended Courſe of Law.</p>
               <p>And in order thereto, it is but too well known, how they had ſeveral Treaſonable Meetings, made bold and riotous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes into ſeveral Parts of the King's Dominions, thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to debauch the Minds of the well-meaning, though unwary and ignorant, Part of the King's Subjects.</p>
               <p>But theſe their evil Purpoſes, it pleaſed <hi>God</hi> alſo to fruſtrate, by bringing to Light that curſed Conſpiracy againſt the Life of His Sacred Majeſty, King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second; as alſo, againſt That of our dread Soveraign, that now is, whom <hi>God</hi> long preſerve.</p>
               <p>Theſe Helliſh and damnable Plots, one would have thought, could not have ſurvived the juſt Condemnation and Execution of ſome of the chief Contrivers of them; eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that after it had pleaſed Almighty <hi>God,</hi> to take to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf our late Merciful and dread Soveraign, no ſooner was His Sacred Majeſty, that now is, Seated in the Royal Throne of His Anceſtors; but He made it His utmoſt Endeavours, not only to convince the World, that He had quite forgot thoſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and abominable Indignities that had been put upon Him,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53536:10"/>
only for being the beſt of Subjects, and the beſt of Brothers: but did alſo give forth the moſt Benign Aſſurances imaginable to all his loving People, that He would approve Himſelf to be the beſt of Kings.</p>
               <p>And further, to evince the Reality of theſe His Gracious and Heroick Reſolutions, He immediately called a <hi>Parliament</hi>; and therein repeated, and ſolemnly Confirmed His former Royal Declarations of having a particular Care of maintaining our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh't Laws and Religion: With which that Wiſe, Great, and Loyal Aſſembly, were ſo fully and perfectly ſatisfied, that they thought they could not make ſufficient Returns of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for ſuch Gracious and Princely Condeſcentions.</p>
               <p>And yet, my <hi>Lords,</hi> while the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> were thus, as I may ſay, endeavouring to out-do each other in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Kindneſs, that wicked and unnatural Rebellion broke out; and thereupon the Arch-Traytor, <hi>Monmouth,</hi> was, by a Bill brought into the <hi>Lower-Houſe,</hi> and Paſs'd by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſent of <hi>Both Houſes,</hi> (and I could wiſh, my <hi>Lords,</hi> for the ſake of that <hi>Noble Lord</hi> at the Barr, that I could ſay, It had Paſs'd with the Conſent of every particular Member of each <hi>Houſe</hi>) juſtly Attainted of <hi>High-Treaſon.</hi>

               <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> What ſhare my <hi>Lord</hi> at the Barr had in thoſe other Matters, I muſt acquaint You, is not within the Compaſs of this Indictment, for which You are to Try him, as his <hi>Peers</hi>: For That is for a Treaſon alledged to have been Committed by him, in His Majeſty's Reign that now is.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace, my <hi>Lord High Steward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and You my Noble Lords, the <hi>Peers:</hi> My Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> the Priſoner at the Barr, ſtands Indicted for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring the Death of His Majeſty, and in order thereunto to Raiſe a Rebellion in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:53536:11"/>My <hi>Lords,</hi> In proving this Charge upon him, we crave Leave to give your <hi>Grace,</hi> and your <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> ſome ſhort Account by Witneſſes, that we have here, of a former Deſign that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to this Matter, for which this <hi>Noble Lord</hi> ſtands here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed: And We ſhall not trouble your <hi>Grace,</hi> and your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi> with any long Evidence, becauſe it has received many ſolemn and repeated Tryals; and, as to the Proof of it, has been Confirmed by as many Verdicts. But We do it rather, to give ſome Account as an Introduction to a Material Evidence, by ſhewing, That <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> which was the Province of this <hi>Noble Lord,</hi> was One of the Stages, where that <hi>Rebellion</hi> was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be acted; and that, preparatory to it, great Riotous Aſſemblies, and Tumultuous Gatherings of the People, were ſet on foot by the <hi>Conſpirators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall then ſhew, my <hi>Lords,</hi> That after the late <hi>Duke of Monmouth,</hi> (the Head of the Conſpiracy) went beyond Sea, (eſpecially after the Death of the late <hi>King</hi>) frequent Meſſages, and Intercourſe of Correſpondency, were ſent and held between him, and the reſt of his <hi>Accomplices</hi> abroad, and their Fellow-<hi>Conſpirators</hi> here at home.</p>
               <p>And particularly, We ſhall prove, That a little before the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> came over laſt <hi>Summer,</hi> into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> the <hi>Duke of Monmouth</hi> did diſpatch one <hi>Jones</hi> (who was one of the moſt conſiderable Agents in this Contrivance) to come from <hi>Holland</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to let his Friends know, that though he had intended to go into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and begin his Work there; yet now his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions were for <hi>England</hi>; where, he hoped, his Friends would be prepared for him. And with this Meſſage, and Reſolution of his, <hi>Jones</hi> was to acquaint ſome Lords, (who they were, the Witneſs will tell your <hi>Lordſhips</hi>; but) among others, this <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord,</hi> the Priſoner, was one: And to acquaint them beſides, That he would immediately ſet ſayl for <hi>England,</hi> whither he would come ſo ſoon as he could get. That he had a Deſign to have Landed in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> where he expected to be moſt readily receiv'd; but finding That inconvenient, they ſhould have notice Four or Five Days before-hand, of the Place of his Landing; which, he intended, ſhould be in the <hi>Weſt.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Directions that <hi>Jones</hi> had to give to thoſe <hi>Lords,</hi> one was, That they ſhould immediately repair into <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> there to wait for the News.</p>
               <p>Theſe Inſtructions <hi>Jones</hi> had given him in Writing; but Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with an Injunction, not to open them till he came to Sea; and then he was to peruſe that Writing, and deliver his Meſſage according to his Inſtructions: And in that Writing was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53536:11"/>
the Name of this <hi>Noble Lord,</hi> as one that was principally rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, to carry on the Rebellion in <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> And We ſhall give You an Account, That the late <hi>Duke of Monmouth</hi> did look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> as one of his main Supports; and upon my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> as a Principal Aſſiſtant <hi>There.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> This Meſſage was <hi>Jones</hi> to communicate to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Mathews,</hi> and Captain <hi>Mathews</hi> was to tranſmit it to this <hi>Noble Lord,</hi> and the other Perſons that were concern'd with him. <hi>Jones</hi> arrived with this Meſſage here in <hi>England,</hi> upon the <hi>Twenty-Seventh</hi> of <hi>May</hi>; [And I muſt beg your <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> to obſerve the Time particularly:] But Captain <hi>Mathews,</hi> to whom he was directed, was not to be found; nor Major <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> to whom, in the Abſence of Captain <hi>Mathews,</hi> he was to apply himſelf, as You will hear more fully from the Witneſs's own Mouth: Thereupon he ſends for one <hi>Diſney,</hi> (a Name which your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> cannot but know, he being ſince Executed for <hi>Treaſon</hi>) and one <hi>Brand,</hi> whom your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> will likewiſe hear of; and they meet with this ſame <hi>Jones,</hi> who communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates his Meſſage to them, and they undertake to deliver it to the Perſons concern'd; Captain <hi>Mathews</hi> being out of Town, and Major <hi>Wildman</hi> not to be found.</p>
               <p>That very Night, my <hi>Lords,</hi> this ſame <hi>Brand</hi> and <hi>Diſney</hi> they meet this <hi>Noble Lord,</hi> my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> at the Coffee-Houſe, and give him an Account of the Meſſages: And as ſoon as ever he had received the Meſſage, upon that <hi>Twenty-Seventh</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> at Ten of the Clock at Night, does my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> diſpatch out of Town, with only one Servant to attend him, and Two other Friends that he had pick't up, or appointed to meet him, and go with him.</p>
               <p>With all theſe Badges of Plot and Deſign, does my Lord <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamere</hi> ſet out that Night. It was the ſame Night that <hi>Jones</hi> came to Town: It was late at Night. He changed his Name, and went by the Name of <hi>Brown.</hi> He choſe to go all the By-roads, and would not keep the High-common-road; and went with great ſpeed, as We cannot but preſume according to the Meſſage delivered by <hi>Jones,</hi> on purpoſe to repair into <hi>Cheſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> pleaſe to obſerve, You will find ſeveral remarkable Inſtances of Plot and Contrivance in the matter: Firſt, That a Nobleman, and one of 10 conſiderable a Character in his Country, as my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> ſhould make ſuch haſte out of Town with 10 ſmall an Equipage, as but one Servant; Then, That he ſhould go ſo late at Night: Again, That he ſhould
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53536:12"/>
change his Name; and That ſhould prove to be a Name not caſually taken up, as the firſt Name he could think of next his own; but a Name of diſtinction, that he was known by among all his own Party: For all the Communications between the Confederates and Him, were managed, as to Him, under the Name of <hi>Brown:</hi> By that Name, ſeveral of the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Trayterous <hi>Declarations</hi> were ſent for; which were to be ſent to him, or by him, into <hi>Cheſhire:</hi> And that alone, with Submiſſion, my <hi>Lords,</hi> would be a ſhrewd Circumſtance of Suſpicion, that a Noble Lord, ſuch an one as my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> ſhould aſſume the Name of a Commoner, and poſt out of Town ſo ill accompanied in a Diſguiſe at that time of Night; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Parliament</hi> being then Sitting, as really it was.</p>
               <p>But beſides all this Circumſtantial Evidence, We ſhall prove, by Poſitive Teſtimony, what the haſty Buſineſs was, that made my <hi>Lord</hi> undertake this Journey in this manner: For, having notice of the <hi>Duke of Monmouth</hi>'s Intention to Land ſpeedily in <hi>England,</hi> when he comes into <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> he actually ſets about the Work to put that County in a forwardneſs to aſſiſt in the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> endeavours to ſtir up the People to joyn with him; and acquaints One that he imployed in that Affair, with the whole Deſign, that he was engaged to raiſe ſo many Thouſand Men, and ſo much Money, to be ready by ſuch a Day.</p>
               <p>Nor does my <hi>Lord</hi> reſt here: But, after the <hi>Duke of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> was Landed in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> to corrupt the Minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, We ſhall prove what Diſcourſes he had, (and theſe will te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his Inclinations to the Cauſe) concerning the great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he had obtained over the King's Forces, and how he applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Conqueſts.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> We ſhall plainly ſhew You all this that I have opened in plain Proof; And then, We ſhall ſubmit it to your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> Judgments, Whether this <hi>Noble Peer</hi> be Not Guilty, as he has Pleaded to his Indictment.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I was ſaying, that the Conteſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the diſputed Election of Sheriffs, had occaſioned ſuch heats in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and other Places, that it was even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the common expreſſions of diſcontent: I knew nothing of any particular Deſign there was in hand till about ſix weeks after, when Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> came to me, a Perſon I had known ſome time before, and, upon diſcourſe, acquainted me, that he had found out that there were ſome perſons engaged in a conſiderable Action that was near its execution, and that in order to it, he had had notice given him to make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereupon he had thought fit, for that reaſon, to withdraw from the place where he did at that time Lodge, (which was in <hi>Red-Lyon</hi>-Court in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> as I remember) and betake himſelf to a private Lodging, that he might be the readier for Action; and to put himſelf into a better equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page for joyning in the enterpriſe, he had bought himſelf a Horſe, and ſent his Son into <hi>Ireland</hi> to turn all he could into ready mony, and return it, that he might be the better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to go through with the undertaking. My Lords, this was a great ſurpriſe to me; for though I knew, as all the reſt of the World did, that there were great diſcontents, yet, till then, I never had any intimation of any particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: I told him I was going into the Country, but ſhould be glad to know how things went, and deſired him to write to me, and gave him a little <hi>Cabala</hi> or <hi>Cipher</hi> to diſguiſe the matter he was to write about: and when I was in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I did receive ſeveral Letters which intimated ſomething of a deſign that was going on, and at laſt he writ, with ſome warmth to me, of a neceſſity we were under to enter into Action; and of the readineſs of my Correſpondents; (for the ſtile of the Letters was that of Merchants, for ſo was the Cant that I had given him): But truly I was not over-haſty in my return to <hi>London,</hi> becauſe I rather choſe to ſee what would be the Iſſue of what was then projected, before I did intermeddle in ſuch an Affair, and ſo made uſe of all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes I could to retard my return, and came not to Town till that week which determined the long-continued contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy in <hi>London</hi>; Nay, and then alſo avoided meeting with any body in any ſet-way, till I could better ſee how things were managed, and what event they would probably come to; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I would not go to my own Houſe, but took up my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Mile-end,</hi> and lay there 3 or 4 days, till the day came for confirming the new-elected Sheriffs, and the election of a new Lord Mayor, which, as I take it, is on the day before
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53536:13"/>
                  <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-day, and <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-day: When that day was over, I could not find there was any intention of entring into any ſort of Action; I found indeed there were great murmurings in the mouths of all ſorts of People, and very angry warm ſpeeches, and nothing elſe: So I thought the buſineſs was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for that time, and thereupon away I went to my own Houſe. This, my Lords, was upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Upon the <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> came to me, and deſired that he might have ſome private diſcourſe with me in my Garden; and there he told me, My Lord <hi>Shaftsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> had withdrawn himſelf, and that he did believe things were in a great preparation for Action: I deſired him to tell me what it was; he anſwered me, That he deſired to be excuſed in that, for I muſt go to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who would give me an account of the whole; and withall he told me, my Lord <hi>Shaftsb<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> had been much deſerted and ill uſed by thoſe Lords upon whoſe concurrence he had rely'd, and that was the reaſon why he had withdrawn himſelf, and kept himſelf ſo private: I told him, I did not know my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had any deſire to ſpeak with me; yes he ſaid he had, for he had ſent him to me on purpoſe, and he was to bring back my anſwer, whether I would Joyn or no. I told him, if my Lord deſired to ſpeak with me, I would wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and thereupon I went with him, and he carried me to a place where my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was retired in the City, ſomewhere about <hi>Foſter-Lane</hi> or <hi>Wood-Street,</hi> at the houſe of one <hi>Watſon</hi>: When I came there, after Salutation, my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> began to make great reflections upon the miſery and badneſs of the times, particularly, upon the iſſue of that great Affair, the election of the Sheriffs, which had ended ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately to the terror of all good men: For whereas before the great and ſure reſort of innocency, was to the Integrity of our Juries, when returned by fair and equal Sheriffs, they looked upon the eagerneſs of getting thoſe Perſons Sworn that were then in Office to be a deſigne to intrap the innocent, the elected Sheriffs being eſteemed perſons that would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelves to the humour of the Court; and now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt be run down for crimes that he was no way guilty of, if the ſinger of the Court did but point him out to deſtruction. The apprehenſion of this, he ſaid, had made him withdraw himſelf, not knowing how ſoon he might be ſeiz'd, ſhould he have remain'd in publick; and he thought the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was as imminent upon, and likely to reach to others, as well as to him; and particularly to my ſelf, and therefore, he ſaid, the ſenſe of this danger ought to put every Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had a value for his Country, and any thing that was dear to him in it, upon uſing his utmoſt endeavours to give
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53536:14"/>
ſome prevention to thoſe calamities which were impendent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, and which threatned the deſtruction of all men that ſtood up for the rights of the people; and this, he ſaid, was his reſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord,</hi> In order to this, he declared to me, what Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations had been made for the Raiſing of Force for this purpoſe; he ſaid, there were eight or ten Thouſand Men (I cannot fix the particular number) that he was well aſſured to have ready in the City; That there had been divers Horſe (I think about Fourſcore or an Hundred he named) that about a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before, had been, by parcels, drawn into the Town, without being obſerved; and theſe were in daily expectation to go into Action; but through the unhandſome Diſappointment of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the other Lords that adhered to him, who were to have joyned in the Acti<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> and have ſet the Wheels at work in other Parts, he was <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>t alone to do the whole in his Province of <hi>London,</hi> they being not ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr according to their Engagement: But as he ſhould have the greater Danger, ſo he ſhould have the greater Glory; and he reſolved to go through with the Attempt, or Periſh in the Execution. To all this Diſcourſe, I gave ſuch an Anſwer as the nature of the thing required: I told my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> I could not deny all thoſe things to be true, as he had repreſented them in his Diſcourſe; and that I would not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt his Judgment ſo much, as to ſuppoſe, he would enter upon ſuch an Affair, without due deliberation of all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances requiſite to it; and ſo I would not queſtion, but there was ſuch Preparations, and that he had aſſurance of ſuch a Force, as he had ſpoke of, whenever they ſhould begin any Action: But I told him ſomething ſtuck with me, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me very much, That, in a time of ſuch difficulty, when the convenient Help of the Nation was all little enough to joyn in the Work, he ſhould ſtand by himſelf, and Engage in ſuch an Enterprize, in Separation from thoſe other Lords, of whoſe Help there would be ſo much need: He ſaid, he could not help it, they had appointed this time and that, but now, when it came to the puſh, they were not ready to do their parts; but the People were now in ſuch expectation of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done, eſpecially in <hi>London,</hi> that it was impoſſible to reſtrain them, and as impoſſible to get thoſe Lords ready to joyn with them: I told him, I was altogether unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the proceedings in this Affair, and that all of it was wholly new to me: But pray, My Lord, ſaid I, give me leave to Act that part in this buſineſs, that, I think, will moſt conduce to the Succeſsful Iſſue of it, which is, to be a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between You; and let me deſire you to let things reſt as they are, till I have endeavoured to Create a better Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding

between your Lordſhip, and thoſe Lords, of whoſe Tergiverſation you ſeem to complain. Upon this, my Lord was in: a great heat, and expreſs'd himſelf with great warming but at laſt, with much ado, he gave me Permiſſion to go to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and aſſure him, and the reſt of the Lords that were concern'd, and tell them from him, That, if they would be ready to take the Poſts that were aſſign'd them, according to their own former Agreement, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enter upon Action, he would joyn with them, but if not, he was reſolved to go on alone. This was, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, upon <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the Second of <hi>October</hi>; upon the <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> Morning, I went to find out the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> but coming to his Lodgings, he was gone to <hi>Moor</hi>-Pank, where, when I came, I found ſeveral Perſons with him, I but after a little time, I ſeparated him from the Company, and whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him, I gave him to underſtand, how great a Diſorder I found my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> in, and how great a Complaint he made of his being deſerted by him, and the other Lords engaged with him, and what Reſolution he had taken to ſet upon the Work alone: 

  <q>My Lord, ſayes he, I think the Man is Mad, his Fear makes him loſe his Underſtanding; I do not know why he hides himſelf from his Friends, that no body can telll where he is; but as to that which he ſpeaks of, oft our forſaking him, and breach of Faith, he is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; For, 'tis true indeed, we are about doing the Thing, that he is ſo eager for, but we are not for doing it ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, as his Fears precipitate him to do; and he muſt excuſe us, if we Comply not with his Humour, to hazard the whole Undertaking by a raſh beginning.</q> 

Upon that, I ſaid to him, My Lord, I ſhall not diſcourſe the Particularities of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with your Grace; but this is all that I at preſent Addreſs to your Grace for, to be a means, if I can, with your Grace, as I have been with him, to procure a Meeting between you, that you may Settle it with one another. 

  <q>Withal my heart, ſayes the Duke, pray let it be ſo; for, though my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> is angry without a cauſe, yet I would not have him loſe himſelf in a temerarious Undertaking:</q>
  
My Lord, ſaid I, I will tell him what you ſay, and will ſee if I can work him to a Complyance with the Propoſal. The next day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Thurſday,</hi> my <hi>Lord,</hi> I went to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> again, and reported to him, the Diſcourſe I had with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and what Anſwer he had given to his Complaint of their deſerting him: He Reply'd, <q>It was falſe, they had poſitively ingaged to be ready by ſuch a time, and had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the very Day; but now they were off, and would not tell when they would be ready</q> and withal, he told me, he greatly ſuſpected the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to have a ſecret
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53536:15"/>
Correſpondence with the King. I then deſired him, That he would pleaſe to conſent to the Treaty that was propoſed, and give the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the Lords a Meeting; he, in great heat, Replyed, <hi>No,</hi> he would come no more at them: It is ſtrange, my Lord, ſaid I, that you ſhould have ſuch an Opinion of theſe Men, that they would go about to betray you; they are not Men of that ſize: but he perſiſted in it, that they had dealt perfidiouſly with him: For, after a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Agreement, when the Thing was brought juſt to the Birth, they withdrew their helping-hand; but he was ſure, in <hi>London,</hi> he could Raiſe a ſufficient Force to do the Work, and if he were but once ſet on Horſe-back, he would Head them himſelf: But yet he was willing to put it off for a Fortnight, or three weeks longer, if they would be ſure to keep pace with him. With this Propoſal I went the next day, which was <hi>Friday,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and had the ſame Anſwer from him, that I had before; but withal, he bid me tell my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> That he did make it his earneſt Requeſt to him, to give him, and his other Friends a Meeting, before he Engaged in this buſineſs: For, he found by his precipitation, he was about to Deſtroy himſelf, and all that adhered to him. Thereupon, I came to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> again, upon the <hi>Saturday</hi>; and when I came there, after a long and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate urging all the Arguments I could think of; I ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him, that he agreed to give them a Meeting, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, that it ſhould be the next day; and becauſe it ſhould be ſo private, that no notice might be taken of it, he choſe to have the Meeting at his own Houſe, where no body would ſuſpect him to be, and whither he would be conveyed, under the Diſguiſe of a Parſon. I went back with this Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who did undertake, that the other Lords ſhould be there.</p>

               <p>My Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> named my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and a great many more that ſhould bear their parts. I went to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and told him of it, I ſay, and he engaged, that they ſhould certainly be there: But, upon the <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, when I came to the <hi>Temple,</hi> there I found a Meſſage left for me, That my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had receiv'd an Alarum, That there were ſome great <hi>Toryes</hi> lived near his Houſe in <hi>Alderſgate</hi>-Street, who were continually Spying about; and ſo great a Company might make their more than ordinary Obſervation. That this gave him ſuch a Jealouſy, as would not permit him to Meet according to his Appointment: Afterwards, I came to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53536:15"/>
underſtanding of the Reaſon of this, and found there was ſome fineneſs in it, (which I could not comprehend before; But after this time, I never ſaw my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> for he removed then to other Lodgings. So that, what I now ſpeak of him, is only what I had, by hear-ſay, from others: For, I had no knowledge of what paſs'd, as to him, but what I had from Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi>; who told me, That after that, there were ſeveral dayes of Meeting appointed, but ſtill, from time to time, put off; but upon what reaſon, I cannot particularly remember.</p>
               <p>This is all I know of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>; and the latter Part is wholly by Hear-ſay from <hi>Walcot:</hi> But by reaſon of this Agitation, we continued under Expectation till ſuch time as my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> went into <hi>Holland</hi>; where he ſhortly after died. And truly, I thought, at that time, much of the Deſign was quaſhed, and laid aſide: But, ſoon after, <hi>Ferguſon</hi> came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; who, when he came Here, began to revive and quicken the Buſineſs, and puſh it on to Execution. I ſpoke with him at the <hi>One Bell</hi> in the <hi>Strand</hi>; and there he gave me an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all the Steps that had been taken: He told me what Preparations had been made in the City, in general; what to ſeize the Gates of the City; what to Poſſeſs themſelves of the <hi>Tower</hi>; what to attacque the Guards; and ſeveral other Things, which I can't now ſo well remember; the Impreſſions of them being worn out of my Memory, by length of Time, and other Accidents.</p>
               <p>This, in general, is all that I can ſay, as to what was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the particular Engagement wherein I was concern'd: For, at laſt, after many Diſcourſes, the Troubles and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Times increaſing, and the Dangers that threatned us, as we thought, growing higher and higher, this gave an Occaſion for our uniting Councels, and entring into a kind of <hi>Juncto</hi>; which, I ſuppoſe, is Foreign to this Affair before your <hi>Lordſhips</hi>; and therefore, I ſuppoſe, would be likewiſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent for me, to trouble your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> with.</p>

               <p>About the Time of Election of <hi>Sheriffs</hi> for the City of <hi>London</hi>; I mean that memorable Time of the Conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Election, which furniſhed the World with ſo much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and was the occaſion of ſuch Heats and Animoſities: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Time, the <hi>Duke of Monmouth,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> began to diſcourſe about making uſe of That, as an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to accompliſh their Deſign; For they thought the Ferment was ſo high, that Men would eaſily be diſpoſed to an Inſurrection; And after many Diſcourſes to that purpoſe, they came to this Reſolution, That they would apply themſelves to make what Intereſt they could, to procure a Riſing in Three ſeveral Parts of the Kingdom at once: One in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> whither the <hi>Duke of Monmouth</hi> was to betake himſelf: and there be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by my Lord <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> my Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> my Lord <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamere</hi> that then was, and the Priſoner at the Barr, what Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were proper to apply to, for joyning in the Deſign: The Second was in <hi>London,</hi> which was aſſigned to be the Province of my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Third was, in the <hi>Weſt</hi>; which was committed to the Care of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel.</hi> The <hi>Duke of Monmouth</hi> did accordingly go his Progreſs into <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> as is very well known; and, upon his Return, was taken into Cuſtody by the <hi>Serjeant at Arms:</hi> Upon which, Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> was ſent Poſt to Town, and get an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>; and withal, to deliver a Meſſage to Me, to be Communicated with my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury:</hi> Which Meſſage, as near as I remember, was to this Effect; That he had been kindly received by the Gentlemen of the Country; and had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd the Matter with them, and found them all inclined very much to his Satisfaction: That upon his being Arreſted, he had been adviſed to make his Eſcape into <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and Riſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; but that he would not do a Matter of that great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, without the Approbation of his Friends.

               <p>My Lord, ſoon after the late Kings Death, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> with my Lord <hi>Argyle,</hi> where there was an account given of the Deſign that was in hand, of an Inſurrection in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the preparations that had been made in order to it; and at that time there came over to <hi>Holland</hi> Mr. <hi>Crag,</hi> that came as I was inform'd from Major <hi>VVildman,</hi> and his Errand was to promote and recommend a Reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Argyle,</hi> who till that time had acted in ſeparate Intereſts; and <hi>Crag</hi> then gave an account that Means and Money were prepared; he had no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Meſſage to the Duke, becauſe he did not know of meeting him there at that time: The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> upon this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, did ſend Captain <hi>Matthews</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> with a Meſſage to Major <hi>VVildman,</hi> wherein he did deſire him that he would procure a Meeting with my Lord <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> My Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> and I think Mr. <hi>Charleton,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them that he had received a full account of my Lord <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi>'s affairs, and the preparations that had been made for it, and accordingly he had ordered his own affairs to join with him; he likewiſe ſent <hi>Crag</hi> with a Meſſage to the ſame purpoſe to other Friends in <hi>London,</hi> and he diſpatch'd away one <hi>Batteſcomb</hi> into the <hi>VVeſt,</hi> to prepare things there.

There was likewiſe a particular Meſſage from Major <hi>VVildman</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> That he deſired he would bring over with him a Broad Seal to Seal Commiſſions with, and to take upon him the Title of King; the other particular branches of the Meſſage, I do not ſo well remember, but only this, he was particularly asked, Whether the Priſoner at the Bar was there, and he ſaid he was, —</p>

               <p>My Ld. I ſhall give an account as far as I know; after the death of the late King, Captain <hi>Matthews</hi> came to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and gave an account there, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> intended to be there ſhortly to meet and conſult with my Lord <hi>Argyle,</hi> who, we underſtood, then was preparing for an expedition into <hi>Scotland</hi>; thereupon I was ſent into <hi>Freezland</hi> to deſire my Lord <hi>Argyle</hi> to come to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which he did; and there the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did conſult with him, and they did agree together, that at the ſame time that my Lord <hi>Argyle</hi> made an Inſurrection in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſhould Invade <hi>England,</hi> and to that end, that he ſhould ſend to thoſe Friends he had in <hi>England</hi> to be ready to aſſiſt him when he came there; and in order to it, he did ſend Captain <hi>Matthews,</hi> who amongſt other things, was to go to the Dukes Friends in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and amongſt them, my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> was named to be one, and the buſineſs was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to be ready to aſſiſt him when he ſhould land; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Captain <hi>Matthews</hi> went; but a little after his going away, I think one <hi>Crag</hi> came over, and he came from Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> and his buſineſs was to endeavour a good underſtanding between the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Argyle,</hi> who were then at ſome difference; and to endeavour to make them act jointly by united Councils; a little after he was ſent back again into <hi>England</hi> to Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> to deſire him to aſſiſt them with ſome Money; he went back again, and returned, but brought no Money; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was ſent again, by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> becauſe the firſt time he was not ſent by him; the Sum demanded was Six Thouſand Pounds, or Four Thouſand Pounds, and at laſt he ſent for a Thouſand Pound; <hi>Crag</hi> returned with this Anſwer, That they could not aſſiſt them with Money, for they did not know to what end they ſhould have Money, but to buy Arms, and for that the people were well provided enough already, and there was no need of Money for that purpoſe. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> a while after ſent Mr. <hi>Crag,</hi> and pawned all the Jewels he had, to raiſe Money, and fitted out Three Ships for this Service, laden with Ammunition, and becauſe he had promiſed my Lord <hi>Argyle</hi> to make a diverſion, in <hi>England,</hi> while he Invaded <hi>Scotland,</hi> he reſolved to go with that proviſion he had, and deſired by Mr. <hi>Crag,</hi> that ſince thoſe Lords and Gentlemen that were to aſſiſt them, had ſent no Money, as was deſired of them, and expected from them, they ſhould now trouble themſelves with no further needleſs conſultations; but ſhould repair each man into his own
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53536:18"/>
Countrey, where their intereſt was greateſt, to be ready when he ſhould come; and in order to this, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did ſet ſail from <hi>Holland,</hi> and came to <hi>Lyme,</hi> and landed there; and did afterwards order his March, ſo that he might moſt conveniently meet with his <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Friends, that is, towards <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and ſo to get <hi>Glouceſter</hi> Bridg, that thereby gaining the command of the River of <hi>Severn,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> if they did, as was expected, make an Inſurrection at the ſame time, they might eaſily join to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. In purſuance of this deſign we came to <hi>Keinſham</hi> Bridg, and there a party of the Kings Horſe ſet upon us, and we took ſome Priſoners, and thereupon thought it adviſable not to let the Kings Army join together, but to go back and engage thoſe that were already come together, and that was the reaſon we did not go over the Bridg.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I went to <hi>Holland</hi> about the latter end of <hi>April</hi> laſt; my going, as I have acquainted his Majeſty and the Council, was not only about this Affair, for I had other buſineſs that called me thither, which I ſhall not now take up your time, or trouble you with repeating of; but having ſome knowledg from Mr. <hi>Diſney,</hi> that there were ſome intentions of doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, tho it was communicated to me but very darkly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that little I did know, made me the willinger to go for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſo ſoon as I did; but before I went, I had a mind to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſomething more of the deſign, and therefore the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went, I came to Mr. <hi>Diſney,</hi> and acquainted him with my intended Journey; Mr. <hi>Diſney</hi> did perſwade me againſt it, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I had gone upon this account, but I told him the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he partly knew, why I went; but withal I told him, I did intend to ſee the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and if he had any Meſſage that he would have delivered to him, I would deliver it very ſafely; he told me all the Meſſage I ſhould deliver to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> if I ſaw him, was to deſire him to keep to the laſt Concluſion which he would find in a Letter that had been ſent to him, and that if he had not yet received the Letter, it was to come by the Crop-hair'd Merchant, or the Crop-ear'd Merchant, I cannot ſay which, but I think it was the Crop-hair'd; I asked him what that Meſſage was, leſt the Letter ſhould miſcarry, for I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53536:19"/>
told him, if I ſhould go to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and refer him to a Letter wherein a Meſſage was to be brought him, which he was to keep to, and that Letter ſhould miſcarry, I ſhould in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect bring no meſſage at all to him; my Lord, thereupon he told me, that I ſhould acquaint the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> that his Friends in <hi>England</hi> would not by any means have him come for <hi>England,</hi> but that he ſhould continue where he was, or if he thought good to go for <hi>Scotland,</hi> they approved of it; this is the ſum of what he ſaid to me, as near as I can remember. When I came to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> there was one Mr <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that was kill'd at <hi>Philips Norton,</hi> went with me to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s, and when I came to him, I acquainted him, as Mr. <hi>Diſney</hi> appointed me to do, that there was ſuch a letter ſent by ſuch a perſon, and that ſuch a Meſſage was included in it; My Lord, he was in a great paſſion, I know not how to expreſs it, and ſeemed to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much troubled, and did reflect very much upon Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> and ſaid, that was <hi>Wildman</hi>'s work, and he ſaid, (as I think that was the word he uſed) <hi>Wildman</hi> was a Villain, or to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but withal he ſaid it was too late to ſend ſuch a meſſage now, and that he was reſolved to come for <hi>England</hi>; and he would make <hi>VVildman</hi> hang with him, or fight for it, with him; that <hi>Wildman</hi> did think by tying his own purſe, he ſhould tye his hand, but he ſhould find it ſhould not be ſo, and ſome other words of the like nature, he uſed; but this is the ſubſtance of what he ſaid; he gave ſome account what preparations had been made, he ſaid Money was very ſhort, and he had been fain to pawn all he had to raiſe what Money was raiſed, upon his own charge. He asked me if I did think to return to <hi>England</hi> ſhortly; I told him if he had any ſervice to command me for <hi>England,</hi> I had ſome little buſineſs to do at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> which I would diſpatch, and then I would perform his Commands; he told me, he would be glad I did return as ſoon as I could for <hi>England,</hi> and that this ſhould be the Meſſage I ſhould carry to <hi>Wildman</hi> in anſwer to the Meſſage he had ſent him, That he would come for <hi>England,</hi> and he ſhould either fight with him, or hang with him, and that was all he had to ſay to him. I was coming away from him, but he ſtopped me, and told me he would not have me go out of Town till he had ſpoke with me again; this was upon the Sunday, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I did go in the Evening to him, and when I came, he told me, he would have me ſtay till Tueſday Morning, for he was going out of Town, and intended to be back again at that time, but if not, I ſhould receive from my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> what he had to ſay to me. He did not come upon the Tueſday, but my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> did come, and I think to the beſt of my remembrance Mr. <hi>Crag</hi> was with me; he told me all he had to ſay was, That the Duke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53536:19"/>
to be in <hi>England</hi> within Nine days, and that upon the Thurſday ſeven-night after I came away, the Duke would be in <hi>England</hi>; and he bid me to remember to tell <hi>Brand</hi> that when he heard the Duke was landed, he ſhould acquaint Sir <hi>Robert Payton</hi> with it, but not till he was landed; for tho they did think that he would join with them when the thing was begun, yet they ought to be careful who it was communicated to, for fear it ſhould be diſcovered and diſappointed; this was all that I had in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from my Lord <hi>Gray.</hi> I came to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and diſpatch'd my buſineſs there, and would have come away, but it happened there were no Ships coming for <hi>England,</hi> nor would there be any in a Fortnights time; thereupon I returned to <hi>Amſterdam</hi>; when I came back, I went to ſee the Duke to give him an account how it happened that I was not gone for <hi>England</hi>; the Duke told me he was glad I was not gone; for now he had a further Meſſage for me to carry, and he would have me ſtay 2 or 3 days in Town for it; I ſtaid three days, and came again to him, but he told me he was not ready for me yet; then I ſtayed two or three days lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger till the 21<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>May</hi> to the beſt of my remembrance; it was upon a Thurſday that he gave me the Meſſage that I was to bring into <hi>England</hi>; I came to him in the Morning, and he told me I ſhould come to him upon the Evening of that day, and when I came, there was a Paper lay before him on the Table, and he took the Paper and ſealed it up, I cannot ſay he wrote all that was in that Paper, but the Paper that lay before him was not finiſhed when I came in, and that he did not write while I was there, I am ſure; but he took it up and ſealed it before me, and when he had ſealed the Paper, he told me, I muſt aſſoon as I came for <hi>London,</hi> ſee for Captain <hi>Matthews,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi>'s Son in Law, who lodged at Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and deſire him to acquaint my Lord <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> my Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> with his deſign of coming for <hi>England,</hi> and that he was reſolved to ſet out upon the Saturday Morning after I came away, which was upon the Friday; he told me Captain <hi>Matthews</hi> was to ſend one Poſt to that place that was named in the Note to receive Intelligence of his landing, and that ſhould be brought to his Friends here immediately (he deſigned ſhould be 24 Hours before the Court had notice of it in Town), and thoſe Lords were to be in readineſs, that as ſoon as they knew he was landed, they might repair to their ſeveral Poſts to aſſiſt him. I told him that I would deliver what Meſſage he gave me, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, what I was to do with the Paper he put into my hands; thereupon, as near as I remember, he uſed theſe expreſſions to me, I do by you, as Princes do by their Admirals, when they ſend them out upon any conſiderable expedition, which requires ſecrecy in the management of it, they have their Commiſſion delivered
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53536:20"/>
to them ſealed up, which they are not to break open till they are at Sea. So here I deliver you your Inſtructions ſealed up, which you are not to open till you are at Sea; and when you have opened them, and read what is contained in them, I would have you tear the Paper, and throw it into the Sea, or otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it, leſt you be ſurprized and ſearched at your landing, and my Papers found about you. My Lord, I asked him, becauſe I would be as punctual in my Meſſage as I could, what thoſe Lords were to do, when they came out of Town, whether they ſhould come directly to him or no; he told me no, not that, but they ſhould go into the Countrey, and ſecure their Intereſt for him there. I asked him then, if Captain <hi>Matthews</hi> be out of the way, and I be diſappointed of meeting with him, ſhall I deliver this Meſſage to the Lords my ſelf; he told me no, by no means, for thoſe Lords were Perſons of Quality, and that that was not a thing to be done by me; what ſhall I then do, my Lord, ſaid I, if Captain <hi>Matthews</hi> be out of the way? you need not queſtion that, ſaith he, but if you meet not with <hi>Matthews,</hi> ſpeak to <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, with theſe inſtructions (and this as near as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member is the Sum of all he ſaid to me) I came away, and came to Sea; when I was out at Sea, I broke open the Letter that I had given me by the Duke, and I will tell you as near as I can, what were the Contents of it; there was written in it to this Effect:</p>
               <p>TAUNTON <hi>in</hi> Somerſetſhire <hi>is the place to which all are to reſort; the Perſons to be acquainted with the time of land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are the Lord</hi> Macclesfield, <hi>the Lord</hi> Brandon, <hi>and the Lord</hi> Delamere; <hi>the place to ſend the Coach to, is to</hi> Taunton <hi>to</hi> Mr. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages <hi>Houſe at the</hi> Red Lyon; <hi>the place where the Poſt was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to return, was Captain</hi> Matthews <hi>Lodging, at</hi> Mr. Blake<hi>'s, and he was to receive the meſſage, or if he did not, he was to appoint one that ſhould receive it; or if it were to return to any other place, that was left to him to do as he thought fit.</hi> And this was all, as near as I can remember; when I had ſeen this, I came to <hi>London,</hi> and being very weary and tired, when I came home, I went to Bed</p>

               <p>I came out of <hi>Holland</hi> the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> I came home the 27<hi>th,</hi> and looking upon my Almanack, I find that it was the Wedneſday Fortnight before the Duke landed, that I came; when I was come home, I ſent for Mr. <hi>Diſney,</hi> and he came to me imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; I told him I had ſeen the Duke, and deſired that he would help me to the ſpeech of Captain <hi>Matthews</hi>; he told me he was out of Town too; then I deſired to ſpeak with Major <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:53536:20"/>
he told me he was gone out of Town too; then I told him I muſt deliver my Meſſage to him, and I told him this meſſage as I have told your Lordſhips before, and therefore left it to him to convey it to the knowledg of thoſe Lords that were concerned; he did ſeem to be unwilling, and told me he did not know how to communicate it to thoſe Lords, and asked me why I would not deliver the Meſſage my ſelf; I told him I did ask the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> that very queſtion, whether I might, and he had forbid me, and ordered me to deliver it either to Captan <hi>Matthews,</hi> or to Major <hi>Wildman</hi>; and ſince they were abſent, I knew not any to communicate it to, but only to him, in order to their having notice of it. He told me he would do what he could.</p>

               <speaker>Jones,</speaker>
               <p>There was none preſent but himſelf then, for it was the firſt time that I ſpoke with him after I came from <hi>Holland</hi>; I told him there was a Poſt to go to receive intelligence, which ſhould bring notice of his landing, 24 Hours before it could be known at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and therefore it were fit they ſhould be in a readineſs; he did ſcruple at it, and ſaid he did not know where to get any one that could convey the Meſſage to them, but he would do what he could; and concluded to meet at night in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and he did ſo, and there were two Perſons with him, Mr. <hi>Crag,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Liſle,</hi> and another, I think his name was <hi>Brand,</hi> and he took me and <hi>Brand</hi> aſide, and did ask me where was the place that the Poſt was to go; I told him where, and then he did diſcourſe of the Dukes coming over, but I mentioned not any thing of the Lords, but only to <hi>Diſney</hi>; and after an hours talk or thereabouts, we parted. I ſaw Mr. <hi>Diſney</hi> once afterwards, but what he did with the Meſſage I cannot tell, he gave me no account of it; I did indeed before I went out of Town ſee him at the Half-Moon Tavern in <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> I went out of Town, and met the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> at <hi>Lyme</hi> where he Landed, and when I came to him, I told him what I had done with my Meſſage, and how it happened that I could not deliver it to the perſons that he had ordered; the Duke told me he was ſatisfied that I had done what I could, but ſeemed to be troubled that <hi>Matthews</hi> was out of Town. And this is the ſum of what paſſed in my knowledg as near as I can remember.</p>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:53536:23"/>

               <speaker>Bab.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. Attorney, I will give an account of that afterwards, but I have ſomething elſe to ſay firſt; After this, I was diligent to know of my Uncle <hi>Vermuyden</hi> and my brother, who this Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> was; my Uncle told me it was my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> and deſired me whenever I diſcourſed of him, to call him by that name, and I have very good reaſon to believe Mr. <hi>Vermuyden</hi> knew of the matter, becauſe he was acquainted with a great many of that ſort of people, and declared he had collected and knew of moneys that were gathered for that purpoſe; and he had a good account of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s landing, and of the Force he had in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and how long it was preſumed that he could maintain that Force without aſſiſtance from any body elſe, and ſo I preſume he was very well acquainted with the whole Tranſaction: Afterwards I happened to be at <hi>Diſney</hi>'s over the Water, there was my Brother <hi>Paunceford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> and my ſelf.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Diſney</hi> ſhew'd me a Declaration that was not perfected quite, but after that we fell into a diſcourſe about Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> and afterwards my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi>'s name was named by ſome body, that ſome of the Declarations were to be ſent to him, and I remember Mr. <hi>Diſney</hi> ſaid he was afraid my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> was not capable of doing that ſervice that was expected from him in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> for want of ſome of thoſe Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, which would be mighty uſeful to him to inform the people, they being <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Declarations.</p>

               <p>My Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> I had this very thing in my thoughts before I came hither this Day, becauſe I did foreſee that this was likely to be a long Cauſe, and the proceeding in it would take up much time: I have a little doubt, I muſt needs ſay in my own mind, whether it may be done by Law; I know very well, if this were a Trial in full Parliament, there have been Precedents to warrant the Adjournment till another Day, though it be in the midſt of a Trial; and in the middle of the Evidence: But this Court, I take to be of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though of a degree higher, with the other ordinary Courts of Judicature; and whether it be not obliged and tied up to the ſame Method of Proceeding with thoſe other Courts, where all Capital Offences are tried, is a thing I am in ſome doubt about: In thoſe Courts it has not been uſual to Adjourn the Court after Evidence given; nay, it has been ſometimes a Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Judges in thoſe Courts, after the Jury are gone from the Barr, to conſider of their Verdict, could Adjourn themſelves: I ſay, the Judges have ſometimes made a Doubt of it, though I know, the Point is now ſettled, and the Practice is, that they may, and do: But this is moſt certain, after the Evidence given, the Jury cannot be Adjourned, but muſt proceed in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and be kept together till they are agreed of their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; this has cauſed ſome Heſitancy in me, what the Law may be in this Caſe; therefore I think it may be proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with my Lords the Judges; for I deſire, the thing may be conſidered and ſettled.</p>

               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I humbly beg this Favour of your Grace, but to Adjourn till to morrow.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>With all my heart, my Lord, if it may be done by Law.</p>

               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>I hope it may, my Lord, and I beg that Favour of your Grace.</p>

               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhould be very glad to comply with your Lordſhip's deſires, but truly I have conſidered of it, and do doubt whether I can by Law do it: In full Parliament it is clear it may be done, but upon this Commiſſion, after my Lords the Peers are once charged, and the Evidence partly given, whether I can then Adjourn them till another Day, is with me a Doubt: My Lords, if your Lordſhips pleaſe, before
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53536:27"/>
ſuch time as my Lord, the Priſoner at the Barr, enters upon his Defence, I will with your leave propound the Queſtion to my Lords the Judges, and hear their Opinion what the Law is.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I ſhall hardly be able to finiſh all I have to ſay in any convenient time this Day.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>There has a great deal been ſaid, and it will require a great deal of time to give it an Anſwer.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but if it cannot be done as you would have it, we muſt be contented to ſtay the longer together; for I would not abridge you of your Defence; therefore, my Lords the Judges, if you will pleaſe to go together and conſider of it, and report your Opinions, what the Law is in this Caſe, and we will ſtay till you come again?</p>

               <p>My <hi>Lord High Steward,</hi> I do humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, this is a Matter that concerns the Priviledge of the Peers, and becauſe it is a Matter that doth ſo much concern the whole Peerage; I think, my Lords here ought in ſome meaſure to concern them ſelves about it: Therefore, my Lord, I have a ſhort Motion to make to your Grace, that, conſidering the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that the Precedent of this Caſe may draw with it, ſince, my Lords the Judges, are gone together to conſult of this Point, of which, I may ſay, they are not altogether the ſole Judges: We may alſo withdraw to conſider of this Matter with them, becauſe it may not be proper for my Lords in Publick here, to offer what they may have to ſay, to incline my Lords the Judges in their Judgments one way or other?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Falconberge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I humbly offer this to your Grace, upon the Motion that this Noble Lord has made, that, with Submiſſion, I take this to be a thing that concerns the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Peerage only, and I conceive the Judges are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to make any Determination of that Matter. I think therefore, my Lords here ought to retire with them to conſider of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, I think, with Submiſſion to your Lordſhips, that this is a Queſtion naturally proper for my Lords the Judges to give their Opinions in, whether this Court, as a Court of Judicature for the Trial of this Noble Lord, may,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53536:28"/>
in the midſt of the Tryal adjourn till another day: And the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Peerage cannot at all come in queſtion here as I conceive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Falconberg.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, that we conceive is a point of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge which certainly the inferior Courts can have no power to determine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Lords.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, withdraw, withdraw.</p>

            <stage>Then the Peers withdrew, and after half an hour the Judges returned and took their places as before, and after about an hour the Peers returned to their former places.</stage>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward,</speaker>
               <p>My Lords the Judges have you conſidered of the Matter that has been propoſed to you, and what is your Opinion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Herbert.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace, the Judges in obedience to your Graces Commands have withdrawn, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of what your Grace propoſed to them, and with humble Submiſſion they take the Queſtion to be this.</p>
               <p>Not, whether your Grace may Adjourn your Commiſſion from one day to another, for that is clear you may, and has been practiſed, for that is the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Somerſet</hi> and his Wife.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion is, Whether, after the Priſoner is upon his Tryall, and the Evidence for the King is given, the Lords being, as we may term it, Charged with the Priſoner, the Peers, Tryers, may ſeparate for a time, which is the conſequent of an Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another day.</p>
               <p>And my Lord the Judges preſume to acquaint your Grace, that this is a matter wholly new to them, and that they know not upon recollection of all that they can remember to have read, that either this matter was done, or queſtioned, whether it might or might not be done in any Caſe.</p>
               <p>My Lord, If the matter had been formerly done, or been brought into queſtion in any Caſe, where it had received a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and reported in any of our Books of Law, then it would have been our duty to contribute all our Reading and Experience for the ſatisfaction of this great Court: But being, as it is, a new queſtion, and a queſtion that not only concerns the particular Caſe of this Noble Lord at the Barr, but is to be a preſident in all Caſes of the like nature for the future: All we can do is, to acquaint your Grace and my Noble Lords, what the Law is in the inferiour Courts in Caſes of the like nature, and the Reaſon of the Law in thoſe points, and then leave the Juriſdiction of this Court to its proper Judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:53536:28"/>My Lord, in the firſt place, where the Tryal is by a Jury, there the Law is clear, the Jury once charged can never be diſcharged till they have given their Verdict, this is clear; and the reaſon of that is, for fear of Corruption, and tampering with the Jury, an Officer is ſworn to keep the Jury together without permitting them to ſeparate or any one to converſe with them; for no man knows what may happen, for (though the Law requires honeſt men ſhould be returned upon Juryes, and without a known Objection are preſumed to be <hi>probi &amp; legales homines,</hi> yet) they are weak men, and perhaps may be wrought upon by undue Applications.</p>
               <p>This, My Lord, it is ſaid, fails in this Caſe, becauſe the Lords that are to try a Peer, are Perſons of that great Integrity and Honour, that there is not the leaſt preſumption of their being to be prevailed upon in any ſuch way; and for that reaſon, becauſe of the confidence which the Law repoſes (and juſtly) in Perſons of their Quality, they are not ſworn as common ordinary Jurors are, but are charged and deliver their Verdict upon Honour.</p>
               <p>My Lord, in the Caſe of a Tryal of a Peer in Parliament, as your Grace was pleaſed to obſerve, and as is very well known by late Experience, there the matter has been Adjourned till another day, and for divers days; the Evidence being given in ſeveral Parcells, and yet there the danger is as great (if any were to be ſuppoſed) of tampering: But whether the Lords being Judges in that Caſe, and in this Caſe, only in the nature of a Jury makes the difference, though in both Caſes it is but like a Verdict, for they give their Opinions <hi>Seriatim,</hi> whether the Peer tryed be Guilty or not Guilty, that they ſubmit to your Graces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, My Lord, whether their being Judges in the one, and not in the other inſtance, alters the Caſe, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Reaſon of Law in inferiour Courts, why the Jury are not permitted to ſeperate till they have diſcharged themſelves by their Verdict, may have any influence upon this Caſe, where that reaſon ſeems to fail, the Priſoner being to be tryed by his Peers, that are men of unqueſtionable unſuſpected Integrity and Honour, we can't preſume ſo far as to make any Determination in a point that is both new to us, and of great Conſequence in it ſelf; but think it the propereſt way for us, having laid matters as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them before your Grace and my Lords, to ſubmit the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of your own Court to your own determination.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords; I confeſs I would always be very tender of the Priviledge of the Peers, wherever I find them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; but truly I apprehend, according to the beſt of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that this Court is held before me. It is my Warrant that convenes the Priſoner to this Barr. It is my Summons that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53536:29"/>
brings the Peers together to try him, and ſo I take my ſelf to be Judge of the Court.</p>
               <p>My Lords 'tis true may withdraw, and they may call the Judges to them to aſſiſt them, which ſhews they have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Priviledge in ſome Caſes more before the High Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than Juries have in inferior Courts in Caſes of common Perſons: For if it be in a common Caſe, no Jury can call either Counſell or Judges to aſſiſt them, in the abſence of the Priſoner, but if they will have advice, it muſt be asked in open Court in the preſence of the party accuſed.</p>
               <p>But now, My Lords, if you have a mind to conſult with me in private, as I now ſit by Virtue of this Commiſſion, which is his Majeſties Warrant for me to hold this Court, I could not withdraw with you, but you muſt ask all your queſtions of me, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Priſoner in open Court; whereas if it were in full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as were the Caſes of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> then he that were the High Steward might go along with you when you withdrew, and conſult with you, and give his Opinion, which I cannot do in this Caſe; for I am bound to ſit in Court, while you withdraw to conſider of the Evidence, and am not to hear any thing ſaid to me, but what is ſaid in open Court in the preſence of the Priſoner, except it be when you deliver your Verdict.</p>
               <p>This I confeſs my Lords has a great weight with me, and I know your Lordſhips will be very tender of proceeding in ſuch a Caſe any way but according to Law; For though you are Judges of your own Priviledges, yet, with Submiſſion, you are not Judges of the Law of this Court; for that I take to be my Province.</p>
               <p>Why then, Suppoſe my Lords, I ſhould take upon me to do as my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> deſires and adjourn the Court, and ſuppoſe the Law ſhould fall out to be that indeed I ought not ſo to have done, would it be any advantage to this Noble Peer, if he ſhould be acquitted by your Lorſhips after ſuch an Adjournment, might not the evil conſequence of that be, that he might be Indicted for the ſame crime, and tryed again? For all the Proceedings after that would be Void, and lyable to be reverſed.</p>
               <p>And if on the other ſide your Lordſhips ſhould think fit, upon the Evidence you have now heard, and what he ſhall ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to convict him after I have adjourned as is deſired, and I paſs Judgment upon him, as it will be a Duty incumbent upon me to paſs Sentence on him, if you convict him; what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Caſe then; and how ſhall I be able to anſwer it, as having done my duty, when I pronounce a Judgment notoriouſly Erroneous and Illegall? for ſo it will be, if the Law prove to be againſt my adjourning: This, my Lords, is a matter of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and worth the Conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:53536:29"/>But in the other Caſe of a Trial in full Parliament, the Lord that Sits where I do, is only as the Chairman of the Court ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Judge, he gives a Vote in ſuch proceedings; and therefore my Lord the Priſoner did very well at the beginning to ask the Queſtion, whether I had any Vote in his Tryal, as a Peer jointly with your Lordſhips: If I ſat in full Parliament I ſhould without all queſtion give my Vote as well as any other Peer, but ſitting here by immediate Commiſſion from the King <hi>pro hac vice,</hi> High Steward; I acquaint you as I did him, I have no authority to give any Vote: My Buſineſs is to ſee the Law obſerved and fulfilled as Judge.</p>
               <p>Certainly, My Lords, your Lordſhips and I, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ought to be tender of committing any Errors in Caſes of Life and Death, and I would be loath, I will aſſure you, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded for giving an Erroneous Judgment in a Caſe of Blood, and as the firſt man that ſhould bring in an illegal Precedent, the Conſequence of which may extend I know not how far.</p>

               <speaker>M. Att. General.</speaker>
               <p>Will your Grace give direction for my Lord to proceed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he muſt proceed I think.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace, and you my Lords, it is an offence of a very high Nature for which I am this day to anſwer before your Lordſhips; yet I thank God I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to ſpeak in this place, becauſe I am not only certain and very well aſſured of my own Innocency, no ſuch thought having as yet entred into my heart; but I am alſo well aſſured of your Lordſhips Wiſdom and Juſtice, which cannot be impoſed upon or ſurprized by Inſinuations and florid Harangues, nor go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by any thing but the Juſtice of the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I can with a great deal of Comfort and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſay, that theſe Crimes wherewith I am charged are not only Strangers to my Thoughts, but alſo to what has been my conſtant Principle and Practice; For I think that in matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Church and the things enjoyned therein, few have conformed more in Practice then I have done; and yet I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and am not aſhamed to ſay it, that I have always had a Tenderneſs for all thoſe who could not keep pace with me, and Charity for thoſe that have outgone me, and differed from me, though never ſo far; nay though of a different Religion: For I always thought Religion lay more in Charity than Perſecution.</p>
               <p>While I had the Honour to be a Magiſtrate in my Country, I did conſtantly duly and impartially execute the Laws, and in every publick truſt I was very faithful in the Diſcharge of it, for I never voted nor ſpoke in any manner but as my Conſcience and Judgment did dictate to me. I have always made the Laws the meaſure of my Loyalty, and have ſtill been as Zealous and Careful to give the King his Prerogative, as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53536:30"/>
to preſerve to the people their Properties, and have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as far as in me lay to live peaceably with all men.</p>
               <p>This, My Lords, was not only the Dictates of my own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but it was the Principle of my lather, and the Leſſon that he taught me: I ſay of my Father, who was ſo greatly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in ſnatching this Nation out of its Confuſion, and reſtoring it to its ancient Government, by ſetling his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty upon his Throne, and conſequently was the means of his preſent Majeſty that now is, his coming ſo peaceably to the Crown: And this I may the more boldly ſpeak, becauſe I ſpeak it by good Authority; becauſe in the Patent that created my Father a Peer, his late Majeſty is pleaſed to ſay, his riſing was mainly inſtrumental in his Reſtoration. I beg the Favour of your Grace and my Lords, that I may read to you that Clauſe in the preamble of the Patent, which I have here ready to produce.</p>
               <stage>
                  <hi>Which was read, and then, my Lord proceeded as follows,</hi> viz.</stage>
               <p>My Lords, I ſuppoſe moſt of your Lordſhips did know him, and whoſoever did ſo, I dare ſay did believe him to be a good man: For my part I did not know a better Copy to write after than his Example, which I endeavoured always to imitate, and that I hope will go very far to vindicate me from the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of being inclined to any ſuch Crime as I ſtand charged with.</p>
               <p>My Lords, it is now late, and therefore I ſhall cut off a great deal of what I had intended to ſay to your Lordſhips, that I may not take up too much of your time, and come immediately to my Defence, as to what I ſtand accuſed of.</p>
               <p>And firſt, my Lords, I ſhall obſerve that here have been a great many Witneſſes produced, and a great deal of Swearing, but little or nothing of Legal Evidence to affect me; for there is but one man that ſaith any thing home and poſitively againſt me (and whom I ſhall anſwer by and by) all the reſt are but Hear-ſays, and ſuch remote Circumſtances, as may be tacked to any Evidence againſt any other perſon, but are urged againſt me for want of greater matters to charge me with; and therefore I hope the producing and preſſing of theſe things againſt me, is rather a ſtrong Argument that I am Innocent, and that there have been miſchievous and ill deſigns of ſome againſt me, than that I am guilty; for if they had had other and greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, your Lordſhips would have been ſure to have heard of them.</p>
               <p>With your Lordſhips leave, I cannot but obſerve to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips an excellent ſaying of that great man my Lord of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi> (whoſe Name will ever be remembred with Honour in our Engliſh Nation,) when he ſate in the ſame place that your Grace does now, at the Tryal of my Lord <hi>Cornwallis,</hi> which I will read to your Lordſhips. Speaking to the Peers he has this paſſage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:53536:30"/>
                  <hi>I know your Lordſhips will weigh the Fact, with all its circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from which it is to receive its true and its proper Doom. Your Lordſhips are too juſt to let Pity make any abatement for the Crime, and too wiſe to ſuffer Rhetorick to make any Improvement of it: This only will be neceſſary to be obſerved by all your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, that the fowler the Crime is, the clearer and plainer ought the Proof of it to be; there is no other good Reaſon can be given, why the Law refuſeth to allow the Priſoner at the Bar Counſel in matter of Fact, when Life is concerned, but only this, becauſe the Evidence by which he is condemned ought to be ſo very evident and ſo plain, that all the Council in the world ſhould not be able to anſwer it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, I think the Evidence that has been given againſt me this day does not come up to this. And I hope your Lordſhips will regard this ſaying of my Lord <hi>Nottinghams,</hi> as more worthy of your conſideration, than the fine Flouriſhings and Inſinuations of the Kings Council, which tend (if it be not ſo deſigned) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to miſguide your Lordſhips, than to lead you to find out the Truth.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I ſhall now tell you the method that I ſhall proceed in, in making my Defence; and I begin with <hi>Saxon,</hi> for he I perceive is the great <hi>Goliah,</hi> whoſe Evidence is to maintain this Accuſation, and if I cut him down, I ſuppoſe I ſhall be thought to have done my own buſineſs; therefore to that I ſhall apply my ſelf firſt, and do it if I can; and I will in the firſt place examine ſeveral perſons that are his Neighbours and have converſed, with him what they have heard and know of him; and firſt I deſire <hi>Richard Hall</hi> may be called</p>

               <p>About the nineteenth of <hi>December</hi> in the year 1683, I received a Letter by <hi>Thomas Saxon</hi> from <hi>Richard Hildage,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he deſired me to ſend him the ſum of ſix pounds odd money which I owed him; I received the Letter and paid the money, and to the beſt of my knowledge ſome little time after I met with the ſaid <hi>Hildage</hi> at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> who asked me to pay him the money I owed him: I replyed I had paid the money, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Note, but he ſaid he never gave any ſuch Note, and threatned to ſue me; thereupon I ſent one <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Hildage,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:53536:31"/>
that is here now in the Court, and deſired <hi>Hildage</hi> his forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for a while, till I could get the money from <hi>Saxon</hi> back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and afterwards he ſent again for his money, and I ſent to <hi>Saxon</hi> for it, but ſtill the money did not come.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>Did you ever ſpeak with <hi>Saxon</hi> himſelf?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hall.</speaker>
               <p>No, but with his wife, who came to me about it, but he acknowledged, he wrote the Letter before <hi>John Lord.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Saxon.</speaker>
               <p>Did not my wife tell you that <hi>Richard Hildage</hi> lent me the money?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, you muſt not Dialogue with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but if you have any queſtions you muſt propound them to the Court: My Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> have you any more queſtions to ask him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>Then what is it you would have him asked, <hi>Saxon?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Saxon.</speaker>
               <p>I deſire you would pleaſe to ask him whether or no, he did not lend me the money?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Richard Hildage</hi> did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>What ſay you did <hi>Richard Hildage</hi> lend him the money?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hall.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> the Objection carries a great deal of weight in it, to prove him a very ill man, if it be fully made out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, if your Grace pleaſe I can prove that he owned the writing of the Letter to another man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, he does own here, that he wrote the Letter and that he wrote it in <hi>Hildage's</hi> name, but he ſaith, the Letter he ſo wrote in <hi>Hildage's</hi> Name was by <hi>Hildage's</hi> directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and if ſo, that takes off the Objection made againſt him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt ſubmit that to your Grace, whether what he ſays in that matter be Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>What <hi>Hildage</hi> did, or did not, is the main turn of the queſtion in this Caſe; for he might lend him the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and yet afterwards might ſay, when he thought he might loſe it, that he did not ſend any ſuch Letter, and all this be true, and <hi>Saxon</hi> in no fault: I muſt confeſs, if <hi>Hildage</hi> were here, himſelf, and ſhould deny the lending of the money, or the giving him Directions to receive it, you would have fixed a ſhrewd Objection upon him; but otherwiſe Hear-ſays and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at ſecond hand are not to take off the Credit of any mans Teſtimony.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>But <hi>Hall</hi> ſays <hi>Hildage</hi> denyed the receipt of the money, or any Order for receiving of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>That ſignifies nothing, being but by ſecond hand.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Saxon.</speaker>
               <p>If it pleaſe your Grace, here is my Brother in Court will give you an account of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hough.</speaker>
               <p>For ſeven Pounds.</p>

               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Saxon.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I had five Pounds ten Shillings of him in money, and ten Shillings in work, for which I gave him Bond, there were the Witneſſes names at it, the Bond was fairly read, and I ſealed it, and he took it with him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but he ſays it was to be for ſeven Pounds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Saxon.</speaker>
               <p>I never had any more of him than ſix Pounds, and for that I gave him Bond.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>Was the Bond read to you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hough.</speaker>
               <p>He read it himſelf, and he made it himſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>How did he read it? What did you apprehend by his reading it was made for?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hough.</speaker>
               <p>I took it as he read it to be made for ſeven Pounds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Saxon.</speaker>
               <p>He may ſay what he pleaſes, but I had no more of him but ſix Pounds; I was to give Bond for no more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>Now the Witneſſes to this Bond would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper to be produced here: For, if he did make the Bond but for ſix Pounds, when the Debt that was to be ſecured was ſeven Pounds, that is a ſign that he had an intention to cheat him of the twenty Shillings.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>But this is but Witneſs againſt Witneſs, for he ſays he owed no more, and was to make the Bond for no more.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Heveningham.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, It was a more than ordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that makes me remember the thing and the time ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. I was engaged in a diſpute in the Houſe of Commons about my own Election, and that was upon the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> then was a Caſe debated in the Houſe, whether a Mayor that was elected a Burgeſſe for any Town could ſit upon his own Return, it was then carried he ſhould not, and the next day which was the third of <hi>June,</hi> another queſtion came on, whether Sir <hi>Joſeph Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamſon</hi> was duly elected and returned, and I remember at that time I was walking with Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> in the Court of Requeſts, and Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> came out of the Houſe, and told me, that it was carried by five, that he was not, and then Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> was with me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
               <p>So you ſpeak as to the 2<hi>d</hi> and 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>June?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Heveningham.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, had it not been upon this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occaſion, I could not have remembred the time ſo exactly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
               <p>You give a very good token for your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and my Lords hear what you have ſaid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>Will your Grace pleaſe that the Clerk of the Houſe of Commons may be called, and examined to the Journal of that Houſe, when it was Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> preferred his Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that will fix the time as to what Mr. <hi>Aſhburnham</hi> and Sir <hi>William Twiſden</hi> have ſaid?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
               <p>Call whom you pleaſe, My Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>It ſeems he is not ready, but I hope I have given your Grace and my Lords ſufficient ſatisfaction, that Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> was not there at that time that this fellow ſpeaks of. I will now go on and prove Mr. <hi>Offley</hi> was not there neither, and the firſt Witneſs I call to that, ſhall be Sir <hi>Willoughby Aſton,</hi> whom I deſire your Grace will be pleaſed to hear ſpeak in his place.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Well, what do you ſay, Sir <hi>Willoughby</hi>?</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>Pray can you remember, <hi>Sir Willoughby,</hi> what time it was, and whether about the latter end of <hi>May</hi> laſt, or when, that you know of Mr. <hi>Offley's</hi> being at your Houſe, and how long he ſtayed there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir W. Aſton.</speaker>
               <p>I can give an account of his Motion for ten days together, but that perhaps may be more than is neceſſary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
               <p>It will not be improper, Sir, for you to give as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and partiular account as you can of the times.</p>

               <p>It was that day Sennight before I went out of Town, which was <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> and had it not been for that particular circumſtance, I had not remark'd it ſo much as to be able particularly to remember it.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Booth.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell, but I ſaw him upon the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>June</hi> in the Evening.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it is not poſſible for him ſo to do in that time, if he rode Poſt.</p>

               <p>But pray; my Lord, mind the Objection that has been made, for it carries a great deal of weight in it.

               <p>My Lord, I am certain I ſaw him that day in the Evening, and ſo on to the 10<hi>th.</hi>

               <p>I vvas in the Houſe of Lords that day that my Lord <hi>Macclesfield</hi>'s Tryal was, and I remember I did ſee my Lord <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamere</hi> there.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I hope now I have ſatisfied your Grace, and the reſt of my Lords, that none of us three whom this fellow has mentioned were there at that time at <hi>Mere,</hi> when he ſays we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53536:37"/>
were: For my own part I do poſitively affirm, and I ſpeak it as in the preſence of Almighty God, that I have not ſeen Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> at my houſe that I know of theſe many years, and I believe Mr. <hi>Oſſley</hi> was never in my Houſe ſince I was Maſter of it: And I do likewiſe proteſt that, to my knowledge, I never ſaw the face of this Man till now that be is produced as a witneſs againſt me; I am ſure I never ſpoke with him in all my life, nor never ſent for him to come to my houſe: And if your Lordſhip pleaſe to conſider the Story that he tells, it will eaſily appear to be very improbable, for he neither tells you vvho the Meſſenger was that was ſent for him, nor the way that he came into the Houſe, which any body that has ever been at the Houſe could not miſtake. For when I asked him what door it was he came in at it was for this reaſon, becauſe he muſt needs have gone a great way about, if he had not come in at the uſual Entry into the houſe, for I have but one door into my houſe except that by the Stables, which is a great vvay off the houſe? and it being about that time of the year, if it were 8 or 9 of the Clock in the Evening, he muſt needs diſcern which way he came in: And, beſides, My Lords, Is it probable what he ſays, that he ſhould ſee no body ſtirring about the Houſe except it were this man without a hand, that he ſays was ſent for him? I aſſure your Lordſhips, I have not, nor had my Father ever, that I know of, any Servant or Tennant that was maimed in that manner that he ſpeaks of; he ſaith, he was recommended to us by my Lord <hi>Brandon:</hi> But he cannot tell your Lordſhip any thing that ever he had done, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him either to him or us: I did ask him what important Service he had ever done for me, that might give a credibility to my imploying him in ſuch a buſineſs as this. My Lord, I cannot help it, if People will tell falſe Stories of me, but I hope your Lordſhips will conſider the credibility of it; Is it to be imagined that I would take a man I knew nothing of, upon another mans word, into ſo great a confidence, as to employ him about a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Nature? I am glad that he was called in here again for your Lordſhips to view him, I beſeech your Lordſhips to look at him; Is this Fellow a likely Fellow to be uſed in ſuch an Affair? Does he look as if he were fit to be employed for the raiſing of ten thouſand men? Does he ſeem to be a man of ſuch conſiderable Intereſt in his Countrey? A Fellow, that though it be not direct Evidence, yet by ſeveral Witneſſes, I have ſhewn to be a Man of no Reputation in his Country, nay of a very ill one; and could we have none elſe to employ in a matter of this moment but ſuch a Fellow as his Neighbours would not take his word for any thing? It is an improbable Story upon theſe accounts, if I ſhould ſay no more. Your Lordſhips likewiſe ſee, that he is ſo well thought of, that he dare not be truſted out of <hi>Newgate,</hi> but is kept ſtill a Priſoner, and as ſuch gives Evidence here: And I know your Lordſhips will not forget that he ſwears to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53536:37"/>
having been a Rebel by his own Confeſſion, and he would fain exchange his Life for mine, till he has a Pardon, which as yet, as I am informed, he has not; the Objection will ſtill lye upon him, that he ſwears to ſave himſelf, which will render his Teſtimony not credible, and the Law requires the Witneſſes, in Treaſon, to be credible ones: And yet, forſooth! this Man, that no body that knows him will believe a word he ſays, muſt be taken to be the man of Integrity, Zeal, and Induſtry; the man of Management and Diſpatch, the Man of Intereſt and Authority in his Countrey, that nothing can be done, but he muſt have a hand in it. My Lords, I think I need ſay no more of him; your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips time is precious, too precious indeed to be ſpent upon ſuch a Subject, and ſo I ſet him aſide.</p>
               <p>My Lords, there is a thing that I perceive the King's Counſel lay a great weight upon, and that is my going down upon the 27<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> and my frequent riding Poſt to and fro. I ſhall now ſatisfie your Lordſhips of the Reaſons of my Journeys. The firſt time which was betwixt the Coronation and the ſitting of the Parliament was upon this reaſon; I went down to take poſſeſſion upon a Leaſe of a conſiderable value which was renewed to me by the Biſhop. I did not think of going down at that time ſo ſoon; but I had word wrote me out of the Countrey that the Biſhop was ill, and that obliged me in point of Intereſt to make haſte down. And this I ſhall prove by one that was Attorny for me, and another that was a witneſs of my taking Poſſeſſion: And for this, I firſt call Mr. <hi>John Edmonds</hi> 
                  <stage>who came in</stage> Pray Sir, will you tell his Grace and my Lords, what you know of my coming down into the Countrey in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and upon what account, and what time it was?</p>

               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, I hope this a ſatisfactory reaſon for my going down at that time, the Biſhop being ill, and the Leaſe being worth 6 or 7000 <hi>l.</hi> The next time that I have to ſpeak to, is, That of my going the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> And for that I give this anſwer; I did go out of Town the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> The occaſion of my going was, I had taken up a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution before to go ſee my Child that was not well, but I had not taken my Journey ſo ſoon, nor with ſuch privacy, but that I had notice, there was a Warrant out to apprehend me, and knowing the inconveniences of lying in Priſon, I was very willing to keep as long out of Cuſtody as I could, and therefore I went out of the way, and under a borrowed name. When I came to my houſe in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> there were not above 5 of my own Servants that ſaw me all the while I was there, and I ſaw no body but them, but while I was there my Wife ſent me an Expreſs, that as to the Warrant ſhe hoped it was a miſtake, and there was no ſuch thing; but my eldeſt Son was very ill, and if I intended to ſee him alive I muſt make haſte up, this was the occaſion of my quick return, and I ſhall ſatisfie your Lordſhips by Proof, that I came thither in that manner to avoid the Warrant, and for no other Reaſon.</p>

               <p>My Lords, This Child of his that was in the Countrey, was more than ordinarily pretious to him, in regard it was born to him at that time, when he was an innocent honeſt Man, (as he is now a Priſoner in the Tower for high Treaſon,) above two years ago, and I think it increaſed his affection to the Child, that God had given it to him when he was in that affliction, My Lord, I knowing the affection that the Father and Mother both had to the Child, my care in their abſence I thought ought to be more exerciſed about him: The Child sucked, but I <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <speaker>L. Delamere.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, I acknowledge I did go at that time privately a By-Road, and by the name of <hi>Brown,</hi> and as for <hi>Jones,</hi> who it is ſaid came from <hi>Holland</hi> that day, I appeal to him himſelf, and I call God to Witneſs I never ſaw the man before now in my life; nay, till after I was made a Priſoner upon this account, I never ſo much as heard of his Name; and your Lordſhips ſee by the Proofs, that all that has been ſaid againſt me, except what this Fellow <hi>Saxon</hi> has teſtified, is but hearſay, nay indeed but hearſay upon hearſay at the third and fourth hand.</p>
               <p>My Lords, if People will make uſe of my name, and ſay this, and that, and the other, and among themſelves talk of Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſent to me; can I or any man in the world help it? at this rate who can be innocent, If a man muſt be guilty becauſe others intend to draw him into Treaſon? For there is no more in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that this proof can amount unto. It is at the pleaſure of any two men in the world, to take away the Lives, Honours, and Eſtates of any of your Lordſhips, if it be a proof ſufficient to make you guilty of Treaſon, for them to ſwear you were intended to be drawn into Treaſon.</p>
               <p>And, my Lords, as to the truth of the thing it ſelf, that there was any Meſſage or Correſpondence between the late <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> and me, I call God to witneſs I have neither wrote nor ſent Letter or Meſſage to him, or received Letter or Meſſage from him, this 3 years: I cannot tell what expectation he might have concerning me or any body elſe. It is very probable he might have expectation of aſſiſtance from ſome body, and that without ſuch expectations he would not have made the attempt he did: But, my Lords, all that is nothing to me, I had no correſpondence
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53536:41"/>
either by Letters or Meſſages with him, ſo that all that has been ſaid upon that point of his expectation, and what he declared, I muſt give the ſame anſwer to that I gave to the Evidence about <hi>Jones</hi>'s Meſſage, That admitting it to be true, he did declare ſo, yet, no proof being made of an actual correſpondence, it is no more but only an intention in him to draw men into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Treaſon; and if that be allow'd for proof of guilt, I muſt repeat it again, there's no man can be innocent.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, my Lord, I muſt leave my Caſe to the conſideration of your Lordſhips: I am not Maſter of ſo much Law or Rhetorick as the Kings Counſel, to plead in my own Cauſe, and I have had but little time to recollect and apply my defence to my accuſation, but I hope what Evidence I have offered has given your Lordſhips full ſatisfaction that I am not guilty of what I ſtand charged with.</p>
               <p>And after all that has been ſaid, my Lords, I would beg your Lordſhips to conſider this, that if in caſe I were guilty of theſe things, and were conſcious to my ſelf of having been ingaged in an Affair of this nature, can any man imagine I could have been ſo hardy as to have ſurrendred my ſelf upon the Kings Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nay, if I with thoſe other two Gentlemen that he has named, had had any tranſactions of this kind, with ſuch a Fellow as he has been made appear to be by his Neighbours (that muſt needs be thought a man of no Faith, becauſe of no Reputation, tho' he gives himſelf a great Character as a man of great Intereſt, of wonderful diſpatch and dexterity in the management of ſuch matters) ſo as at firſt ſight to put this large confidence in him; Can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined I ſo little regarded my own Life and all that is dear to me, as to have ſurrendred my ſelf, were it not that I was certain of my own innocence and integrity: Life it ſelf, my Lords, is to be preferred above all things but Honour and Innocence; And <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Skin for skin and all that a man hath will he give for his life,</hi> and why ſhould I be preſumed to have ſo little a value for it, as voluntarily to deliver up my ſelf to deſtruction, had I been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that there was any one, who could really teſtifie any thing that could hurt me.</p>
               <p>Beſides, My Lords, this very Fellow <hi>Saxon</hi> is but one Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and how far you will believe him, I muſt ſubmit it to you, but ſurely one Witneſs will never be ſufficient to convict a man of Treaſon, tho' thouſands of hear-ſays, and ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val circumſtances be tacked to it, eſpecially when they are tacked to an Evidence, which I dare ſay your Lordſhips are far from thinking it deſerves any Credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:53536:41"/>My Lords, I deſire your leave to ask this one Queſtion; Would not any of your Lordſhips think himſelf in a bad condition as to his Fortune, if he could produce no better Evidence to prove his Title to his Eſtate than what has been produced againſt me this day to take away my Life, and if ſuch Evidence as this would not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupport a Title to an Eſtate, certainly it can never be thought ſufficient to deprive a man of Life, Honour, Eſtate, and all.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I am not the only Man that has been or may be falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed; God knows how ſoon the misfortune of a Falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation may fall to the Lot of any of your Lordſhips; I pray God it never may, but ſince that may happen, I queſtion not, but your Lordſhips will be very cautious, how by an eaſy Credulity you give incouragement to ſuch a wickedneſs: For Knights of the Poſt will not end in my Tryal if they proſper in their Villany, and perhaps it may come home to ſome of your Lordſhips, if ſuch practices be incouraged, as I cannot but firmly believe they will not.</p>
               <p>My Lords, the Eyes of all the Nation are upon your Proceedings this day; Nay I may ſay, your Lordſhips are now Judging the cauſe of every man in <hi>England,</hi> that ſhall happen to come under like Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with my Self at any time hereafter: For accordingly as you judge of me now, juſt ſo will inferior Courts be directed to give their Judgments in like Caſes in time to come.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhips very well know, Blood once ſpilt can never be gathered up agen, and therefore unleſs the Caſe be very clear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, you I am ſure will not hazard the ſhedding of my blood upon a doubtful Evidence: God Almighty is a God of Mercy and Equity: Our Law, the Law of <hi>England,</hi> is a Law of Equity and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and both God and the Law require from your Lordſhips Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all Caſes of Life and Death, and if it ſhould be indifferent, or but doubtful to your Lordſhips (which upon the Proofes that I have made, I cannot believe it can be) whether I am innocent or guilty, both God and the Law require you to acquit me.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I leave my Self, my Cauſe and all the Conſequences of it with your Lordſhips; And I pray the All-Wiſe the Almighty God direct you in your Determination.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Soll. General.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace, and you my Noble Lords the Peers of my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> the Priſoner at the Barr.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:53536:42"/>The Evidence that hath been given againſt this Noble Lord is of two Natures, part of it is poſitive Proof, and part is circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and though it be allowed that there muſt be two Witneſſes in Caſes of Treaſon, and that Circumſtances tho never ſo ſtrong, and ſufficient to fortify one poſitive Proof, do not nor can make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond poſitive Witneſs; Yet I crave leave to ſay, that there may be Circumſtances ſo ſtrong and cogent, ſo violent and neceſſary to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify a poſitive Teſtimony, that will in Law amount to make a ſecond Witneſs ſuch as the Law requires.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I do not ſay every Circumſtance will do it, but ſuch as neceſſarily and violently tending to the ſame thing that was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively proved.</p>
               <stage>As for Example.</stage>
               <p>If a man comes and Swears againſt another that he ſaid he will go immediately and kill the King, and another man that did not hear thoſe words, comes and teſtifies his Lying in wait, that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Lying in wait, that was an action indifferent in it ſelf, yet, when applyed to the poſitive Proof, will be a ſecond witneſs to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Law, which requires two witneſſes in Treaſon.</p>
               <p>It muſt confeſs, My Lords, when we will make Circumſtances to be a ſecond Evidence, they muſt be ſuch as are neceſſarily tending to fortifie the poſitive Evidence that was given by the ſingle Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Now whether that be ſo in this Caſe, I muſt, as becomes me, leave to your Lordſhips Conſideration: It is not my buſineſs to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Evidence further than it will go, and I am ſure it is not my duty to let it loſe any of its weight; and if it have not that force it ought to have, I ſhould be to blame, as not having done what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to me to do: I will therefore ſtate the Fact to your Lordſhips plainly as it ſtands upon the Proof, and ſubmit the whole to your Lordſhips Determination.</p>
               <p>My Lords, Our poſitive Proof with which I crave leave to begin, is but by one, ſingle Witneſs, and that is <hi>Saxon,</hi> and his Evidence is this, That being in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> where he lives, he was ſent for about the 3<hi>d</hi> or 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> laſt to my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Mere,</hi> and there he was brought into a Lower Room, where he ſaw my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crew Offley</hi>: That my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> told him he had received a Meſſage lately by one <hi>Jones,</hi> that was ſent from the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whereby he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that the Duke would ſpeedily be in <hi>England,</hi> and that they muſt provide Men and Arms to aſſiſt him when he came; That he was a Man recommended to them by my Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> and that upon his recommendation they had thought fit to intruſt him in the matter, and withal told him, They were to raiſe 40000 <hi>l.</hi> and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53536:42"/>
10000 Men in that County: He tells you likewiſe, theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men gave him 11 Guineys and 5 <hi>l.</hi> in Silver to go of an Errand for them to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> which he undertook to do, and hired a Horſe to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>This, My Lords, is the poſitive Proof, and this, I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſtanding-ſingle and by it ſelf, will make but one Witneſs; but whether the Circumſtances that have been offered to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips by the other Witneſſes, be ſuch violent Circumſtances as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily tend to fortifie and ſupport that poſitive Evidence, and ſo will ſupply the defect of a ſecond Witneſs, is the next queſtion that I come to conſider, and I ſhall take them into conſideration in the ſame order that the Evidence was delivered.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtep, My Lords, that was made as to any Evidence that toucheth this Noble Lord at the Bar, was what was teſtified by my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> (for as to the other part of the Evidence that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Conſpiracy in general, I need not trouble your Lordſhips with the repetition of it (that there was ſuch an one is notoriouſly known) but I ſay that part of the Evidence in his Hiſtory of the Conſpiracy, which my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> brought home to my Lord <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi> was this,</p>
               <p>That upon the firſt Meetings and Conſultations, it was reſolved upon, That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſhould go into <hi>Cheſhire</hi> to make an Intereſt there, and among the Perſons that he was directed to go to, and to apply himſelf to for advice there, as Perſons fit to be truſted, this Noble Lord was one.</p>
               <p>That upon the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Return out of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> he did give his Confederates here in Town an Account, how well he had been received, and that he liked all things very well there: This my Lords, is the firſt Circumſtance offered that has been to you, to ſhew that he had a Confidence in my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi>; as a Principal Support of his Deſigns at that very time.</p>
               <p>The next thing that we offer, is this Meſſage of <hi>Jones</hi>'s, and for that, our Evidence has fully and plainly made it out to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, That <hi>Jones</hi> did go over into <hi>Holland,</hi> and his Buſineſs there was an Errand from <hi>Diſney</hi> and Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> and the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates here. The effect of his Meſſage was, That it was their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſhould go for <hi>Scotland</hi> and joyn with my Lord <hi>Argyle</hi>; but upon the Receipt of the Meſſage, he being angry, ſaid, It was too late for ſuch a Meſſage now, and he would come into <hi>England,</hi> for he was ready to Sail, and thereupon he did ſend this ſame <hi>Jones</hi> back again into <hi>England</hi> upon a Meſſage, to inform the Lords and others of his Party, among whom my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> was one, That he would have them betake themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53536:43"/>
their ſeveral Countries, and not ſtay to be taken or clap'd up here, for that, he did underſtand, was the deſign; and this Meſſage was delivered in Writing (now that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did write a Note and give it to <hi>Jones,</hi> is verified by my Lord <hi>Gray</hi>'s Teſtimony too) and this was Sealed up, and he was not to open it till he came to Sea, and when he did open it, he found it contained a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Place where he was to Land, and where he was to Rendezvouz, which was <hi>Taunton,</hi> and who were the Perſons that were to have Notice of it, among whoſe Names we find my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi>'s to be one; but he does likewiſe tell you, he was not the man that was to carry the Meſſage to theſe Perſons, but he was to deliver it to <hi>Matthews</hi> or <hi>Wildman,</hi> and they were to tranſmit it to the other Perſons.</p>
               <p>He tells you likewiſe, That when he came to Town, which was the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> he met neither with <hi>Matthews</hi> nor Major <hi>Wildman</hi>; whereupon being at a loſs what he ſhould do with his Meſſage, for want of thoſe other Perſons, he acquainted <hi>Diſney</hi> that was Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with his Errand, who promiſed to take care that it ſhould be delivered.</p>
               <p>This, My Lords, is all <hi>Jones</hi>'s Evidence, for <hi>Jones</hi> does not ſay that he himſelf acquainted, or that <hi>Diſney</hi> did acquaint my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> with the Meſſage.</p>
               <p>But here, My Lord, is the main Circumſtance that renders the matter ſuſpicious, That very Night that <hi>Jones</hi> came to Town, and <hi>Diſney</hi> being acquainted with the Meſſage, had undertaken to get it delivered, does my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> at Ten of the Clock at Night go out of Town, in the Company of two Friends under the Diſguiſe of the Name of <hi>Brown,</hi> and a Bye-Road, and ſo goes down to his own Houſe in <hi>Cheſhire</hi>; This I ſay, is the Circumſtance that renders the thing ſuſpicious.</p>
               <p>Now my Lords, if we do prove by ſuch ſufficient Evidence, as may make the matter manifeſt to you, that my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> had Notice of <hi>Jones</hi>'s Meſſage (for upon that Point the Caſe will turn, whether he had Notice ſuch a Meſſage was brought, that ſuch things were in agitation, ſuch Preparations made, and that they were all to go into the Country) then I ſay, his going down is a violent Preſumption, he had an intent to comply with the Meſſage, and joyn in the Deſign.</p>
               <p>But now, My Lords, comes the Queſtion, the main Queſtion, How is it made out that he had Notice, <hi>Jones</hi> brought ſuch a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:53536:43"/>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> indeed, My Lords, does not ſay that he himſelf imparted it to him, or that <hi>Diſney</hi> told him he had Communicated it, but I think there is another Witneſs, and that is <hi>Storey,</hi> who ſaith, That <hi>Brand,</hi> one that knew of the Meſſage, did acquaint him, that my Lord had received it at the Coffee-Houſe, and that Night went out of Town.</p>
               <p>It is true, My Lords, this is but a Hear-ſay, but that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed being matter of Fact, my Lord's going out of Town that Night, ſo late in the Night, and in ſuch an unuſual ſuſpicious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, gives more Credit to the Relation, than as a bare Hear-ſay could have of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>For unleſs there be ſome good account given of my Lords thus going out of Town, it is a kind of neceſſary Preſumption, that he acquainted with the Meſſage, part of which was, That he ſhould go out of Town; and if ſo, it can have no other Conſtruction, with Submiſſion, than to be in purſuance of, and complying with the Directions that that Meſſage brought him from the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, to carry this a little further, there were two Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes produced that went out of Town with him; they ſeem indeed unwillingly to give their Evidence, but I ſhall faithfully repeat what Teſtimony they gave: Their Names were <hi>Vaux</hi> and <hi>Edlin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vaux</hi> he ſaith he met my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> at the Rummer-Tavern in <hi>Queen-ſtreet</hi> the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> which was the day before <hi>Jones</hi> came to Town, and that then he appointed to go out of Town the next day, which was the 27th, and accordingly he did go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edlin</hi> he ſaith, he met <hi>Vaux</hi> at the Cuſtom-Houſe upon the 27th of <hi>May</hi> in the Morning, and being deſired by him to go with him out of Town, he did ſo, and there was with him a Gentleman whoſe Name was <hi>Brown,</hi> and who now appears to be my Lord <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamere</hi>; they went in Company with him as far as <hi>Hitchin,</hi> where they left him upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 28th at Noon.</p>
               <p>This Evidence is produced to ſhew, That my Lord did go out of Town at that time, and in that manner as has been alledged, and that theſe Perſons went with him to conduct him a private way that he ſhould not go the common Road. Your Lordſhips will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Anſwer hath been given to this, and what account my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> has given of himſelf.</p>
               <p>Another thing my Lords, that renders this matter ſuſpicious, is the Name which my Lord was pleaſed to aſſume to diſguiſe himſelf
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53536:44"/>
by, it being a Name by which the Party uſe to call my Lord in their Diſcourſes of him; And to prove that, we have likewiſe produced two Witneſſes, <hi>Babington</hi> and <hi>Paunceford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Babington,</hi> he ſays, That in their Conſultations there were Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> under the Name of <hi>Brown,</hi> and once at a Tavern when my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> was named by one in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he was preſently catched up for it, and replied to, You mean Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>; and ſo it ſeems that was the Canting Name under which they diſcourſed of my Lord <hi>Delamere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Witneſs <hi>Paunceford,</hi> he tells you, That being at <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>'s Houſe, and concerned with him in the printing the Late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Declarations (for the printing of which, <hi>Diſney</hi> was Executed) one <hi>Lock</hi> came for ſome of thoſe Declarations for Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> and they were to be ſent into <hi>Cheſhire:</hi> ſo that though your Lordſhips obſerve the Witneſs ſaith, ſome body elſe was called by the Name of <hi>Brown,</hi> yet you have had no account given you, that there was any other <hi>Brown</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true indeed, My Lords, that theſe are only things that <hi>Diſney</hi> ſaid, and <hi>Lock</hi> ſaid; But I muſt take leave to ſay, it is very ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that if my Lord went out of Town into <hi>Cheſhire</hi> under the Name of <hi>Brown,</hi> and ſome Perſons ſhall on the behalf of <hi>Brown</hi> come for Declarations to be ſent into <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and my Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in that Parly go by the Name of <hi>Brown,</hi> that thoſe Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were for my Lord, and that will be a great Evidence of his Correſpondence with <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I confeſs, My Lords, all this while our Proof is Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and indeed there is no poſitive Proof but that of <hi>Saxon,</hi> and in him our Proof muſt center, for without him I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nothing that has been offered will be Proof againſt my Lord upon this Indictment, for bare Circumſtances and bare Suſpicions will be no Proof againſt any Man, but ſuch as are violent and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thoſe joyned to a poſitive Proof, ſuch as the Law requires.</p>
               <p>Now then, My Lords, I come to the Conſideration of what weight and ſtreſs is to be laid upon this poſitive Evidence of <hi>Saxons</hi>: And here I muſt confeſs there are objections made to this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to which I cannot readily give an Anſwer; for <hi>Saxon</hi> has ſworn, that he was there at ſuch a time, and that he was ſent for and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd as a Perſon recommended by my Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> as fit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Secret, and capable of being imployed to ſtir up the Country, in order to the proſecution of a Deſign they had on foot to raiſe a Rebellion, and he does Charge Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crew Offley</hi> to have been there at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:53536:44"/>The Evidence, My Lords, that has been produced to falſifie this poſitive Witneſs, in the point of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s being there, has been by Five or Six Witneſſes, who teſtifie Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s being in Town, and not elſewhere from the 10th of <hi>April</hi> to the latter end of <hi>July</hi>; and I do not ſee what we have to ſay in anſwer to their Teſtimony; I muſt agree the Proof to be full in that Point, and if the Evidence they give be true, I cannot ſay that <hi>Saxon</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence can be true in that Point.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe as to Mr. <hi>Offley,</hi> Sir <hi>Willoughby Aston</hi> and others have teſtified, that he was not at my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi>'s at the time <hi>Saxon</hi> ſpeaks of: For he gives you an account where he was every day from the 26th of <hi>May</hi> to the 4th of <hi>June,</hi> and his own Servants bring him to his own Houſe, upon the 4th of <hi>June</hi> in the Evening, which is quite another way than from Sir <hi>Willoughby Aſton</hi>'s to my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi>'s; If this likewiſe be true, what <hi>Saxons</hi> ſays, cannot be true, I muſt agree it.</p>
               <p>There is another thing that is offered on my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi>'s part, That he was himſelf in Town at that time that <hi>Saxon</hi> ſayes he was at <hi>Mere</hi>; But here indeed the matter ſeems to be a little more ſtrange and dubious, that my Lord ſhould make ſo much haſt down, as to go out late at Night, and ſo cautiouſly as to go by a wrong Name, and yet to ride to Town again the Poſt-way to be here juſt the 3d of <hi>June,</hi> when <hi>Saxon</hi> ſwears he was in <hi>Cheſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs there is the Proof of his two Brothers that ſay, They ſaw him in Town the 3<hi>d</hi> and 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi>: There is likewiſe ſome account given of his going out of Town, that it was upon a Meſſage received from his Mother; that his Child in the Countrey was ſick, and indeed he did go a By-way and change his name for fear of a Warrant in a Meſſengers hands that was out againſt him to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Now, My Lords, I do not hear any thing that has been offered, that there was any ſuch Warrant, or any diſcourſe to ground that apprehenſion upon; My Lord had the firſt and only apprehenſion of a Warrant; but upon what Reaſons he himſelf beſt knows: This apprehenſion made him go out of Town ſo privately, he ſayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not be prevented of ſeeing his ſick Child.</p>
               <p>But how comes it to paſs that my Lord makes ſuch a ſpeedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: By the Proofs it appears he did not get there till <hi>Sunday</hi> Night, and upon the <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning comes Poſt for <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The account that he gives of that, is this, His haſt was to ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Child, that was here ſick in Town; For he had received an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53536:45"/>
from his Wife upon the <hi>Monday</hi> to acquaint him, that the Coaſt was clear, and there was no Warrant out againſt him, but if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſee his Child alive, he muſt make haſt up to Town; and accordingly upon the <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning early he ſets out, and upon the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in the Evening is here in Town again.</p>
               <p>But, with ſubmiſſion, My Lords, there is no good Account giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by this noble Lord, what reaſon there was for ſo many Poſt-Journeys backward and forward, as, had been teſtified, he to have made within a very little compaſs of time; for beſides this of his return Poſt upon the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> there is only an Anſwer given to one of the reſt, which is, That of the 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> when he ſaith he went to take poſſeſſion of the Land that he held by a Leaſe then renewed to him by the Biſhop, which being of ſome Value and Conſideration to his Lordſhip, and the Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſick, he thought it neceſſary to go down Poſt himſelf, and would not be content to receive Livery by Attornment. This is the only anſwer that is given to all thoſe times of his riding Poſt that have been given in Evidence.</p>
               <p>Theſe are matters of Suſpicion that are offered to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, but I confeſs matters of Suſpicion only; unleſs clear, poſitive, probable Proof be joyned with them, will not weigh with your Lordſhips to convict a man of High-Treaſon where two Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are required. But whether theſe matters of Suſpicion be ſuch violent and neceſſary Preſumptions as tend to fortifie the poſitive Teſtimony, I muſt leave that to the Conſideration of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</p>

               <speaker>Lord High Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, it has not been uſual of late, for thoſe who have ſate in the place where I now am, upon thoſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to give you Lordſhips any trouble in repeating or obſerving upon the Evidence: In this Caſe the Evidence that hath been given has been very long, and it would be too great a Preſumption in me, ſhould I have any manner of doubt in the leaſt, that either your Lordſhips have not well obſerved it, or the Learned Counſel for the King have been defective in collecting or remarking upon it, ſo as to need my Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>But, my Lords, I confeſs there is ſomething I cannot omit taking notice of, not for your Lordſhips ſakes, but for the ſake of this numerous and great Auditory, that one miſtake in point of Law
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53536:45"/>
might not go unrectified, which ſeemed to be urged with ſome earneſtneſs by the Noble Lord at the Barr, <hi>That there is a neceſſity in point of Law, that there ſhould be two Poſitive Witneſſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict a man of Treaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſeemed to lay a great ſtreſs upon that, but certainly his Lordſhip is under a great miſtake, as to the Law in that Point; for without all doubt, what was urged in anſwer to this Objection by that Learned Gentleman that concluded for the King, is true, There may be ſuch other ſubſtantial Circumſtances joyned to one Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Teſtimony, that, by the Opinion of all the Judges of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſeveral times has been adjudged and held to be a ſufficient Proof.</p>
               <p>As for the purpoſe, in this Caſe, ſuppoſe your Lordſhips, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Evidence that has been given here this day, ſhould believe <hi>Saxon</hi> ſwears true, who is a Poſitive Witneſs, and ſhall then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe believe that there was that Circumſtance of <hi>Jones</hi>'s coming over from <hi>Holland</hi> with ſuch a Meſſage upon the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> (which is directly ſworn in Evidence, you are the Judges of that Evidence) and what the other Witneſſes have ſworn likewiſe, and is not denied by my Lord, the Priſoner at the Barr, that he went out of Town that Night, changed his Name, and went an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect By-Road, certainly theſe Circumſtances if your Lordſhips be ſatisfied he went for that purpoſe do neceſſarily knit the poſitive Teſtimony of <hi>Saxon,</hi> and amount to a ſecond Witneſs.</p>
               <p>That is, if <hi>Saxon</hi>'s poſitive Teſtimony be true, then ſuppoſe all theſe Circumſtances that gove the Jealouſie do make up a ſtrong preſumption to joyn with the poſitive Evidence of <hi>Saxon,</hi> then you have two witneſſes as the Law requires, eſpecially, if the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer given by the Priſoner to thoſe Circumſtances be not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (as the ſlender account he gives of his ſo frequent Journeys in ſo ſhort a compaſs of time) but that there ſtill remains ſome Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion; I could have wiſhed indeed, that matter might have been made ſomewhat more clear; that no ſhadow of Suſpicion might remain.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhips are Judges: And if you do not believe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Saxon,</hi> whoſe Teſtimony hath been ſo poſitively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by divers Witneſſes of Quality, the Priſoner ought to be acquitted of this Indictment: If your Lordſhips pleaſe, You may go together and conſider of it.</p>
