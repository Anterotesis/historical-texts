            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

great <hi>Fundamental</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
That by which they
have been diſtinguiſhed
from other Profeſſors of
Chriſtianity, in their Time,
and to which they refer all
People about Faith, <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
and <hi>Practice,</hi> both
in their Ministry and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
That as the Fingers

<pb facs="tcp:52318:3"/>
in all the Parts and
Articles of it, Springs
from this Divine Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in Man: And becauſe
the Prejudices of ſome are
very great againſt this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and their Way; and that
others, who Love their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs
and commend their
good Life, are yet, through
Miſtakes, or want of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
under <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of their
Vnſoundneſs in ſome Points

which deſire earneſtly
<pb facs="tcp:52318:4"/>
to know and enjoy God in
that ſenſible Manner this

ſeem to long after a State of

with God; but are under
Doubts and Diſpondings of

Power to enable them,

            <p>For theſe Reaſons and

<pb facs="tcp:52318:4"/>
               <hi>and ſo often trod upon and
treated as the Off-ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Earth, are the
People of God, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the moſt High.</hi>
Bear with me <hi>Reader,</hi> I
know what I ſay, and am
not high minded but <hi>fear.</hi>
For I write with <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
towards God, though
with <hi>Confidence</hi> towards
thee. Not that thou ſhouldſt
believe upon my Authority
nothing leſs, for that's not
Act upon Knowledge but
<hi>Truſt:</hi> But that thou
<pb facs="tcp:52318:5"/>
ſhouldſt try and prove what I
write: For that is all I
ask, as well as all I need,
for thy Conviction and my
own Juſtification: The
whole, indeed, being but a
ſpiritual Experiment upon
the Soul, and therefore ſeeks
for no implicite Credit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is Self-evident to
them that will uprightly try
it.</p>
            <p>And when thou, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
ſhalt come to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with this <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
and the plain and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb facs="tcp:52318:5"/>
Teachings of it, thou
wilt, with us, admire thou
ſhouldſt live ſo long a <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
to that which was ſo
<hi>near</hi> thee, and as much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that other Folks ſhould
be ſo blind as not to ſee it,
as formerly thou thoughteſt
us ſingular for obeying it.
The Day, I believe, is at
hand, that will declare this
with an uncontroulable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
becauſe it will be
with an unqueſtionable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>I have done, <hi>Reader,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52318:6"/>
with this Preface, when <hi>I</hi>
have told thee. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That
<hi>I</hi> have ſtated the <hi>Principle,</hi>
and opened, as God has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
me, the <hi>Nature</hi> and
<hi>Virtue</hi> of it in <hi>Religion:</hi>
Wherein the <hi>common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi>
and <hi>Articles</hi> of the
Chriſtian Religion, are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and improved; and in
which, <hi>I</hi> have endeavoured
to expreſs my ſelf in <hi>Plain</hi>
and <hi>Proper</hi> Terms, and not
in <hi>Figurative, Allegorical,</hi>
or <hi>Doubtful</hi> Phraſes; that
ſo <hi>I</hi> may leave <hi>no room</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:52318:6"/>
an Equivocal or Double
Sence; but that the <hi>Truth</hi>
of the Subject <hi>I</hi> treat upon,
may appear <hi>Eaſily</hi> and <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi>
to every common
Vnderſtanding. Next, I
have confirmed what I have
writ, by Scripture, Reaſon
and the Effects of it, upon
ſo great a People; whoſe
uniform, concurrence in the
Experience and Practice
thereof, through all Times
and Sufferings, ſince a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
challenge the Notice
and Regard of every ſerious
<pb facs="tcp:52318:7"/>
               <hi>Reader.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>I</hi> have
written <hi>briefly,</hi> that ſo it
might be every ones Mony
and Reading: And, much
in a little is beſt, when
we ſee daily that the <hi>Richer</hi>
People grow, the <hi>leſs</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or Time they have for
God, and Religion: And
perhaps, thoſe that would not
buy a large Book, may find
in their Hearts to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
ſome of theſe, for their
Neighbours Good, being
little and Cheap. Be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

               <p>§. 4. It is to This Principle of <hi>Light,

all: For they ſay it is the great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
in Religion; <hi>That,</hi> without
which, there is no <hi>Conviction,</hi> ſo no
<hi>Converſion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 3. 5.</note> or <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</hi>
and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no entring into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God. That is to ſay, there
can be no true <hi>ſight</hi> of Sin, nor <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
for it, and therefore no forſaking
or overcoming of it, or Remiſſion
or Juſtification from it. A neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52318:10"/>
and powerful Principle indeed,
when neither Sanctification, nor Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
can be had without it. In
ſhort, there is no becoming Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Holy and Good without this
Principle; no acceptance with God,
nor Peace of Soul, but through it.
But on the contrary, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſo much <hi>Irreligion</hi> among

without Injoyment, and ſo
little <hi>Heart-Reformation,</hi> is becauſe
People, in Religion, <hi>Over-look</hi>
this Principle, and leave it behind
them.</p>
               <p>They will be Religious <hi>without</hi> it,
and Chriſtians without it; though
this be the only means of making
them ſo indeed: So natural it is to
Man, in his degenerate Eſtate, to
<hi>prefer</hi> Sacrifice before Obedience,
and to make Prayers go for Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and ſo flatter himſelf to Hope,
by Ceremonial and Bodily Services,
to excuſe himſelf with God, from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52318:11"/>
the ſtricter Diſcipline of this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Soul; which leads Man to
take up the Croſs, deny ſelf, and do
that which God requires of him:
And that is every Mans true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and every ſuch Man is truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious:
That is, he is <hi>Holy, Humble,
Patient, Meek, Merciful, Juſt, Kind</hi>
and <hi>Charitable;</hi> which, they ſay, no
Man can make himſelf; but that this
Principle will make all them ſo, that
will embrace the <hi>Convictions,</hi> and
<hi>Teachings</hi> of it; being the <hi>Root</hi> of all
true Religion in Man, and the <hi>Good-Seed,</hi>
from whence all Good Fruits
proceed. To ſumm up, what they
ſay upon the Nature and Virtue of
it, as Contents of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
they declare that this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is, Firſt, <hi>Divine.</hi> Secondly, <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal.</hi>
Thirdly, <hi>Efficacious:</hi> In that

Duty, <hi>and</hi> Diſobedience <hi>to it.</hi>
               </p>

Sorrow for Sin, <hi>in thoſe that ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
regard the Convictions of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It enables them to forſake
Sin and Sanctifies from <hi>it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It applies Gods Mercies in

are paſt, unto Juſtification, upon ſuch
Sincere Repentance and Obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, It gives the Faithful Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance

cannot be a Light to himſelf by

to the Soul, by his <hi>immediate Inſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi>
and <hi>Influences:</hi> 'Tis moſt true,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52318:17"/>
Chriſt was, in a Sence, the <hi>Light of

and ſhined forth by his <hi>heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
many admirable <hi>Miracles,</hi> and

ſtill that hinders not, but that he
was and <hi>is That Spiritual Light,</hi> which
ſhineth, more or leſs, in the Hearts,
of the Sons and Daughters of Men.
For as he was a <hi>Light</hi> in his Life
and Converſation, he was only a
Light in a more excellent Sence, then
he ſpoke of to his Diſciples, when
he ſaid, <hi>Ye are the Lights of the
World.</hi> But Chriſt the Word en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
them, and enlightens us,
and enlightens all Men that come
into the World; which he could
not be ſaid to do, if we only regard
his Perſonal and Outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
For in that Sence it is long,
ſince he was that Light, but in
this, he is continually ſo. In that
reſpect he is <hi>Remote,</hi> but in this Sence
he is <hi>Preſent</hi> and <hi>Immediate,</hi> elſe we

had much Reverence; for, <hi>verſe</hi> 8.
he ſaith of <hi>John, He was not That

That Light:</hi> Now comes his Proof and
our Teſtimony, <hi>That was the True
Light, which lighteth Every Man that
cometh into the World;</hi> which was
not <hi>John,</hi> nor any elſe, but the
<hi>Word that was with God, and was
God.</hi> The Evangeliſt did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

ſo many Miracles, and Living
ſo Holy a Life; and, after all, ſo pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
Suffering Death (which yet

be <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Efficacious,</hi> which is
able to diſcover to Man, what is of

which gives him a <hi>Diſtinct</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

<hi>manifeſt</hi> God, is yet Evident from
<hi>Rom. 1. 19. Becauſe that which may be

<hi>That this is to be understood of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

Light, as they phraſe it, doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
God, other then as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
explained and allowed; Since
whatever is part of Man, in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
but eſpecially in his Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy
from God, is ſo far from
Yielding him the knowledge of God,
that it cannot <hi>rightly</hi> Reprove or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that which offends him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Light we ſpeak of: And it
is Granted, that what we call <hi>Divine,</hi>
and ſome, Miſtakenly, call <hi>Natural</hi>
Light, can do both. <hi>2dly</hi> If this
Light be <hi>Natural,</hi> Notwithſtanding
it doth manifeſt our Duty, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
our Diſobedience to God, they
would do well to aſſign us ſome
Certain <hi>Medium,</hi> or <hi>Way,</hi> whereby
we may truly diſcern, and diſtinguiſh
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52318:23"/>
between the Manifeſtations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
of the <hi>Natural</hi> Light within,
from thoſe of the <hi>Divine</hi> Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
ſince they Allow the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, and Reproof of Evil,
as well to the one, as to the other.
Let them give us but one Scripture
that diſtinguiſhes between a <hi>Natural</hi>
and a <hi>Spiritual Light within.</hi> They
may, with as much Reaſon, talk of
a <hi>Natural and Spiritual Darkneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
'Tis true, there is a natural
proper darkneſs, to wit, the Night
of the outward World; and there
is a Spiritual darkneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> The
<hi>clouded</hi> and <hi>benighted Vnderſtandings</hi>
of Men, through diſobedience to the
Light and Spirit of God: But let
them Aſſign us a Third, if they can.
People Uſe, indeed, to ſay, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
of Blind men, they are <hi>dark,</hi>
we may Call a <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Idiot</hi> ſo,
if we will: But where is there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Chriſt diſtinguiſhed not between
Darkneſs and Darkneſs, or Light

have frequently ſpoken of Darkneſs

cannot, pray let him forbear his

<hi>Light of Chriſt within Man,</hi> as Man's
<hi>Guide</hi> in Duty to God and Man. For
as he muſt yield to us, that the Light
Manifeſteth Evil, and Reproveth for
it, ſo doth Chriſt himſelf teach us
of the Light, <hi>John 3. 20. For every
one that doth Evil hateth the Light,
neither cometh unto the Light, leſt his
Deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> And the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> plainly ſaith, <hi>Eph. 5.
13. But all things that are reproved
are made manifeſt by the Light;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there are not two diſtinct Lights

Light within. And this the Apoſtle

Verſe 6. <hi>If we ſay, we have Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip

would have anticipated their Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>viz. 'Tis true, your Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
reproves for Evil, but it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Divine Light, which leads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

1 <hi>John Ch. 2. 8, 9. The Darkneſs is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52318:25"/>
and the true Light now ſhineth. He
that ſaith he is in the Light, and hateth
his Brother, is in Darkneſs even until
now;</hi> which is not another Light then
that mentioned before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. For
as Light is put there, in Oppoſition to

but ſuch a Light is that which we
Confeſs, Teſtifie to, and Maintain:
Therefore it is a <hi>Spiritual Light.</hi> It
is alſo worth our Notice, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52318:25"/>
uſeth the ſame Manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

<hi>now</hi> ſhineth; and that it is the ſame

ſuch as <hi>hate their Brethren:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that Light that ſo repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
them, is the <hi>True</hi> Light. And
ſtrange it is, that Chriſt and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
but eſpecially his beloved One,
ſhould ſo often make that very Light,
which <hi>ſtoops</hi> to the <hi>loweſt</hi> ſtep of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality,

Nay, not only ſo, but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle

Caſe, <hi>viz. not hating of his Brother:</hi>
And that yet any ſhould ſhut their
Eyes ſo faſt againſt beholding the
Virtue of it, as to conclude it a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and Inſufficient Light,</hi> is both
<hi>Vnſcriptural</hi> and <hi>Vnreaſonable.</hi> Shall
we ſlight it becauſe we come ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily

the <hi>Diſtinction and Diſcerning</hi> it gives.
<hi>Let there be Light, and there was Light,</hi>
ſaid God in the beginning of the Old

Pſalm 139. 7. and the Prophets

becauſe it was a <hi>fuller Diſpenſation</hi> of
the Virtue and Power of the Same
Divine Principle: And that being

It was under the Law but as a

Goſpel, it may be ſaid to be poured
out upon Men. According to that
Gracious and Notable <hi>Promiſe</hi> of
God, by the Prophet
<hi>Joel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joel 2. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>In the latter Days,

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52318:31"/>
it Rains plentifully, look how it
pours. So God <hi>Augments</hi> his Light,
Grace and Spirit to theſe latter Days.
They ſhall not have it <hi>ſparingly,</hi> and
by ſmall Drops, but <hi>fully and freely,</hi> and
<hi>overflowingly</hi> too. And thus <hi>Peter,</hi>
that deep and excellent Apoſtle, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that Promiſe in <hi>Joel,</hi> on the Day
of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> as the beginning of the
accompliſhment of it. This is Grace,
and Favour, and Goodneſs <hi>indeed.</hi>
And therefore well may this <hi>Brighter</hi>
Illumination, and <hi>Greater</hi> Effuſion of
the Spirit, be called Grace; for as
the coming of the Son excelled that
of the Servant, ſo did the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Light and Spirit of God,
ſince the coming of Chriſt, excell that
of the foregoing Diſpenſations; yet
ever ſufficient to Salvation to all thoſe
that walked in it. This is our <hi>Sence</hi>

They could <hi>ſee</hi> the Object of their

Power to Addreſs it when they
would. It was more <hi>faſhionable</hi> too,

it will appear, that God, in all his

come <hi>nearer</hi> and <hi>nearer</hi> to the <hi>Inſides</hi>

nearer Acquaintance with himſelf in
Spirit: And <hi>then</hi> it is that Man muſt
ſeek and find the Knowledge of God

all things that are made ſhow forth
the Power and Wiſdom of God, and

therefore many Men urge the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

But though all thoſe things ſhow a

why is Man his Delight, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Man only, of all his Works,

Honour of being his <hi>Image;</hi> and by

is to ſeek him in himſelf, in his

               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. THough there be many
good things ſaid, how
Chriſt appears and works in a Soul, to
Awaken, Convince and Convert it; yet
you ſeem not particular enough about the
Death and Sufferings of Chriſt: And it
is generally Rumour'd and Charged upon
you by your Adverſaries, that you have
little reverence to the Doctrine of Chriſt's
Satisfaction to God for our Sins, and
that you do not Believe, That the <hi>Active</hi>
and <hi>Paſſive</hi> Obedience of Chriſt, when he
was in the World, is the <hi>alone</hi> ground of
a Sinners Juſtification before God.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> §. 1. The Doctrine of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi>
and <hi>Juſtification,</hi> truly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
are placed in ſo ſtrict an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the one is a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52318:45"/>
of the other, and what we
ſay of them, is what agrees with the
ſuffrage of Scripture, and for the moſt
part in the terms of it; always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
that in Points where there
ariſes any difficulty, be it from the
Obſcurity of Expreſſion, Miſ-tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the Duſt raiſed by the Heats
of <hi>Partial</hi> Writers, or <hi>Nice Criticks,</hi>
it is ever beſt to keep cloſe to the
Text, and maintain Charity in the
reſt. I ſhall firſt ſpeak <hi>Negatively,</hi>
what we do not own, which perhaps
hath given occaſion to thoſe who have
been more Haſty than Wiſe, to judge
us defective in our Belief of the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of the Death and Sufferings of
Chriſt to Juſtification: As,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <p>
                  <hi>§. 2. Firſt, We cannot Believe
that Chriſt is the</hi> Cauſe, <hi>but the</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>of God's Love, according to the
Teſtimony of the Beloved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
John, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. God hath ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the World, that he hath given
his only Begotten Son into the World,
that whoſoever believeth on him
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52318:45"/>
ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We cannot ſay, God
<hi>could not</hi> have taken another way to
have ſaved Sinners, than by the Death
and Sufferings of his Son, to ſatisfie
his Juſtice, or that Chriſt's Death
and Sufferings were a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi>
Satisfaction for that Eternal Death
and Miſery due to Man for Sin and
Tranſgreſſion: For ſuch a Notion
were to make God's Mercy little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in Man's Salvation; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we are at too great a diſtance
from his Infinite Wiſdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to judge of the <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>Neceſſity</hi>
of his Actings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We cannot ſay Jeſus
Chriſt was the <hi>greateſt Sinner</hi> in the
World, (becauſe he bore our Sins
on his Croſs, or becauſe he was made
Sin for us, who knew no Sin) an
Expreſſion of great <hi>levity</hi> and <hi>unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
yet often ſaid by great Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Profeſſors of Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:52318:46"/>
Fourthly, We cannot Believe that
Chriſt's Death and Sufferings <hi>ſo</hi> ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
God, or juſtifies Men, as that
they are thereby Accepted of God:
They are indeed thereby put into a
ſtate capable of being accepted of God,
and through the Obedience of Faith
and Sanctification of the Spirit, are
in a ſtate of Acceptance: For we can
never think a Man juſtified before
God, while <hi>Self-condemned;</hi> or that
any Man can be in Chriſt, who is
not a <hi>New</hi> Creature, or that God
looks upon Men <hi>otherwiſe</hi> than they
are. We think it a ſtate of <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and not of <hi>Salvation,</hi> to call <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
Lord!</hi> and not by the Work of
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt. Maſter!</hi> And he
not yet <hi>Maſter of our Affections: Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our!</hi>
And they not ſaved by him
from their <hi>Sins: Redeemer!</hi> And yet
they not redeemed by him from their
<hi>Paſſion, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Vanity, Honours, vain Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi>
and <hi>Glory</hi> of this World: Which
were to deceive themſelves; for God
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52318:46"/>
will not be mocked, ſuch as Men
ſow, ſuch they muſt reap. And
though Chriſt did <hi>Die</hi> for us, yet we
muſt, by the Aſſiſtance of his Grace,
<hi>work out our Salvation with fear and
trembling:</hi> As he Died for Sin, ſo we
muſt Die <hi>to</hi> Sin, or we cannot be ſaid
to be ſaved by the Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Chriſt, or throughly juſtified
and accepted with God. Thus far Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively.
Now, Poſſitively, what
we own as to Juſtification.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
               <p>§. 3. We do Believe, That Jeſus
Chriſt was our Holy <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and
<hi>Attonement,</hi> and <hi>Propitiation;</hi> that
he bore our Iniquities, and that by
his Stripes we were healed of the
Wounds <hi>Adam</hi> gave us in his Fall;
and that God is juſt in forgiving true
Penitents upon the Credit of that
Holy Offering, Chriſt made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to God for us; and that what he
did and ſuffer'd, ſatisfied and pleaſed
God, and was for the ſake of fallen
Man that had diſpleaſed God: And
that through the Offering up of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52318:47"/>
once for all, through the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Spirit, he hath for Ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
thoſe (in all times) that are
ſanctified, <hi>who walk not after the Fleſh,
but after the Spirit. Rom.</hi> 8. 1. Mark that.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <p>§. 4. In ſhort, <hi>Juſtification</hi> conſiſts
of two parts, or hath a twofold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
<hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification from
the Guilt of Sin, and Juſtification
from the Power and Pollution of Sin,
and in this Senſe Juſtification gives
Man a full and clear Acceptance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. For want of this latter
part, it is that ſo many Souls Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
inclin'd, are often under Doubts,
Scruples and Dependencies, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all that their Teachers tell
them of the Extent and Efficacy of the
firſt part of Juſtification. And it is
too general an Unhappineſs among
the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, that
they are apt to cloak their own <hi>Active
and Paſſive Diſobedience</hi> with the <hi>Active
and Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt.</hi> The
firſt part of Juſtification we do reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
and humbly acknowledge is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52318:47"/>
only for the ſake of the Death and
Sufferings of Chriſt; nothing we can
do, <hi>though by the Operation of the Holy
Spirit,</hi> being able to cancel Old Debts,
or wipe out Old Scores: It is the
Power and Efficacy of that Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Offering, upon Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that juſtifies us from the Sins
that are paſt; and it is the Power of
Chriſt's Spirit in our Hearts that
purifies and makes us acceptable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. For till the Heart of Man
is purged from Sin, God will never
accept of it. He Reproves, Rebukes
and Condemns thoſe that entertain
Sin there, and therefore ſuch cannot
be ſaid to be in a <hi>Justified</hi> State; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
and Juſtification being
Contraries: So that they that hold
themſelves in a Juſtified State by the
Active and Paſſive Obedience of
Chriſt, while they are not Actively
and Paſſively Obedient to the Spirit of
Chriſt Jeſus, are under a <hi>ſtrong</hi> and
<hi>dangerous Deluſion;</hi> and for crying out
againſt this Sin-pleaſing Imagination,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52318:48"/>
not to ſay <hi>Doctrine,</hi> we are Staged
and Reproached as Deniers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers
of the Death and Sufferings of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But be it
known to ſuch, they add to Chriſt's
Sufferings, and Crucifie to themſelves
afreſh the Son of God, and trample
the Blood of the Covenant under their
Feet, that walk unholily under a
Profeſſion of Juſtification; for God
will not acquit the Guilty, nor juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Diſobedient and Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Such deceive themſelves, and
at the Great and Final Judgment their
Sentence will not be, Come ye Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
becauſe it cannot be ſaid to them,
<hi>Well done Good and Faithful,</hi> for
they cannot be ſo eſteemed that live
and die in a Reproveable and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable
State; but, Go ye Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

them; but alas, they were clouded,
puft up, and ſet farther off from the
Inward and Saving Knowledge of
God, becauſe they ſought for it in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52318:54"/>
them, and thought to find God there.
But the <hi>Key of David</hi> is an other thing,
which ſhuts and no Man opens, and
opens and no Man ſhuts; and this
Key have all they that receive the
<hi>Gift of God</hi> into their Hearts; and it
opens to them, the Knowledge of
God and themſelves, and gives them
a quite <hi>other Sight, Taſte</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of things, than their <hi>Educational</hi>
or <hi>Traditional</hi> Knowledge afforded
them. This is the beginning of the
<hi>New Creation</hi> of God, and thus it is
we come to be New Creatures: And
we are bold to declare there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, beſides this, by which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
can come into Chriſt, or to be
true Chriſtians, or receive the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that comes by the Death and
Sufferings of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.
Wherefore we ſay, and upon good
Authority, even that of our <hi>own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi>
as well as that of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Truth, Chriſt will prove <hi>no
Saving Sacrifice</hi> for them, that <hi>refuſe</hi>
him for their <hi>Example.</hi> They that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52318:54"/>
                  <hi>reject</hi> the Gift, do <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Giver,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of themſelves <hi>daily,</hi> for the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
ſake. O that People were wiſe!
that they would conſider their latter
End, and the things that make for
the Peace thereof! Why ſhould they
<hi>periſh</hi> in a vain hope of Life, <hi>while
Death Reigns?</hi> Of living with God,
who live not to him, nor walk with
him? <hi>Awake,</hi> thou that ſleepeſt in thy
Sin, or at beſt, in thy Self-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
Awake, I ſay, and Chriſt ſhall
give thee Life! For he is the <hi>Lord
from Heaven, the quickening Spirit,</hi>
that quickens us, by his Spirit, if we
do not, <hi>reſiſt</hi> it and <hi>quench</hi> it, by our
Diſobedience; but receive, love and
obey it, in all the Holy Leadings and
Teachings of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14, 15. To
which Holy Spirit I commend my
<hi>Reader,</hi> that he may the better ſee
where he is, and alſo come to the
true Belief and Advantage of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of our Dear and
Bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus
Chriſt, who ſaves from the <hi>Power
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52318:55"/>
and Pollution,</hi> as well as Guilt of Sin,
all thoſe that <hi>hear his knocks, and open
the Door of their Hearts</hi> to him, that
he may come in and work a real and
through Reformation in and for them:
And ſo the <hi>Benefit, Virtue</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi>
of his <hi>Doings</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> without
us, will come to be livingly applied
and felt, and Fellowſhip with Chriſt
in his Death and Sufferings known,
according to the Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;
which, thoſe that live in that
which made him ſuffer, know not,
tho' they profeſs to be ſaved by his
Death and Sufferings. Much more
might be ſaid as to this matter, but I
muſt be brief.</p>

               <p>§. 6. To conclude this Chapter,
we wonder not that we ſhould be
miſtaken, miſ-conſtrued and miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
in what we believe and do
to Salvation, ſince our Betters have
been ſo treated in the Primitive
Times; nor indeed is it only about
<hi>Doctrines</hi> of Religion, for our <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>

had the ſame Succeſs: But this is
what I earneſtly deſire, that however
bold People are pleaſed to make with
us, they would not <hi>deceive</hi> themſelves
in the great things of their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
That while they would ſeem
to own all to Chriſt, they are not
found <hi>diſowned</hi> of Chriſt in the laſt
Day. Read the 7th of <hi>Matthew;</hi> it
is he that hears Chriſt, the great
Word of God, and does what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins,
what he commands, and by his
Bleſſed Example, recommends, that
is a <hi>Wiſe Builder,</hi> that has founded
his Houſe well, and built with good
Materials, and whoſe Houſe will
ſtand the laſt ſhake and Judgment.
For which cauſe we are often plain,
cloſe and earneſt with People, to
conſider, that Chriſt came not to
ſave them in, but <hi>from their Sins;</hi> and
that they that think to diſcharge and
releaſe themſelves of his <hi>Yoke</hi> and

Chriſt with his having done all for

them, while he has wrought <hi>little or

any thing for the love of him, will
finally awake in a dreadful ſurprize,
at the ſound of the laſt Trumpet, and

<hi>Depart from me, ye Workers of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

Worſhip and Miniſtry;</hi> Chriſt's

That God was a Spirit, and that he

Convictions of the Spirit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
in their daily courſe of living,
by which they were taught to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew
that which was made manifeſt
to them to be evil, and to do that
which was good, they, in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
together, ſate down, and
waited for the Preparation of this
Holy Spirit, both to let them ſee their
States and Conditions before the Lord,
and to worſhip him acceptably; and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52318:57"/>
as they were ſenſible of Wants, or
Shortneſs, or Infirmities, ſo in the
ſecret of their own Hearts, Prayer
would ſpring to God, through Jeſus
Chriſt, to help, aſſiſt and ſupply
them: But they did not dare to <hi>wake
their Beloved before his time; or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Throne of the King of Glory,
till he held out his Scepter; or take
thought what they ſhould ſay,</hi> or after
their own or other Mens ſtudied
<hi>Words and Forms,</hi> for this were to
Offer <hi>ſtrange Fire;</hi> to pray, but not
by the Spirit; to ask, but not in the
Name, that is, in the Power of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who pray'd as well
as that he ſpoke like one having Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that is, <hi>Power,</hi> a Divine <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy</hi>
and <hi>Force</hi> to reach and pierce
the Heavens, which he gives to all
that obey his Light, Grace and Spirit,

and that according to Scripture,
ſo is it, Bleſſed be God, our Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

we are ſeparated from the Worſhips
of Men, under their ſeveral Forms,
becauſe they do not found it in the
Operation, Motion and Aſſiſtance of

as the Holy Teſtimonies of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

Miniſters are to miniſter <hi>what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive:</hi>
This is <hi>Scripture;</hi> now that
which we receive, is not our own,

we are not to ſtudy what we are to
ſay before Magiſtrates for our ſelves,

We are to miniſter, <hi>as the Oracles of

<hi>from Chriſt,</hi> God's Great Oracle, what
we are to miniſter. And if we are
to miniſter what we receive, then not
what we Study, Collect, and beat
out of our own Brains, for that is not
the Mind of Chriſt, but our Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52318:59"/>

And if the Spirit muſt give

Mony to be made Miniſters, in order
to live by their Preaching, that they
may ſee what ground it is they build

this, of the Evangelical Prophet, the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52318:61"/>
beloved Diſciple agrees, and which
is a full Anſwer to the Objection;
<hi>Theſe things have I written unto you,
concerning them that Seduce
you:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 2. 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>But the <hi>Anointing,</hi>
which ye have received of
him, abideth <hi>in you,</hi> and ye <hi>need not</hi>
that any Man teach you, but as the
ſame Anointing teacheth you, of all
things, and is Truth, and is no Lye:
And even as it hath taught you, <hi>ye
ſhall abide in him.</hi>
                  </hi> In which <hi>Three</hi>
things are obſervable. <hi>1ſt,</hi> That he
writ his Epiſtle upon an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> to prevent their
<hi>Deluſion. 2dly.</hi> That he aſſerts a
nearer and ſuperior Miniſter than
himſelf, <hi>viz. The <hi>Anointing or
Grace</hi>
                  </hi> they had received; and
that not only in that particular
Exigency, but in <hi>all Caſes</hi> that
might attend them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That
if they did but take heed to the
Teachings of it, they would have
no need of Man's Directions, or fear
of his Seducings. At leaſt of <hi>no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52318:62"/>
that comes not from the Power
of the Anointing:</hi> Though I rather
take the Apoſtle in the higheſt Sence
of the Words, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 9. Thus alſo
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians.
But as touching Brotherly Love, ye need
not that I write unto you: For ye your
ſelves are <hi>Taught of God</hi> to Love
one another.</hi> But <hi>Helps</hi> are uſeful,
and a great Bleſſing, if from God,
ſuch was <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptists;</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
he pointed all to Chriſt,
<hi>John 1. 26. Lo the Lamb of God! I
Baptize you with VVater, but he ſhall
Baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and
with Fire,</hi> Mat. 3. 11. And ſo the
true Miniſtry does. And while Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are <hi>Senſual,</hi> and under ſuch an
<hi>Eclipſe,</hi> by the Interpoſition of <hi>Sin</hi>
and <hi>Satan,</hi> God is pleaſed to ſend
forth his <hi>Inlightning</hi> Servants to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and turn them <hi>from the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the Light in themſelves,</hi> that,
through Obedience to it, they may
come to be <hi>Children of the Light,</hi>
John 12. 36, and have their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52318:62"/>
one with another in it, and an
Inheritance, at laſt, with the Saints
in Light for ever.</p>
               <p>And as it is the Way God has
taken to Call and Gather People, ſo
a <hi>Living</hi> and <hi>Holy Miniſtry</hi> is of great

up</hi> the Young, and <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh</hi>
the feeble and ſimple Ones. But
ſtill I ſay, the <hi>more Inward,</hi> the <hi>leſs
Outward:</hi> The more People come to
be taught Immediately of God, by
the Light of his Word and Spirit in
their Hearts, the leſs need of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
means, read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. 19, 20.
which is held by all to be a <hi>Goſpel</hi>
Promiſe, and the Sun and Moon
there, as general underſtood to mean
the external Means in the Church.
Compare them with <hi>John 1. 13.
Rom. 1. 19. 1 Cor. 2. 11, 15. 1 Theſ.
4. 9. 1 John 2. 20, 27. Rev.</hi> 21. 22,
23, 24. All which points at what we
aſſert of the ſufficiency and glorious
Priviledge of Inward and Spiritual
Teachings. And moſt certainly, as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52318:63"/>
Men <hi>Grow in Grace, and know the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing</hi>
of the Word in themſelves,
the Diſpenſation will be leſs in
Words (though in Words) and more
in Life; and Preaching will, in great
Meaſure, be turned into <hi>Praiſing,</hi> and
the Worſhip of God, more into <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with,</hi> than Talking of God: For
that is <hi>VVorſhip indeed,</hi> that <hi>Bows</hi> to
his Will at all Times, and in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
The <hi>trueſt,</hi> the <hi>higheſt</hi> Worſhip
Man is capable of in this World.
And it is that Conformity that gives
Communion, and there is no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with God, no Light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to be enjoyed, no Peace and
Aſſurance to be had, further than
there is <hi>Obedience</hi> to his Will, and a
<hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to his Word, according

               <p>I ſay, this is the <hi>trueſt</hi> and <hi>higheſt</hi>

Swearing, being <hi>Vntruth,</hi> that Men's
