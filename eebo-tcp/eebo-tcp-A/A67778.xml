         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

our <hi>sanctification,</hi> either for the increase of our <hi>patience,</hi> or the exercise of our <hi>saith,</hi> or the improvement of our <hi>zeal,</hi> or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke our <hi>importunity,</hi> or for the doubling of our <hi>Obligation:</hi> seeing true <hi>gold</hi> flies not the <hi>touchstone;</hi> Let us examine whether we have thus <hi>husbanded</hi> our <hi>affliction</hi> to his <hi>glory,</hi> and our own spiritual and everlasting good. I know <hi>Gods</hi> fatherly <hi>chastisements</hi> for the time, seem <hi>grievous</hi> to the best of his <hi>Children;</hi> Yea, at first they come upon us, like <hi>Samsons Lion,</hi> look terrible in shew; as if they would <hi>devoure</hi> us; and as <hi>Children</hi> are afraid of their <hi>friends</hi> when they see them masked, so are we. But tell me, hath not this <hi>roaring Lion</hi> prevailed against thy best part? Hast thou kept thy <hi>head whole?</hi> (I mean) thy <hi>soul; free?</hi> For as <hi>Fencers</hi> will seem to fetch a blow at the <hi>leg,</hi> when they intend it at the head; so doth the <hi>Devil,</hi> though he strike at thy name, his aim is to slay thy <hi>soul.</hi> Now instead of being overcome doest thou overcome? Hath this <hi>Lion</hi> yielded thee any <hi>Honey</hi> of <hi>Instruction,</hi> or <hi>Reformation?</hi> Hath thy sin died with thy fame, or with thy health, or with thy <hi>peace,</hi> or with thy <hi>outward estate?</hi> Doest thou perceive the <hi>graces of Gods Spirit,</hi> to come up, and flourish so much the more in the spring of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, by how much more hard and bitter thy <hi>winter</hi> of adversity hath been? Then thou hast approved thy self Christs faithful <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,</hi> and a <hi>Citizen</hi> of that <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which is above: Yea, I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say of thee, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of himself, That <hi>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To finde this <hi>Honey</hi> in the <hi>Lion,</hi> more then makes amends for all former fear and grief: and in case any man, by his <hi>humiliation</hi> under the hand of God, is grown more <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>conscionable:</hi> there is <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> out of the <hi>Lion:</hi> or is any man by his temptation or fall, become more <hi>circumspect</hi> after it? There is also <hi>Honey</hi> out of the <hi>Lion, &amp;c.</hi> For there is no <hi>Samson,</hi> to whom every <hi>Lion</hi> doth not yield some <hi>Honey;</hi> for as <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction sanctified,</hi> ever leaves some <hi>blessing</hi> behinde it, like the <hi>River Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> which, by overflowing the Land of <hi>Egypt, fattens,</hi> and <hi>fils</hi> it, with <hi>flowers</hi> and <hi>fruits;</hi> so a <hi>fine wit,</hi> and a <hi>Christian will,</hi> makes use of any thing: like the little <hi>Bee,</hi> which will not off the meanest <hi>flower,</hi> till she hath made somewhat of it. Even <hi>Sauls</hi> malice shall serve to enhance <hi>Davids zeal:</hi> and the likelihood of losing <hi>Isaac,</hi> shall both evidence and improve <hi>Abrahams love to God:</hi> or, Hath the <hi>Lord</hi> made <hi>Hannah</hi> barren?

Lastly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this <hi>School of Affliction,</hi> will learn <hi>in what estate soever he is, (prosperous,</hi> or <hi>adverse,) therewith to be content:

But above all, our <hi>Saviours example</hi> will most excellently <hi>distinguish</hi> the ends of <hi>God, Satan,</hi> and <hi>wicked Men;</hi> for if we observe, <hi>Judas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him to death</hi> for <hi>gain,</hi> the <hi>Jewes</hi> for <hi>envy, Pilate</hi> for <hi>fear;</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> provoked each of them through this <hi>enmity; Christ himself,</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> his Fathers will, God the Father in love to sinners, and for their <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption:</hi> each furthered one and the same thing, but to contrary <hi>ends:</hi> so when this <hi>enmity</hi> breaks forth in the wicked, Satan hath a hand in it as a <hi>malicious authour;</hi> as when he entred into <hi>Judas, and made</hi> him <hi>betray Christ, Luke</hi> 22. 3. <hi>Man</hi> himself as a voluntary <hi>instrument,</hi> as when <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> hardened his own <hi>heart</hi> against the <hi>children of Israel, Exod.</hi> 9. 34. God as a most <hi>righteous Judge,</hi> and avenger, as when he also <hi>hardened Pharoahs heart,</hi> so punishing his former <hi>hardnesse,</hi> with further <hi>obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Exod.</hi> 9. 12. But how in this case? Even by permitting the <hi>seed of the Serpent,</hi> from their own malicious inclination, to hate the <hi>seed of the Woman,</hi> not by infusing this malice, but by with-drawing his grace when he sees it abused: he doth not <hi>infuse corruption,</hi> he doth <hi>not with-hold the occasion;</hi> as when the <hi>Rider</hi> gives his <hi>horse</hi> the raines, we say <hi>he puts him on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence that distinction of adversities, as they come from <hi>Satan,</hi> they are usually called <hi>temptations;</hi> as they come from <hi>Men, persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> as from <hi>God, afflictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as <hi>God</hi> turned the treachery of <hi>Judas,</hi> not onely to the praise of his <hi>justice, mercy, wisdom, power, &amp;c.</hi> but to the <hi>good of all believers:</hi> so he turnes this <hi>enmity of Satan</hi> and <hi>wicked men,</hi> to his <hi>childrens great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> (in stopping them in their courses of sin and keeping them in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise) and <hi>his own glory:</hi> And well may he work good by <hi>evil</hi> instruments, when every <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Magistrate</hi> hath the seàt to make profitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, aswell of <hi>evil persons,</hi> as of <hi>good:</hi> yea, when there is nothing in the world, be it <hi>gall</hi> it self; yea, the <hi>excrement of a Dog,</hi> or the <hi>poison of a Serpent,</hi> but mans shallow invention can finde it is <hi>good for something:</hi> neither do two contrary <hi>poisons mingled</hi> together prove mortal.</p>
            <p>And thus you see that the <hi>will of God</hi> may be done thanklessely, when in fulfilling the <hi>substance,</hi> we fail in the intentions, and <hi>erre in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now see with the like patience, how it will fare with these men in the end. <hi>Pomponius Atticus</hi> being destin'd to <hi>famishment,</hi> &amp; receiving no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>sustenance</hi> for many dayes; contrary to the intention; was <hi>freed</hi> by means of that <hi>abstinence</hi> from a violent pain, &amp; <hi>recovered of a disease;</hi> which otherwise had cost him his life. <hi>Prometheus</hi> being run in with a <hi>Rapier,</hi> and <hi>Jason</hi> receiving a <hi>great blow on the brest,</hi> each was restored to <hi>health,</hi> from dangerous and deadly <hi>impostumes,</hi> which otherwise were

thought <hi>ineurable.</hi> And this is our case, for even as that <hi>cured them,</hi> which their enemies intended should have <hi>killed them;</hi> so this enmity of the Serpent and his Seed, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>res our <hi>souls,</hi> and makes us everlastingly <hi>happie.</hi> Yet they intending onely evil in it, or at least the satisfying of their own wicked wills, (as they know better then I, wherein they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <hi>Weesel,</hi> which doth a man pleasure in <hi>destroying of Vermine,</hi> yet only intends the satisfying of her <hi>own hunger,</hi> not his good that keeps the house) can no way assume the least <hi>praise</hi> to themselves, nor expect the more favour.

            </p>
            <p>The Lord doth often good to his Church, even by those Instruments whom for their sins he means to cast into <hi>Hell-fire. Ashur</hi> was his Rod to <hi>scourge Israel;</hi> that done, they fell under a sharper <hi>lash themselves: Those Nations, saith God, shall serve the King of Babel seventy years, and when the seventy years are accomplished, I will visit the King of Babel and that Nation for their iniquities, and will make it a perpetual desolation, &amp;c. Jer.</hi> 25. 11, 12. <hi>and</hi> 30, 16. even the greater sinners may punish the lesse, and prosper for a time, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 7. <hi>I will bring the most wicked of the Heathen, and they shall possesse their Houses, vers.</hi> 24. When <hi>iniquity</hi> hath plaid her <hi>part,</hi> vengeance leaps upon the <hi>Stage;</hi> the <hi>Comedy</hi> is <hi>short,</hi> but the <hi>Tragedy</hi> is <hi>longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We use <hi>rubbish to scoure our vessels,</hi> when those vessels are cleared, we <hi>fling away the rubbish. Bridges</hi> that help men <hi>over the stream,</hi> at last themselves rot and sink in. When <hi>Balaams Asse</hi> had done speaking, <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana voce,</hi> she lived an <hi>Asse,</hi> and <hi>died an Asse:</hi> So when God hath suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <hi>afflicted the righteous,</hi> by the <hi>rod of the wicked,</hi> he will <hi>fling</hi> the <hi>Rod</hi> into the <hi>fire which is unquenchable, Isa.</hi> 33. 1.</p>
            <p>And it stands with the strength of <hi>reason,</hi> for if God, saith Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> strike so smartly those whom he spareth; how heavie will his blows be on them whom he condemneth; and with what severity shall <hi>Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes</hi> be punished, when <hi>his own children</hi> are so visited and afflicted. If Gods own <hi>Children,</hi> who are as dear and near to him, as the <hi>Apple of his eye,</hi> or the <hi>signet on his right hand,</hi> suffer so many and grievous afflictions here; what shall his adversaries suffer in <hi>Hell?</hi> undo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Again secondly, if the wicked are punished for doing wrong to the wicked, much more for wronging the <hi>just,</hi> and <hi>innocent:</hi> But wee have many examples of the former, as that of <hi>Adonibezeck,</hi> who having cut off the <hi>Thumbs</hi> and great <hi>Toes</hi> of Seventy Kings that were wicked like himself, had also his his own <hi>Thumbs</hi> and <hi>Toes</hi> cut off; <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Now why doth God by his <hi>promise</hi> tye himself to bee present with us; more especially in <hi>affliction?</hi> but that hee may <hi>resist our enemies, sustain us</hi> when wee faint, and <hi>crown</hi> us when wee overcome; but that hee may bee exact in taking <hi>notice</hi> of our particular sufferings, and as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Count our wandrings, put our tears into his bottle,</hi> and enter all into his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister, <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 8. 9. All our afflictions are more noted by that God <hi>that sends</hi> them, than of the <hi>patient that suffers them;</hi> every pang, and stitch, and gird, is first felt of him that sends it: could wee bee <hi>miserable unseen,</hi> wee had reason to bee heartless: but how can it bee but less possible to indure any thing that hee <hi>knows</hi> not, than that hee <hi>inflicted not?</hi> As hee said to <hi>Manoah</hi> by an <hi>Angell, Thou art barren, Judg.</hi> 13. 3. so hee saith to one, thou art <hi>sick,</hi> to another, thou art <hi>poor,</hi> to a third, thou art <hi>defamed;</hi> thou art <hi>oppressed</hi> to another; that all-seeing <hi>eye takes notice</hi> from heaven of every mans condition, no less than if hee should send an <hi>Angell to tell us</hi> hee knew it: and his <hi>knowledge</hi> compared with his <hi>mercy,</hi> is the just comfort of all our sufferings. O God! wee are many times <hi>miserable,</hi> and feel it not; thou knowest even those <hi>sorrows</hi> which we might have, thou knowest what thou hast done, <hi>do what thou pleasest.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Seeing therefore our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> hath fully discharged our <hi>debt,</hi> and made full satisfaction to his <hi>Fathers justice:</hi> God cannot in equity exact of us a <hi>second paiment,</hi> no more than the <hi>Creditor</hi> may justly require that his debt should bee twice paid; once by the <hi>Surety,</hi> and again, by the <hi>Principall.</hi>

and made these promises to the <hi>Prophets, Apostles, and holy men of God;</hi> but not to such <hi>hainous and rebellious sinners,</hi> who have most justly deserved, that God should pour out upon them the <hi>Vialls of his wrath,</hi> and those fearfull punishments threatned in the Law: All the promises made in the <hi>Gospel are generall, indefinite, and universall,</hi> excluding none that turn from their fins by <hi>unfained repentance,</hi> and beleeve in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> resting on him alone for their salvation, as appears, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16. 36. and 6. 37. 40. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1.

               <p>And therefore unless thou conceivest of God, that hee is unjust in his dealing, untrue in his Word, a covenant-breaker; yea, a perjured person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which were most horrible blasphemy once to imagine,) thou must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <hi>assure thy self,</hi> that hee will pardon and forgive thee all thy sins, bee they in number never so many and innumerable; or in nature and quality never so hainous and damnable: if thou turnest unto him by <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained repentance,</hi> and laiest hold upon Christ by a true and <hi>lively faith.</hi> For consider, doth the Lord say <hi>hee will extend his mercie unto all</hi> that come unto him? doth hee <hi>invite every one?</hi> doth hee say <hi>I would have all men saved,</hi> and none to perish? and dost thou say, nay, but <hi>hee will not extend his mercy unto mee,</hi> hee will have mee to perish, because I am a <hi>grievous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</hi> What is this but in effect, and at a distance to <hi>contradict the Lord,</hi> and give the lye to truth it self.</p>
               <p>Indeed God says not, Beleeve thou <hi>John, or Thomas,</hi> and thou shalt bee saved; but hee says, <hi>Whosoever beleeveth, and is baptized, shall bee saved,</hi> which is as good. And yet thou exceptest thy self, hee excludes none; and dost thou exclude one, and that one <hi>thy self?</hi> Hee would have all men saved, and thou comest in with thy exceptive, <hi>All but mee;</hi> Why thee? a precious <hi>singularity,</hi> but beware of it: For whereas others that <hi>beleeve not the threatnings,</hi> flatter away their souls in a <hi>presumptuous confidence;</hi> thou by not <hi>beleeving the promises,</hi> wilt cast away thine, in a sullen <hi>prodigious desperateness,</hi> if thou take not heed. For <hi>infidelity</hi> on both sides is the cause of all, of presumption in them, of despair in thee, of impiety in <hi>every one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But bee better advised, beleeve the Lord who never <hi>brake his Word</hi> with any soul. Thou wilt give credit to an <hi>honest man's bare word,</hi> and hast thou no affiance in the mercifull <hi>promises of God,</hi> past to thee by <hi>Word, Oath, Seals, Scriptures, Sacraments, the death of his own Son,</hi> and (I presume) the <hi>Spirits testimony,</hi> if not now, yet at other times: take heed what thou dost, for certainly <hi>nothing offends God more, then the not taking of his Word.</hi>

                  <hi>Objection.</hi> I know well that <hi>Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness, unto every one that beleeveth,</hi> Rom. 10. 4. But I want faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This is the <hi>objection</hi> I expected: (for the true Christian is as fearfull to entertain a good opinion of himself, as the false is unwilling to bee driven from it) But is it so? or doth <hi>Satan</hi> onely tell thee so? I know it is not so, I know that thou beleevest with some mixture of <hi>unbelief,</hi> and that this is but a slander of <hi>Satans;</hi> for as Satan slandereth us to God, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 9. and God to us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 4. 5. so hee slandereth us to our selvs, <hi>Iob</hi> 16. 9. But least thou shouldest think I slander <hi>Satan;</hi> know, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, even whiles you complain of unbelief: for as there could bee no shadow, if there were no light, so there cannot bee this fear, where there is no <hi>faith.</hi> They that know not <hi>Christ,</hi> think it no such great matter to <hi>loose him.</hi> But if God once say, <hi>this is my Son,</hi> Satan will say, <hi>if thou bee the Son of God, Matth.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>and</hi> 4. 3. That Divine testimony did not <hi>allay his malice, but exasperate it.</hi> Neither can the happy <hi>building of, Lord I beleeve,</hi> stand without that columne to under-prop it, <hi>Help thou mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi> And he that doubts not of his <hi>estate,</hi> his <hi>estate</hi> is much to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of; <hi>doubting and resolution</hi> are not meet <hi>touch-stones</hi> of our success: <hi>a presumptuous confidence</hi> commonly goes bleeding home, when an humble fear returns in triumph. As it fared between the <hi>Philistims and Israel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 10. 11. The <hi>Philistims and Goliah</hi> were exceeding <hi>confident</hi> of the victory, but <hi>Saul,</hi> and all <hi>Israel</hi> much discouraged, and greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid: yet <hi>Israel</hi> got the victory, and the <hi>Philistims</hi> with their great <hi>Goliah</hi> were overcome, <hi>ver.</hi> 51. 52. They that are proudly secure of their <hi>going to heaven,</hi> do not so frequently come thither, as they that are afraid of <hi>their going to hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it is in <hi>this world for temporall things,</hi> so for the <hi>World to come in spirituall things; Cantant pauperes, lugent divites; poor</hi> men sing, and rich men cry. Who is so melancholly, as the rich worldling? and who sings so merry a <hi>note,</hi> as hee that cannot change a <hi>groat?</hi> so they that have store of grace, mourn for want of it; and they that indeed want it, chant their abundance. But the hopes of the wicked fail them when they are at <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi> whereas Gods Children had those comforts in <hi>extremity;</hi> which they durst not expect.</p>
               <p>As there is nothing more usuall, than for a <hi>secure conscience to excuse</hi> when it is guilty: so nothing more common than for <hi>an afflicted conscience to accuse,</hi> when it is innocent; and to lay an heavie <hi>burthen</hi> upon it self, where the Lord giveth a plain <hi>discharge:</hi> but a <hi>bleeding wound</hi> is better than that which <hi>bleeds not.</hi> Some men go <hi>crying to heaven,</hi> some go <hi>laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sleeping to hell.</hi> Some <hi>consciences</hi> aswell as men, lie <hi>speechless</hi> before departure: <hi>they spend their days in a dream, and go from earth to hell, as Ionas from Israel towards Tarshish, fast a sleep.</hi> And the reason is, they dream their case is passing good, like a man which dreams in his sleep that hee is rich and honorable, and it joyes him very much, but awaking, all
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62748:23"/>
is vanish'd like <hi>smoak.</hi> Yea, they hope undoubtedly to go to <hi>heaven,</hi> as all that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> hoped to go into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and inherit the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed promises: when onely <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua</hi> did enter, who <hi>provoked not the Lord.</hi> And the <hi>reason of this reason</hi> is, whereas indeed they are <hi>Wol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ight;</hi> so there is something in a <hi>Christian under a cloud,</hi> whereby hee may bee discerned to bee a <hi>true beleever,</hi> and not, an <hi>hypocrite.</hi> But, to make it manifest to thy self, that thou art so.</p>
               <p>Know, first, that where there is any one grace in truth, there is every one in their measure. If thou art sure thou hast love, I am sure thou hast faith: for they are as inseparable, as <hi>fire and heat, life and motion,</hi> the <hi>root and the sap,</hi> the <hi>Sun and its light:</hi> and so of other graces. Or, dost thou feel that Christ is thy greatest joy, sin thy greatest sorrow; that when thou canst not feel the presence of the spirit in thy heart, thou goest mourning, notwithstanding all other comforts? Assuredly as that holy <hi>Martyr</hi> said, if thou were not a <hi>wedding Child,</hi> thou couldest never so heartily mourn for the absence of the <hi>Bridegroom.</hi> Thus I might go on, but a few <hi>Grapes</hi> will shew that the <hi>Plant</hi> is a <hi>Vine,</hi> and not a <hi>Thorn.</hi> Take but notice of this, and severall graces will one streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then another, as <hi>stones</hi> in an <hi>Arch.</hi> As for example, Master <hi>Peacock,</hi> Fellow of a House, being <hi>afflicted in conscience,</hi> (as thou art) and at the point of despair; when some <hi>Ministers</hi> ask'd whether they should pray for him, answered, By no means do no so <hi>dishonour God,</hi> as to pray for such a <hi>Reprobate</hi> as I am: but his young <hi>Pupill</hi> standing by, said, (with tears in his eyes) Certainly a <hi>Reprobate</hi> could never bee so <hi>tender of Gods dishonour;</hi> which hee well considering, was thereby <hi>comforted</hi> and <hi>restored:</hi> when neither hee with his <hi>learning,</hi> nor any other <hi>Ministers</hi> with their <hi>sage advice,</hi> could do any good.</p>
               <p>Again secondly, if ever thou hadst <hi>true faith</hi> wrought in thy <hi>heart,</hi> bee not discouraged; for as the former graces shew, that thou hast with <hi>Mary</hi> made choice of that <hi>better part, which shall never bee taken from thee:</hi> So this grace of <hi>faith</hi> is <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>wedding Ring,</hi> and to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hee <hi>gives it,</hi> hee <hi>gives himselfe with it;</hi> wee may lose the <hi>sence,</hi> but never the <hi>essence</hi> of it: It may bee <hi>eclipsed,</hi> not <hi>extinguished: Fides concussa, non excussa: The gifts and calling of God are without repentance:</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>Friends</hi> are unconstant, <hi>riches, honours, pleasures,</hi> are unconstant; the <hi>world</hi> is unconstant, and <hi>life</hi> it self is unconstant; but.

            <p>And commonly their change is not more dolefull, than sudden; for as it often hapneth, that in very fair weather a storm doth arise: and as I have read of certain <hi>Trees,</hi> which on <hi>Munday</hi> have been growing in the <hi>Forrest,</hi> and before <hi>Sunday</hi> following, <hi>under sail on the Sea:</hi> so the same hour hath seen the <hi>knee bowing to the head;</hi> and again, the <hi>head stooping, and doing reverence to the knee,</hi> as every age gives instance: for else I might <hi>muster up a multitude of examples</hi> for proof of the point.

And certainly, if riches were such pearls, as most men esteem them, it is not likely the Lord would <hi>cast them to suh Swine,</hi> as mostly hee doth: If such <hi>happy things,</hi> hee would not <hi>throw them to such Dogs.</hi> As what saith <hi>Luther</hi> of the whole <hi>Turkish Empire?</hi> it is but a crum of bread, which the master of the house, throweth to his Dogs. And the truth is, what men think most pleasing, (viz. to have their wills, and their lusts granted) <hi>is most plaguing,</hi> Psal. 81. 12. <hi>So I gave them up unto their own hearts lusts, and they walked in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels;</hi> so that the greatest <hi>temtation, is to bee without temtation: and the greatest affliction, not to be afflicted,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 7.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>lift up your hands which hang down,</hi> because of some sore affliction, <hi>and your weak knees, Heb.</hi> 12. 12. and know, that the worst of temporall afflictions, are an <hi>insufficient proof</hi> of divine displeasure: yea, that stripes from the Almighty, are <hi>tokens of his love,</hi> and <hi>seals of his Son-ship.</hi>

So Ecclesiasticall History gives the like generall testimony of all the <hi>Saints</hi> in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and succeeding ages; for we read that of all the <hi>Apostles,</hi> none dyed a naturall death save onely Saint <hi>John,</hi> and hee also was banished by <hi>Domitian</hi> to <hi>Pathmos:</hi> and at another time, thrust into a <hi>Tun of seething Oil at Rome;</hi> as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> do report. As for other beleevers, there was such a multitude of them suffered <hi>Martyrdom</hi> for professing the <hi>Gospel;</hi> whereof some were <hi>stoned,</hi> som <hi>crucisied,</hi> som <hi>beheaded,</hi> some thrust through with <hi>spears,</hi> some burnt with <hi>fire,</hi> and the like; (for wee read of <hi>twenty nine severall deaths</hi> they were put unto) that Ecclesiasticall History makes mention of, <hi>two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi> which suffered the same day with <hi>Nicanor.</hi> And after that, in the time of the <hi>Ten persecutions,</hi> were such an <hi>innumerable company of innocent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians put to death,</hi> and tormented; that Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Chromatius and Heliodorus,</hi> saith, There was not one day in the whole year, unto which the number of five thousand <hi>Martyrs</hi> might not bee ascribed; except onely the first day of <hi>January,</hi> who were put to the most exquisite <hi>deaths and torments,</hi> that ever the wit or malice, of <hi>Men or Devills</hi> could invent to inflict upon them. Since which time, the <hi>Turke</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> have acted their parts in <hi>shedding the blood of the Saints,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews and Roman Empeours,</hi> as appears in the Book of <hi>Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. where the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> hath foretold, that the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> should <hi>fight with the Lambe, and they that are on his side, called, and chosen, and faithfull, untill shee were even drunk with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jesus;</hi> which in part was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>England,</hi> under the Raign of <hi>Queen Mary:</hi> when in one year a <hi>Hundred seventy</hi> six persons of quality were burnt for <hi>Religion,</hi> with many of the common sort, and in <hi>France,</hi> where before theselate bloody <hi>Massacres,</hi> there were two <hi>Hundred Thousand</hi> which suffered <hi>Martyrdone, about Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi> And it is well known, that our <hi>Saviour Christs</hi> whole life, even from his <hi>Cradle to his Grave,</hi> was nothing else but a continued act of suffering; yea, hee was the person, upon whom, as upon one <hi>Center, all our sorrows met:</hi> Hee that had all, possessed nothing, except the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to our sins, which lay so heavy upon him for satisfaction; that it pressed his soul as it were to the nethermost <hi>Hell,</hi> and made him cry out

in the anguish of his spirit, <hi>My God, My God, why hast thou sorsaken mee?</hi> so that there is nothing befalls us, but hath befalne our betters before us: and to bee free from crosses and afflictions, is the priviledge onely of the <hi>Church triumphant.</hi> For, <hi>qui non est Crucianus, non est Christianus,</hi> saith Luther: <hi>there is not a Christian, that carries not his Cross.</hi> It is onely <hi>Heaven,</hi> that is above all windes, storms and tempests: Not hath God (saith <hi>Bernard)</hi> cast n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

laud, and thinksgiving, for all thy mercies and favours, spiritual and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, temporal and eternal: For that thou hast freely elected us to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all eternity; when thou hast passed by many millions of others, both Men and Angels, whereas we deserved to perish no lesse then they; and thou migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For thine unexpressible love, in redeeming us out of Hell, and from those unsufferable and endlesse tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the pretious blood of thy dear Son: who spared not himself, that thou mightest spare us. For calling us home to thee by the Ministry of thy Word, and the work of thy good Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>. For the long continuance of thy Gospel with us, (the best of blessings). For sparing us so long, and giving us so large a time of repentance. For justifying, and in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure sanctifying us, and giving us ground for assured hope of being glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy heavenly Kingdom. For preserving us from so infinite many perils and dangers, which might easily have befalne us every day, to the taking away of either our estates, our limbs, or our lives. For so plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and graciously blessing us all our life long, with many and manifold good things; both for necessity and delight. For peace of conscience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of minde. For our health, wealth, limbs, senses, food, raiment, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, prosperity. For thy great mercie in correcting us, and turning thy corrections to our good. For preserving us in the night past from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of body and soul; and for infinite more mercies, of which we could not well want any one: and which are all greatned, by being bestowed upon us, who were so unworthy; and have been so ungrateful for the same. O that we could answer thee in our thankfulnesse, and obedient walking, one for a thousand!</p>
               <p>Neither are we unmindful of those national blessings, which thou hast vouchsafed unto our Land in general: as namely, that deliverance from the Spanish Invasion in 88, and from that divelish design of the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-Treason: for preserving us from the noisome, and devouring Plague and Pestilence. Lord grant, that our great unthankfulnesse for these thy mercies, may not cause thee to deliver us into the hands of our enemies: and although we have justly thereby deserved the same, yet we beseech thee, give us not up unto their wills, neither suffer Popery ever to bear rule over us; nor thy blessed Word and Sacraments to be taken away from us; but continue them unto us, and to our posterity after us, if it be thy good pleasure; untill the coming of thy Christ.</p>
