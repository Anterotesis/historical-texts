            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEloved Sisters, and my well infected <hi>Brethren,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this Text, as you shall find it written in the first Chapter of <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the third Verse, as it followeth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Babylonians had an Idoll they called Bell, and there were spent upon him every day,</hi> 12 <hi>gress measures of fine flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and</hi> 40 <hi>sheepe, and</hi> 6 <hi>vessels of wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will first of all make a Division in the former part of my Text, I will leave the latter to the Last, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that as I shall <hi>VVax</hi> to an <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Babilonians had an Idoll they called Bell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This sentence I shall divide into 4 parts, because your understandings my Beloved Brethren, consisteth chiefly in the Knowledge of Divisions, the particles are these.</p>
            <p>1. The Time. 2. The Nation. 3. The Crime. 4. The Denomination.</p>
            <p>The Time. <hi>Now.</hi> The Nation, <hi>The Babylonians.</hi> The Crime, <hi>had an Idoll.</hi> The Denomination, <hi>called Bell.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Now the Babylonians had an Idoll called Bell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First I will begin with the time, you must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it was 1, 10. 100. 1000 yeares agoe, but <hi>Now,</hi> at this present, <hi>Now the Babylonians, &amp;c.</hi> Beloved there is much evill and abomination to be picked out of these three letters <hi>Now,</hi> according to the explication of a deare deceased Brother of ours which you cald <hi>Anthony Now, Now,</hi> and cald he was from us too soone, yet the worst the wicked can say of him is, that hee dyed a dutifull death, and hee did but <hi>Come when he was called,</hi>


               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:63859:3"/>
but leaving our Brother as he hath left us, I will proceed with this word <hi>Now, Now the Babylonians, Now</hi> doth, plainely and significantly expound it self in these words, at this time, this present, this instant, and never were peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more strangely misled by fals teaching and preaching then <hi>Now:</hi> you shall heare how many sentences or questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this word <hi>Now</hi> will answer me: When were golden Crosses, Images &amp; pictures suffered to stand in defiance of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> nay even in the open streetes? my Text doth answer <hi>Now:</hi> When were lying, fcurrilous pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, which abuse the Brethren in prose and Verse, by the Name of <hi>Round-head,</hi> more in Fashion then <hi>Now.</hi> There was one who writ a Booke, intituled, <hi>A Medicine for the times,</hi> where assuredly he doth vindicate that pillar of Golden superstition, <hi>Cheap side Crosse,</hi> calling us thieves, who bare away the lead, because those limbes should not be agen set up by Idolatrous people, &amp; when was this booke generally sold to draw the hearts of the people from us, but according as it is in my text, <hi>Now:</hi> but were he in our Conventicle that writ it, and he that printed it, I thinke it were convenient that all of us with one a-cord shold endeavour to hang them to death, and were they here, no fitter time then <hi>Now:</hi> but si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence they are not present, we will defer their execution till wee can confidently say we have them <hi>Now:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I will not trespasse upon your patience much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then my limited time, 6 houres, I will <hi>Now</hi> conclude this part of my Text, and proceed to the next, which is the <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Nation were <hi>Babylonians,</hi> for so my Text telleth me,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Babylonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved, these Babylonians are a Nation that inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Babylon, and derive their names from <hi>Nimrods</hi> Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Babel,</hi> a Tower, which according to my Authors description, was 4 hundred thousand times higher then the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> bearing twice as many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand piece of Ordnance, for it was the intention of that proud <hi>Nimrod,</hi> to shoot downe heaven: amongst this Nation lived that grand enemy to our sect, <hi>The Whore of Babylon,</hi> a most fathomlesse Harlot, and corrupted every man that had any Part in Babel (the more fooles they) this <hi>Nimrod</hi> was the first that ever taught Idolatry, for (as I have bin told) you know I cannot read my selfe, before ever the Art of carving or painting was, hee taught the people to adore the fire, which expressed his hot zeale in Idolatry, it was onely their ignorance in arts, that kept them from setting up such a Crosse, as is in <hi>Cheap-side:</hi> not long after <hi>Nimrod</hi> succeeded King <hi>Astiages:</hi> after his decease, <hi>Cyrus</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi> received his Kingdome, as you shall read in the first Verse of this Chapter, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my Text is living at this present, for,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Babylonians had an Idoll, Called</hi> Bell.</p>
            <p>And thus much shall suffice to have bin spoken for the second part of my Text, which is the Nation, <hi>Babilonians,</hi> now the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> I will now proceed unto the third, which is their crime, their Idolatry, their Image worship the Divell by this time had instructed them in the Art of making Idols, for so my Text saith,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Babylonians had an Idoll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Idol was made of Brasse without and clay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, a brazen face, and an earthen heart, fil'd with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63859:4"/>
and fraught with abhomination. This word Idoll properly derives it selfe from Idle, which in significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, my attentive Brethren, is sloth, Iazinesse, they wold imploy their times in nothing but making Images. Ile warrant you in those dayes a Journeyman Image-Maker might get his halfe crowne a day, doe you but censure then, my deare Assembly, how they flourished in their wickednesse, but, since they had nothing else to doe but to set up Idols, it shall become us to make it the busines of our whole lives to pull them downe: but take this caution with you, when you next attempt the holy destruction of that nest of Idols, <hi>Cheap-side Crosse,</hi> be not too violent, least you suffer as our Brother did, yet had hee past the Pikes, he had bin living to this day. This Idoll in my Text, was Brasse without, and earth within, a cheape Idoll to those in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> for they are Gold without, and lead within. Beloved, Lead was not made to forme Idols with, but for the good of mankind, which is to make Bullets, and Tyle Houses; your onely way to confound this aforesaid <hi>Cheap-side</hi> Crosse, is to pull downe to the ground, that old Idoll <hi>Charin,</hi> and beat downe this with the stones, that wee may have no more cause to say,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Babylonians had an I doll called Bell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now come to the Denomination of this Idoll, they cald him <hi>Bell,</hi> for so saith the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Babilonians had an Idol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This notorious Babe of Idolatry, who hath to name, <hi>Bell,</hi> hath his Name derived from that generall enemy to mankind <hi>Belze-bub,</hi> one whom we all know to bee the


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63859:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Devill; this <hi>Bell</hi> was made of brasse, &amp; that is the only reason (my beloved) that our <hi>Bels</hi> be held so much in contempt amongst the Brethren. This <hi>Bell</hi> according to the text had spent upon him every 10 great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of fine Flower, 40 Sheepe, and 6 Vessels of wine: now who devoured this Flower? Bell, who consumed the 40 Sheepe, but Bell, who dranke the wine, so that there was a generall exaction laid upon each Pint and Quart, but Bell, or A-bell.</p>
            <p>I have observed that there was never any good in that word where <hi>Bell</hi> had a share in't what was <hi>Adam Bell,</hi> but a hunter, so was Nimrod, who built that ambitious Tower <hi>Babel;</hi> I have heard with mine owne eares, those blads which call themselvs <hi>Cavaleroes</hi> call a Crosse Bard sword <hi>Troy Bel.</hi> what is a <hi>Bel-man</hi> but a night walker (as I apprehend him) nay doe not your superstitious papists curse the Bretheren with <hi>Bell Booke and Candell;</hi> was not that <hi>Cardinall</hi> an arch Heretick who had to name <hi>Bell Armine;</hi> doe not those persecuting papists in <hi>Ireland Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bel,</hi> yes double and <hi>Tre-Bel;</hi> and I hope there will be such an Equall uniformity amongst us who are the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>Brethren</hi> that no particular man may be sayd to bare the <hi>Bel:</hi> nor shall any man hereafter be counted a man the sounder for being <hi>Bel-Metle,</hi> for <hi>Bel</hi> was <hi>Brasse</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and Clay within.</p>
            <p>Now the Babilonians had an Idol called Bell,
and there was spent upon him every day 12 measures of fine flower, and 40 sheepe and 6 Vessels of wine, beloved had I been to serve <hi>Bell</hi> with this banquet I would have made <hi>Bels eares ring noone</hi> ere he should have had it; now who doe you conceive should worship this <hi>Bell?</hi> noe worse man then <hi>Cyrus</hi> the King, as you shall find it in the fourth verse;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63859:5"/>
               <hi>And</hi> Syrus <hi>worshipped it and went daily to adore it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is thought (by some Authors) that this <hi>Syrus</hi> first made this <hi>Bel,</hi> if hee did, hee was but a <hi>Bel</hi> founder; or at least the first that ever was a <hi>Bel-founder.</hi> I shall love a <hi>Bel-founder</hi> the worse for it all dayes of my life; I could proceed further and would but for feare of the law, who if I should be too zealous, would censure this Lecture to be a <hi>Libell,</hi> therefore, this shall suffice at this time, next meeting shall perfect the worke begun: repaire to your houses and consider of these sayings, Farewell.</p>
