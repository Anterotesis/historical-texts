            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Interpreters concerning the time, and the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of it: Some conceiving it was about the time when the Jews were ſtopt and interrupted in the works of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Temple by their ill neighbours; but moſt doe agree that the time was about the end of the ſeventy years captivity, when God had raiſed up the ſpirits of the Prophets to encourage the people to expect this mercy, according to that of <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. <hi>Comfort yee, comfort ye my</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 40. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>people, ſaith the Lord, ſpeak ye comfortably to Hieruſalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accompliſhed:</hi> and alſo ſtirred up the ſpirits of the people to pray to the Lord, to accompliſh his good word for their returne, according to that of <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. <hi>Then ſhall yee call upon mee, and I will</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 29. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>hearken unto you.</hi> And as for the Penman of it, who ever it was, (for that is altogether unknown) moſt certain it is, that hee neither penn'd nor ſpake theſe things in his own name, or of his own condition, but in the name of the whole Church of God, like another <hi>Jeremy</hi> writing a book of <hi>Lamentations,</hi> for the deſolations of <hi>Zion;</hi> bemoaning them before the Lord, and moſt earneſtly begging mercy and deliverance. In the 11 firſt Verſes you may behold the afflicted Church of God ſitting alone like a deſolate widow, with her tears on her cheeks, her belly cleaving to the duſt, her heart ſmitten and withered like graſſe, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhes for bread, mingling her drink with weeping; as a Pelican in the wilderneſſe, as an Owl in the deſart; her enemies many and raging againſt her, ſhee looking round about, and all her Lovers and friends departed from her; enquiring after ſuccour and comfort, and it is farre remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: <hi>Behold to what a ſad condition the ſinnes of Gods own people doe oft times bring them!</hi> and that is the firſt part of the <hi>Pſalme.</hi> But in this dark and tempeſtuous night of calamity and deſolation, this afflicted ſoul, with <hi>Jonah</hi> in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112952:4"/>
the whales belly with weeds-wrapped about his head, looks up to God, begins to remember thoſe everlaſting mercies that may bee found in the Lord Jehovah; and preſently there darts in a beam (as from a new created Statre) of light and comfort in the 12, and 13 Verſe, which ſhines into the ſoule, and inables this poore deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late creature to conclude very comfortably, that that God who had broken her would yet again heal her, that his wrath ſhould not alwayes continue, but he would return and revive, and quicken them, after all the days wherin he <note place="margin">Eſa. 40. 31.</note> had afflicted them, and ſo ſuddenly begins to renew its ſtrength, and mount up with wings of comfort, as an Eagle: And from the 12 Verſe to the end of the Pſalme, after all this ſad lamentation, there is a comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall ſtory of all the good that God did mean to doe fot this afflicted Church, which now lay in the duſt and rubble: wherein there are three remarkable things,</p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>A ſtrong confident propheticall concluſion,</hi> that the deliverance of Gods Church was nigh at hand, in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe and have mercy upon Zion, for the time to deliver her; yea, the ſet time is come:</hi> that's her concluſion, that it muſt of neceſſity be, the Lord was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſpeedily to raiſe them out of their low condition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you have <hi>the Argument</hi> which ſatisfied this afflicted deſolate ſoul, that the time of <hi>Zions</hi> deliverance was at hand; becauſe <hi>all Gods ſervants took pleaſure in the duſt of it, and pityed the very ſtones, and the rubbiſh of it;</hi> their hearts were deeply humbled for <hi>Zions</hi> miſeries; they had ſet themſelves earneſtly to pray to the Lord; to give him no reſt night nor day till hee had ſet it up; and this ſpirit of prayer powred out upon the Church, was to her as ſure a token of approaching deliverance, as the day ſtar is a token of an approaching morning: That is the ſecond.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:112952:5"/>
The third part of this prophecy is, the <hi>uſe or fruit,</hi> which he doth foretell ſhould be made of this great work of Gods raiſing and building up of <hi>Zion,</hi> which is very excellent; partly the uſe that the reſt of the <hi>Nations</hi> of the world ſhould make of it, <hi>all the heathen</hi> ſhould ſtand and wonder at it, and praiſe Gods name for it; yea, their <hi>Kings,</hi> even <hi>all</hi> the Kings ſhould behold the glory of the Lord, and come in and worſhip, and honour him who had wrought ſuch a great work, as the raiſing <hi>Zion</hi> out of the duſt: and then for the <hi>Church,</hi> the people that <hi>are created</hi> on purpoſe to bee for Gods glory, <hi>it ſhould bee written for them from generation</hi> to generation, that they and all their poſterities ſhould perpetually love and ſerve the Lord, who did thus remember his people in their low condition. Now leſt ſome body might wonder why the Prophet ſhould make ſuch a ſtupendious buſineſſe of it, and demand a reaſon why all the world muſt thus take ſuch notice of the building of <hi>Zion:</hi> what is <hi>Zion?</hi> and what is the work? as he ſaid of <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Parphar,</hi> were they not better rivers then all the rivers of <hi>Samaria?</hi> Are there not other Empires and States, more pompous, and powerfull, and glorious, and excellent then <hi>Zion?</hi> what is <hi>Zion</hi> to <hi>Nineveh</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> that all muſt ſo ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the reparation of it? To ſatisfie all the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, that the work of building up of <hi>Zion,</hi> is indeed admirable and wonderfull, and deſerves all the praiſes that the hearts and tongues of men can utter, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the 2 Verſes which I have read, doth ſetdown two remarkable Circumſtances which perpetually accompany this work, which if they but interpreted, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, will ſatisfie all the World, that <note place="margin">And of theſe words.</note> this alone is the work deſerving admiration, and theſe they are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:112952:5"/>
The firſt is, It is ſuch a work, that when ever the Lord goes about it, <hi>Hee doth appeare in his glory;</hi> when the Lord ſhall build up <hi>Zion,</hi> he ſhall appear in his glory.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, when the Lord doth build up <hi>Zion,</hi> He doth then <hi>return an anſwer to all the prayers of his afflicted people:</hi> Whatſoever they had been begging from year to year, from generation to generation, now was the Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee, now comes the return of all into their boſomes, full meaſure, thruſt together, ſhaken, and running over: When the Lord doth build up <hi>Zion,</hi> he doth then regard the prayer of the afflicted, and however before hee might ſeem to deſpiſe ehem, now he doth no longer deſpiſe their cry: The firſt of theſe is that, which by the Lords aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance I ſhall this day clear unto you; this remarkable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which accompanies the building and reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Zion: When the Lord ſhall build up Zion hee ſhall appear in his glory;</hi> and in it obſerve &amp; handle theſe two leſſons.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>The firſt I ſhall onely touch, and that but to make way for the ſecond.</p>

appeare in his glory when he comes to build his Church. Secondly, I ſhall make application of it. And for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the truth of it there are foure things to be opened.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, To prove the truth of it out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <note place="margin">2.</note>

            </p>
            <p>And fourthly, why he is pleaſed thus to appeare in his <note place="margin">4.</note> glory, when he undertakes this work. For the firſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what it is to appeare in Glory. Glory and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency <note place="margin">1. What it is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in glory.</note> doe thus differ one from another: Excellency is the intrinſecall worth or value of any thing; Glory is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of this Excellency: Glory is nothing but the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation or ſhining out of Excellency. Take a true Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond ſtone when it is firſt found, and lookes but like a common ſtone, there is even then all the excellency of a Diamond in it; but when it is filed, and the curious Artiſt hath done his part to ſet it off in its luſtre, then appeares the glory of the Diamond: or amongſt men, it may be a man hath admirable abilities of wiſedome, learning, power, ſtrength, activity, or whatſoever elſe might argue him to be eminent, ſo long as all theſe are hidden, this man is really an excellent man, but when by ſome worke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all theſe inward excellencies the world comes to know him to be ſuch a one as indeed he is, then doth the man appeare in his glory: So that to appeare in glory, is nothing but to appeare to be as excellent as indeed one is. Therefore for God to appeare in glory, is his manifeſting himſelfe to be ſuch a God as he is, when all thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, excellent attributes and perfections which are in him, come to irradiate, ſhine forth, that others muſt neceſſarily
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:112952:10"/>
acknowledge God to be that which he is; when he appears like himſelf, then doth God appeare in his glory.</p>
            <p>Now ſecondly, it's cleare in the Scripture that God doth ſo, that he doth manifeſt himſelfe to be ſuch a God as he <note place="margin">2.</note>

Sometimes flouds and waves ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the tumultuous people, that make a noiſe of ſedition, mutiny, trouble, and violence; but here, the flouds which ſignifie People and Nations, lift up their voice of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and acknowledgment of that which was ſet downe before, <hi>viz.</hi> that God was cloathed with Majeſty and

            <p>Another you ſhall ſee in the 68. <hi>Pſalme;</hi> The whole <hi>Pſalme</hi> is a moſt ſtately ſtraine of divine Rhetorique, the <note place="margin">Pſal. 68. 1. 2. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</note> beginning of it is very high and lofty: Let God ariſe, let him ſhew himſelfe, let his enemies be ſcattered, them that hate him, fly before him; as ſmoake is driven away, as wax melteth before the fire, ſo muſt wicked men periſh at this preſence of God: and every where throughout the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> you may obſerve ſuch a glorious preſence of God, as made the earth ſhake, the heavens drop, the hills leap, the mountains moved, the Saints rejoyce and ſing, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to bee routed, Kings and Princes to flee: all this is nothing but a deſcription of Gods manner of appearing, when he builds up <hi>Zion,</hi> when hee redeems his Church out of bondage, and ſubdues people unto him by the Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of Chriſt, the Preaching of the word, which is the rod of his power, as is moſt manifeſt by one place in the <note place="margin">Verſe 18. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 4. 8.</note> midſt of the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> which is as a key to open all. Thou haſt aſcended up on high, thou haſt led captivity captive, thou haſt received gifts for men, even for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwell among them. This is meant of Chriſts aſcending to the right hand of God, to take poſſeſſion of the rule and government of the Church; when he thus aſcended up on high, hee led captivity cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, led all the enemies of the Church, as captives at his Chariot wheeles, and gave gifts to men, ſuch gifts as ſhould build his Church; which <hi>Paul</hi> interprets in the fourth of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to be the offices and gifts which the Lord Chriſt gave, when he aſcended up to heaven, for the gathering, and building up of the Church; hee then gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Prophets, ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112952:11"/>
of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Another notable paſſage is in the 63 of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Marke how rhetorically and elegantly the Spirit of God ſets it <note place="margin">Eſa. 63. 1, 2. &amp;c. opened.</note> down; The Prophet ſtands amazed at the ſight of one that drew nigh unto him; Who is this (ſaith hee) that comes from <hi>Edom,</hi> with dyed Garments from <hi>Bozrah?</hi> that is thus glorious in his apparell: travelling in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſtrength? who is this? what is hee that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in thus much glory? the anſwer is made, in the name and perſon of Chriſt, <hi>It is I the Lord, mighty to ſave.</hi> And what was the work that hee did there? what was the glory? why truely, Jeſus Chriſt then came to reſcue his Church from thraldome, from <hi>Egypt, Babylon,</hi> from <note place="margin">Verſ. 9.

            <p>Yet this work of gathering and building of the Church <note place="margin">This work car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on in a way differing from all other his works. Manifeſted.</note> of Chriſt, is a work, which is carryed in a quite differing ſtraine, and way, from all other workes, which ever the Lord puts his own hand to. Look upon all his other workes, and you ſhall ſeldome finde that the work goes beyond what the matter and the inſtruments may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and within the compaſſe and fadome of ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, may you finde the ſumme of all that doth appeare in any other work of Gods hands; ſo that although every thing that is done, may truely bee ſaid to bee the Lords, and to bee wrought (if I may ſpeak with reverence) in his ſhop; yet becauſe God carries them on by a concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and ſubordination of ſecond cauſes, every one working according to their nature, (though ſecretly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed by his own hand) theſe workes of God may true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee ſaid, to bee wrought by Gods ſervants, by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſes and inferiour ſervants; but the whole carriage of the buſineſſe of the Church of God is reſerved for Gods owne hand, as his Maſter peece; carryed in ſuch a way as none may lay any claime to have any thing to do in it, unleſſe he can challenge to have the perfections of Jehovah in him; and this I am certaine you'l acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if you pleaſe to lend me your reverent attention, while I cleare theſe foure things unto you:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>Materials out of which</hi> the Lord uſes to build his Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Inſtruments by which</hi> hee uſes to build it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Time when hee doth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Fourthly, and chiefly, the <hi>Manner how hee doth it.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> For the firſt. <note place="margin">From the unfit materials out of which it is builded.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Materialls, out of which this ſtately peece
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:112952:12"/>
is to bee erected; you know that in all other buildings, if the work bee to bee a glorious work, the materials are the excellenteſt that can be found; and <hi>Mercury</hi> muſt not be made of common wood: When <hi>Solomon</hi> meanes to build a Temple, it muſt be with Cedar Trees over-layed with Gold: If <hi>Noah</hi> be to build an Arke, it ſhall be of Gophir wood, firme and ſtrong ſubſtantiall Timber: No man would imagine that a ſtately fabrick ſhould be erected out of rotten Willowes, and broken ſtickes, and refuſe chips &amp;c. But now the materials out of which God builds the Church, are the very refuſe, out of as arrant refuſe ſtuff as is in all the world, is this goodly building erected: Satans kingdome, the damned in Hell, that curſed ſtate of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is not built out of worſer ſtuffe then the Kingdome of Chriſt is, take the materials as they are when he firſt findes them. When God tooke the Nation of the Jewes to be his people, ſome people ſay, they were the ill-favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redſt people in all the world, a loathſome people to looke upon; but it is certaine, they were as croſſe and perverſe in <note place="margin">Deut. 9 23, 23. 3. 26.</note> their ſpirits as any living; the Lord told them often, that they were the unworthieſt of all Nations when he choſe them, bids them never thinke that they were choſe out to be his before the reſt of the world, for any thing that was in them, for he proteſted there was nothing to allure him: And for the Church which Chriſt now ownes and builds, the ſame things are manifeſt. In the 11 of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> you have <note place="margin">Eſa. 11.</note> a Propheſie of Chriſts Church, what they are by nature, till his grace change them; Lions, and Tigers, and Bears, and Wolves, and Cockatrices, and Aſpes, and ſuch kinde of Vermine, are the creatures out of which Chriſt Jeſus chooſes and makes up his Flock of Sheep: Read <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and you will finde that all the Saints (the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of the earth, whom Chriſt thought not himſelfe and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:112952:13"/>
all his glory too good for) were <hi>Mancipia Satanae,</hi> Bond-flaves, and Hell-hounds, going on in their wicked wayes: A deſcription you have in the 16 of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> that fits every one of them, where the Lord tells the Church, what kinde <note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 1, &amp;c.</note> of people they were when he fell in love with them; their Navell not cut, caſt out in the day of their birth, lying in their mothers bloud, no eye to pitty her, nor no hand to doe her any friendly office; and when he paſt by her in that pickle, then did he fall in love with her, and ſpread the skirt of his garment over her: And if you take another place of Scripture, to ſee what kinde of Spouſe he <note place="margin">Ezek. 23.</note> had; <hi>Aholah</hi> and <hi>Aholibah,</hi> two Whores, were the Spouſes that he did chuſe; plainly ſhewing to us, that this glorious work, that which all eternity ſhall give honour to him for, that the materials out of which it is built, are as bad as any are who goe to Hell and deſtruction. And this is one great part of a demonſtration, to let you ſee, that when God doth ſuch a work as this is, he doth appeare in his glory: It muſt needs be an excellent Work-man, who can raiſe ſo glorious a peece out of ſuch baſe ſtuffe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and by what <hi>Instruments</hi> doe you thinke the <note place="margin">2. From the weake inſtruments and tooles by which it is builded.</note> Lord doth build it? and what are their Tooles? who are his Work-men? you'll wonder by that time I have told you a little about them. God hath ſometimes ſtrong Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his enemies to overthrow, from which he meanes to reſcue his people, and then the Armies which he brings <note place="margin">Exod. 7, 8, 9, 10 chap.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112952:13"/>
finde out the learned and excellent parted men, but a few Fiſher-men (poore deſpicable men, brought up in no Arts or Learning) ſhall be the Champions, who ſhall goe and ſubdue the great, and the wiſe men of the world, unto the Throne of Chriſt: and ordinarily, the men whom he doth chuſe to work the greateſt matters by, are men of a meane preſence, of weake parts, and contemptible gifts, (though God will have ſome that are eminent, to let you ſee, that his grace can make uſe of any, but yet) the greateſt ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that have beene done in the Church of Chriſt, have been moſt-what done by inſtruments from whom mans wiſdome would promiſe very little: ſo that in them is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fulfilled that of the Prophet, <hi>A woman doth compaſſe a</hi>

wherewith theſe unlikely Work-men are furniſhed; far more ludibrious things in reference to this work, then a Shepheards boy with his ſling and his bag were to the Philiſtian Giant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, take likewiſe the <hi>Time,</hi> for that is as remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">3.</note> as any of the reſt: The time when the Lord uſeth to <note place="margin">At a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely time.</note> build his Church, heare in this 102 Pſalme, it was when the Church profeſſed <hi>her bones were burnt up like a hearth, her belly cleaved to the duſt, ſhe was like an Owle,</hi> like a <hi>Peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> like a <hi>Swallow, fed on aſhes;</hi> and my Text in the next words ſaith, God would regard the prayer of this <hi>poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute</hi> Church: The Hebrew word here tranſlated <hi>deſtitute,</hi> ſignifies either the <hi>ſhrub of a broken Tree,</hi> or the <hi>Heath</hi> that growes in the barren Wilderneſſe; ſuch were Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at this time: Now here is the time which God chuſes, when the enemies of the Church have them in the greateſt bondage, when his Church and people are in moſt utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of doing any thing towards their deliverance, or expecting any thing to be done for them; that time he ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily chuſes for the reſcuing of his people. When hee fetched them firſt out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they were worne out there with making brickes, and the tale of their brickes was do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bled, then did God ſend a Shepheard to fetch them out: When in the 70 yeares captivity they complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Pſal. 141. 7. Ezek. 37.</note> that their bones lay ſcattered, as one ſhould hew chips on the face of the earth; and in another place compared to dry bones; that was the time he choſe to raiſe them up a glorious Army, and to bring them out for himſelfe: And ſo it is obſerved by Hiſtorians, that when the Lord came to deliver his Church from the terrible perſecutions under <hi>Nero</hi> and the reſt of the perſecuting Romane Emperours; and now lately from Antichriſt, when Cardinall <hi>Cajetan</hi> ſaid, that the Germans were ſo devoted to the Pope, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112952:14"/>
they were ready to eat graſſe and hay, <hi>more pecudum,</hi> like brute beaſts, at the Popes command, for the redemption of their ſoules; and all the reſt of the Chriſtian world ſtood in the ſame condition, the Kings having given their Crownes to the Whore, and laid their heads in her lap, <note place="margin">Rev. chap. 17, 18, &amp; 19.</note> and their glory at her feet, and all the people Vaſſals and Slaves wondering after that inchanted Beaſt; then by a few Monks and Shavelings did the Lord break the power of this great enemy in pieces, and began the rearing up of that great work, which he is carrying on at this day: And ſuch like times doth he chuſe in planting grace, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his kingdome in the converſion of particular men, plucking them out of Satans clawes, when they are moſt deſperately wicked: when <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> wallowes in bloud of <note place="margin">2 King. 21. Luk. 82. Matth. 9. 9. Ezek. 16. 23. Acts 9. Epheſ. 2. 3 Col. 1. 21.</note> Innocents; when <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> is proſtituting her ſelfe; when <hi>Paul</hi> is mad againſt the Church; when <hi>Matthew</hi> ſits at the receipt of Cuſtome, every one of them wallowing in their bloud, carried headlongly to deſtruction, fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh with greedineſſe, loving their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, not ſuſpecting or underſtanding their danger, not ſo much as deſiring a better condition: this is the time the Lord chuſes. Now to doe it by ſuch inſtruments, out of ſuch ſtuffe, at ſuch a time, this addes much to his glory. I remember it is ſpoke of one of <hi>Davids</hi> Worthies, in the 2 of <hi>Samuel</hi> 23. it was <hi>Benajah</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Jehojada,</hi> that among all his valiant acts this was one, that <hi>he ſlew a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 20.</note> but that which magnifies it is, <hi>the Time when he ſlew it,</hi> it was a Lion that was got into a pit, in the time of a great ſnow: a Lion in a pit is moſt deſperate, moſt rampant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no flying away, eſpecially in a ſnow, the cold of the weather making all the heat of the beaſt gather about his heart, and ſo encreaſes his courage and ſtrength; and in the time of a ſnow, when a man hath hardly any
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:112952:15"/>
footing to ſtand where he muſt fight; this magnified, the time when <hi>Benajah</hi> ſlew the Lion: So for the Lord to doe it by ſuch inſtruments, and out of ſuch ſtuffe, and at ſuch a time, if I had no other thing to ſay, I know you would by this acknowledge that the Lord appeares in his glory. But the fourth is the maine proofe of all, and that is</p>
            <p>The <hi>manner</hi> how the Lord doth it, which my Text moſt aimes at; it is in ſuch a manner as ſhews him abundantly to <note place="margin">4.</note> 
               <note place="margin">The manner is moſt glorious wherein he uſeth to magnifie.</note> be that which he is: thoſe excellent and eminent perfections of All-ſufficiency, which are in God, do marvellouſly irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and ſhine out, when God builds the Church. Among many others, which may be obſerved, permit me to ſpeak a little of theſe 5 excellent Attributes, which do in their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency ſhine out, when he undertakes the building of the Church: Firſt, his <hi>unſearchable wiſdome.</hi> Secondly, his <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power.</hi> Thirdly, his <hi>excellent holineſſe.</hi> Fourthly, his his <hi>infinite grace and bounty.</hi> And fifthly, his <hi>admirable juſtice.</hi> Theſe five Attributes doth the Lord ordinarily magnifie in the higheſt degree, when he is pleaſed to ariſe to build up <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay, his <hi>unſearchable Wiſdome:</hi> The Prophet ſpeaks aright of all Gods works, <hi>O Lord how manifola are</hi>

motions of all creatures doe all concurre to further this work, though they work according to their ſeverall principles, and for their owne ſeverall ends, moſt of them intending miſchiefe and ruine to the Church, yet he orders them all to be as directly ſubſervient, to carry on the work of building the Church, as if they all ſtudied it, and intended it with their whole might: The plots of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <note place="margin">Acts 15. 39. Pſal. 1. 12.</note> their ſtrength, their cunning, their cruelty, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the weakneſſes, faults, corruptions, and even diviſions of his ſervants, all contribute toward the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up of the Church, though they ſeem all contrary to it: God ſeemes to me to lay a taxe not onely upon Heaven, but upon Hell it ſelfe, and all the powers of darkneſſe, and all their ſervants, that every one of them ſhould bring in their utmoſt power to carry on this work. You have an excellent inſtance in the 60 chapter of <hi>Eſay,</hi> where God <note place="margin">Eſa. 60. <hi>per to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
               </note> orders it, that the Iſlands and Kingdomes, the Princes and Nobles, the Beaſts and Birds, the Foreſts and Rivers, the Gold, Silver, Braſſe, and Iron, all kind of creatures and things, ſhall contribute their uttermoſt to raiſe up and beautifie this building; yea, though they intend it not, <note place="margin">Micah 4. 11, 12, 13.</note> though they intend the contrary, to ruine and ſpoile it, as is clearly expreſſed. Many Nations gathered together againſt <hi>Zion,</hi> that ſay, let her be defiled, and let our eye looke upon <hi>Zion,</hi> when in the meane time the wiſdome of God hath contrived it, that they come but to be threſhed out, and to be made a crop for <hi>Zion</hi> to feed upon. Never doth the Lord ſo magnifie his wiſdome, as in his excellent contrivances about the Churches welfare, ſuiting all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences and occurrences of things, and endevours of all people, though they have a thouſand ſeverall ends, yet every one to contribute their beſt, as if one ſoule dwelt in them all: which made <hi>Paul,</hi> when he conſidered of this

            <p>His <hi>Holineſse:</hi> Never doth the Lord appeare ſo holy <note place="margin">3.</note> a God, as he doth in this work of building the Church. <note place="margin">His Holineſſe.</note> Holineſſe is not onely a glorious Attribute, but in truth it is glory it ſelfe, it is the very face of God; and therefore holy men are ſaid to beare the image of God, becauſe they are like his very face, when, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> may be ſung unto him, <hi>the whole earth is full</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 6. 3.</note> 
               <hi>of his glory,</hi> with that work which cauſeth his holineſſe to appeare, then like the Sun he ſhewes his glorious face, when he appears in his holineſſe. Now this excellent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute is celebrated to the height in the Churches buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: <note place="margin">Rev. 4.</note> This is cleare in that ſolemne and glorious repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt, ruling in, and beautifying of his Church <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. the foure Beaſts repreſenting the Catholike Church in the foure quarters of the world, when night and day they give glory to Chriſt, the head and King, the Builder and Ruler of his Church; their Song is onely this, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty:</hi> and that triumphant Song of the Church, recorded <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. for the victory <note place="margin">Rev. 15. Pſal. 89, 18. &amp; 99. 5. Eſa. 17. 7. 1 Sam. 2. 2.</note> obtained over the Beaſt, wherein they celebrate his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, truth, and juſtice, the Church ſets this as the riſe of all, <hi>For thou onely art holy:</hi> and in truth, the uſuall name he takes to himſelfe, and by which his people call him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this work, is, <hi>The Holy One of Iſrael;</hi> and it is fit it ſhould be ſo, for then he ſhewes how little he can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure iniquity, then he purges away the ſin of his people,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:112952:17"/>
then he makes them a peculiar people, zealous of good workes, then he ſeparates their droſſe and their rubbiſh from them, then he makes them like unto himſelfe: never doth God beautifie his holineſſe ſo, as he doth when he builds the Church. That is the third.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and that which is one of the ſweeteſt, the Lord never magnifies nor glorifies his free grace and his love ſo <note place="margin">4.</note> 
               <note place="margin">His free grace and love.</note> as he doth in this work of building the Church; all the treaſures of love and favour, which before lay hid in his breaſt, do gloriouſly ſhine out; then he marries her, or keeps his Wedding-feaſt, and makes all the world to know how deare ſhe is unto him; there and then, and no where elſe, doth he beſtow his choice favours. When he gives Kingdomes and Empires, he gives nothing but a peece of clay, what he cares not for; but when he builds the Church, there he layes out his Treaſure. The time would faile me to number the gifts which he then gives: Great Princes ordinarily have their Almoners with them whereſoever they goe, and they give this or that peece of ſilver or gold to ordinary Petitioners; but when they will appeare in their glory, and give ſuch gifts as ſhall magnifie them, then it may be they create Earles, and Lords, and great Officers of State, which are peculiar and diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pledges of their love: So doth God, when he builds up other Nations with outward mercies, with fruitfull ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, health, wealth, and pompe, &amp;c. he eſteemes them as nothing, he cares not a ſhoo-latchet for theſe common gifts, they are his common almes; but when he builds his Church, then he gives his Ordinances, then he gives his Miniſters, then he gives them the Graces of his Spirit, theſe are his Chryſolites, his Emeralds, his Pearles, and Diamonds, then he makes all the world ſtand amazed, (as my Text ſaith) and all the Kings to wonder, at the love
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112952:18"/>
and beauty which he ſhewes to his people in the day he builds up <hi>Zion:</hi> then they who deſpiſed her ſhall wonder at her, <hi>Who is this that comes out of the wilderneſſe leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

It is true, the gates of Hell doe alwayes appeare with all their wiſdome and ſtrength againſt it, but what of that? it is his glory to build it, and can we imagine that any ſhall be able to ſpoil him of his glory, that any can pull downe what he will build, or root up his pleaſant plant; when he hath called it his houſe of glory, which he will glorifie, that poore <note place="margin">Eſa. 60. 7.</note> wormes ſhall be able to defile or deface it?

O read over the admirable dealings of God towards us, in theſe foure or five laſt yeares, I am aſſured it will be the wonderment of ſucceeding generations, God will have it written by one hand or other, and when theſe things ſhall be told they will be wondred at indeed: when it ſhall be written what a low ebbe we were at, how we were <hi>tantum non</hi> ſwallowed with Popery, Prelacy, Superſtition, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, Tyranny, Oppreſſion all things concurring to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe us, and then the Lord broke thoſe Iron yokes, and hath called this Parliament, which after he hath ſitted, and tried, and humbled, he hath put upon the repairing of his Church, and building the walls of his City, in a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome time, when they build with the Trowell in one hand, and the Sword in another, when huge potent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are riſen up to deſtroy them, and yet he carries on this work, exerciſing and manifeſting ſuch rare wiſdome in the midſt of our folly, ſuch admirable power in the midſt of our weakneſſe, ſuch holineſſe in the midſt of our corruptions, ſuch love in the midſt of our unworthineſſe, ſuch juſtice to our enemies in the midſt of their pride, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it on after ſuch a manner, that they who read theſe things muſt ſtand amazed, and cry out, O how wonderfull are thy doings O Lord toward thy poore unworthy flock

To this end there are two things I ſhall humbly offer unto you: Firſt, to tell you what you may doe, and what God expects you ſhould doe: Secondly, to give you ſome quickening Motives to warme and enflame your hearts, with a purpoſe and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to doe what God would have you doe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you may poſſibly demand, what may or can we <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> doe, or what can any creature doe, ſeeing you were taught that the building of <hi>Zion</hi> is Gods work alone?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, it is very true, the work is Gods, and Gods <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> alone, and you may truely ſay of <hi>Zion,</hi> when ever it is <note place="margin">What Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and great men may do.</note> built, it is not by might, nor by an Army, but by Chriſt and his Spirit; yet were not great men, Princes, and Nobles, to be very great inſtruments in this work, God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have promiſed it, as one of the great priviledges of the Church, that <hi>Kings and Princes ſhould be her nurſing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and that <hi>ſhe ſhould ſuck the breaſts of Kings:</hi> And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Eſa. 49. 23. &amp; 60. 16. 1 Tim. 2. 26.</note> it is much you may doe by your examples, and by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your great families to ſerve the Lord; <hi>I and my Family</hi> (ſaid <hi>Joſhua) will ſerve the Lord:</hi> and all the great men we <note place="margin">Joſh. 24. 15.

Jewes, <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> or any of their Kings, conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Nations round about them, they never compelled any of them to forſake their falſe Gods, and to turne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, becauſe thoſe people never had choſen God to be their God; but a people who once had in Covenant made themſelves the Lords, and ſo the Lord by virtue of the Covenant could lay claim to them and their poſterity, his Princes and ſervants have ever (according to his will) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled theſe to ſtand to their Covenant, or elſe they ſhould not enjoy their protection; and therefore <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and thoſe good Kings put them all to death who followed <hi>Baal,</hi> and returned not unto the Lord their God.

In this world God will build their houſes.</note> bloud, and birth, and eſtate, make the preſervation and eſtabliſhing of their Familie, ordinarily next to the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſoules: Now (my Lords) you may take this for a certaine Rule, Build you Gods houſe, God will build yours; <hi>Jehu,</hi> though not ſound at heart, entailed the Crowne of Iſrael to the fourth generation upon his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <note place="margin">2 King. 10. 30.</note> for ſticking to God in the cauſe of <hi>Baal,</hi> in rooting <hi>Baal</hi> out of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and God promiſed concerning <hi>Solomon,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 11, 13</note> 
               <hi>he ſhall build my houſe, and I will eſtabliſh his Throne;</hi> mark it, thoſe two go together, <hi>he ſhall build my houſe, and I will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his Throne;</hi> and God ſaid to <hi>David</hi> in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe he had but a purpoſe to build a houſe for the Lord, <hi>becauſe it was in thy heart to doe it, I will build thy houſe for ever;</hi> and even the very Midwives in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who loved <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 20.</note> Gods people, God <hi>built them houſes.</hi> So that if ever you would eternize your names, and bring Gods bleſſing upon your families, know certainly this is the onely way, other projects will not doe it, he can cut off families and houſes in their greateſt glory: <hi>Shebna</hi> thought by pride, and pomp, and ſtate, to carry it out, but <hi>ſhalt thou reigne</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>becauſe thou haſt built thee a brave houſe?</hi> Ile kick thee like a ball in ſtrange countries: It is no thinking to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

greatneſſe in deſpight of God, who at his pleaſure puls down and raiſeth up. But in this work you have him ingaged, build <hi>you Gods</hi> houſe, and <hi>hee</hi> will build <hi>yours,</hi> give his bleſſing to your poſterity, or in caſe they faile, give you a name that is better then of Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <note place="margin">And in another world, a better houſe prepared</note> But I'l tell you that which is better for you, better to your ſoules, when you have ſerved him herein this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work, when the day of account and reward comes, they who faithfully work moſt in this building, ſhall have the beſt wages, they ſhall ſit upon thrones there, and ſhine even as the Sun in the firmament, for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The benefit of this work for the publique <note place="margin">2. This would ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the State.</note> State.</p>
            <p>The publique State (my Lords) is that, that you have ſweat and toyl'd for hitherto, and you would rejoyce to ſee it well ſetled, to ſee poore <hi>England,</hi> buoide out of theſe quick-ſands, into which it is falne: What a bleſſed man would he be, that could but put us into the way, how to pacify Gods wrath kindled againſt the Nation, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it for the time to come; Now (my Lords) this will doe both, this will pacify the wrath of God. No ſuch way under Heaven, to remove it, as to goe on faithfully in Reforming the Houſe of God, in ſetling Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word: That Heathen King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> ſent a letter by <hi>Ezra,</hi> to all the Governours, and bids them, that they ſhould let <hi>Ezra</hi> have all that he would <note place="margin">Pacifie Gods wrath at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</note> deſire for the Houſe of God, ſo much Gold and Silver, and Wheat, and Oyle, and Salt, as much as he would, and bids him goe on, and ſet all in order; and what was the great Motive? For (ſaith he) <hi>Why ſhould there be wrath upon the Realme of the King, and his Sons?</hi> marke it, if all <note place="margin">Ezra 7. 23.</note> was not done that was requiſite for the Houſe of God, there would be wrath; and let it be done, and there would
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:112952:28"/>
be no wrath; ſo I ſay to you, that God who hath caſt us into theſe combuſtions, can eaſily quiet them: how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten when we have been ready to ſtrike ſaile in the harbour, hath ſome <hi>Euroclydon</hi> caſt us out into the ſea againe? and on the other ſide, when ready to ſinke, how unexpectedly hath he raiſed our hopes? Our work lies with him, and with him only, pacify God and all is done; this black ſtorm will bee blown over, if hee but ſpeak all will bee quiet: you may ſee this clearly in the prophecy of <hi>Haggai,</hi> God was very much diſpleaſed with them, and blaſted and <note place="margin">Haggai, per totum.</note> curſed every thing they took in hand, but as ſoon as they cordially ſet upon this work, his ſpirit was pacifyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. And then for time to come, (with which I end) The doing of this work wil be the readieſt way to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>England</hi> againſt the like danger; I am perſwaded, you all think that the ſeeds of deadly and continuall feuds are now rooted between Family and Family, Neighbour and Neighbour, ſuch are the plunders and havocks made out of cruell ſpight, and God knowes whether the childe but new born will ever live to ſee an end of them; theſe I think are your feares, but carry you on this work, and this will ſecure the peace of the State for the time to come, I ſay againe, the doing of this ſhall ſecure all, ſo that no Enemy ſhall bee able to hurt you. It's ſaid of the <hi>Trojans Palladium,</hi> and the <hi>Romans Ancile,</hi> that they were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of thoſe Cities, that while they were ſafe, no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy could hurt them; when they were ſtolne and gone, the City was loſt; Certainely the eſtabliſhing of this, will bee the <hi>Palladium</hi> and <hi>Ancile</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> you have a promiſe in the fourth of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the latter end of it, The <note place="margin">Eſa. 4. 5.</note> Lord would create upon every dwelling of Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> a pillar of a cloud, and a pillar of fire, for <hi>Upon all the glory there ſhall bee a defence,</hi> mark, a defence upon all the glory; Keligion is the glory, the ordering of Gods Houſe, is his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112952:29"/>
glory, and that is a defence even a wall of fire; And you have had good experience of the fruit of Religion, in this huge conflict wee have had theſe three or foure yeeres together for our Religion, and Liberty; mark, who are they that have left you, and who adheard unto you, whether the Counties that have forſaken you, have not generally been the dark places, the Cities, and corners of the Land, where nothing but ſuperſtition, Prelacy, Ignorance, and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe have dwelt, and whether the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Counties which have had the Goſpel, where Chriſt hath been ſoundly preached, have not been the men, who to the exhauſting of all, have adheared to you in your righteous defence; and it's hard to name one Town that hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, where the people are ſubdued to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and you find the generality of godly men tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-out the Kingdom reſolved to ſink or ſwim with you, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath put it into your hearts, to reform and build up <hi>Zion.</hi> I will conclude with that promiſe, in the 58 of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the latter end, where the Lord exhorts his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to build the old waſte places, and repaire the Cities for the generations, &amp;c. The great incouragement which the Lord there gives them is, <hi>The glory of the Lord ſhall bee their</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 58. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Rereward;</hi> not their reward onely, but their rereward, their reſerve; that that ſhall back them; the glory of the Lord is Religion, the Ark and Ordinances: Set up Religion, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <note place="margin">Eſa 60 13.</note> the place of his Sanctuary, make the place of his feet glorious, that will keep God among you, and keep the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple faithfull to God and your ſelves, and eſtabliſh you ſo, that the Enemy ſhall not bee able to riſe up, or if he do, and come one way, he ſhall fly ſeven waies; And this is the firſt Circumſtance from which the Prophet ſo magnifies this work of building up <hi>Zion,</hi> becauſe when the Lord doth build up <hi>Zion,</hi> hee appears in his glory: Conſider what I have ſaid, and the Lord give you underſtanding in althings.</p>
