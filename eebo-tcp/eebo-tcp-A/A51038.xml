            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A MITE from a MOURNER: Upon the Loſs of that Faithful and Able Miniſter of the Goſpel, M<hi rend="sup">R</hi>. RICHARD KENTISH,
Who departed this Life <date>
                  <hi>Jan.</hi> 31. 1676</date>.</head>
            <l>VVHat muſt we put our Second Mourning on,</l>
            <l>Before our Mourning for dear <hi>Fowler</hi>'s gone?</l>
            <l>Muſt we for <hi>Kentiſh</hi> go to and lament,</l>
            <l>Before for <hi>Fowler</hi> we were well content?</l>
            <l>Ah, ſtay thy hand (dear Lord) ſay 'tis enough,</l>
            <l>Elſe make this way plain that to us ſeems rough.</l>
            <l>Ah when he followed <hi>Fowler</hi> to his Urn,</l>
            <l>We little thought ſo ſoon would be his turn.</l>
            <l>But, <hi>England, England,</hi> we fear that thy field</l>
            <l>Hath little harveſt more to Chriſt to yield;</l>
            <l>Cauſe Labourers are call'd to take their wages,</l>
            <l>Thou little think'ſt what Leanneſs this preſages.</l>
            <l>Ten hath been call'd within this twelve moneths day,</l>
            <l>Now <hi>Kentiſh</hi> too is call'd to take his pay:</l>
            <l>All which were faithful to their Maſter Chriſt,</l>
            <l>And laboured hard till call'd up to the High'ſt:</l>
            <l>Whileſt we poor Sheaves alas are yet unhous'd,</l>
            <l>And know not with what Prong we muſt be rous'd.</l>
            <l>Our hope is onely this, that God who carves</l>
            <l>Never dealt yet with us as ſin deſerves:</l>
            <l>For we alas have but play'd with our light;</l>
            <l>Our deeds ſure God ſees ſuits beſt with the night:</l>
            <l>Therefore our Candleſticks are thus remov'd,</l>
            <l>In token that our works are diſapprov'd.</l>
            <l>Theſe us'd to invite ſinners to Chriſts wedding,</l>
            <l>And was till late in our high way a Bidding.</l>
            <l>Come let us look, have we got wedding garments?</l>
            <l>For Bidders now are preaching Farewel Sermons:</l>
            <l>And we have warning now to ſtand and fear,</l>
            <l>This is the laſt time that this man muſt hear.</l>
            <l>How like a Puritan did <hi>Kentiſh</hi> walk,</l>
            <l>In Habit, Hair, yea like to them in talk?</l>
            <l>He was a patern unto this proud Age,</l>
            <l>Whoſe pride and covetouſneſs good works aſſwage.</l>
            <l>His life ſhew'd forth that to him Chriſt was given,</l>
            <l>His holy Soul now ſuits a holy Heaven:</l>
            <l>For its not all that cries to Chriſt, Lord, Lord,</l>
            <l>Muſt enter Heaven: look elſe in his Word,</l>
            <l>Though this Age fancies all that dyes are bleſt,</l>
            <l>And every Glutton no doubt goes to reſt;</l>
            <l>Their friends conceit, and to each other tell</l>
            <l>That heartening word, No doubt but he is well.</l>
            <l>This <hi>Dives</hi> fear'd his Brethren thought of him,</l>
            <l>And would not mend, but to thoſe torments ſwim:</l>
            <l>For <hi>Lazarus</hi> muſt be ſent from the dead</l>
            <l>To tell them news how he was tormented.</l>
            <l>Ah, its from ſin not in ſin men are ſaved;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Kentiſh</hi> had this pledge before he was grav'd.</l>
            <l>Through dangers and afflictions this man went</l>
            <l>Of Liberty and Goods, yet was content.</l>
            <l>He counted charge before that he did build;</l>
            <l>'Twas Faith in God that was his only Shield.</l>
            <l>He did bear witneſs in his Generation</l>
            <l>Againſt the growing Evils of this Nation.</l>
            <l>He proved Chriſt long, yet to his dying day</l>
            <l>He held him forth the new and living way.</l>
            <l>For Humane Learning too he had that art,</l>
            <l>Yea he was learn'd to chuſe the better part.</l>
            <l>That he was more then Man was all of grace,</l>
            <l>Therefore in God we all the glory place.</l>
