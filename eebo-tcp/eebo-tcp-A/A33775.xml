            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherefore and in eſpecial it is neceſſary for thee to know, that GOD of his great Grace, hath made thee his Image, having regard to thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, underſtanding and will, and that GOD is thy Maker, and thou his wretched

And alſo think thou of a ſurety, that if thy ſenſual appetite be not ordered by reaſon and grace, thou art worſe ordered than a beaſt; for thou then liveſt out of order, and ſo doth not a Beaſt; which is a great ſhame and rebuke to thee, being a reaſonable creature, and without the great mercy of GOD, it ſhall be thine eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: wherefore I ſay conſider what

thy ſin is, in the ignorance of God, of thy ſelf, and of thine own evil, and of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and ſearch thine impenitency in this, that thou makeſt too light account of GOD's juſtice, and therefore thy heart waxeth hard; it is far without feeling of faith, either toward God, or love towards thy Neighbour, ſo that thou likeſt and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt ſin, and haſt no grief nor hatred for it: examine further, whether thou haſt not neglected GOD's Word, either not in dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hearing of it preached or read, or when thou haſt heard it, in not regarding it: nay, whether thou haſt not had more delight to read unprofitable bleſſings, savouring alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the fleſh, ſuch as thou ſhouldeſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e afraid once to think of, as it would have beſeemed thy holy profeſſion, and whether thou haſt not rebelled againſt it, whilſt thou haſt withſtood the working of it, that thou ſhouldeſt mortifie the old man, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it and gaining upon it daily, till it be framed to Gods moſt holy will: and if thou ſhalt find theſe things in thee, then judge thy ſelf of ſin, that thou be not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord, for it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over judge thy ſelf for putting no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Gods will and thy corrupt will, through which thou haſt neglected
<pb facs="tcp:108085:7"/>
Gods will, and love thine own to fly from his and follow thine own; which then hath plainly ſhewed it ſelf, when his was plainly taught to be contrary to thine, and yet thou didſt yield to it, in breathing forth unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ungodly pangs, rageings, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings againſt it; and therefore judge thy ſelf of this intolerable pride of mind, and ſtubbornneſs of heart, and of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled affections, rebelling and murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt God, and miſ-judging of him that reproveth thee: Further ſee whether thou haſt judged thy ſelf for neglect of Prayer, when thou haſt omitted many days, never regarding it, but as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon haſt not once thought of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:108085:7"/>
becauſe the abuſing of Gods Creatures is a great ſin, examine thy ſelf, whether thou doſt miſuſe them in forgetfulneſs of God, in pride of life to pleaſe thy ſelf in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature more than in the Creator, ſeeing with the abuſe of them to ſet forth thy ſelf in pride, to pleaſe thy ſelf and the fleſhly eyes of others, rather, than in humbleneſs, to uſe them to the pleaſing and praiſing Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God the Creator: In the uſe of all which things, the love of God, which appeareth unto thee to a continual medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make thee to ſpie out ſin in thy ſelf, and to judge that to be ſin, which is ſin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and in no wiſe to mince or diminiſh it, or to cover it with the figg-leaves of thine own vain excuſes, but to lay it open before the Lord, nakedly and plainly as it is; ſo that thou call not ſin righteouſneſs, nor righteouſneſs ſin; good evil, nor evil good: but condemn that which thou knoweſt to be ſin, to abhor it, to flee from it, without all hypocrisie and cloaking of it with ſelf-love, or nouriſhing it, or elſe with lightneſs and contempt to dwell in it; and therefore thou muſt examin this ſin throughly, of not applying thy heart and mind to meditate and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, to believe and taſte of the work of thy ſalvation wrought in Chriſt crucified,
<pb facs="tcp:108085:8"/>

               <p>O My God and moſt loving Father, I do acknowledge that I have moſt highly offended thy ſacred Majeſty, by my groſs and moſt filthy life, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked thee to anger by my abominable wickedneſs: wherefore, O Lord, be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto me, and pardon me this great wickedneſs; look not upon me, good Father, with the eyes of Juſtice, neither do thou draw againſt me the ſword of Judgment; for then how ſhall I that am but duſt and aſhes ſtand in thy ſight, when thy wrathful indignation cometh forth as a whirlwind, and thy heavy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as a mighty tempeſt; ſeeing the earth trembleth, the depths are diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the very Heavens are ſhaken when thou art angry?

               <head>For the worthy receiving of this Sacrament, theſe four things are very conſiderable.</head>
               <list>

               <p n="1">1. Preparation conſiſteth in ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and in an act of the ſoul reflecting upon it ſelf in a general ſurvey of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtate in grace, comparing our preſent condition, which we find in our ſelves, with the word of God, by which will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear what good we ſhould have done, and the evil we ſhould not have done.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s admonition is, that before the receiving of this holy Sacrament, there ſhould be a ſtrict examination: <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat and drink of this Cup.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>For he that drinketh unworthily, drinketh his own damnation.</hi>

Therefore, O my ſoul, contemplate of the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our good God, which hath this day ſent ſalvation to thy ſoul, and calleth thee to this great feaſt, to be partaker of the precious body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt, being prepared by humble repentance to receive in faith and joy thy bleſſed Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, giving thanks always to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe mercy is everlaſting, whoſe truth endureth from generation to generation.</p>

The only eaſe and conſolation to our diſtreſſes, the bleſſedneſs of content and reſt to our weariſome Souls, is to be looked for in the World to come: What honour, glory, pleaſure of earthly delight ſoever, but is ſubject to inſtability, poſſible and uncertain? which made the wiſe-man upon his experience cry out, <hi>Vanity of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, all is Vanity.</hi> And the ſingular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to a man in any affliction for the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſorrow, need, ſickneſs, or any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity whatſoever, is, that by the ſweet united bleſſings, patience and content, at the laſt by paying an inexcuſable debt to Death, which, who ſo liveth, of what ſtate or condition ſoever, cannot but think he muſt die, will bring us to that eternal reſt, to the bleſſed enjoyment of everlaſting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, to dwell in glory for evermore: For bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108085:140"/>
from henceforth, yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13.</p>
            <p>Death is a ſleep, a departed breath from dead earth, inlivened at firſt by breath caſt upon it; to die is to be no more unhappy, it is true to thoſe over-ſwayed by nature, death is accounted a miſery, but to men refined by the light of Judgment, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the only remedy againſt miſery, as it is the wages of ſin, it is due to us; and as it is the end of all grief and ſickneſs, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto us. It delivers us from all cares and troubles, and bringeth us to all joys un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable; by it we ſhall receive fulneſs of grace, perfect and accompliſhed rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and perfect glory, which while we are on earth, we have but in part: here we ſee darkly, as in a glaſs, then ſhall we ſee face to face: the heavens you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſhall be ſuperinveſted with new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, made everlaſting habitations for the Saints prepared; by death we paſs to immortality, nor can we attain eternal life, but by leaving this life; yet corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death is no period of life, but a paſſage to eternity; though our body ſleep a while in duſt, it ſhall riſe again after thy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: As for me, ſaith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> I will bebold thy face in righteouſneſs,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:108085:140"/>
and ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake. Holy <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, Though all my fleſh be conſumed to bones, yet thy Spirit blowing upon dead bones, can revive them, and couple them again with ſinews, and cloath them with fleſh. The dead men ſhall live together, with my dead body ſhall they ariſe, awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt, for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 19. For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my skin worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God; if the earthly houſe of this tabernacle be diſſolved, we have a building of God, an Houſe not made with hands eternal in Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Chriſt is riſen from the dead, and made the firſt of them that ſlept, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Though in <hi>Adam</hi> we all die, yet in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. That body that was ſown a natural body, ſhall riſe a ſpiritual body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 Therefore let us be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and not fear the pains of death, the approach of which ſuddenly makes a man to know himſelf; he tells the proud and inſolent they are but duſt, and in an inſtant makes them to repent and hate their fore-paſt happineſs; he takes an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the rich, and proves him a begga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that fills his mouth; ſhews the beautiful their deſormity, and they hate it; he draws together the far ſtretch'd greatneſs, all the Pride, Cruelty, Vain-glory, and ambition of man, and covers it all over with duſt in the narrow limits of a grave; And though for ſome years the body lies mouldred in the grave, it ſhall at the laſt be raiſed in honour and glory; purified, perfected, and immortalized from a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of miſery, to a place of all felicity, to our own Country, into Paradiſe, where we ſhall meet with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> the Patriarchs and Prophets, Saints and Angels, our Friends and Kindred gone before us, which we ſhall ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in Mount Sion, the City of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living God, in the company of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Angels, praiſing and magnifying the Lord of Heaven, in white Robes, and Palms in their hands, following the Lamb whereſoever he goeth.</p>

            <p>And for as much as all mortal men are ſubject to many ſudden perils, diſeaſes and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:108085:141"/>
ſickneſſes, and ever uncertain what time we ſhall depart out of this life; there ſhould no day paſs without conſideration for our laſt end; which meditation is very requiſite, both for them that are in perfect health, &amp; thoſe that feel the hand of God by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: that death will come is certain, but when, how, or where, is very uncertain. It is appointed for all men once to die, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. but the day when, God hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, becauſe we ſhould be ready every day; it comes as ſoon to the young man, that glorieth in his ſtrength, as to ſome in a good old age; to the rich fool in a night, as to the poor in the anguiſh of his ſoul; to ſome violently, to others untimely by accident; to ſome by ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected death without warning; to all, ſome one way or other. And being Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hath pleaſed to lay this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon you and therein time to repent, aſſure your ſelf it is his viſitation ſent to you to try your faith &amp; patience, or elſe to correct and amend what is amiſs in you, or whatſoever hath offended your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father; for every child whom the Lord loveth he correcteth, to prepare for a better world; affliction seals us up to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption; by it he exerciſes his Children, and the graces he beſtows upon them: it is
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:108085:142"/>
ſpecial means to further our contrition and repentance: In affliction, ſaith the Lord, they will hear me. <hi>Davids</hi> troubles made him pray; <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s ſickneſs made him weep; and miſery drew the Prodigal child home: We have the Prophets exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and patterns of bearing afflictions pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently; which though the puniſhment and ſhame is of ſin, God turns to be the ſubject of his honour and glory, in ſaving a ſinner that calls upon him in faith and true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to Heaven. His chaſtiſements are ſigns of his Fatherly love; which though for the preſent, ſeem grievous unto us, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it bringeth quiet fruit of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to thoſe whom the Lord giveth grace to make a ſanctified uſe of it, for which he hath inflicted this ſickneſs on you.</p>
            <p>And know you certainly, though your ſins are many and grievous which you have committed, by the temptation of the Devil; yet upon your true repentance, God hath promiſed to forgive; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of which, are the eſcaping eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, God's everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the attaining eternal ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: where ſin abounds, there grace much more abounds. God calls all thoſe that are heavy laden, to refreſh and eaſe them of all their trouble, the Lord forſaketh
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:108085:142"/>
no man, till man forſaketh him: Look not ſo much upon the greatneſs of thy ſins, as to the riches of his mercy, and let thy ſoul be comforted in the All-ſufficient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Let the (wicked ſaith the Lord) forſake his way, &amp; the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto me, and I will have mercy upon him, and I will pardon him abundantly: Let not your conſcience be terrified at the remembrance of your tranſgreſſions, for there is no ſin bars a man from ſalvation, but incredulity and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency. Therefore lift up your hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, call unto him for mercy, repent earneſtly of your ſins, and have a lively conſidence in Chriſt's merits, and doubt not but upon your humble contrition and ſorrow for ſin, with ſighs and tears (the blood of a wounded ſoul) God will receive your ſoul into everlaſting happineſs, to live in eternal glory, which he of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy grant, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
