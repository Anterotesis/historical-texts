            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

of flattery, so far as they are capable to improve them: But I have the happiness of being fred from this trouble, you being such as neither need, nor desire to be caressed in that manner; And I may justly call this an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to me, since my naturall temper removes me to the greatest distance from the confines of that service vice. I can not indeed withold my self from acknowledging, that I owe you all the expressions of Gratitude which I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to pay; and when I tell the world, that as you have honours entailed upon you from a long Series of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Ancestors, so you are like to transmit them unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished to your Posterity, to whose honours it will be an addition, to have it remembered that they are yours; and that for your Noble Qualities and Vertues, you are justly esteemed and beloved of all who have the honour of your acquaintance, I am assured that I doe not transgress the Rules of the severest modestie, their is only one thing which I must utter to your commendation, because it ought not to be concealed, namely, your being faithfull to God and Conscience, in adhereing to the true Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in a time when many have made defection, and you have been assaulted with such tentations, as nothing but a brave Resolution, and a mighty grace could have enabled you to conquer: And tho you have been happily united, both in the conflict and Victory; yet let it not be offensive that I relate what part each of you have acted therein, and of this I shall say nothing but with the assurance of a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and with the Ingenuity becoming a man of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
            <p>Those who understood your Inclinations, knew, that you could have been well pleased, that the Romish Missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:94581:3"/>
would have saved themselves the trouble of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits they made you, And it was the opinion of some who were sollicitous for your safety, that you should have rid your selves of them, by denying them access; but as the sweetness of your tempers, doth (as it were by an inevitable force) carry you to deport your selves with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging civility to all persons, so for other weighty consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, you did not relish that advice.</p>
            <p>Upon you (MY LORD) they did begin to make some direct attempts, to seduce you from your Holy profession; but <hi>Your Lo:</hi> took a wise and compendious method to avoid their snares, by giving them to understand, that your mind was fully satisfied of the truth of your Religion, and that you had something else to doe, then entangle your self in perplexing debates with them knowing no good fruit that was to be reaped thereby: This resolute answer, made them perceive, it was in vain to insist any further that way; but they hoped, by fetching a compass a little about, to gain more ground.</p>
            <p>It hath been an old craft of seducers (considering what interest <hi>Ladies</hi> have in the affection of their Husbands, and what power with their Children) to make their utmost essayes to proselite them to their Errours, not doubting, but if they succeed, they shall quickly have the whole familie at their Devotion: And therefore <hi>You MADAM</hi> was the prize on which they set their eyes; But <hi>Your La:</hi> did for see the danger, and provided to encounter it. These Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of the <hi>Romish Religion</hi> who were to make their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to you, were given out to be men of vaste learning and admirable parts (for that is one of the arts of Papists, as they boast that their Church is infallible, so they would
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94581:4"/>
have the world believe, that their Clergie are an invincible sort of men, that they may fright those whom they besiege u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the first summonds to make a surrender) you therefore applied your self to a diligent use of all means, for your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment in the Truth, you Prayed, and Read, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and pondered deeply the matters of Religion, and thought, all you could doe in these wayes, no more then was needfull in so weightie an affair. Heaven hath endued you with a great stock of excellent gifts, a composed and comprehensive mind, a clearness and solidity of Iudgment, a deep reach, and readiness of expression, and these being joyned with singleness and sincerity of heart, are such ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts and defences against seduction that they make the Soul almost impregnable: And that good God, who is never wanting to the assistance of his faithfull Servants, did furnish you with such light, and Grace, that your Faith hath remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unshaken. Those who designed to seduce you, soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved, that they had not to doe with a person of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary capacity: Their usuall common places of arguments, they found you could easily answer; and your prejudices against their Religion though you proposed them only by way of Queries, and with the modestie of a Learner, were yet so framed, that it was evident to them, you had so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated into the controversies of Religion, that they thought it a sort of Victory to get of, without being at some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible disadvantages, and I hardly knew any of them who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once made an essay, were sond of a second encounter.</p>
            <p>The Remembrance of the particular passages of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, is still very gratefull to me, and the relating of them would sure be very pleasing to others, but your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie and humility is such, that I may not adventure to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94581:4"/>
publish them: Onely give me leave to say concerning you both, that if either crastie insiauations, or the charmes of friendship, or worldly considerations, or long importunities, or any thing that could be projected by the wit and subti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Seducers, could have corrupted or byassed your minds, none of these methods were left unessayed: And when all these efforts proved unsuccessfull, and all Topicks were exhausted; yet that they might be ever like themselves; they had the impudence to write, and spread reports to distant places in this Kingdom, that you were their Converts, or just at the turning point: Whether this was done out of spite, or to be an Argument, to prevail with others of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacious humour to imitate such noble Precedents I cannot determine; but this I know that Hell it self could invent nothing more false</p>
            <p>The Gracious God hath in part rewarded your integrity, and constancy, and I hope will doe it yet more: Your saith is strengthned, by these winds of temptation, you have the joyes of a good Conscience, you are hereby endeared to all serious and Godly persons, and providence hath of late interposed to bring some secular affairs of great concernment to your Noble Familie to a confortable and desired period, and that at a nick of time, when it could searce have been expected, and a few days longer delay might have quite ruined them. I hope you will in all this observe the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindness of the Lord, and ever remember your engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Iesus Christ who hath interceeded for you, that your saith might not fail.</p>
            <p>I have little to say concerning this <hi>Poem</hi> which I offer unto you, I confess it is a mean present, yet you know its offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from an affectionat mind: After I had write the first
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94581:5"/>
copie of it, I put it immediatly in your hands; and you were pleas'd to commend it, severall copies of it are since spread, of which some are very incorrect, to doe my self justice I have at length resolved to publish it: It cannot much serve the ends of my reputation, and so I may hope that it cannot be imputed to vanitie. My publishing it under your shaddow, can only signifie that which I am well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough pleased the World should know, namely, that you have a great goodness for me, when I can presume that you will favourably accept of such a trifile: Gratitude oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me to make you richer offerings, but I have them not to make; my Prayers to God for you, are the best com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations I can give for your favours to me, and these are, and daily shall be offered up unto Heaven, for the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of your Souls, the increass of your grace and the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing of your Noble Family by</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Can not perswade my self that any have just reason to be offended with me, or to clamour, that it is a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable to a man of my Profession to expose a Religion so Zealously mantained and propagated by so many great and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, in such a dress as this: All that I shall say for my own vindication is, that I am none of those that sport my self with the sins and miseries of Mankind, and I ever abborred these jests which idle and profane wits doe break upon serious matters, that are not to be jested with: Nevertheless, when a Partie of men have under the venerable name of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church</hi> so grossly abused the World, imposing on the belief of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Disciples, so many <hi>Reverend Absurdities,</hi> and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falshoods, and recommending to their practise, such super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious trifles, and ridiculous fopperies, unbeseeming the gravity of the Christian Religion, to give a just representation of them in this manner, is a thing that may have it's own usefulness, especially since it may be presumed, that many will read a <hi>Poem,</hi> who will not set their eyes on a more serious Book. I have only therefore a few things whereof to advertise thee concerning it.</p>
            <p>Namely. That I have in a few passages of it taken a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to my self, in a Poeticall manner to intermix some of my own fancies, yet not without designe. As, when I produce an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the <hi>Caelibate of the Clergie,</hi> which I know they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made use of, but let it be remembred that this is <hi>a Dream,</hi> and the it were not, yet since they make such other inferences
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94581:6"/>
from that Text as I have there mentioned, I suppose they might draw this Conclusion from it, as well as the rest, and for any thing I know, it is an Argument against the marriage of Church men of as great force, as any that they have heretofore hit upon.</p>
            <p>But in truth my aim is to show what ridiculous interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture these pretended infallible expounders of it, doe often make. He who will prove the Popes supremacie from <hi>Genes. 1. 1.</hi> Because it is there said <hi>In principio,</hi> and not in <hi>Principiis</hi> (as Pope Boniface doth) or his Precedencie to the Emperour from <hi>Genes. 1. 16</hi> Where it is said, <hi>that GOD made two great lights,</hi> (as Pope Innocent <hi>3)</hi> or his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and Ecclesiastick power, from <hi>Ecce duo</hi> gladii: or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the Celibate of the Clergie. From <hi>Rom. 8. 8.</hi> (as Pope Siricius) I think may prove <hi>Quidlibet ex Quolibet.</hi> I have mentioned a <hi>Relique</hi> which they pretend not to have; but in that I mean only to show in whole manner these litle wondrous things are usually alledged to be found.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Sirs</hi> which I say they call <hi>Veniall;</hi> are by their Casuists put in that rank: and that they account it much more Criminall, to neglect the observation of the Traditions of the Church, then to break the Commandements of GOD, is so well known, that it needs no prooff.</p>
            <p>I have spoken at length of their Religious Houses and Orders, they being the only things they boast of that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shew of Sanctitie, and to evidence that I meant nothing but fair dealing, I have not equally inveighed against all persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
            <p>The words of their Mystick Divinitie that I have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are to be found every one of them in their own books, with a great many more which I could not get brought into verse. Thebodde talkings which they have of the <hi>Superessentiall Life.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94581:6"/>
               <hi>The State of Totalitie,</hi> The Union of Nothing with Nothing, <hi>The Dei-forme Fund of the Soul</hi> &amp;c. I could no more make Rhyme, then they can make Reason of them.</p>
            <p>When I reflect on the rude disorders of some who betake themselves to the Religious Houses. I doe not slander them, the Epistle of Huldericus Bishop of Augusta, to Pope Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas, wherein he tells of six thousand heads of Infants found in one Mote, gives sufficient ground for the reproach.</p>
            <p>I wrote this <hi>Poem</hi> in the Year <hi>1679.</hi> When these Nations were allarmed with the noyse of the Popish plot. And I thought to have enlarged more on that Subject, but ere I finished it, that began to be a suspect business, and it was come to that which on ingeniously expresseth thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Shams with Shams, and Plots with Plots were cross't, And the true Plot, among the false was lost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any expect that I should make an Apologie for publishing it, the Common-Heads of excuse in these cases are well enough known, and I may pretend to have an equall right to them with other Men.</p>
            <p>If their be any thing in it, that may be offensive to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest modestie, I shall be readie (upon conviction) to acknowledge my faultiness therein; but for my litle extravagancies, that may be found here. I hope thy censure will be gentle, for it any sort of men have reason to expect some charitable allowance for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scapes, it can hardly be denyed to <hi>A Dreaming Poet.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>I Find I'm haunted with a busie mind,</l>
               <l>Swift as the Clouds, unstable as the wind,</l>
               <l>It sometimes gets it Wings, and soars aloft,</l>
               <l>Anon it steeps into delights more soft,</l>
               <l>It's sometimes serious, and it's sometimes vain,</l>
               <l>Sometimes it's thoughts do please, and sometimes pain;</l>
               <l>On while they'r dark, and then they clear again;</l>
               <l>Sometimes they'r cheerfull, sometimes they are sad;</l>
               <l>They'r sometimes good, and often they are bad;</l>
               <l>Sometimes, my self, my self's their only Theam,</l>
               <l>Sometimes, they grasp at more then <hi>Caesar's</hi> claim:</l>
               <l>They bring forth Ioy, they nowrish Fear,</l>
               <l>They Towers into the Air do rear,</l>
               <l>All things do seem within their Sphear:</l>
               <l>O what a wandring thing's the Mind!</l>
               <l>What Contrares are there combin'd?</l>
               <l>HOw shal't be held, or where confin'd?</l>

O what a Web's a busie Thought!</l>
               <l>Where is it made? whence is it brought?</l>
               <l>How is it warpt, how is it wrought?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While thus my Mind was in this roving plight,</l>
               <l>I did it chide, for it's uncertain flight,</l>
               <l>I strove to settle it with all my might:</l>
               <l>At length we did some composition make,</l>
               <l>And it began some rest to take,</l>
               <l>To be more plyant for good manners sake:</l>
               <l>I firmly with my self did then conclude,</l>
               <l>I would repair unto some solitude,</l>
               <l>Beneath a pleasant Tree my Lodge I made,</l>
               <l>Became the Tennant of it's cooling Shade,</l>
               <l>Here (said I) I my self will shroud,</l>
               <l>From scoarching Beams, from dropping Cloud,</l>
               <l>Here shall I rest; and shall be free</l>
               <l>From this Earth's noise, which seems to me</l>
               <l>A blunt, a dull, ill-acted Comedie:</l>
               <l>It's Pleasnres I'll not prise,</l>
               <l>It's Honours I'll despise,</l>
               <l>And all it's Wealth, as Dross I will disdain,</l>
               <l>My Mind Religious Thoughts shall intertain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>RELIGION (thought I) is the way to Rest,</l>
               <l>RELIGION is the choise that's surely best,</l>
               <l>It raiseth no Commotions to infest,</l>
               <l>It stills the noise of Passions and of Rage,</l>
               <l>And turbulent Affections doth asswage</l>
               <l>It cooleth Youth, it's Comforts warm Old-Age:</l>
               <l>But lo again my Thoughts did range,</l>
               <l>This lovely thing it's shape did seem to change,</l>
               <l>In many Formes it did to me appear,</l>
               <l>And many various Garbs I saw it wear,</l>
               <l>I saw it fight in Fields, and making Warres,</l>
               <l>I heard it scold in Schools, and raising Jarres:</l>
               <l>

A thousand different Parties cry'd, lo here</l>
               <l>Thou'l't find the thing, should be to thee most dear,</l>
               <l>Whom shall I hear? where shall I go?</l>
               <l>What shall I chuse? what shall I do?</l>
               <l>I'm puzled, and amazed too,</l>
               <l>I love RELIGION, and I would her serve,</l>
               <l>But while I seek Her, fear from Her to swerve.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While I am in this Labirinth involv'd,</l>
               <l>The more I por'd, the less my Doubts were solv'd,</l>
               <l>And to make yet more serious search resolv'd:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Sleep,</hi> (that great lovely thief, which often robs</l>
               <l>Mine Eyes of vexing Sights, mine Heart of Sobs,</l>
               <l>Which from my Books doth steall away mine Eie,</l>
               <l>And often from my Prayers stealeth me)</l>
               <l>Came gliding on, and did me quite o'r shade,</l>
               <l>With a thick Cloud of misty Vapours made:</l>
               <l>Mine Eyes were shut, mine Ears were stopt,</l>
               <l>My Hands were ty'd, my Senses lockt,</l>
               <l>The House was silent, Gates were blockt:</l>
               <l>And now WILD FANCIE did begin her Game,</l>
               <l>And playes her self, with things I cannot name,</l>
               <l>Things so many, and so strange,</l>
               <l>Things that Shape and Colour change,</l>
               <l>Things which without Order range;</l>
               <l>Yet still me thought RELIGION I did view</l>
               <l>And did Her with some amorous thoughts persue,</l>
               <l>'Mongst all that Croud, I knew Her lovely hue.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She did Her self shift from among the Crowd,</l>
               <l>I saw Her go, cry'd after Her aloud,</l>
               <l>I call'd to Her, For Love and Pitty stay,</l>
               <l>Besought Her that She would not say me Nay;</l>
               <l>But Wind, bore Her and my lost words away:</l>
               <l>And when She's gone, I found into Her room</l>
               <l>A throng of wild, unruly things did come,</l>

                  <hi>Roving Fancies, Horrid Sights,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Dismall Places, Uncouth Wights</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Which put me in a wondrous plight</l>
               <l>I'll tell what I can mind, and it's no Crime,</l>
               <l>Of incoherent things to speak, in incoherent Rhyme.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>I saw A</hi> CITY, very Great and Fair,</l>
               <l>With which, scarce any other might compare,</l>
               <l>Whose proud Walls, did all Batteries defy,</l>
               <l>Whose prouder Towers, seem'd to affront the Sky;</l>
               <l>To him I first did meet <hi>What</hi> CITY'S <hi>this,</hi> said I?</l>
               <l>A Question indeed said he! <hi>For this</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>No single</hi> CITY, <hi>but the whole World is.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>I saw A</hi> MAN, <hi>in more than Kingly State,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And thousands, did his dread Command await,</l>
               <l>Yet did his grifly Face, his panting Breath,</l>
               <l>His failing Limbs, bewray th'approach of Death:</l>
               <l>But soon I found, that he was vile and proud,</l>
               <l>He rais'd his Eyes, and spake odd Words aloud</l>
               <l>Of BULLS, and BRIEVES, and CANONS, and CROISADES</l>
               <l>And whispered some Tales of WHORES and BAUDES,</l>
               <l>And Stories, which imported nothing less</l>
               <l>Than that He was grow'n old in Wickedness:</l>
               <l>I ask't, <hi>What wretch</hi> was that who passed by?</l>
               <l>And presently they made a dreadfull Cry,</l>
               <l>And said, I did blaspheme,</l>
               <l>And spoke prophanly of an Heavenly Name,</l>
               <l>Since Divine Honours were his rightfull Claim.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>I saw some</hi> YOUTHS; for I could guess</l>
               <l>No other, by their beardless Face,</l>
               <l>I heard them talk what I thought hardly Sence,</l>
               <l>Yet talk; with an unblushing confidence:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>What Striplings</hi> (said I) do yonder walk?</l>
               <l>What new, unheard of Stories do they talk?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94581:9"/>
They call'd me mad, and said, they were</l>
               <l>All REVEREND FATHERS I saw there,</l>
               <l>And that the things they gravely told,</l>
               <l>Were Mysteries, delivered of old,</l>
               <l>Which the Apostles left them to unfold.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A PACK of IDEOTS next I saw,</l>
               <l>For so I thought them; but I stood in awe</l>
               <l>To call them so, till I did see</l>
               <l>Them at their <hi>Childish playes</hi> to be,</l>
               <l>Some were dandling painted babies,</l>
               <l>Some numbring BEEDS, and telling GADIES,</l>
               <l>Some mumbling GIBBERISH and such uncouth leid,</l>
               <l>As no where else did I e're hear or read,</l>
               <l>Alace what do these poor Fools? did I say,</l>
               <l>Vile man (said they) they worship and they pray,</l>
               <l>See what Devotion their looks do bewray.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To them some HELL-HOUNDS did succeed,</l>
               <l>Their eyes were sunk, their hands were red,</l>
               <l>Their words were dreadfull, threats were loud,</l>
               <l>Their looks were grim, they breathed blood,</l>
               <l>I saw them bring forth from dark Shopes,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Wheels and Racks, and Cords, and Ropes,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>They gathered fewell, kindled fire,</l>
               <l>And fastned stakes, I did enquire</l>
               <l>What all these dreadfull things did mean?</l>
               <l>More dreadfull then mine eyes had ever seen:</l>
               <l>They told me, these were persons, whose great zeall</l>
               <l>Did alwayes levell to the Churches weall,</l>
               <l>And that these <hi>Tools,</hi> whose sight did shake mine heart,</l>
               <l>Were instruments, by which they did convert</l>
               <l>Men to the Faith: So they and I did part.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Sure (said I) I'm in some enchanted land,</l>
               <l>Of all I see, I nothing understand,</l>

What shall I think! O that some Angell would</l>
               <l>These hidden wondrous things to me unfold,</l>
               <l>For it's a work above all humane reach</l>
               <l>Mine eyes to open, or my mind to teach.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>While thus I'm wondring, and am bath'd in tears,</l>
               <l>A Gentle voice arrived to mine Ears,</l>
               <l>From whence I know not; but the words were these,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Young man, thy wonder, and thy weeping cease,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>What thou shalt see, shall serve well to explain</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>What thou hast seen:</hi> A little while again</l>
               <l>It silent was; At length did only say,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Take Heed, Take Heed, see that thou watch and pray,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I heard no more, it vanished away.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I quite confounded lay, my mind was vex't</l>
               <l>With thoughts confus'd, and with dark fears perplext;</l>
               <l>When lo, I wildly roll mine eyes, and see</l>
               <l>That which a little calm'd and cheered me;</l>
               <l>A LADIE, walking with a comely grace,</l>
               <l>All beauties seem'd combined in her face,</l>
               <l>She courteously approached to the place,</l>
               <l>Where I did now my self repose,</l>
               <l>Which when I saw I humbly arose.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I am perswaded, that in man must be</l>
               <l>An untaught skill of PHYSIOGNOMIE;</l>
               <l>For when I at a distance did behold</l>
               <l>This sumptuous DAME, attyr'd in Pearles and Gold,</l>
               <l>I thought, such beauty was unseen before,</l>
               <l>And that mine eyes should see the like no more,</l>
               <l>I would have nam'd all things in Heaven and Earth,</l>
               <l>All that is pryz'd by Fancie, Wit, or Dearth,</l>
               <l>To see if any thing I could compare</l>

But as I did Her more distinctly view,</l>
               <l>I thought my self deceiv'd; sure (said I) now</l>

               <l>Yet wisely I concealed my distaste,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Her words did charme me so, that I began</l>
               <l>To chide my self, and say, Untoward man,</l>
               <l>This is an ANGELL; what ill GENIUS brought</l>
               <l>A disesteem of Her into thy thought?</l>
               <l>I work my woe, shee's fond to have me blest,</l>
               <l>I toile for Cares, she comes to give me rest,</l>
               <l>She loves me; I distaste her in my mind,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>How bold our passions are, and yet how blind!</hi>

               <l>These were the secreet workings of my breast,</l>
               <l>My longings now to hear Her, were increast,</l>
               <l>And she went on</l>
               <l>And thus she spoke in an alluring tone:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I am</hi> THE HOLY CATHOLICK-CHURCH (said she,)</l>
               <l>The porch of Heaven; none go there but from me:</l>
               <l>And now I come to be <hi>A Guide</hi> to thee:</l>

I saw thee lately cast thine Amorous eyes</l>
               <l>Upon RELIGION, and I heard thy Cryes,</l>
               <l>She seem'd to leave thee, and would make no stay,</l>
               <l>Went out of sight, thou knowest not what way,</l>
               <l>I know her path, to Her I will thee lead,</l>
               <l>I listened well to all that she had said,</l>
               <l>I Bow'd mine Head, and low obeysance made,</l>
               <l>Bless'd now (said I) the day that I was born,</l>
               <l>No longer will mine heart be rack't and torn,</l>
               <l>With doubts and Scruples, and with anxious cares,</l>
               <l>With sinking fears, and languishing despaires.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Mine Eyes again I lift unto her face,</l>
               <l>To fix them ever in that lovely place;</l>
               <l>I rub'd mine Eyes, I thought they were diseas'd,</l>
               <l>The more I look't, the more I was displeas'd:</l>
               <l>I thought Her sometimes too Gay, to be Good,</l>
               <l>Her Brow Imperious, and Her Looks too Proud,</l>
               <l>Her Colour oftner chang'd, then I can tell,</l>
               <l>Her Breath (I judg'd) had an invenom'd smell:</l>
               <l>These things did somewhat cool my confidence,</l>
               <l>And brought me in a very great suspence,</l>
               <l>It is not good to be too Rash (said I)</l>
               <l>It's Good before I trust too much, to try.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She was sagacious, and soon found me out,</l>
               <l>Uncertain Breath, and Looks bewray'd my doubt,</l>
               <l>What means this Coldness (said she) Youth? mine hand</l>
               <l>She grasp't, and ask't what mean't I thus to stand?</l>
               <l>Did I not to thee joyfull tydings bring?</l>
               <l>Is happiness to thee so small a thing?</l>
               <l>Just now thou seem'd inflamed with desire</l>
               <l>To learn the way to Bliss, who quench't that fire?</l>
               <l>Thy sails were hoysed, and thou seemed clear,</l>
               <l>Unto RELIGION as thy port to steer,</l>

               <l>To be thy Pilot, I did not disdain.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>I'm for the Voyage (said I) But it is fit</l>
               <l>To know my Pilots skill, for fear I split,</l>
               <l>For in RELIGION there are many Cheats,</l>
               <l>No fewer then their are in Courts and States,</l>
               <l>Each painted HARLOT, calls her self the <hi>Spouse,</hi>

               <l>And with the name of CHURCH, doth Men amuse,</l>
               <l>And therefore I again would hear your Name</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My Warrines She seemed to applaud,</l>
               <l>And said, I might suspect from others Fraud;</l>
               <l>But that HER WORD, might be sufficient,</l>
               <l>To clear my mind, to clear her just intent,</l>
               <l>For others do acknowledge they may Erre;</l>
               <l>But I my self <hi>Infallible</hi> averre,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>I am the</hi> ROMAN CATHOLICK CHURCH, (said She)</l>

               <l>Now in your Name, then I did hear before,</l>
               <l>And that same Word, (which makes me yet more Shy)</l>
               <l>Doth seem a Contradiction to imply:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Catholick,</hi> how can that consist?</l>

               <l>And said <hi>Poor Man,</hi> how far ar't thou beguil'd,</l>
               <l>Thy throat's too narrow, and thy Wit's too shallow,</l>
               <l>If thou one Contradiction can not swallow;</l>
               <l>That's but a Gnat; go with me silly fool,</l>

My Pleas are great, for all I doe pretend,</l>
               <l>Mine Arguments are Infinite, without end,</l>
               <l>Without beginning; then She stretch't Her voice,</l>

MY GUIDE was there well known, tho I was not,</l>
               <l>To Her they Bow'd, to Her all homage pay'd,</l>
               <l>And to the Palace we were streight convey'd:</l>
               <l>I looked with a curious Strangers Eie,</l>
               <l>Observing all things which I there did see,</l>
               <l>The rooms, were stately which I did behold,</l>
               <l>All pav'd with Marble, and all siel'd with Gold,</l>
               <l>Which Struck with rayes, reflected such a light,</l>
               <l>As did at once please and confound my sight:</l>
               <l>But that wherewith mine eyes I longest fed,</l>
               <l>Was pictures wherewith they were garnished,</l>
               <l>And these were draw'n and were coloured so,</l>
               <l>I doubted if they were alive or no.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Here was a judge, who on his bench did sit,</l>
               <l>A mightie throng of men encompass'd it,</l>
               <l>I saw them gape, perceiv'd they cry'd aloud</l>
               <l>Away with him, and on us be his Blood;</l>
               <l>I saw the man 'gainst whom they were so bent,</l>
               <l>His looks, bespoke him wholly innocent;</l>
               <l>They told me that was IESUS, whom I spy'd,</l>
               <l>And these were Jewes who thus against him cry'd,</l>
               <l>I well took heed to all,</l>
               <l>And thought, I'm now in <hi>Pilates Iudgement-Hall:</hi>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The manner of Christs death, I saw so plain,</l>
               <l>How he was mock't, how men did him disdain,</l>
               <l>How he was strip't, and scourg'd, and crown'd with thorn,</l>
               <l>How he came forth, and how his Cross was born;</l>
               <l>How he was pierc'd, and how he bow'd his head,</l>
               <l>That to my self with confidence I said,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Or here's the place in which my Lord was slain</hi>

               <l>She told him that I was a Stranger, whom</l>

               <l>To say the truth when I observ'd his face,</l>

               <l>Upon his brow (me thought) at rage and death,</l>
               <l>For he was very wrinkled, very pale,</l>

               <l>I told him I was rap't in Admiration,</l>

               <l>I spake even as I thought, I lyed not:</l>

               <l>The Garb was <hi>wondrous</hi> which I saw him wear,</l>
               <l>And <hi>wondrous</hi> were his Boasts, and <hi>wondrous was his Chair:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I well remember, of THE CHAIR I said</l>

               <l>It's Seat and Stoops were so Demonstrative:</l>
               <l>He smil'd at this, and nothing more did say,</l>
               <l>I humbly took my leave, and went away.</l>

               <l>MY GUIDE perceiv'd, I did not well digest</l>
               <l>The scalding dishes of this sumptuous feast,</l>
               <l>She told me, that She well in mind did bear</l>
               <l>The words, I uttered of the SACRED CHAIR;</l>
               <l>And what I spake of the forbidden Tree,</l>
               <l>Assur'd her that the fruit displeased me:</l>
               <l>Yet ceas'd she not, HER HEAD still to commend,</l>
               <l>And bid me mind, how he did condescend</l>

               <l>Is this THE HOLY COURT, where I have been?</l>
               <l>Are these RELIGIONS DARLINGS, I have seen?</l>
               <l>All here, are Masters of the art of sin,</l>
               <l>They scarce have more of men, but shape and sikn;</l>
               <l>They seem to be incarnat Furies all,</l>
               <l>Or by what other name shall I themcall?</l>
               <l>Gain, Honour, Pleasure, I see them implore,</l>
               <l>No other Gods I think they doe adore,</l>
               <l>They look't not up to Heaven; but when they swore:</l>
               <l>They often met, did often counsell take,</l>
               <l>How they might all men their own subjects make,</l>
               <l>And in their Consultations, did pretend,</l>
               <l>That to advance RELIGION was their end:</l>
               <l>RELIGION'S sacred name did cloak all things,</l>
               <l>And they made it a Stall to all designes:</l>
               <l>I mark't them well, I found they were a Crew</l>
               <l>Whose Eyes and Faces, were of yellow hue,</l>
               <l>The love of Gold, <hi>(That jaundise of the Soul)</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Had made their Visage odiously feul:</l>
               <l>Vices I never heard of here I found,</l>
               <l>Men who unto their pleasures set no bound;</l>
               <l>With Flouds of Wine, they drowned all their cares,</l>
               <l>And did with Musick over-noyse their feares:</l>
               <l>Some the Buffoons here did play,</l>
               <l>Some, poor Orphans did betray,</l>
               <l>Some, projected by each Cheat,</l>
               <l>How they might be rich or great,</l>
               <l>They nothing did account unjust,</l>
               <l>Might serve their humour or their lust;</l>
               <l>Freely their Souls and Consciences they sold,</l>

The CARD'NALL VERTUES, I could tell before;</l>
               <l>But CARD'NALL VICES, I found many more</l>
               <l>Than I could number: Better be alone,</l>
               <l>Then in this Court (said I) I will be gone.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>MY GUIDE displeased was, to see, that I</l>
               <l>So narrowly did into all things pry;</l>
               <l>Some little Touch of Learning She did find</l>
               <l>I had, and therefore to divert my mind,</l>
               <l>Desir'd, that now I would HER SCHOOLS go view,</l>
               <l>The Shops of Learning (said She) would me shew:</l>

            <lg>
               <l>This sight at first did give me great content,</l>
               <l>I thought I was into myne Element:</l>
               <l>Men of Prodigious Learning, I saw there,</l>
               <l>Prodigious heaps of Books, lay every where;</l>
               <l>I saw some writting Volumes (I confess)</l>
               <l>Which I did judge, would over-load the Press;</l>
               <l>Some scrap'd out lines, some rent out leaves of Books,</l>
               <l>Which pleas'd them not, (as I thought by their looks)</l>
               <l>What mean't that Havock I conceived not,</l>
               <l>They said, THEY PURGED WHAT THE FATHERS wrote,</l>
               <l>Because in many things, they well did see</l>
               <l>Their Books inclyn'd to favour Heresie:</l>
               <l>Some took <hi>Old Parchment</hi> and did write on it,</l>
               <l>In Antique letters, what they judged fit,</l>
               <l>I asked what they wrote? It was, (they said)</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Grave Old Traditions, new come in their head,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And by these <hi>suddled Parchments,</hi> men would see</l>
               <l>These were the Doctrines of Antiquitie,</l>
               <l>For whatsoe'r the present <hi>Church</hi> doth hold,</l>
               <l>Must be beleeved to be very old,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I did admire their Wit; but could not be</hi>

I left the SCHOOLS, and to MY GUIDE did say</l>
               <l>That I inclin'd to go to CHURCH, and pray</l>
               <l>It was a very Solemn <hi>Holy-Day;</hi>

               <l>The Pictures of <hi>All Saints</hi> did here appear,</l>
               <l>Yea even <hi>The Trinitie</hi> was painted here:</l>
               <l>The People flocking came unto the place,</l>
               <l>And to each <hi>Image</hi> they did bow their face,</l>
               <l>Then every one, his Prayers did direct</l>
               <l>Unto the <hi>Saint,</hi> he chiefly did respect:</l>
               <l>Many did to <hi>The</hi> BLESSED VIRGIN croud,</l>
               <l>Begg'd that <hi>She</hi> would their Souls protect, and shroud,</l>
               <l>From all their foes, from all their feared harmes,</l>
               <l>They kiss'd her feet, they hugg'd her in their armes,</l>
               <l>They did bespeak Her in all flattering termes,</l>
               <l>Said, that they did their whole trust in Her place,</l>
               <l>Call'd Her <hi>A</hi> GODDESS, LADY <hi>of all Grace,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And when they thought Her by these whinings won,</l>
               <l>They did beseech Her TO COMMAND HER SON:</l>
               <l>In on thing many much themselves o're-shot,</l>
               <l>They call'd Her LADY, yet Her <hi>Sex</hi> forgot;</l>
               <l>For when they kneel'd, they gravely did accost Her,</l>
               <l>First with an AVE then a PATER NOSTER:</l>
               <l>I strang'd, to hear, that all that praying throng,</l>
               <l>Did scorn to pray but in <hi>The Latin Tongue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I thought they all were Clerks, untill I found</l>
               <l>They did poor <hi>Priscian</hi> very rudely wound,</l>
               <l>Yea they did use such uncouth Barbarous terms,</l>
               <l>That I suspect'd their prayers smell'd of Charmes,</l>
               <l>Some Wives intending to rehearse their <hi>Creed,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Did enterlac't with handsome words indeed,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:94581:18"/>
They wrestled through it, with a deall of pain,</l>
               <l>And ended it with <hi>Beitt-im and Turnim again.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now comes the PRIEST and did himself address</l>
               <l>With many Rites to celebrate the Mass,</l>
               <l>I prysed much the <hi>Vestments</hi> which he had,</l>
               <l>So rich they were, so well embroydered,</l>
               <l>His <hi>Mystick Robes</hi> did make a splendid show,</l>
               <l>And he did gravely to the ALTAR goe:</l>
               <l>Sometimes He stood,</l>
               <l>Sometimes He bow'd,</l>
               <l>Now mumbled, then spoke aloud,</l>
               <l>He crossed once, He crossed twice,</l>
               <l>Then at a Bend He crossed thrice:</l>
               <l>Uncouth were the mouths he made,</l>
               <l>Uncouth were the words he said,</l>
               <l>He often crienged, and he kiss't,</l>
               <l>And turning next, the people bless't;</l>
               <l>He turn'd his face, he turn'd his back,</l>
               <l>We understood not what He spake;</l>
               <l>But saw him toss'd to every Art,</l>
               <l>Thus Antickly he act'd his part.</l>
               <l>After He thus had been as one in throwes,</l>
               <l>Had made strange gestures, and such warbling showes,</l>
               <l>At length, FIVE WONDER-WORKING WORDS he saith,</l>
               <l>Whose strange effects, doe far exceed all Faith:</l>
               <l>That which just now, was only BREAD before,</l>
               <l>He does assert, that it is Bread no more;</l>
               <l>But did enjoyn, that it we should <hi>Adore;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Nothing but <hi>Bread</hi> did in his hand appear,</l>
               <l>Nought (said he) but it's <hi>Accidents</hi> are here.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>It's Bread we handle, Bread we taste, and see,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And yet we must believ't no Bread to be:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The people all upon the <hi>Wafer</hi> gaz'd,</l>
               <l>They trusted all he said, and were amaz'd,</l>

They kneel'd unto it, as a Deity,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>They have a sturdie Faith, (in truth said I)</hi>

               <l>I made no Question next; but every Guest</l>
               <l>Who was invited to this Holy Feast,</l>
               <l>Should be admitted of the Drink to taste:</l>
               <l>But that' sa favour which was quite deny'd,</l>
               <l>He took THE CUP, but would it not divide,</l>
               <l>He did alledge, that liquor must not be</l>
               <l>Bestow'd upon the profane Laitie:</l>
               <l>I asked what did aile the surly Priest</l>
               <l>Thus to refuse, what was allow'd by Christ?</l>
               <l>Why should he fear to give, since Jesus did it?</l>
               <l>They said, <hi>A</hi> HOLY COUNCILL had forbid it,</l>
               <l>Who Christ's appointment well did understand,</l>
               <l>But what he bid, that it did counter-mand,</l>
               <l>Behold the <hi>Canon</hi> is at hand,</l>
               <l>Which with a NON OBSTANTE doth begin,</l>
               <l>Read it, and then you'l see it is a Sin</l>
               <l>For Laicks to desire to drink that Cup</l>
               <l>The Priest himself must drink it every sip,</l>
               <l>And that because, <hi>It's greatly to be fear'd,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Some Drops may stick unto a Lay-mans Beard.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>Mass being done, the Priest with no mean grace</l>
               <l>Himself into <hi>The Sacred Chair</hi> did place,</l>
               <l>And frankly to his preaching work did fall,</l>

               <l>And so did keep the <hi>Young Bridegroom</hi> alive:</l>
               <l>From this fair Text, he did discourse at length,</l>
               <l>Of these <hi>Bad Spirits</hi> cunning, and their Strength,</l>
               <l>He Marshall'd all the Devills in File and Ranks,</l>
               <l>He told us <hi>Asmodeus</hi> place, and pranks:</l>

How against <hi>Marriage</hi> he was so intent,</l>
               <l>Because it is <hi>An Holy Sacrament:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then had we such a talk of <hi>Holy Fish,</hi>

               <l>As did awake mine appetite to wish</l>
               <l>I had some of them served in a dish?</l>

As if the pain'd, and new delivered Mother</l>
               <l>Had born a Child, and ugly Devill together:</l>
               <l>With <hi>Holy Oyle,</hi> the Babe he did besmear,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Hallowed Garments,</hi> put on him to wear;</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Holy Salt,</hi> was put into his Mouth,</l>
               <l>Sure (thought I) that will breed the Child a drouth:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>A Holy Candle's</hi> then put in his hand,</l>
               <l>The use whereof I did not understand;</l>
               <l>And last of all, <hi>The Priest</hi> did think it fit</l>
               <l>Gently <hi>To stroke the Child with what he spit.</hi>

               <l>When all was done, one did <hi>The Priest</hi> accost,</l>

               <l>Doth for your presence earnestly intreat,</l>
               <l>Now to assist him in his greatest strait;</l>
               <l>He was not nice to go; and I</l>
               <l>Resolved was to bear him company;</l>
               <l>Not that I curious was to see</l>
               <l>The poor man in his agonie,</l>
               <l>But that I thought, I might instructed be</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Being intent upon this good designe,</l>
               <l>I very heedfull was to every thing:</l>
               <l>The Dying man did earnestly request</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Father,</hi> to direct him, how he best</l>
               <l>Might now arrive unto an happie rest:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Priest</hi> sat down, and promis'd he should find</l>
               <l>All ease, and satisfaction to his mind.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>He first required, <hi>That he should confess</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>His Sins,</hi> and not conceall them more or less:</l>
               <l>The house was usher'd, and when all were gone,</l>
               <l>He, and the dying man were left alone;</l>
               <l>But sneakingly I creep't beneath a bed,</l>
               <l>That I might hear all that was done, or said:</l>

Into the <hi>Priest,</hi> the man much trust repos'd,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Oft (said He) I have harbour'd flaming ires,</l>

               <l>Sometimes have drunk, sometimes to excess eated,</l>
               <l>And often have I excessively prated,</l>
               <l>Not seldom have I also rashly sworn,</l>
               <l>And the most sacred name profanely torn,</l>
               <l>And many times when I have pray'd alone,</l>
               <l>My lips have talked, when my heart was gone:</l>
               <l>Officious lies made often he confess't,</l>

                  <hi>The Priest</hi> said, these were faults indeed; <hi>Yet all</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>Or most of them, were only</hi> VENIALL;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Some Doctors</hi> have averr'd no less, (said he)</l>
               <l>Which doth suffice for PROBABILITIE:</l>
               <l>And then what other guilt there was, did ask?</l>
               <l>The man did thus again begin his task:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Churches Lawes full often have I broke,</l>
               <l>Against the Pope full often have I spoke,</l>
               <l>The Holy days I carelesly despis'd,</l>
               <l>And Holy Reliques have not duely pryz'd,</l>
               <l>Often (said He) I grievously have fail'd,</l>
               <l>Some faults from my Confessor hath conceal'd:</l>
               <l>And then he made a very sad complaint,</l>
               <l>That he had sometimes eaten Flesh in Lent,</l>
               <l>And had on Friday's done so often times;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Priest said, These were horrid</hi> MORTALL <hi>Crimes</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Such as deserve Eternall punishment;</l>

               <l>Some with cross'd armes did <hi>Cloath'd with Sackloth</hi> go,</l>
               <l>Some with bare feet did walk among the snow:</l>
               <l>Some <hi>Lash't</hi> themselves, untill their flesh did bleed,</l>
               <l>Some only <hi>Strewed Ashes</hi> on their Head:</l>
               <l>Some, did some <hi>Ave's,</hi> and some pray'rs rehearse,</l>
               <l>As carelesly as ever I did verse;</l>
               <l>They only seem'd concern'd to keep account</l>
               <l>That they to such a number might amount:</l>
               <l>Some said they <hi>Fasted,</hi> and no Flesh did taste,</l>
               <l>And yet their meals lack'd nothing of a Feast:</l>
               <l>The difference was great that I saw there.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Some Pennances were slight, and some severe.</hi>

               <l>These cruell whippers of themselves (said I)</l>

Men in their tempers differ much, and I</l>
               <l>With all of them endeavour to comply:</l>
               <l>These whom thou thus torment themselves do'st see,</l>

               <l>That these their outward tortures, ease their mind;</l>
               <l>Or else unto great <hi>Merit</hi> they aspire,</l>
               <l>And I will not deny them their desire;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I bid them lash, till they make bare their Bones,</hi>

               <l>Others more joviall sinners are then so,</l>
               <l>And will not such hard measures undergoe,</l>
               <l>Unto all thought of <hi>Merit,</hi> they are freezed,</l>

               </l>
               <l>They would 'scape Hell; but not disturb their ease,</l>

               <l>Some prayers they'r appointed to say over,</l>

               <l>I shew them very easie wayes to bliss,</l>

               <l>And some, their bread by <hi>Begging</hi> only got,</l>

               <l>I to RELIGIOUS HOUSES did repair,</l>

               <l>Thither I found some Princes had retir'd,</l>
               <l>And what had brought them thither I admit'd;</l>

               <l>The consciences of some were rack't with guilt,</l>
               <l>Of Horrid crimes, and blood which they had spil't</l>
               <l>On Beds of Silk, they could obtain no rest,</l>
               <l>An <hi>Angry Conscience</hi> (that unwelcome Guest)</l>
               <l>Came un-invited unto every feast,</l>
               <l>Imbittered all things unto their taste,</l>

               <l>Their Crimes (they think) are expiat hereby,</l>
               <l>Blood, and oppression will no longer cry,</l>

               <l>Finding that they could breath in free'r air,</l>

               <l>Some of them, still did hatch mischievous things,</l>
               <l>To imbroyle Kingdoms, and to murther Kings,</l>
               <l>And for these ends, did with instructions load</l>
               <l>The most Pragmatick and sent them abroad:</l>
               <l>Some were for learning, and choos'd that retreat</l>
               <l>As most convenient for the muses seat:</l>
               <l>Some were Ambitious, and here courted Fame,</l>
               <l>Fled from the world, to obtain a name;</l>
               <l>Some Criminalls fled hither from the judge,</l>
               <l>Fear of the Gibbet, made them take refuge</l>
               <l>Into the CLOYSTER; Some their <hi>Discontent,</hi>

               <l>Rather then their <hi>Religion</hi> hither sent:</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Each of them did their ORDER magnifie,</l>

               </l>
               <l>They wanted not their factions, and much heat,</l>
               <l>Their talking of their MERITS was too great,</l>
               <l>The lives of others they too much disgrac'd,</l>

               <l>And what was Sp'rituall, to much foundred was,</l>
               <l>Except with very few; so that although</l>
               <l>Their mealls were sparing, and their Garments rough,</l>
               <l>And pleasures they unto themselves deny'd,</l>

Beautie they had, whereby love might be warm'd;</l>
               <l>But 'gainst it's darts invincibly were arm'd;</l>
               <l>Whenever any softer pleasures knock't</l>
               <l>Loud at the door, they keep't it fast and lock't:</l>

               <l>And taught, from true Humility to slide,</l>

               <l>Some MYSTICK words (I found) they learned thence,</l>
               <l>Words strange to Scripture, and as strange to sense;</l>
               <l>They talked of their <hi>Wondrous</hi> INSPIRATIONS,</l>
               <l>Of PASSIVE UNIONS, and ANNIHILATIONS,</l>
               <l>Of INTROVERSIONS, and IRRADIATIONS,</l>

               <l>The <hi>Understanding</hi> mean while lying still:</l>

They in GODS MID HEAD <hi>were beclos'd</hi> (they said)</l>
               <l>And in his BUXOMNES and MEEK-HEID laid,</l>
               <l>And that their <hi>Souls,</hi> did deeply in him <hi>Ground,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And knew him in the SPIRITS PUREST FUND:</l>
               <l>In many words they talked at this rate,</l>
               <l>Words, which I cannot in this place relate,</l>
               <l>Such stubborn words as frowardly decline</l>
               <l>With neighbour-words in verses to combine;</l>
               <l>So that it to a Poet were a crime,</l>
               <l>Once to attempt to fetch them into Rhyme:</l>
               <l>I Grew impatient, and began, to huff,</l>
               <l>To hear them rattling such non sensick stuff,</l>
               <l>Yet when I did into their temper pry,</l>
               <l>Observing, that their minds they did apply</l>
               <l>Unto Religious thoughts; and were no Cheats,</l>
               <l>But too much warm'd with <hi>Entbusiastick heats,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And that their heads were weak. their musings long,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Wine, was for the Bottle much too strong,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I blam'd their Leaders, who did them abuse,</l>
               <l>And suffered them to be too much Recluse,</l>
               <l>And in their hands such Canting books did put,</l>

               <l>'Gainst these impostors was my Choler mov'd,</l>

               <l>Others, were like poor Birds shut in a cage,</l>

               <l>Some at their cruell Parents, who to save</l>
               <l>Their Portions, had sent them to that Grave;</l>
               <l>Some at themselves, who had not been more shy</l>
               <l>To take these VOWES which they could not unty;</l>
               <l>For their Novitious fervour, now was gone,</l>
               <l>They found, they were not fit to live alone;</l>
               <l>And yet their OATHS, had all their hopes defeat,</l>
               <l>Of ever living in a married state:</l>

This did their minds continually racke,</l>
               <l>If they shall keep what they have vow'd or break;</l>
               <l>The thoughts of either, did them quite confound,</l>
               <l>Both HORNES of this DILEMMA did them wound:</l>
               <l>Their very frozen CELLS did nurse their fires,</l>
               <l>Restraints, were fewell to their warm desires;</l>
               <l>Yet <hi>Conscience,</hi> did put them still in fear,</l>

               <l>Thus were they burthen'd; yet once being fast,</l>
               <l>I found they were resolved to be chaste,</l>
               <l>Their Lot was cast: They choosed to endure</l>
               <l>Their angrie thoughts, and not to seek a cure,</l>
               <l>They judg'd, it was a more Religious life</l>
               <l>To be a vexed maid, then perjur'd wife:</l>
               <l>Their case (I thought) did much compassion claim,</l>

               <l>What happy change upon thy mind is wrought?</l>
               <l>When thou amongst the HOLY MONKS hast been,</l>

               <l>RELIGIOUS HOUSES such as these, (I said)</l>
               <l>I think, might usefull in the CHURCH be made,</l>
               <l>There might more rough undanton'd youth be tam'd,</l>
               <l>And tender minds be to Religion fram'd,</l>
               <l>And as the <hi>Prophets Schools</hi> they well might be,</l>

               <l>There, persons of a sad dejected mind,</l>

Of Christian freedom I doe judg't a breach,</l>
               <l>To bind some thus, to things beyond their reach,</l>
               <l>Things, which at first doe with their minds agree;</l>

               <l>Nothing but constant toyle and drudgerie:</l>

               <l>Nor can I think, but I have elsewhere seen</l>
               <l>As much <hi>Religion,</hi> where less noise hath been:</l>

               <l>In hearing this, SHE was impatient;</l>
               <l>Yet did She smother all her discontent,</l>
               <l>She only seemed to bewail my State,</l>

               <l>Mean while, <hi>A Clerk</hi> behind the door they had,</l>
               <l>Who did observe, and write all that I said.</l>

               <l>After a while, some <hi>Officers</hi> doe show,</l>
               <l>That now <hi>The Judges</hi> call me, I must goe;</l>
               <l>I am led out, and brought unto the Barr,</l>
               <l>And there inditements fram'd against me are:</l>
               <l>They said they were no time with me to lose;</l>
               <l>But bid me <hi>Swear,</hi> whatever they propose</l>
               <l>Or ask of me, that faithfully I shall</l>
               <l>Without Dissimulation answer all:</l>
               <l>Then, such ensnaring questions they did ask,</l>
               <l>To find an answer, was a vexing task;</l>
               <l>Which to be rid of, I said I would be</l>
               <l>As plain, as any could desire of me,</l>
               <l>So that they should not need, thus to go on</l>
               <l>In making further <hi>Inquisition,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>They all applaud my Resolution.</l>

                  <hi>After that manner you call</hi> HERESY</l>

               <l>But all this freedom, did not satisfie,</l>
               <l>My cruell Judges: Still they urged me,</l>
               <l>Some said, I did my complices conceal,</l>
               <l>Others that I had wealth, and must reveal</l>
               <l>Where it was hid; some said I must recant,</l>
               <l>And some alledg'd I did already faint,</l>
               <l>A little feeling of the WHEEL or RACK</l>
               <l>(They said) would all my resolution break,</l>
               <l>All engines they of torture did present,</l>
               <l>And threatned all most cruell punishment,</l>
               <l>And promis'd favour, if I would repent.</l>
               <l>Then was I back unto the Prison sent.</l>

               <l>A throng of angrie people in the street,</l>
               <l>Some runn, some rail'd, some cudgell'd all about,</l>

                  <hi>My Guards,</hi> did what they could to part the fray,</l>

               <l>In this Confusion, they had need to see</l>
               <l>To save themselves, who should have look't to me,</l>
               <l>I did observe the opportunitie,</l>
               <l>And thus escaped from these TYGERS hands,</l>
               <l>And found the means to be fred of my bands,</l>
               <l>I fled, and car'd not whether I did run,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>

I did unto a desert place repair,</l>

               <l>Have I not heard much talk, and little sense?</l>
               <l>And seen much shew, which void of substance is?</l>
               <l>RELIGION'S SHELL but did it's KERNEL miss:</l>

               <l>In <hi>Learned</hi> CHURCH-MEN to defend their cause;</l>
               <l>But all these things shall prove but broken reeds,</l>
               <l>The times shall change, and they must change their Creeds</l>
               <l>Their NUMBERS, I by ARMIES will o'rawe;</l>
               <l>I'l raise a power, that shall DISPENSE with LAW</l>
               <l>Their <hi>Parliaments Pl pack,</hi> their hands I'l bind,</l>
               <l>Their <hi>Tests</hi> and <hi>Statutes,</hi> I'l cause them rescind:</l>
               <l>Of mine own CLERGIE, I'l hiss for a Fry,</l>
               <l>That shall out-dispute, or shall theirs out-cry;</l>
               <l>These GOWN-MEN now look big, preach, write, &amp; brag,</l>
               <l>I'l quell their courage, or their mouths I'l gag.</l>
               <l>No money will I spare, no pains, no cost,</l>
               <l>And tho I will not of the issue boast</l>
               <l>Too much afore hand, yet I'm confident,</l>
               <l>At length I shall not miss of mine intent:</l>

                  <hi>I'le overturn,</hi> I'le doe more then I say,</l>
               <l>I may perhaps in one contrivance fail,</l>
               <l>But in another, hope I shall prevail:</l>
               <l>That ISLAND either shall take on my yoke;</l>
               <l>Or else it shall in peices quite be broke,</l>
               <l>Better it should an empty desert be,</l>
               <l>Then that it be not subject unto me:</l>
               <l>I will, <hi>I will</hi> Rule in that stubborn ISLE,</l>

               <l>My knees did shake, I trembled every joynt,</l>
