            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is written in hiſtories (Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull) that the ſonnes of Seth and Seneca, or ſome other zealous Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, being deſirous to leaue ſome thing woorth memorie vnto their poſterities. Did make two pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, one of braſſe, and another of earth, wherein were grauen the principles of the ſeuen ſciences, to the end their ſucceſſours ſhould vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the good wils of their predeceſſours: whereby they did ſet forth and ſhew all ſuch good knowledge and learning, as they had found out in their time, to the furtherance of their common wealth. So likewiſe now, things neceſſarie for the ſame, ought not to bee deferd, nor lightly regarded, or forgotten. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the delights of people are of diuers kinds, the ſame is perceiued by their doings: But as touching their delights, thoſe ought chiefely to be regarded which profit moſt the common wealth. As (among the reſt) the gouernment and preſeruation of cattell, and ſuch like: wherein (for lacke of knowledge) oft times the poore man looſeth his beaſt. Alſo I haue knowne that the diſeaſed cattell, of wealthie yeomen, and other poore men ſometimes haue all periſhed, whereby the whole pariſheshaue bene impoueriſhed therby: which thing hath bene a great loſſe vnto ſuch townes, and alſo hinderances vnto the common wealth. Marcus Tullius Cicero, was euer deſirous to further his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and common wealth, and ſaid, that daie was euill ſpent, that he did not therein do good, to his common wealth: I would it were ſo now. Euen ſo likewiſe our
<pb facs="tcp:12686:3"/>
predeceſſours, Ariſtotle, Virgill, Plato, and many other in giuing vs examples therein, haue left immortall fame behind them in writing, through the good zeale and loue they had to their countrie and common wealth. Which thing likewiſe (Right worſhipfull) hath moued me of long time to gather and put in writing the doings of diuers and ſundrie perſons, as wel ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as of our owne countrie men, to ſhew the helpes for moſt diſeaſes in cattell. And for as much as I am enformed your worſhip is deſirous to know and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of the gouernment of cattell, and of the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Oxen, to the intent to ſhewe the good will I beare to further therein, I thought good to ſet forth the practiſes of many men, how to helpe cattell diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: which thing ought not to be kept ſecret for the lucar of a few, but rather I do communicate this my labour to him that hath delight therein. If anie thinke not well hereof, or deſpiſe this my trauell, I will frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire them with theſe wordes: <hi>Quod meliora noſti, candidus imparti ſi non, his vtere mecum.</hi> VVhich is: If you know anie better how to mend it, of your courteſie impart it, if not, take part of this with me. Thus I leaue to trouble your worſhip anie further, deſiring you to beare with this my plaine and rude ſtile, and to be the defender thereof in print, and in ſo doing, I ſhal thinke my trauell well beſtowed, my paines much lightned, and my good will well recompenced.</p>

                  <p>WHen I had gathered and collctted (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) certaine medicines how for to helpe cattel and to gouerne them. I conſidered what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and profit it might bee to my countrie and common wealth, ſpecially vnto the huſband men, and ſuch as haue the gouernment of Oxen, Horſes, Shéep, and ſuch other cattell. For oft times for want of knowledge, many cattell being ſicke, do periſh and die: Where as ſickenes and hurts are accident vnto man diuers waies, euen ſo it chaunceth vnto cattell. Whereupon I thought it good to take occaſion for the loue of my countrie and common wealth, to write ſomewhat, partly of the gouernment for our moſt vſed cattell, as oxen, kine, calues, horſes, ſhéepe, hogs, and ſuch: with diuers approued remedies for them. Plainely and perfectly ſet forth, as well to bee vnderſtood of the vnlearned huſband man, as of the learned gentle man: ſhewing ſomewhat moreouer for the bones ſetting in a beaſt: Declaring likewiſe the order and nature of hogs, with the vſe of dogs, and the cauſe of their madnes, with certaine helpes againſt the bitten cattell, and alſo to help mangie dogs, with diuers approued waies to take moules in any kind of ground.

Alſo the kéeper ought to rubbe them daily that labour and to kembe them with a carde, which will make them the luſtier, and to waſhe their feete with colde wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when they labour not, will doe well, Yée ſhall alſo know the force and age of an oxe in viſiting his mouth, for he wil caſt his two formoſt teeth within ten moneths of his firſt yeere, and within ſixe weekes after that, hee will caſt the two next teeth vnto them, and about the ende of three yeeres, he will chaunge and caſt them all. And when they are growen all full vp agayne, they will then bee all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, white and long. But when the Oxe beginneth to waxe olde, they will returne and waxe crooked and blacke and likewiſe vnequall. Alſo for Oxen to labour, the black <note place="margin">The labouring Oxe.</note> Oxe and the redde oxe are the beſt, and the brown or gréeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Oxe are next, the white Oxe is worſt of al colours.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then it were beſt to feede him and ſo to ſell him: an oxe will liue wel 15, or 16. yeeres. Alſo wilde oxen are better to beare a burden than to labour, for they are neuer ſo free nor ſo ſtrong to drawe and labour, as the tame Oxen are. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is not good to labour with any bul among your oxen, <note place="margin">Bul te labour.</note> for he wilbe ſtubborne and ſullen, and loues to be a maiſter ouer the reſt, whereby he wil but trouble them.

If a cow with make deſire the bull, if ſhee bee mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked incontinent before, ſhee will not then take nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the bull, if then ſhe haue no bul, &amp; leeſe her make, ſhe wil deſire the bull about a moneth after againe, thus ſome
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12686:30"/>
huſbands haue proued, and the bull the contrarie. For he muſt be fat and luſty when he ſhall couer the kine, or els thoſe calues will be weake. A cow will liue well 15. yeares, but after ſhe will waxe féeble and weare. Alſo ye ſhall not let a cow take the bull before ſhe be three yeare olde. For when young kine go to the bull, they bring forth commonly ſmall and weake calues: therefore ſome huſbands will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer weane the firſt calfe of a cow. And alſo ye ſhall not put your kine vnto the bull before the third or fourth day of Iune, to the ende that ſhe may (by the vertue in eating of hearbes and graſſe) be the more hot and luſty as to take the bull when ſhe ſhalbe put vnto him. Wherefore ſome huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands (to make a cow take the bull the ſooner) do giue her of the hearbe called cowmake, which groweth like a white gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loflower among corne. Then to keepe her a little hungry, and to giue her therof, two houres before ſhe ſhall take the bull, and that will put her in more heat, and ye ſhal then rub her naturall cundit with nettles, which is alſo good, if ſhee wil refuſe the bull. Some huſbands do counſell not to ſuffer your kine to be conered vnder foure yeres, and likewiſe not after twelue yeares, becauſe the one is too young, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is too olde.</p>
                  <p>And alſo they ſay, the beſt time to put the bull with the kine is, all the month of Iuly. For then the kine will bring their calues in ver, in the beginning and ſpring of hearbes and graſſe: ye need not conſtraine her then to take the bull, for the aboundance of hearbes will prouoke and put her in heat, ſo that ye ſhall not then conſtraine her. A cow will go with calfe ten monethes. If a cow refuſe, or the bull wil not couer her, ye ſhal make them haue appetite, as it is ſpoken of among the horſes and mares, and as it is afore rehearſed: and then ye ſhall diminiſh her paſture, to the ende that the aboundance of graſſe do not make her barren, for a cow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fat, will ſmally deſire the bull, and when ſhe hath taken, ye may iudge by refuſing the bull, and alſo to knowe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe ſhall haue a cow calfe or bull calfe, ye ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, if the bull deſcend from her on the right ſide of her,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:12686:31"/>
more then the leaſt, is to iudge a bull calfe: and likewiſe the contrarie if he deſcend on the leaſt ſide. Or if the com in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending and lying downe on the right ſide, is to iudge ſhee hath a bull calfe. And if ſhe lye downe on the left ſide, is to iudge a cow calfe. And when ye ſhal iudge ſhe hath taken by refuſing the bul, which thing doth not alwaies happen true, for although ſhe haue taken, yet many kine be not ſatiſfied, for ſome brute beaſtes will haue a voluptuous deſire aboue nature, as wel as other creatures.</p>
                  <p>Alſo to nouriſh your kine and calues, in countries where there is great ſtore of paſture, they may nouriſh their calues all the yere. But where there is ſmall ſtore of paſture, it wil ſcant ſuffice them from two yeare to two yeare: And ye may nouriſh your calues of their dammes for one yeares ſpace. But that yeare thoſe kine muſte not bee charged with any kind of labour. Alſo when a cow hath calued, ſome huſbands will after the calfe hath ſuckt iii. wéekes, take away a tet, &amp; milke it cleane: the next wéeke another tette, &amp; ſo the thirde. Thus they will haue milke plentie, and yet many kine wil kéepe milke inough to ſerue for her calfe. If a cow paſſe x. yeares, ſhe is not then ſo good to bring calues as before. If a young cow calue before thrée yeares, ye ſhall take away the calf, and milke her firſt thrée daies together, becauſe ſhe ſhal not then be charged with to much milke. Then milke her no more but let the calfe haue al the reſt: If ye will drye vp her milke, ye ſhal noint her vdderne all ouer with tarre. Kine deſire not ſo much to drinke of the riuer water as of ponde water, becauſe the water of the riuer is more colder then the ponde water: Which riuer water being ſo colde, will chyll her within, and make her in danger to caſt her calfe, if God worke not the contrarie. Notwithſtanding among all great cattell, the cow will lightly abide the moſte coldeſt ayre. Wherefore they commonly let them lye without the dores all the winter in moſt places and countries.</p>

Wherefore it is thought good of ſome to burie them whole, for feare of a further inconuenience, this is thought good of ſome to take a ſmall corde and binde it harde about his necke, then on the farre ſide, yee ſhall feele a great vayne, and with a launcet. yee ſhall ſtrike thereon and lette him bloud, a pint or more, and ſo likewiſe on the other ſide of hys necke. Then take away the corde, and it will ſodaine ſtanche, but if the ſigne be there, he is in more daunger of bleeding ſtil.

nowe and then ſome ſmall helpes, and alſo the Dams by Iune ſhalbe the readier againe to take the bull, &amp; to bring other calues in the time aforeſaide, and if a Cow tarry til after May ere ſhe calue, The calfe wilbe too weak in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, following: and the dam wil not be ſo ready to take the Bul againe, but thereby oft time go barren. Alſo to reare a calfe after Michaelmas, and to kéepe the dam at hard meate as they doe in ſome countries, it woulde be too coſtly al the Winter, and a cow abroade will giue more milke with a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle graſſe, then muche fodder lying in the cloſe houſe, or fed with hay and ſtraw remaining in the ſtall: for the drie and harde meate doth diminiſh more milke a great deale than graſſe. As for thoſe huſbandes that haue but ſmall paſture or none at all, muſt doe as they may, and in my minde, it were farre better for them to ſell theyr calues, than to reare them, whereby they may ſaue the milke to a more profite for the kéeping of his houſe, and the Cowe then wil the rather goe to the Bull againe.</p>
                  <p>Alſo if the huſband goe with an Oxe plough, it ſhalbe then meete to reare two Oxe calues, and two Cow calues yearely, to holde vp his ſtocke if he can ſo doe, and it wilbe the more profite.

And thoſe that can haue ſeuerall paſtures for their kine &amp; calues ſhall doe well and reare with leſſe coſte then others. The weaning of Calues with haye and water will make them haue great bellies, becauſe they ſtirre not ſo well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with as with graſſe, and they will the rather rotte when they come to graſſe. And agayne in Winter they woulde bee put in houſes, rather than to remaine abroade, and to giue them but haye on nightes, and to paſture them in the day time. And thus beyng vſed, they ſhall bee muche bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to handle when they ſhall be kine or oxen to ſerue to any other purpoſe.</p>

                  <head>What cattell are moſt meete to go in one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture together.</head>
                  <p>YE ſhall vnderſtand, it is not ſo good nor ſo profitable, to haue cattel all of one ſort in a paſture together, as to haue all oxen, or all horſes in a paſture together, nor yet ſheepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone except they paſture on high groundes, for they will not féed euen, but ouerrunne, and leaue many tufts of graſſe here and there vntouched in diuers places of the paſture: except it be greatly layd with cattell. Therfore ye ſhall perceiue that horſes will agrée well with other cattell in one paſture toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for there is ſome graſſe that horſes wil eate, and beaſts will not, and lightly a horſe will couet to féed after other cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. Alſo a horſe loues to feede on low groundes, as plaſhes and hollow places. But horſes and ſhéepe will not ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together, except it be for the ſheepe to féede on the vpper
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12686:39"/>
groundes. For a ſheepe will féed on a bare paſſure, &amp; eate the ſwéeteſt graſſe, and ſo will a horſe likewiſe, but hee muſt haue it longer. Yet (as ſome do ſay) a horſe wil eate as nigh the ground as a ſheepe, but he cannot therewith fill his belly ſo ſoone. To one hundreth of cattell in a paſture, ye may haue xx. horſes, if it be a low ground. But if there be plenty of graſſe, then ye may put therein an hundreth ſhéepe mo: and ſo likewiſe to the rate of the goodnes of the Paſture, more or leſſe in cattell: and after this order yee maye eate your paſtures euen with cattell, and leaue but few tuftes of graſſe vneaten.</p>
                  <p>Alſo if it be a high ground, ye may then put in more ſhéep, and leſſe of other cattell. For manye kine and draught oxen, will eate a ground much barer then the fatting oxen or kine. And ye may alſo giue a mylch Cowe as well to much meat as to little: For to much meate will make her ſoone fatte, and then ſhee will the rather take the Bull: and ſhee being fatte will giue leſſer milke then a leanner cowe: For the fatnes ſtoppeth the poares of the raines which ſhould conueigh the milke vnto the vdderne. Wherefore a meane paſture is alwaies beſt to keepe your mylch kyne in, and to haue them in a good meane eſtate, neither to fatte nor to leane. Alſo if a Cowe bee fatte when ſhee ſhall calue, ſhee is in more daunger then being leane, and the calfe (ſhee being fatte) ſhall be the leſſe of ſtature. As for your draught oxen yee cannot giue them to much meate, except it bee the after graſſe of a lowe mowed meddowe. For that will cauſe them to haue the gyrrie, and then hee maye not away ſo well with labour. Likewiſe if there be very much graſſe in a cloſe, the cattell will feede the worſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for better is a good ſwéete bitte from the earth, then a large and déepe graſſe. For where as it is long, the beaſts will byte of the toppes thereof and no more, for that is the ſweeteſt. And the other graſſe ſhall remayne ſtill on the grounde and ſo rotte, for no beaſt will eate thereof, but horſes onely in winter. For they will féede on foggie graſſe and ſuch like. Alſo ye ſhall vnderſtand that horſes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12686:39"/>
and cattell may not well be foddered in winter all together, but put apart, for the beaſtes with their hornes will gore both horſes and ſhéepe. Wherefore it is the more daunger ſo to féede them together: it is beſt therefore to make ſtanding rackes and cratches, and to caſt their meate therein: Which ſtaues ought to be ſet ſomewhat nigh together, for pulling and ſpoiling their fodder to much at once vnder their féete. It were rather better to change their places euery daye where ye feede them, which ſhould make them to gather vp more cleane, and not for to trample ſo much vnder their feete. Thus much as concerning the paſturing of cattell together in paſtures, and alſo the fothering of them together in winter.</p>

                  <head>A very good order for the fatting of oxen in the ſtawle.</head>
                  <p>VVHen ſoeuer you intend to fatte any oxen in the ſtawle, being in ſomer or winter to ſet them vp, if ye take them from graſſe in the ſommer, they will hardly fall to the eating of hay of a good while after, but when yee then take them vp, kéepe them ſo without meat and water one daye and a night, and ſo they will by extreme hunger forget the graſſe the rather, and then at the firſt giue them a little haye at once, whereby they may eate it vp cleane, and thereby waxe ſtill hungry. Ye muſt alſo take them vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtawle on a drie day, for if yee ſtawle them wette, they will haue (as ſome graſiers ſaye) warnell wormes on their backes, which will commonly come vnto them by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine &amp; pouertie, and will hurt the ſkin. And alſo it wil make them be lowſie. Ye ſhall therefore vſe to kembe them with wool cards or horſe combe, as ſome do, &amp; ſay it doth make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more luſtier. But indéed that is good for the labouring oxen, ſo to be vſed, but not for the fatting oxe as ſome iudge: nor ye ſhal not let them go forth of the ſtawle at anye time, not ſo much as to drinke. For then they will deſire the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12686:40"/>
more to be abroad, &amp; the licking of them wil hinder (as they ſay) their fatting. But ye ſhal ſo prouide that they may haue water brought them in cowles, or els to come through their ſtawles, as ſome do vſe, which is to ſet a woodden troffe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long through their ſtawles, and with a pipe of lead and a cocke at the ende thereof, coming from a conduit or ceſterne, and thereby fils the ſaid troffe twiſe a day with freſh water, morning and euening, and at euery time before, to clenſe the troffe of all the olde water, and ſo to giue them freſh, for after they haue once drunke their fils of the freſh water, they wil lightly haue no more thereof, for they will blow theron, and after loth to drinke any more thereof vntill they haue freſh. For an oxe or cow is a beaſt that doth loue to feede ſwéete and clenly. Alſo ye ſhall lay your troffes ende ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a ſlope ſo that the water may run forth al at the one ende thereof, in taking forth a pin to let out the ſaid water: and then waſh the troffe cleane, and ſo giue them freſh. Thus ye muſt vſe them dayly morning and euening ſo long as ye fat them.</p>
                  <p>And firſt in the morning ye ſhal take away all their olde haye, and ſo clenſe their water troffe, and then giue them freſh water, and then a little freſh hay againe, &amp; ſo at noone, and likewiſe at night: and thus to vſe them to be fedde from time to time. Alſo it ſhall be beſt to place and ſet their troffe on the farther ſide their crib nye vnto the wall, and to ſet it two foote hie and more, and their racks likewiſe woulde ſtand of a good height, as of iiii. foote or more, and to be made almoſt as broad beneath as aboue, for feare of tangling their hornes therein, and the rack ſtaues ſet not paſſing iiii. inches a ſunder: yet ſome do vſe to feede them on the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a racke, but that is thought to bee more duſtye and more waſtfull of haye. They do alſo giue them ſometimes for change, of wheate or barly chaffe, with the gurgins ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for that after it (they ſay) wil make them to drinke well. But the hay is onely the chiefeſt fodder and will make the hard fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe their ſtandarts and poſts to faſten the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by would
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12686:40"/>
be made round and ſmooth, of the bignes of xvi. inches about and vii. foot long, and ſette iiii. foote wide one poſt from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Ye muſt ſée likewiſe they be ſet faſt and ſtrong both aboue and beneath: and ye ſhall alſo hardle your oxen in the ſtawle, all of the one ſide of your ſtandartes or poſtes, for feare of their hornes the one oxe to hurt the other, and ye ſhall faſten them vnto the poſtes, with a bow-with made ſhacle wiſe, ſliding aboue and beneath his necke on the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dart, ſo that the one ſide of his necke ſhall be alwaies cloſe vnto the ſaid ſtandart or poſt. By which order of tying ſo, they ſhall not at any time bow their heads ſo well to licke them. For in licking them (as is ſaid) it doth hinder their feeding in the fatting. And alſo if ye ty them as plowe oxen be, with a ſole and a with, which is made like a yoake bow, which would be to long a tye from the ſtandart, and they will then both licke them ſelues, and ſtrike ech other with their hornes: therefore the other way of hardeling and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is beſt. Some do make a light cradle of wood, and put it about their neckes, which wil keepe their heads from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe to licke themſelues in any part of their bodies, but it is not ſo eaſie to ly downe. Other do al to ſméere them with their owne dung, and then caſt aſhes thereon, which will ſaue them from licking. Alſo for the clenſing and farming of them, they do vſe morning and euening to ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell downe their dung, and to ſee from time to time that they bee cleane kept, for that is a furtherance vnto their fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and liking. And as for the littering of them, they doo not litter at all, but let them lye on fayre drye plankes, and in their owne dung. Yet ſome are of this opinion, that to litter them ſomewhat vnder the forepart of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſhall not be hurtfull vnto them: and further their kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per muſt from time to time look vnto them, and marke how they eate and drinke orderly as they ſhould doo. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there will grow diſeaſes among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their mouths, as the barbes and ſuch like: Which will much hinder their féeding, and ſo paire if they be not looked vnto in time, and haue helpe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:12686:41"/>
Some do alſo vſe to make holes behind them, and ſet there in earthen pots euen with the ground, to kéepe their piſſe in, and ſo couers them with ſquare boordes or plankes, which piſſe they do vſe to waſh the bodies of thoſe apple trées which are geuen to be worme eaten, or canker eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for they ſay, that wil ſaue them. They do alſo vſe to caſt the ſaide piſſe among their rootes in the garden, for that will alſo kill or cauſe the wormes to voide, and ſaue the rootes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten. Thus much for the ordering and fatting of the oxen in the ſtawle.</p>
                  <p>Ye ſhal take the rootes of great ſedge, which ſedge beareth long leaues with white ſtrekes therein, much like a white and gréene lace, and growes in ſome gardens, like a quitch graſſe, and the rootes are much like vnto the quitch graſſe, but they are more greater, and will run in the ground like the quitch calde garum, in latin, and it is thought to bee a kind thereof. Take a handfull of the ſaid rootes, bruſe them, and boile them in a quart of good ale, then ſtraine it, ſo giue it luke warme three or foure mornings, and they ſhal ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. But let them not eate nor drinke the ſpace of two or thrée houres after.</p>

                     <hi>ALl</hi> thoſe which hath a deſire for to bréede coltes &amp; horſe, they muſt firſt make prouiſion for the good gouernement thereof, and to haue large paſtures, and to bee meaſured in their meate as well as other cattell. For a horſe doth aſke a greater diligence to be meated and kept in the ſtable more then other cattel. There is thrée ſortes of horſes, the firſt are to be nouriſhed young, which are noble and excellent: for the field and tourney. The ſecond is, for carriage of burdens, as moyles and packe horſe, which are bought and ſolde for that purpoſe according to their goodneſſe. The third is, another ſort of horſes and mares of eaſie prices, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for moſt men, the which is of a meaner and ſmaller ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and for the common ſort are moſt neceſſarie to trauell with, and alſo are better to féede and bring vp for to till the earth, which muſt haue alſo kéepers continually to ſée vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in fields &amp; paſtures, aſwel as in woods or other grounds, and to kéepe them from daungerous places of myres and bogges, and where as they may haue ſoft graſſe and ſweet, as wel as to be ranke, high and great. They doe ſuffer theſe horſes to be with the mares in paſtures or other groundes, and paſſe not when they doe couer the mares, not for theſe ſort of horſes: but for your large &amp; great mares, they ought to bee couered about Aprill or May, and ſome doe couer in mid March, to the end the mares may foale about the ſame time they were couered, in hauing ready the ſame time the tender graſſe and herbe to feede on, and to haue the hot and faire ſeaſon vnto harueſt: for about the end of xii. moneths after ſhe foaleth: and therfore ye muſt with good aduiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, put the horſe vnto the mare. For he that kéepes theſe ſort of beaſtes, muſt ſerue them at the ſame houre, when they are deſirous, or when they doe enter into the fierce and hotte deſire of the horſe, which is (as <hi>Hippomanes</hi> ſaith) a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome) becauſe it inflameth both men and beaſtes, and to haue the like rage in loue as the horſes and mares. For
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12686:55"/>
mares maie conceiue of themſelues, without the company of the horſe, as without doubt it is moſt true, that in ſome countries, the mares be ſo great heate, and deſireth ſo to be couered, that although they haue not the horſe, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe in thinking and deſiring ſo muche the horſe, they burne ſo within themſelues, that in thinking thereof, they become with foale. Like as the birdes of houſes, as Cockes to laie egges, and hennes to laye egges without the Cocke. And as the Poet <hi>Virgill</hi> in his thirde booke of <hi>Georgiques</hi> ſaith thus:</p>

                  <p>Alſo it is moſt true in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy mountains of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which lieth towardes y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> occident ſeas. Many genets &amp; young mares <note place="margin">Couering mares.</note> haue colts, without the couering of the horſe, which coltes they do nouriſh &amp; bring vp, and yet they are vnprofitable, for within 3 yéeres when they ſhould be at perfect grouth, they die. But as touching the couering of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mares, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> méeteſt time is about the moneth of March or April, then let the young mares be ſatiſfied of their natural deſire, &amp; the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> yéere to kéep the horſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, &amp; to ſeparat y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great ſtalions apart, it ſhalbe beſt, becauſe they ſhal not couer when they would: but to kéepe them to couer, when the beſt time is, and ſo it ſhalbe better, ſo that ye haue paſture for them, and let them be farre from the mares, or els to kéepe them ſtill in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vntil the time of couering your mares, againſt which time they ought to be well nouriſhed, and fed with barley, &amp; dried peaſe, to make them more luſtier. For whereas a horſe is weake in couering, ſo much weaker ſhal the colt be in growing and might. Some doe make the horſe therefore as luſtie as he maie be, whereby he may the better endure to couer many mares within a ſhort time, and yet not to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aboue xv. or xx. mares, nor to beginne before hee is of thrée yeeres olde: for then he will better continue till twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres, and moſt commonly they are found good, if the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:12686:56"/>
horſe be then ſtrong, and haue reſt. But if he be feeble and weake, ye muſt then rubbe the nature of the mare with a ſpounge, and put it into the horſe noſtrels, and if the mare will not ſuffer the horſe to couer her, yee ſhall bruſe the ſea onion, cald ſquilla, and with that all to rub the ſecrets of the mare, and that ſhall put her in more heat. And ſometimes they let an other horſe leape on the mare, to bring her in more heat, and takes him of againe by and by, and then put the other horſe vnto her and ſo he couers her. Now after ſhe haue taken and is with fole, ye muſt haue a great care for hurting of her, and not to labour her ſoone after her coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <note place="margin">Gouernment of the mare with fole.</note> or when ſhe is nie foling. But to nouriſh her well ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in both the ſaid times. If ye haue not graſſe in winter, ye muſt ſtable her, for ſhe féede twaine. Let her not runne, or trauaile ſore, nor ſuffer any great colde, nor yet to keepe her in any ſtraite or narrow place, or cloſe ſhutte vp, that one hurt not an others belly. For al theſe afore ſaid do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make them bring forth dead coltes. Alſo the ſnuffe of of a candle hold it at her noſe, will make her caſt her colt, or when ſhe longeth not to giue her deſire. Alſo if the mare fole in traueiling, or haue a dead colt, ye ſhall ſtampe <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podium</hi> rootes, or oke ferne, and mixe it with warme wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and giue it her with a horne. But if ſhe haue folde well and the colt faire, touch not the colt with your hands, for by touching it neuer ſo little (being yet but tender) ye may ſoone hurt it. Ye muſt alſo haue a care to ſée it laid warme, and to order the damme ſo as ſhe may haue ſpace inough about her, for the tender colt may ſoone be hurt by the dam if ſhe ſhould chaunce to lye on it. So by little and little ye may bring it abroad with the mare, and take heed that dung hurt not his hoofes: and when he is of more ſtrength, ye may then let him féed continually with the dam, becauſe ſhe ſhal not haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſée her colt, for commonly a mare will become ſicke for loue of her colt, if ſhe ſée it not. Good and luſty mares do bring coltes yearely, and the great and faire mares, ought not to haue coltes but from two yeare to two yeare, to the end (by long ſucking) the coltes may waxe and grow more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12686:57"/>
ſtronger, and thereby they will be the better to trauel, when any ſhalbe put to ſerue in the field.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the ſtallen muſt not be younger then thrée yeares when he couereth a mare, and ſo he may continue vnto xx. yeares well: and the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e may beare well at two yeares, ſo that when ſhe is of iii. yeares ſhe ſhall nouriſh well her colt, but after ſhe is x. yeres, ſhe is not ſo good. For commonly an olde mares colt wilbe heauie in labour, weake, and ſoone wearie. If ye will ſhe ſhall bring a male colt, or female, for the male, when the horſe doth couer her, ye muſt bind backe with a cord or plucke backe his left ſtone, and for the female <note place="margin">Mares, for male &amp; female</note> bind backe the right ſtone of the horſe, and thus yee may do vnto all other kind of cattell.</p>
                  <p>After the colt is folde incontinent ye may iudge what hee wilbe: if he be wel fold, then tractable and ſure of foot, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">Tokens of a good colt.</note> at the noiſe of any thing, full of play and ſwift, hauing a ſhort rumpe, more proper then other are of his age. If hee will leape out of a hole without reculing back. If he will by the way paſſe boldly ouer bridges and riuers. Alſo theſe are the ſignes in a good colt, hauing alſo the beautie &amp; good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the body, as to haue a leane ſmall head, blacke eies, wide noſtrels, ſhort eares, and ſtraight, the chyne of his back large and ſoft, and not long, his mayne thick hanging on the right ſide, a large breaſt and open, with ſtrong muſcles and ſinewes, his ſhoulders large and right with round ſides, his backe bone euen, his belly gant, his ſtones and codde cloſe &amp; ſmal, his raines large deſcending, his knées round &amp; ſmal, not turning inward, his legs right and ſtraight, his buttocks round, his thighes thicke and ſtrong, his taile long with big crumpled haire, his hoofes hard and high ſmooth and round, &amp; his fore top aboue very ſmal, &amp; al his body big, hie, &amp; ſtraight, and well in lifting his féet, faire to ſée in length, &amp; round ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his body. Alſo to be pleaſant and ſoone chaft, &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine gentle and méeke again, for theſe coltes of ſuch nature do ſoone obey the man, and wil patiently endure labor &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile. If a colt when he is folde do not caſt his milt, huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay he will not liue long, but die ſodainly in few yeares
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12686:57"/>
after, and ſome colt will caſt two miltes, no horſe that liues xii. yeares hath any milt within him. Alſo for the taming or breaking of a horſe colt when he is of two yeres he may wel be tamed and broken for the vſe of the houſe, but for the field or iourney, he muſt be of iii. yeres old. and then after iiii. hes may be taken to trauell, and looke alſo from time to time how the markes do change in his body. The age of a horſe is knowne by his hoofes, and taile, and barres in the ruffe of his mouth, but chiefely by his teeth, for a horſe of two yeres olde and halfe, wil caſt his two formoſt téeth aboue, and alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and when he is iiii. yeres, the téeth which we call dogges téeth fall, and ſo cometh other: and before the ſixt yeare, the great téeth or chewing téeth aboue do fall, and on the ſaide yeare, the firſt téeth that fell, are returned whole againe, and on the ſeuenth yeare all are filde vppe againe without hauing any hollownes in the teeth, and from the ſeuenth a man may not wel know of his age, yet about x. yeres his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will begin to be hollow, crooked, and withered. therefore ſome do take vp the ſkin to hide the ſame, and being old, his browes will waxe long, and gray haired, and his téeth grow long and blacke. Alſo when as your horſes are in health, and yet waxe leane, ye ſhal fat them ſoone with dryde wheat or barly, but ye muſt giue this like a maſh in wine or ale, and by little and little to make them haue continuall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, mixe therewith the branne of barly, vntill ye ſhall accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome them to eate beanes, and pure barly.</p>
                  <p>Alſo ye muſt ech day, chafe his body as ye do to ſome men, <note place="margin">Chafing his body.</note> in rubbing them vp and downe with a cloth, and often ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and rubbed, doth profit them much, and alſo to be lead and rubd with ones hand on the backe is better then to giue them much meat, for rubbing doth profit, preſerue, and kéep both ſtrength of body and legs, for fault of rubbing many ſoarnes growes on the legs of horſes in traueile, and this I will counſell you, if one lead his horſe in a raynye tyme from his labour into the ſtable, hee muſte ſee that the place bee drye, and that their hoofes bee not wette, or ſtande in colde wette places, for that both
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12686:58"/>
will cauſe them being hot, to founder, or to haue an ague. If the ſtable be well planked with oke, or if the earth bee often clenſed, and laid cleane ſtraw thereon, for horſes oftimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot, they catch diſeaſes, in being wearie and ſtanding on the cold ground, ſpecially when they are not ſtrong, then ſée the more vnto them: for when they ſweat, to giue them meat or drinke, doth hurt them, but when they are cold ye maye then without danger giue them meat or drinke, but after <note place="margin">Drinke or meat.</note> his drinke, ſturre him a little, and he ſhall do the better, and then ye may giue him prouender or other meat: and when they haue reſted long they chafe them ſodainely which is not good, and for your wearie beaſtes ye muſt let them reſt, and put of ſallet oyle into their throates with a horne, or freſh greaſe with wine: and againſt cold, ye muſt giue them thinges to vomit, and frote their heads, and ridge bone with wine or ſtrong ale, or greaſe melted and warme rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed thereon. If your horſe cannot piſſe, giue him oyle mixte with wine, and chafe him in the flankes, and on the raines. If that ſerue not, put or giue him garlicke with ale: alſo they ſay, to bruſe garlicke and rub his yard, is good againſt let of vrin. A péece made of hony and ſalte put into his yarde, or liue flies, or a little frankincenſe, or ſquirt the iuyce of beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into his yarde. Or giue him warme water, or waſh his yarde with warme vinegar. All theſe are good remedies when he cannot ſtale, or when his vrin burneth in the inner part of the bladder, or when he hath a hot water.</p>
                  <p>Alſo when a horſe hath paine in his head, ye may know it by dropping of his vrine, and in falling and flagging of his eares. His necke, and head, heauie hanging downward, and <note place="margin">paine in the head.</note> then ye muſt let him bloud on the vaine vnder the eie, and ſquirt into his noſtrels warme water, and that day giue him no meate, on the morrow faſting ye ſhall giue him warme water, and then ſome graſſe, and litter him well with olde haye, or ſoft ſtraw, at night againe giue him warme water, and ſome barly mixt with two pound of fetches, and ſo by little and little let him come to his ordinarie féeding, Alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt paine of the eie teeth, or grinding teeth, ye ſhall fume
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12686:58"/>
them with hot vinegar, and ſome do hold it to the téeth with a cloth on a ſtickes ende, and ſo rub them therewith. This is good alſo when there is any inflamation or ſwelling in them. Alſo if his ſhoulder be hurt, or that he haue loſt bloud, then ſhall ye open the vaine in the middle, betwixt his two fore legges, and rub his ſhoulder with the ſaid bloud, mixte with the fine powder of frankincenſe, but let not to much bloud for weakening him, and lay on the place his owne dung, and bind it faſt with ſome thing, and yee ſhall on the next day againe draw ſome more bloud in the ſame place, and vſe it as before, and then giue him no barly, but a little hay, and on the third day vnto the ſixt ye ſhall giue him in the morning vi. ounces of the iuice of leekes, mixt with a pound of ſallet oyle, and after the ſixt day then walke him a little, and lead him forth to ſome place to make him ſwim. Then do nouriſh him well after for a time, and hee ſhall doo well.</p>
                  <p>If your horſe is troubled with choller, his belly wil ſwell and wil be hot, nor he cannot then vent beneath, and then ye muſt rake him with your hand, and clenſe the naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits which are ſtopt, and take forth his dung, and ye ſhall giue him ſauin, ſtaueſaker, and ſalt boild and mixt together, in putting to a little honie, and miniſter it in at his tuel like a gliſter or ſuppoſitorie: which will moue and purge forth al the choller. Some do beat iii. ownces of mirre, with iii. pintes of wine and giues it with a horne: and to chafe and rub his tuell with tarre and olde greaſe. Other do waſh his belly with falte water of the ſea, or water and ſalte. As for other purgations, they do commonly giue in powders, and pilles, which muſt be giuen with good diſcretion, according to ech diſeaſe, his medicine. Which ye ſhal vnderſtand more thereof at large, in M. Blundeuils booke for horſes, howe and when to purge them, therefore I here paſſe it ouer.</p>
                  <p>Againſt the bots or wormes in the guts, when the horſe is troubled therewith, the ſignes are: he will oft wallow and lye downe for paine, and riſe ſodainly againe. Alſo hee will bow his head towards his ſide or bellie, and ſtampe with his

Some do annoynt them with oyle of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, or of Lentyles, or with nettle ſéedes, mixt with ſallet oyle, or the oyle of a whale, or the dropping of ſalte tunny: and chiefely the greaſe of a ſeale fiſh. But if the ſores be old, ye muſt haue ſtronger thinges, as to boyle of betony hearbe, and brimſtone powder, of ellebory, of pitch, with as much old greaſe, and with this they do heale all old ſores, in racing them firſt with a ſharpe yron, and then to waſh them with piſſe, and ſo to annoint. And ſometime if it bee feſtred, to cutte it to the quicke, and then to drawe it with medicines, as ſhall be made with tarre and oyle, or ſuch like which will cleneſ and fill agayne the place, and when the haire ſhalbe full againe and cloſed full with haire, then it ſhall be good to chafe the place with ſoote of a cawdrone, and butter. and to heale a nauelgall, or ſore backe, take ſoote of a chimney, and yeſt mixt together, and plaiſter it therwith, which wil heale without any other thing, in ſhifting it once a daye. For riſing of the ſkinne or rayſing thereof. Take two great onyons, and boyle them in water, with hounds tongue hearb, then being hot, take a pound of ſalt, and mixe it with ſtrong vinegar, putting therein the yeolke of an egge,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12686:60"/>
then mixe all together, and rub the place therewith, and ye ſhall ſee the experience. And for his backe that is chopt and ſwolne, ye ſhall firſt waſh him with piſſe hot, then annoint him with freſh butter, and lay theron a little hay wet in cold water, and ſo clap your ſaddle thereon, and let him reſt ſo al that night, or annoint it with butter, then put on the wette hay, and your ſaddle. Some clap theſe to hot, horſe dung, &amp; then the ſaddle, but take the groundes of ale or beere, and boyle it wel with mallowes, and clap it hot: but if the ſkinne be through chaft, ſo that it do water and is very moiſt, yee ſhall haue ready in a bagge filde with the powder of bryer leaues finely beaten, and put a little of that thereon, and it will drie it, by the morning, ond it will heale it alſo, without other thing. Alſo for ſore eies which may be heald with the meale of wilde tares, cald oreb.

Alſo for a ſore eie, take ſtrong nettles, do ſtampe them and ſtraine them with beere, and ſquirt thereof into his eie twiſe or thriſe, then blow in a little powder of ſandiuer, and let him take no colde of his eie, till it be hole. If ye muſt needes ride him after, it were good to kéepe a cloth before his eie, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the wind, and it were good to let him bloud vnder the eie, and then dreſſe him once or twice, and it ſhall ſuffice: for bloud in eies take the white of au egge, and clap it to, or the iuice of Selandine to annoint, and it is good againſt anye ſtroke, and alſo it is good to make a toſt of bread and dippe it with white wine, and clap it to his eie, and vſe it often, or to let bloud vnder his browes: and to kéepe the flies from his eie, or other ſore, ye ſhal melt tarre and oyle, or tarre &amp; hogs greaſe together, and ſtrike thereof all about.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes a horſe wil caſt bloud at his noſe, which doth weaken him much, and is gotten by ſome ſtraine, or ſuch

                  <p>Sometimes a horſe will looſe his taſt, which cometh of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The remedy is: Take iiii. ownces of the ſéeds of <hi>nigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lromana,</hi> beat with vi. ounces of oyle oliue, mixt with a pint of wine, and make him to ſwallow it downe. The diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vomit: they vſe to take it awaye, in making them often to ſwallowe a beaten head of garlicke, with thrée parts of wine.</p>
                  <p>Againſt appoſtumed or peſtilent ſores, it ſhall bee good to pearce them with a hot yron, rather then with a colde, then plaiſter it with healing medicines. <note place="margin">Peſtilence in mares.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo there is a peſtilence, which cauſeth mares ſodaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to waxe leane, and ſo pine awaye. If anye ſuch do happen, ye ſhall put in their noſtrels foure pintes of Fiſhe brine, called garume. If the griefe be great, they take ſixe times ſo much, and this will make them to purge and caſt out al flegme at their noſtrels.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes mares will be in a rage, but not often, which is to be noted, how that ſometimes they happen to be in a hot rage, that is: when they ſée their image in the water, they <note place="margin">Mares in a rage.</note> are ſodainely taken with loue, in ſo much that then they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to drinke or eate, and in ſo burning doth become drie. The ſignes are, when ſhe runneth ouer the paſtures as ſhée were chaft or beaten, and looking oft about her, as though ſhe deſired ſomething.</p>
                  <p>They vſe to heale this folly, in leading her to the water againe. For when ſhe ſhall ſée her ſelfe in the water as ſhee did before, ſhee doth ſodainely forget her firſt image that ſhe ſawe: and this is often among mares. Thus will I here leaue a little of them, and ſpeake ſomewhat of moiles and their natures.</p>
                  <p>Who ſo hath a deſire to nouriſh aſſes and moyles, they ought diligently to ſearch for the fayreſt and beſt males,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12686:61"/>
and likewiſe the females to beare coltes, for if they bee not both well diſpoſed, thoſe which ſhall come of them ſhall nothing preuaile. Ye muſt therefore chuſe the mare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tenne yeares, and to be large and faire, and well mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, to abide trauaile: and let her beare eaſie burthens for hurting the ſéede within her belly, and not to be one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of body, but good alſo of ſpirite and ſtomach, and when the ſéede is long or it take life within her body, or being long ere ſhe fole, ſcarſly about the ende of xiii. moneths, is a token of ſome let. Notwithſtanding the moile colt taketh moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the aſſe that begat him, rather then after the life and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his dam, and yet ye ſhal not find it true in all mares, no more then is properly in all horſes. For ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth deceiue a mans iudgment in him which hee chuſeth. For oftentimes ſtallions of their owne nature and race, are marueilous in condition and forme. And whereas the mares are but ſmall and faire, commonly they bring more males then females. Neuertheleſſe the coltes do increaſe or diminiſh after or according to their dammes. Some ſtallions are ill to ſée to, and yet ſhall be great coltes of great price. And ſome do yéeld a worthines vnto the fruit, more then other ſome. But they are more colder and not ſo hotte of deſire, and are not ioyned in loue but verye hardly with the mare. And theſe ſort of ſtallions muſt haue mares of the like nature: For the like nature is more familiar to conceiue then others. Yet the aſſe neuer begets an aſſe, nor the moyle neuer begets moyles: and for this cauſe they do often ſuffer the ſtallions to mount on the mares, to put them in more heat, and to take them ſodainely away againe: Which ſhall make the horſe to be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the mare, which before he little paſt of, and this is to be noted by the way, thoſe which haue their kidneys hotte, are alwayes more deſirous, then thoſe which haue their ſtones and kidneys colde, which is as well in man, as in beaſtes.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſorte of ſtallions which are in a rage
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12686:61"/>
in their fierie heate, which are ſo diueliſh and frowarde, that thereby they are ſoone marde, if they be not wiſely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned and handied. And often they breake their halte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rs and cordes in gnawing and eating them a ſonder, and leapes on mares with fole, in byting them by the necke and backe.</p>
                  <p>Now to correct ſuch, ye muſt put them into a horſe myll, and there to make him ſure, and vſe him a little to labour <note place="margin">Hot ſtallion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> gently, and ſo ye ſhall make him to leaue his furiouſnes. So when he hath left it, yet thereuppon let him not bee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to couer vntill hee bée in ſufficient heat thereunto. For this is of greater importaunce, that the ſprite of theſe beaſtes are naturally heauie and ſléepie. But by moderate exerciſes they will be the more liuelyer to trauaile, and then ye may let them couer, that by the ſecret efficacie of hidden nature, their fruit maye bee the more pleaſenter. Alſo a moyle doth not ingender with a ſhe aſſe, or mare, but a ſhe aſſe with a horſe, or a wilde he aſſe with a mare. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine authoures which I will not hide, as <hi>Marcus Verro,</hi> and before him <hi>Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Mago,</hi> haue ſayde, that in Africke there is no maruaile, or yet a monſtrous thing to ſée their moyles to beare, no more then the mares in this countrie. The moſte fayre and largeſt cattell among all moyles, are thoſe which are begotte of aſſes, and maye well be compared vnto thoſe which are gotten of wilde aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. If it were not that they are ſo troubleſome, wild, and hard to gouerne and rule, like vnto their ſires, there were none like them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore thoſe ſtallions that ſhall come of that race, ſhall be better, and ſo from time to time alter. For if yee rouer a mare with a horſe that was begotte of a wilde aſſe, or tame, he ſhall kéepe their bigneſſe and modeſtye like their ſier, with like ſtrength and age vnto theyr firſt race. And thoſe which are gotten betwixt a horſe and an aſſe, ſhall beare the name of theyr parentes, as to ſaye horſe moyles: For they will reſemble lyke vnto theyr dammes. Therefore if it better to haue moyles
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12686:62"/>
of an aſſe ſtallion, which by experiences come of a good and fayrer race, then otherwiſe. Hee muſt bee choſen great of <note place="margin">Beauty of moyles.</note> body, with a ſtrong neck, his ſides long &amp; large, with an open and a large breaſt, and ful of ſinewes, his thighes fleſhye, his legs well truſt and blacke of colour or ſpotted. The aſſes are commonly of a mouſe dun coloured haire. But that is not a pleaſant haire for a moyle: Therefore in generall it is good to take good heede thereof, that ye be not deceiued by your eye, for euen like as we ſhall ſée the fleece of a Lambe, which cometh of a ram with a ſpotted tongue, ſo likewiſe, the aſſe hath haire of diuers colours on his browes and eares, and thereby often they make the moyles of diuers colours: Therefore when ye haue diligently conſidered of your ſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, yet neuertheleſſe ye may be deceiued, for beſide theſe foreſaid markes, ſometimes they haue moyles by other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured horſes which they know not, and yet the ſame maie be as well eſteemed as other, which comes of no other cauſe but from their firſt parentes, and generation, which by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with others hath bene almoſt deſtroyed, and yet by the ſéede of the horſe is renued againe to his firſt eſtate. And the aſſe which I do write of, as ſoone as ſhee hath foled, it ought to bee taken away from her, and priuily to bee ſet to the mare which hath a colte, ſo that ſhe know not thereof, which muſt be done in the night, and ſet in a darke place. But firſt take awaie the mares colte, and put to the other, but in ten daies ſhe wil not let it ſucke, therefore ye muſte helpe it in the meane time, the one as well as the other, as yee ſhall cauſe. Or elſe take the vrine, or milke of the one, and rubbe the coltes therewith contrarie, and at length they will loue and vſe them for their owne. And this young ſtallion colt ſo nouriſhed of the mare, ſhal take a loue vnto mares herafter. And though oft times they be noriſhed with their Dammes milke, yet being but young, and hauing the vſuall company among mares daily, hee will thereby the better loue them, and ſo will he ſerue well your mares, but let him not couer them before hee bee three yeares <note place="margin">Couering of young mares.</note> olde. And at ſuch conuenient times, as graſſe may feede
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12686:62"/>
him well, and ſometimes with ſheues of barly, ſometimes of good maſhes to drink of branne and wheat: or of wheat ſed, or barly ſodde, and let him not firſt couer a young tender mare, which hath neuer bene couered before. For in the mounting on her, ſhe will often ſtrike him with her feete, and thereby he will take it ſcornefully, which ſhall make him to caſt a continuall hate to all other hereafter, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they put ſome other vnto the young mare to put her in a heat, and not to couer her, but with him. And when yée <note place="margin">Place to couer</note> ſhall ſee her deſirous to ſtande, then take him awaye, and put to the young ſtallion and let him couer her. Alſo it ſhall be good to haue a place made with boordes deſcending downewarde before, that ſhee maye the better take the horſe, and not flye aſide, or turne from the horſe when hee couereth her. Some doo manacle her fore feete to the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on both ſides. And by this deſcending place, a lowe aſſe, or horſe maye couer her the better, and more eaſier. And after being thus couered with an Aſſe, or other Horſe, then in the yeare after that ſhee haue folde, yee ſhall not by and by couer her againe with another, but in that yeare let her nouriſh her fole, which fole ſhall be the better hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to doo anye purpoſe: therefore let her not be couered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſo ſoone. And when that colte is a yeare olde, take him from his damme, and put the mare in ſuch paſtures as you ſhall ſeeme good, in woods or in mountaines, to harden her hoofes, whereby ſhee maye the better trauaile hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And alwaies he moyles are better to beare the pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaddle, then then the ſhee moyles, yet ſhee moyles are more quicker, and nimble, and moſt méete to bring coltes: But they are both good to trauaile with the burthen, and alſo to labour the earth, if it were not that theſe kinde of cattell are ſomewhat to hygh for that purpoſe. Therefore common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye they vſe a temme of Oxen to breake the groundes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>And for the burthen ſome do ſaye a mare is weaker then a gelded horſe, &amp; a gelding weaker then a ſtoned horſe, and a horſe weaket then a moile. For the moiles commonly (as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12686:63"/>
they ſay) wil carry v. or vi. hundreth weight, and therewith they will trauaile thirtie miles a day. For both horſe and moiles are beaſts of a great ſtrength, if they had vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no man ſhould be able to rule them, and alſo they ſaye a horſe or moyle hath no braines, but in the place thereof, he <note place="margin">Horſe without braines.</note> hath as it were a bladder filde with winde, and no braines therin, or other thing, but like a white water. Thus I leaue of horſe and moiles, and here I will ſpeake of the ordering of horſe in trauaile.</p>

The which ſtable ought to be made cleane euery morning, for a horſe loues to be cleane kept, and at night to be refreſhed with ſome clean litter, and the horſekeeper ought to ſleepe in the ſtable: to be ready if any horſe break looſe in the night and fight with his fellow. The keeper ought alſo to looke aduiſedly &amp; warily vnto his candle, and to place it in the ſtable out of al danger, and nightly to hang vp his harneſſe for feare of dogges, or rattes, or other dangers of hurting with horſe, and to place them as afore is mentioned, and to haue them ready againſt the morning when he ſhould goe forth to labour them: that he ſlack not the time in ſeeking his harneſſe in partes. And when any horſe is ſicke or ſeeme heauie, then to forbeare, &amp; not labour him for that time, for feare leaſt he waxe worſe. For in ſickneſſe a horſe is a very tender beaſt and heauye to any labour, therfore whenſoeuer ye haue laboured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, walk them after for taking cold til they be in good temper, then truſſe them with ſtraw (as aforeſayd) for taking colde.

                  <p>Here I wil returne &amp; ſpeake ſomwhat of remedies againſt ſoreneſſe as comes oft times to horſes.

                     <hi>Garum,</hi> which I take to be ſaltfiſhe water with a pound of oile oliue mixed together, and put it into his left noſtril, and put there vnto the whites of three or foure egges. And ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they doe launce their eies, and ſometime ſeare it with a hotte yron, and if the blood be deſcended downe into the feete. They cutte it, as the founder of a horſe, &amp; they giue him bearefoote hearbe to eate, &amp; <hi>Hyoſciame,</hi> called henbane, the ſeede is good alſo to be bruiſed and giuen with wine. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the leanneſſe in a horſe, giue him often drinkes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed with halfe an ounce of brimſtone finely beaten, with <note place="margin">Leanneſſe in a horſe.</note> a rawe egge, and a peny weight of the powder of mirre, mixe al with wine and giue it with a horne. Which is alſo good againſt pains of the belly, and for the cough: alſo againſt leanneſſe there is nothing better or ſo good, as thrée leaued graſſe giuen, betwixt gréene and dry, which doth alſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily fat him more than other hay, and yee ſhal giue of this but little at once. For it wil encreaſe too muche blood in the horſe, and thereby he maie ſonne take hurt. Alſo when a moyle or horſe is wearie and ſore chafed, ye ſhal caſt a péece of greace into his mouth and make him to ſwallow it, and <note place="margin">Weary and chafed.</note> giue him ſoma wine or ale therewith.

                  <p>The hoof bound or matelong is when a horſe is pinched or <note place="margin">Hoofe bond, or mate long.</note> bound in the vpper part of the hoofe, it wil make the ſkinne to ſtare aboue the hoofe, and to grow ouer the ſame, It will payne the hoofe ſo that he cannot well ſuffer to treade full on the grounde, and wilbe hotte, it commeth by ſtanding drie in the ſtable, and by ſtraight ſhoing, or heat.

Uſe him thus thrée or foure daies, and lette him ſtand on the ſore legge, &amp; this is good alſo for any ſprain in that place.</p>
                  <p>If your horſe be ſprainde of ſome ſinew, yee ſhall then waſhe him with the groundes of ale or beere made warme, <note place="margin">Sprainde.</note> and therewithal to bathe him, in ſtriking it downwarde, then binde him rounde with a hay rope ſodde therein, and binde him from the fetterlocke vp to the hamme, and let it reſt all one night thereon.

If anie horſe haue it, auoyd him at the firſt, if he can: for dangering all the other. This ſoreneſſe commonly comes of a corrupt bloud and humour ingendred in the bodie, and ſometimes it comes of bruiſed bloud by ſome ſtroke, or of ſome galling or byting with ſome other horſe, or of tickes, or hogge lice (as ſome doe ſay.) The cure, let him blood on the vayne nigh to the ſore, then burne euery bunch in pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them vp with your hand to burne them the better, and leaue none vnburned. Then annoynt them euery day with melted hogges greace, till they fall away, then haue readie a pottle of olde ſtale, and boyle it a little with ſome coperas and ſalt, and a handfull of ſtrong nettles, and therewith warme, waſhe all the corrupt ſores, then fill eche hole with the powder of flacked lime, doe thus once a day til y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hoales are cloſed vp. If anie doe ranckle more than others, fil thoſe with verdegreace. In all this time let him haue a ſmall diet of meate, as ſtraw and water, or ſometimes a loafe of bread, for the lower, he is kept the ſooner he is whole, and yoke his necke that he licke not his ſores, alſo the leſſe reſt hee hath, the better for him. Another remedie, take of miſtleto, and ſtale piſſe, hony, blacke ſoape, ſeeth theſe altogether, &amp; once a day warme, waſh your horſe all ouer therewith. Uſe this fine or ſixe dayes and yee ſhall ſee experience. Another: let him bloud in the necke foure fingers from the head, and alſo on both the ſides, and giue him this drinke. Take a gallon of fayre water, and put therein a good handefull of rewe, and a ſpooneful of hempeſeed, and bruiſe them in a morter altogether, and ſéeth it til the halfe be conſumed, and when it is cold, giue it him to drinke, and this wil make him whole. Another, a very perfect medicine, ye ſhall cut him two ynche long downe in the forehead, and open it in the mids thereof on both ſides two ynches, and put therein a tampin made of the inner rynde of Elder barke, and looke it lye croſſe the cutte, for ſo it will deſtroye all the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed humor in his bodie, and it will heale him ſafe and ſound.</p>
                  <p>For a horſe that cannot ſtale, giue him a pint of wine

or ale mixed with garlick, &amp; the whites of ten egs, &amp; if ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for a while giue him nothing but gréene graſſe.

Alſo wormewood, or ſouthernwood, or galingale, or mallowes, or pimpernel, ſome of theſe, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie one of theſe ſtampt with ale, and giuen, wil cauſe him to make water. For the haw in the eie comes oft times of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, or it may bréede of ſome ſtripe, A ſinguler remedy is: to make a plaiſter of the iuice of ground Iuie, ſtampt in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Haw in the eie.</note> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the iuyce of Iuie berries, or of the leaues beate with cold water, but better with wine, and plaiſterwiſe lay it to, &amp; remoue it euening and morning.

                  <p>The King bone, is alſo an ill ſoreneſſe, it will appeare aboue the fore part of the hoofes, and ſome will be round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ioynt, the haire will ſtare, and riſe on a bunch, and there will reſort a thicke and a ſlimy matter, it cometh by ſome blow of ſome other horſe treading, or by ſtriking one legge againſt another, in proces of time it will become hard like vnto a bone, and it will make him to trippe and halte, and yee ſhall ſée it higher then the hoofe, if it grow in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the legges, then it is calde a knobbe, and no ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone. The cure: waſh it well with warme water, and ſhaue that place the haire cleane of, and race it with a ſharpe razor and make it to bléede. Then take an ounce of euphorbyum, halfe an ounce of cantaradice, and beat them in fine powder, and take oile of baies an ounce. If the griefe bee but ſmally growne, take the halfe of each, and boile them all together, in ſturring it well. And with a fether laie it boyling hote on on the ſore, and ſtir him not for halfe an houre, then let him be in the ſtable, and vſe him thus nine daies in ordering him as ye doo for the ſplint. Then when the haire begin to grow again, ye ſhal fier it in down ſtrokes with a hot yro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in iii. or iiii. places like lines, til the ſkin looke yellow, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paſturn to the hoofe, and then laye molten pitch, and rozen, on flockes of his colour, and ſo clap it to, and let it ſo remaine till it fall of it ſelfe away. Alſo ſome do ſay the ringbone cometh of a bloud in a young horſe, which they helpe thus. They knit faſt a ſhoo makers threed aboue his knées, and let it ſo remaine for a ſpace, and that will ſtay the courſe of the bloud, if it come of bloud, but this muſt be done at firſt before it grow on the horſe foot. Of the foundring of a horſe, there is a foundring in the bodie, by eating ſodainly to much prouender afore he is colde, after his trauaile, which for lacke of digeſtion do bréede ill humours, and taketh awaye his ſtrength, and thereon he will be ſo féeble, ſcant able to ſturre his iointes, or being downe, not able to riſe, ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with paine not able to ſtale.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:12686:74"/>
There is a foundring for a horſe to ſtand ſtill in the ſtable, and not ſturde. There is alſo a foundring, in letting your horſe drink by the way when he is hot. A ſaying is: ride him in the water but to the paſture, and let him drink being hot, he founders, ride him to the knées, he founders not, ride him to the belly, he founders, which comes by ſodaine cooling in his bodie, which cauſeth a watriſh humour to fall downe to his legs and feete, and will make him caſt his hoofes. Some do founder but afore, and ſometimes on all foure feet: and ſome ſay a horſe may be foundered in traueiling on hotte ſandy waies, and ſodainely to ride him but through a ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low water, ye may founder him alſo, by taking cold after a great heat, or by ſtanding ſtil on the ſtones or cold ground, he being hot, or in a cold wind.</p>
                  <p>The foundring in the bodie, the ſignes are theſe, his haire will ſtare, he wil ſeeme chylly and ſhrinke together of all foure, hanging downe his head, forſaking his meate, with quaking after his drinke, and within three or four daies hee will fal a coughing. The beſt remedy is to purge him, by ſome gliſter, or by purging otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>The foundering in the féete, the ſignes are, he will (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in xii. or xxiiii. houres after) crouch on his hinder legges, and <note place="margin">Foundring in the feet.</note> his fore feet wil be ſo ſtiffe, that he is not able to moue them, and go as though he could not well tread on the ground, and readie alwaies to ſtumble. Then ſhall ye immediately garter ech legge a handfull aboue the the knée or hough hard with a liſt. Then walke and chafe him to put him in a heat, and when he is warme, let him bloud on both the vaines on the breaſt, and kéepe the bloud, and take a quart or two of that bloud, with two quartes of wheat flower, halfe a pound of bole armeniac, halfe ſo much of <hi>ſanguis draconis,</hi> with fiue or ſixe egges, and a pint or more of ſtrong vinegar: then mixe them well al together, and chafe al his ſhoulders, back, loynes, breaſt and fore legges therewith, and then walke him on ſome hard ground, and let him not ſtand ſtill: and when all the geare is drie, ye ſhall chafe him with more, and renew it againe, and ſo walk him three or four houres after,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:12686:74"/>
and then ſet him in the ſtable, and giue him a little warme water mixt with ſome malte, and giue him ſome haye and prouender, and then walke him againe either within the houſe or abroad if it be not to colde. And thus ye ſhall vſe him for foure dayes, and when all your oyntment is ſpent, then cloth him warme and let him ſtand and ly warme, and let him eate but little meat for iiii. daies.</p>
                  <p>If he mend not then, it is a ſigne the humour is in his féet, then muſt ye take of his ſhooes and ſearch with your buttres and pare his ſoles afore in the middeſt of his toes, till the water and bloud come forth, and ſo let him bléed well therat. Then ſtop it with hogs greaſe, ſalt, and bruſed nettles, or with turpentine, and hogs greaſe ſo melted together, and laid to with flaxe, and ſome do but ſtop his féet with ſtampt nettles, ſalt, and hogs greaſe, but firſt tacke on his ſhooes, with a lether, and then ſtop him, and put vnder the ſhooe a thinne péece of ſtiffe leather to kéepe in the ſtuffe, and let him run to graſſe, and then ſhift it once a weeke till he bee whole. If ye let him run a quarter, he will be the ſounder. Alſo ſome ſay, if ye let him bloud ſoone after he is foundred aboue his hoofes, that will helpe him from anie further dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Another way. Others do cut the ſkin on the inſides, or on the fountaine of his legs, the length of a finger, and filles a hollow ſtraw with quickſiluer, and make it flye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and ſo let him remaine till he be whole.</p>

They are ſmall grauely ſtones coming vnder the ſhoo, betwixt the foot and the calking of the ſhoo, or chruſhes, and by long trauaile it wil eate into the quicke. And whereas the ſhooe lyeth flat to the foote, there it will ſoone grauell, and wil not lightly forth againe, and it is ſoone mended at the firſt. The cure: ye ſhall pare the hoofe, &amp; get forth al the grauel cleane, for if ye leaue any grauell it will bréed to a ſorenes called aquitter bone, and then muſt ye ſtop him with turpentine, and hogs greaſe melted together, and laid on tow, or flaxe, then clap on the ſhooe, and keepe it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12686:75"/>
ſtopt, and ſhift it euery day till it be whole, and let him come in no wet. If ye ſtop it not wel to kéep down the fleſh, it will riſe aboue the hoofe, and then ſhal ye haue more buſines, and put your horſe to more paine.</p>

The cure. Take may butter if ye can, or els new freſh butter, with a quantitie of yellow rozen, as much naruoile, then fry them all together in a pan, and then let it ſtand till it be cold, and put it in a pot, and put to a little cow dung, and annoint therewith, and if ye bind it to, this wil heale the pricke of a naile alſo.</p>

Then ride him into ſome water vp to the belly, &amp; make him to ſwim if ye can in ſome riuer, or ride him déepe in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and turne and toſſe him therein, &amp; that will lay the heat of his yard.

                  <p>If there be any inflamation behind the eares, or that it grow to any inpoſtumation in that place, ye ſhall boyle the rootes of mallowes in water till they waxe tender, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bruſe them and ſtraine out the water cleane, and warme giue it vnto the horſe.</p>

very ſharpe, and made very hot, and therwith cut the ſwoln places in two partes, croſſe againſt the téeth, but if they bee but ſmally ſwolne, then cut but the third ranke from the téeth, and ſo let them bleed well, then rub it with a little ſalt, and let him go.</p>
                  <p>If a horſe do piſſe bloud, it cometh by ſome ſore ſtraine, <note place="margin">Piſſing bloud.</note> or ouer laden by ſome heauie burthen, or elſe being too fatte, or ſome vains broken. The cure: ye ſhall let him bloud, and boyle that bloud with wheat, and with powder of dride barke of the pomgarnets, then ſtrayne it and giue it hym to drinke, three or foure mornings, and let hym not trauell thereupon. And ſome do but let him bloud in the pallet or ruffe of the mouth</p>
                  <p>Alſo others do giue him of huſked beanes boilde with the huſkes of acornes beat ſmall and mixt therewith. Uſe this as ye ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>

The remedy is to runne him till he ſweate, then ſtraight waye drawe bloud in the pallet of his mouth, and ſo much as he bleedeth, let him ſwallow it downe hotte.</p>
                  <p>If he bite of adder or ſnake, yee ſhall take a liue cocke and cleane him in the middeſt, and all hotte clappe it to the wound. Some take but a pigin, and open her and clappe it to, and thereupon giue him drinke made with a pinte of ſtrong wine and ſome ſalte. Or take the roote and leaues and fruit of brionie burnt to aſhes, and giue vnto the horſe a good ſponefull thereof in a pint of good wyne.</p>
                  <p>Alſo if the horſe haue eaten in his meate anye henne or chicking dung, it will cauſe him to haue the bloudye fluxe, or the trenches, which is ſmall wormes, or a crowling in his bellye or guttes. Therefore kéepe poultry out of your ſtables, if ye loue your horſes.</p>

if ye can, let them drinke litle thereof. And againſt the hen dung, and drinking ſuch water, yee ſhall vſe to giue them quarterly, of the hearbe Angelica, and of Smallage, made in pouder.

                  <p>And when ſoeuer a horſe is in danger of the peſtilence called <hi>Phibula,</hi> they are preſerued by the ſeperating aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Peſtilence in horſes.</note> from that place.

It is a diſeaſe hard to know: but when one dyeth, there will ſoone follow another. Then the beſt is to ſeperate them. And to make them a drinke of bayberies, myrre, ariſtolochia, and gentian, with the ſhauing of iuorie: of each alike, made in pouder, and giue to each horſe a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thereof in a pinte of wine, or ale.

                  <p>The cure. Ye ſhall miniſter vnto him a gliſter, and rake him, and let him bloud on both ſides of the necke, and of the noſe. Some doe take ſaffron, and turmericke and mixe them with milke, and giues it warme. But firſt let him bloud on the noſe, or in the roofe of the mouth. And then put of the iuice of ſelandine into his eare, and binde it faſt and in twelue howers after, then ride him a litle, and then keepe him warme for two or three dayes

after, and let him haue white water warme, and this diſeaſe doth often bréede the ſtaggers.</p>
                  <p>The Staggers is an ill ſorenes to heale: It will make the horſe to hold downe his head: And alſo hee will reele to and fro, and forſake his meate, and this procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the yellowes, and of a corrupt humour in the brayne. His ſight will bee dimme, and hee will bee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie in going.</p>
                  <p>The cure. They do let him bloud in the temple vayne, and alſo cut the ſkinne on the fore toppe, and with a bucks horne doth raiſe it vppe towardes the head three fingers or more deepe. Then to melt turpentine, and hogges greaſe together, and dippe a tent of flaxe therein, and tent it therewith, and vſe this once a daye till it be whole, and make the like iſſue on his poll behinde, and giue him warme maſhe, and walke him ſoftly once a day.</p>
                  <p>Another. Ye ſhall put a ſponefull of the iuyce of ſelandine into one of his eares, and ſo bind it faſt, and ſo let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine and he ſhall mend.</p>
                  <p>Another. Put a little of white ſalte into his eare, and then put in after a ſponefull or two of fayre wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then knit faſt his eare that hee cannot caſt it out. This is a vſed medicine for this diſeaſe, and a moſt certaine helpe.</p>
                  <p>If anye horſe chaunce to bee gorde with a ſtake or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, yee ſhall take and caſt him, and open the wounde as much as yee maye.

                  <p>Alſo for the ſhooyng of a Horſe, mee thinkes it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenient <note place="margin">Shoing of horſe.</note> that the huſbandman ſhoulde vnderſtande ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thereof, although in manie places, they doe know better than ſome Smithes. For in moſt places of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande the Smithes haue ſmall ſkill thereof, but after a common ſorte: howe to ſhooe euerye Horſe as hee ought to bee, they knowe not. Which knowledge doeth conſiſt in diuers pointes, as in good ſtuffe, in making fitte, ſhooes for ouerye horſe foote, in driuing the nayles right, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the making thereof in paring, and leauing the hoofe where it ought to bee, alwayes hauing reſpecte therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For there is as greate a reſpecte vnto the paring, as in the ſhooing, becauſe of the diuerſitie of hoofes, for ſome bee rounde, ſome long, ſome ſhorte, ſome ſmooth, ſome rough, ſome tender, ſome tough, tome flatte, and ſome hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe: and broade hoofes commonly haue narrowe heeles, which will bee ſoone weake to trauell, or to carrie his ſhooe long: and in goyng lowe on his paſtornes, hee is apte to ſurbat and grauell. The rugged horſe is not ſo muche apte to ſurbat or grauell, but it is a ſigne of vntemperate heate, and drought, which makes the hoofes brittle. A long hoofe commonly treades on the heeles and paſtornes, which breedeth wyndegalles. A broade crooked hoofe without, and narrowe within, it makes him ſplayfooted, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more inward than outward: going with his ioyntes cloſe together, maketh him to enterfeere, and ſo become ſame. A broade foote inwarde, and narrowe outwarde is not ſo hurtfull, but on the outſide hee will ſoone grauell. A flatte hoofe not hollowe within, is like to a vnperfecte hoofe. A hollowe hoofe will waxe ſoone drye, and that cauſeth hoofe bounde. And the ſtraight, vpright,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12686:81"/>
and narrow hoofe, will waxe ſoone drie: except hee bee ſtopped, will ſoone bee hoofe bounde: which will cauſe hym to bee ſo lame, that hee cannot treade ſure. And whereas the fruſhes are broade, the heeles are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie weake and ſofte, ſo that yee maye eaſily cruſhe them together, and thoſe horſes will neuer treade well on ſtones, or harde grounde. And alſo where the heeles are narrow, they are commonly tender and hoofe bound.</p>
                  <p>The hoofe ought to bee pared euen, that the ſhooe maye fitte cloſe and iuſt thereon, not beeyng in one place <note place="margin">Faring the hoofe.</note> more higher than another. And becauſe the weight of the bodie afore lies moſt on the heeles. Therefore to fauour them, take as little as yee maye, but the toes beyng thicke and harde, may be taken the thinner, and the paring of the hinder foote, is cleane contrary to the fore feete: as afore is ſhewed in driuing the nayles, ſaying: before behynde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde before, which is, beware the twoo hindermoſt natles on the fore feete, and the two foremoſt nayles on the hinder feete.</p>
                  <p>In ſhooing the fore feete, make your ſhooes, with a broade webbe, and with thicke ſpoonges, meete in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Shoyng the fore feete.</note> ſomewhat appearing on the outſide of the ſhoe: And when yee naile or ſet on the ſhooe, ſpare not from the middes forewarde, but beware backwarde towardes the heeles, and yee ſhall pearce the heales wider on the outſide of the ſhoe, then on the inſide, and more diſtant from the toe, then the quarters, becauſe the hoofe is more thicker forewarde then backwarde, and more holde to be taken, the nayles woulde bee made ſtiffe with ſquare heades, and with ſharpe pointes, and meete at the head to fill the holes of the ſhoes, ſtanding a ſtrawe breadth without the ſhoe, and ſo will hée ſtande moſt ſure without ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and alſo will laſt longer. But that order moſt Smithes doe little regarde, but to diſpatche and awaye, and when they pearce a ſhoe, they commonly make the inſide as broade as the outſide, and theyr nayles are made with ſuche greate ſhoulders, they cannot ſitte well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

nor enter cloſe into the hoales, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The nayles alſo would be made flatter on the one ſide <note place="margin">Nayles to be made.</note> than the other, with a ſmall poynt, and ſtiffer ſtill towards the head, and when yee driue, ſtrike ſoftly firſt with a light hammer, till it bee well entered. Some doe greace the poyntes (for a tender hoofe,) to goe more eaſter, and firſt yee ſhall driue the two hoofe or ſide nayles of eache ſide one, then looke if the ſhoe ſtande right or not, with the ſpoonges right on the ſides. If not, mende it, and driue your other nayles, and ſette downe then his foote, to ſee if they bee all fitte and wel placed, and the horſe to treade euen thereon. If not, take vp his other foote to make him ſtande more ſtiffer thereon, and with your hammer ſtrike where the ſhoe is ſcanteſt, to make it yéelde that waie. Then driue al the reſt of your nayles, ſo that the poyntes on the hoofe maye come out euen and iuſt, not out of order like the téeth of a ſawe, and ye ſhal clinche, ſo as the poyntes mayebe hidde in the hoofe. Some doe cutte the hoofe a little beneath the nayles, and ſo doe clinche. Then ſhall yee pare and rape the hoofe rounde, ſo that it maie bee euen rounde with the ſhoe, which ſome ſuppoſeth to bee beſt.</p>
                  <p>By paring the broade hoofe, not yet fully growen flatte, it maie bee holpen by a ſkilfull Smyth, dy dyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <note place="margin">Paring &amp; ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great hoofe.</note> paring and ſhoyng, and at the toe, let hym take as muche as hee canne, but touche not the heeles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to make the ſhoe ſitte playne: yet lette the hoofe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtrong, and make your ſhoe with a broade webbe, and ſtrong, with broade ſpoonges, and from the tacks nailes to the heele, let the ſhoe appeare a ſtrawes breadth without the hoofe, ſette on with fiue nayles on the outſide, and foure within, becauſe hee weareth more outwarde

                  <p>To pare the rough and brittle hoofe, hee is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie weaker on the outſide, than the on the inſide: and <note place="margin">Paring the rough &amp; brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hoofe.</note> that is, becauſe they are commonly hoater than others, and their hoofes maie bee ſomewhat more opened, to bee the more eaſier ſtopped with Cowe doung, or to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt, to keepe them alwayes moyſt. If a hoofe bee rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the outſide, it woulde bee wrapped and made ſmoothe, and often to bee ſtopped or annoynted with neates foote oyle, or Turpentine, Sheepes ſuet, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let eyle boiled together, which will make it tougher, and to ſhooe a brittle hoofe, yee muſt make a meane ſhooe, not too light, nor too heauye.

For the ſhorter the hoofe is made, the better it is, and a long hoofe hath commonly a weake and ſlender legge. But a ſhort hoofe hath commonly a ſtrong legge, and the long hoofe hauing a weake legge, is forced moſt to tread on the heele, and on the paſtorne. Yee ſhal pare the reſt like the perfect hoofe, and yee ſhall ſhooe him as rounde as yee canne at the toe, whereby the breadth maie take vp the length. If his hoofe bee narrowe, let his ſhooe beare ſomewhat without the ſides, in making the heeles dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for eight nailes, and ſette the ſhooe backward enough, becauſe he treadeth muche on the heele, and it will bee the better.</p>

Alſo it haue béene often ſéene by negligent and vnſkilful Smythes, by paring and ſhooing, many horſes oftentimes haue taken hurt. Alſo by the vnſkilful and negligent kéepers, for want of rubbing their legges, and ſtopping their fore féete: for the hinder feet are commonly kept moiſt by meanes of dunglying at their héeles, and wette by their piſſing thereon. Whereas the fore féete ſtand commonly dry, which maketh them to bee hoofe bound, and brittle hooued. Therefore a good kéeper will ſée to ſtoppe them from time to time with cow doong, for that is beſt.

Then the maiſter doeth put a néedle with a double thread through the toppe of his eare, on the ſame ſide the haw is.

Then knits his thread againe, and ſaies to his man hold faſt, (for feare of ſtarting of the horſeꝭ, the néedle head may put out his eye.) Therefore to woorke ſure is beſt. Then the maiſter waites when the horſe turnes his eye, and when the ſaid haw is moſt ſéene, then hee catches holde thereof with his fore finger and thombe, and pluckes it foorth a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: and puts his néedle through the outer end of the griſtle, and ſo drawes it farther out by the threades ende: and then wrappes the reſt of the ſaid thread about his litle finger of the ſame hande, he puttes out the inner ſide of the griſtle which is towardes the horſe eye, and with a verie ſharpe knife, hee cuttes croſſe the griſtle, and eaſeth finely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſkinne and fatte thereof, on the ſaide haw. And alſo rounde about it, which is calde the waſhe of the eye: for if that bee cutte away, the horſe will bee bleare eide.

For of theſe beaſts cometh a yearely fléece, and are kept with ſmall trouble or any other great paine, but in kéeping them from cold in winter, daggin in ſommer, ſcabbe, bloud, and ſuch other inconueniences which cometh vnto them as well as any other catell.</p>
                     <p>Therfore muſt ye take ſome paine to ſée the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kept in fields &amp; paſtures as wel as in houſes. There is no man that loueth ſheepe but will haue a chiefe care of them, to vſe and order them as they ought to be, conſidering all the commodities y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comes by them, and to kéep their houſes cleane &amp; warme in winter, with their foldes alſo wel ſet and ordered in ſomer. The ſhepheard ought to bee of a good nature, wiſe, ſkilfull, countablo, and right in all his doings, wherein few is to bée found at this preſent. Specially in villages and towns: that by their idlenes &amp; long reſt, they grow new to wax ſtubborn and are giuen (for the moſt part) to frowardnes and euill, more then to good profit to their maiſters, and euil manered, whereof bréedeth many théeuiſh conditions, being pickers, lyers, and ſtealers, and runners about from place to place, with many other infinite euils. Which contrarie was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt ſhepheards of Egipt, &amp; other in their time, for they were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt inuentours of aſtrologie and iudgement of ſtars, and finders out of phiſicke, augmenters of muſicke, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liberall ſciences.</p>

the courſe of the ſtarres, the diſpoſition of times, and by long vſe in marking the ordered times and vnſtedfaſtnes of daies in ſuch ſort continuing that the ancient ſhepheards became people of great knowlege: As witneſſeth <hi>Hierogliphiques:</hi> and therefore al huſbands ought to haue a great care in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of good ſhepheards.</p>
                     <p>Shéepe (as wel as others) ought to be the firſt cattell to be looked vnto, if ye marke the great profite that cometh by them: for by theſe cattell wee are chiefely defended from colde, in ſeruing many waies, in couerings for our bodies. They do not onely nouriſh the people of the villages, but alſo to ſerue the the table with many ſortes of delicate and pleaſant weates: In ſome countries their milke doth ſerue in ſteede of furmentie, of which are the people of <hi>Scithia,</hi> cald <hi>Nomades.</hi> And alſo the gréekes do name them, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactopotes,</hi> that is to ſay, drinkers of milke: and for ſo much as theſe cattell are tender and delicate, as <hi>Celſus</hi> doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme. Therefore good heede muſt be taken vnto them for ſickenes, yet they are commonly in health, except at ſome times they are ſubiect to the murren ſcabbe, or peſtilence, in changing of groundes. Therfore they muſt be choſen agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the nature of the place where they ſhal remain, which is a rule meet to be obſerued and kept, not onely in theſe cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, but alſo in all other cattell of huſbandrie, whereof <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill</hi> ſaith:</p>
                     <p>All groundes for all thinges is not good, nor meete for all beaſtes to get their foode. For the fatte Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion and paſture fieldes is good to nouriſh great ſhéep: for leane ſhéepe and hoggerslles in cloſes. And ſheepe well fleſht, they ſhall do well in Foreſts, and mountaines, drye places, and playne commons: and all ſeuered cloſes are good and commodious to nouriſh all tender ſhéep, and to make them battle, and ſo to fatte well. There is a great reſpect to be had vnto the differences of nature, not onely in the ſortes and bréede of ſhéepe, but alſo of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and chooſing them, for experience doth ſhewe, as the ſheepe of <hi>Mileſie</hi> in <hi>Athens</hi> bee great, verye fayre, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:12686:105"/>
well eſtéemed. Alſo thoſe ſhéepe of <hi>Calabria</hi> and of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Tarent,</hi> and now theſe in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> be more eſtéemed and prayſed, and ſpecially the ſhéepe of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cello,</hi> and next vnto theſe, thoſe of the leane champains as be beſide <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Medena</hi> in <hi>Italie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo the white colour in ſhéepe is very good &amp; profitable, as we vſe here moſt in England: For of this colour a man may make many other. And the white will kéepe alſo his colour long. The blacke and the browne be alſo well prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which be much vſed in Italie at Pollentia, and alſo in high Spaine at Corube. The yellow ſhéepe bee in Aſie, the which they call red ſaſarned ſhéepe. Truly tha vſe therof we haue had alreadie by diuers and many experiences of thoſe kind of ſhéepe. For in Africa, where they are brought (from the towne called <hi>Gaditane,</hi> and there about) are wild rams of ſtrange and maruelous colours, with manie other kind of beaſts, which are oft times brought vnto the people to make paſtimes. <hi>Marcus Collumella</hi> ſaith, a man of a ſingular good wit and vnderſtanding, and verie perfect in huſbandrie, which brought one of thoſe Rams of Africke with him into Fraunce, and did put him in his paſtures, and when hee became gentle, he made him to bee put vnto his yewes, which ramme begat in the beginning all hearie lambs, and like in colour. But after that the ſaid lambs had beene couered againe once or twiſe, their wooli began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to be gentle, ſoft, and fayre. And at length thoſe lambs engendring with their ſhéepe, made their fléece and wooll as ſofte as gentle as ours. This <hi>Collumella</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that from the nature of the ramme, by the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the place and cattell, they became againe to their firſte eſtate. And by little and little, by good order and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their wilde natures be cleane changed. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diuers beaſts become ſoone gentle by well vſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in huſbandrie, which afterward they are found alwaies tame and gentle. Thus I leaue here, and and wil returne to my former purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>There be two ſorts of ſhéepe cattell, the better ſort is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:12686:106"/>
thoſe of the ſoft wooll, and the other the hairy wooll, and for to ſhewe howe to buy theſe twaine, there is many common rules, neuertheles, there is alſo particulars for the better ſort, the which ye muſt take good héed of.</p>
                     <p>The common rules to buy are theſe, when his wooll is white, faire, and long ſtaple, and plaine. Ye ſhal neuer chooſe a very white ram: and yet oftentimes a white ram will get a blacke lambe, but a yellow or blacke ram, wil neuer get a white lambe. Ye muſt not chooſe a ram by his whitenes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but when the pallace of his tongue is of the ſame colour of his wooll. For when either of theſe two do not agrée, the lambe is like to be blacke, or ſpotted in ſome part, as <hi>Virgill</hi> ſignifieth by theſe verſes. <note place="margin">Third booke of georgicks</note>

And ye muſt ſée that ye buy no ram nor other ſhéep that hath a thin ſtaple, or ſmall ſtore of wooll: And for the better knowledge to ſée that they be al of one colour, principally is to conſider in chooſing your rams, for the ſpotty rams wil commonly be ſéene in the lambs.</p>
                     <p>The rams are much eſtéemed when they are hye and long of bodie, with a large belly and couered wel with wool, <note place="margin">Rams eſtemed</note> his tatle long and thicke in wooll, his forhead broad, his coddes big, his hornes crooked or writhen: and yet theſe ſort of rammes are not the beſt.

Neuertheleſſe in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries moiſt and windie, they were better to haue the rams with great and larger hornes, then other without, becauſe it doth kéepe and defend the greateſt parts of their head from the winde and ſtormes. If the winter bee verye ſtormye in thoſe countries, they chooſe thoſe Rammes: but if it be calme and gentle, they take thoſe which haue no hornes. For the horned ramme hath this diſcomoditie, hée feeleth by nature each parte of his bodye ſo well armed, that hée deſireth nothing but to fight with other. And hee is more hotter after the yowes at all tymes, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate then others: So that he will not ſuffer anye other ramme to couer any troope of yowes, and he wil haue warre without cauſe againſt his fellowes, and will not permit or ſuffer them to couer anye yowe, although he can do no more himſelfe, and yet hee will haue all at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
                     <p>But he which is without hornes knoweth he is vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whereby he is not ſo readie to fight, and is alſo of leſſe heat: therefore ye may haue the more rammes. The good <note place="margin">Ram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now for to ſaue and keepe them, ye ſhal vnderſtand your ſhéepe houſes ought to be made low (like vnto a hogge ſtye) and more in length then in breadth, warme for winter, and not ſtraite of romes, for feare of hurting the lambes, paued and boorded on the ſides, and within the place (in deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) of their vrine and dung.

It ſhall be alſo good to make and ſet the houſe open towards the ſun at noone, and to be well couered, for theſe kind of cattell are tender and cannot abide any great colde.</p>
                     <p>Yet although they are houſed, they are oftentimes vext with cold, as reumes, glanders, coughes, and ſuch, &amp; ſo vexed with cold in witer, as well as with heat in ſommer, and afore or about their houſes, it were good to make a cloſe coa well and hye fenſed, ſo that they maye go forth of their howſes in ſafetye to refreſh them.

                     <p>They muſt alſo be kept that they haue no water or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moiſture, and that there be prepared of Fearne or drie ſtraw, for thoſe which haue lambes to reſt more cleaner and ſofter, and to ſée that the rammes goe not with the Eawes, or the lambes: nor goe with anie ſick ſhéepe or other beaſt, and it is better to let the lambes remaine in the houſe, than to goe with their dammes a field.

And among all cattle, theſe may be moſt eaſieſt bred in winter: if the countrey be not verie cold and wet.</p>
                     <p>If ye haue néed to haue many male Rams, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> a man of great knowledge of the works of nature, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth <note place="margin">Male lambes.</note> to be obſerued, and to ſpie out the méeteſt time to couple and put the Rammes to the yeaws: as in a drie time when the North winde bloweth. Then (ſaith he,) make the flocke to goe and féede againſt the winde, and putte the Rammes vnto them, and they ſhall haue male lambes, if ye wil haue your yeawes bring female lambes, put the Rams vnto them when the winde bloweth out of the South. And <note place="margin">Female lambs.</note> for to haue males likewiſe, they doe vſe to binde the lefte

ſtone downe with a tender band. And to haue females, they binde downe the right ſtone of the Ramme. This is done likewiſe in great Cattell. alſo when your yeawes haue lambde &amp; are ſtrong lambs, the ſhepheard that leadeth them to ſeeke their paſture, it ſhall bee good to leaue behinde all the young Lambes. And thoſe that doe ſucke, are méeter to bee ſolde to the Butcher, than thoſe that haue eaten graſſe, for they are more ſwéeter and delicate fleſhe, and when they are weaned, there commeth more profit by their milke, then when they goe with their Dammes, it is alſo good and profitable to nouriſhe them by the ſides of good townes.

And therefore it is daungerous, without yee furniſhe your ſtocke (from yeere to yeere) with the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Cattell, and thoſe that ſhall caſilie beare out the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Winter. And he that will followe this: hee ought to <note place="margin">to nouriſh ſheepe.</note> nouriſhe no Lambe vnder foure yeeres, nor aboue eight yeeres. For theſe two ages are not ſo good to nouriſhe, nor thoſe which come of olde Cattell, for they followe the age of their Parentes, or els are alwaies barren, wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and weake. The lambing of young yeawes ought to be looked vnto, as though they had midwiues: for theſe <note place="margin">Lambing time</note> Cattell trauelies in Lambing, as well as the woman in childe bearing, and often for ſo muche as they are ignoraunt of the time, they trauell more in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liueraunce of their Lambes. Wherefore the ſhepheards
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:12686:109"/>
ought to haue good knowledge and experience of medicines for theſe cattel, and to help them that haue néed thereof, and to take out the lambe wholly together out of the matrice. For when he lyeth croſſe, hee muſt not bee taken out, but if yee ſee ſhe cannot well bee delivered, yee muſt helpe the yeawe, and take and cutte it in peeces, and ſo take it foorth without hurting the birth or the yeawe. The which the Greekes doe call, an vnperfect medicine, then after when the lambe is taken foorth aliue, yee ſhall raiſe her and ſette her on her feete, And alſo the lambe, and then lette him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche vnto the tettes of the yeawe, and open his mouth and preſſe and make the milke come foorth, that hee maie bee accuſtomed therevnto. But before yee doe this, yee ſhall drawe the yeawe a little, which the heardinen doe call ſtroking, this is the groſſe and thicke milke, which is the firſt milke after her lambing, for if yee drawe not a little thereof, it will ſomewhat annoye the lambe. Then lette him (if hee bee weake) bee ſhutte vppe with his damme the two firſt dayes after hee is lamed, to the ende hee maie be kept warme, and to know the tette and his damme, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that hee beginne to leape and waxe more ſtronger: and to putte him in ſome warme cloſe place, then after to putte him with other lambes, becauſe in beeyng alone, hee will waxe leane by too much leaping and playing in his youth. alſo yee muſt aduiſedly putto the young lambes by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and not with the ſtrongeſt for feare in leaping and tumbling to hurt them, and when they are bigge, yee maie well ſuffer the lambes to goe a fielde with their dammes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till night, and when they ſhall waxe more ſtronger, then giue them graſſe in their houſes, with the herbe <hi>Mellilot,</hi> alſo of fine haye or branne: if barley bee good cheape yee maie giue your Lambes of the meale, and of fetches, and when they ſhall waxe yet more ſtronger, yee maie in the middaie remoue them with their dammes into other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and groundes, and alwaies ſee that your Lambes breake not foorth of your paſtures into other groundes, for then they will alwaie bee ſeeking to haue freſhe paſture.

And in ſommer it ſhalbee good to haue them vnder ſhadowie places, or trees in woodes, to the ende that by their reſting, they ſhall haue the better appetite, when they returne to their Paſture againe, and <note place="margin">Drinke,</note> they maie then drinke, whereby to feede the better. And alſo to auoyde their ſurfets. In Winter, ye muſt giue them haie in their rackes and tares, to nouriſhe them withall. They doe alſo feede them with Ealme leaues, and of Aſhe leaues and ſuche like, which is gathered in ſeaſons conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and in Autumne to feed them with haie of the latter ſeaſon. For that is more tender, and more pleaſaunter for them to eate, than other which is dryer, as that which is firſt ripe, the graſſe or herbe called Mellilot, is ſpecial good for them at all times, and likewiſe for all other Cattell.

If he doe not goe, he ought to ſtand, and to ſit ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldome. For the office of a ſhepheard is as a high watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for his cattel, to the end that the ſlow ſheepe doe not ſlip from the other. And on the plaines and meddowes when they make no haſte, then he may ſtaie. But in hard &amp; empty places of Paſture, the light and young ſheepe wil outgo the other, and therefore he ought to haue an eye alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt his ſheepe, or if anie complain by any other means to ſee them incominent remedied, and hee muſt ſee alſo in their paſturing they range not too faſte ouer the groundes, for the light and young ſheepe outgoe the other, and ſtraie abroade in corners, whereby they are in danger the more to be conueyed away, or loſt by ſome other means, or by killing with dogges and ſuch like, theſe rules are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with all cattel. Therefore he that will ſeeme to thriue by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he muſt ſee vnto them warily and wiſely from time to time.</p>
                     <p>Ye muſt not meddle them of a ſtrange kind with other of <note place="margin">Strange ſheep</note> your flocke, for thoſe being of a ſtrange kinde, they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſtand gazing about, and will rather ſeeke to flie then feed: or els looke on others. Therefore looke vnto them, for it is a ſigne they like not the Paſture or layer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they gaze, but wil ſeeke anew. Therefore the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard muſt haue a great care, &amp; vſe diligence vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:12686:111"/>
than the other. For all beaſtes of wool are more delicate and daintie than others, therefore they ought to haue the leſſe negligence with their keeper or maiſter, for they are of leſſe coueting than other cattell, and yet they cannot abide the heate in Sommer, nor the cold in Winter. Theſe cattel are ſeldome nouriſhed abroad without great danger, but in hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and cloſed paſtures, and are gluttons and greedy, that if his meate by ſome occaſion is taken away of others, thereby ſometime he wilbe ſick. Therefore ye ought to giue to euery ſheepe, which ſhalbee ſufficient of meate in their rackes for them in Winter, and to giue them in their troughes, of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley and beanes ground together, and alſo dried peaſe, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kornes ground and giuen with bran, and drie Elme leaues <note place="margin">Meate for ſheepe.</note> or others as aforeſaid, or of three leaued graſſe, greene or dry, or of the herbe Mellilot, or haie of the latter ſeaſon and ſuch like. Alſo there is but ſmal profit in ſelling the lambes being young, and leſſe profit in their milke, and they kill thoſe which they cannot wel nouriſh within a while after they he lambde, and thoſe yeawes which haue loſt their lambs, they make them to giue others ſuck, for they make a lambe ſucke to yeawes: and yet cannot draw forth her milke, becauſe her own lambe haue drawn more oftner, &amp; with more ſtrength, &amp; to that lamb which ſhe haue lambd nature in her do ſhew a more loue. But to the other, ſhe is but as a nurſe to a child, and leſſe giuen to nouriſh it, then her owne. Wherefore yee muſt obſerue and ſee to them all the time being but young, and to bee ſuckled of their dammes and other yeawes alſo. In this kinde of Cattell, it were better to nouriſhe and weane more of males then females. Although by cutting and gelding of them by vnſkilfull perſons, manie doe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and die thereon, for the females commonlie are of a more ruder wooll, as ſome doe ſaie. And againe before the male lambes be ready to couer the yeawes, they are gelded, and when they are paſt two yeeres, they are killed, and their ſkinnes are more deerer ſolde than anie other, for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their wooll. In <hi>Greece,</hi> they vſe to paſture their ſheep where as there is no buſhes or briers, for feare (as I haue
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:12686:111"/>
ſaid) that their wooll ſhould not be torne off their bodies: in plaine fieldes a man néede not be ſo carefull. (But here mee thinkes if I ſhould ſée my ſhéepe come with torne fléeſes, I may aſke my ſhepheard where they haue béen, in ſuppoſing their il gouernment, amongſt buſhes and thornes,) therfore he muſt be careful when they be in field, for all the day ſome doe not goe with them. And againe in the houſe hee ought to haue a more greater care in clenſing of them, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion not to be foreſlewd, in oft opening their wooll where as any place ſéemes loſe by ſcratches or other waies, and then to tarre it, ſome doe waſh the place with wine and oyle, ſometimes they waſh them all, if the day or time bee not too hote or cold, and doe vſe it ſo in ſome countries thrée times a yeare: and often makes cleane their houſes, &amp; takes away al the moiſture of their vrine, which is eaſie to be done in percing the bordes or plankes with an aulgar, or clenſing the pauements whereas they lye. And not onely to haue a care of their doong, but alſo to kéepe them beaſtes and veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous woormes. Whereupon the Poet <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaith:</p>

                     <p>FOr ſo much as I haue carefully written of the diligence which they ought to haue for the preſeruing and keeping their beaſtes in health, now I will declare how to helpe them with medicines, which are grieued with any infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie or diſeaſe. Howbeit, although I haue ſpoken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie of the moſte part of them, I will yet heere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate a fewe medicines for great cattell. For as the bodie is of great cattell, ſo is the bodies of the leſſer cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, almoſt of like nature. Euen ſo, there is ſmal difference betwixt their medicines, and betwixt their diſeaſes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles, whatſoeuer they are, I will not heere let paſſe or omit.</p>
                     <p>If it chance that all your cattell be ſicke, yee ſhall do as I haue afore commanded of great cattel. (Which I think to <note place="margin">Medicines.</note> be a thing neceſſary.) Euen ſo here I command again for a <note place="margin">Sicknes or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence.</note> ſingular remedy to change your paſtures, &amp; your watering places, and to driue your cattel into other paſtures far of. If that peſtilence or murreine do come by great heates, ye muſt haue them vnto couertes, ſhades, and colde places. If it come of cold, ye muſt haue them in open places againſt the ſunne. And ye muſt leade them by litle and litle, and not too haſtily, to the end by their ſoft going they be not grieued: nor yet too ſlowly but gently in a meane pace. For euen as they muſt not bee tormented by too much haſte, whiche are alreadie weary, and auoide with this diſeaſe. Euen ſo it is profitable to goe meanely, neither too faſt, nor yet too ſlow: hauing an exerciſe, and not to let them reſt or lye. And when yee haue brought them to the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place, yee muſt then parte them into many troopes or bandes, and ſo let them bee looked euer vnto, and beeing ſo parted, they are then in more ſafetie then euer they were before when they were togither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtrength and the infection of the contagious and

peſtilent ayre is not ſo great in a ſmall troupe of cattell, as in a great. And alſo it is more eaſie to heale a ſmal nomber then a great: therefore ye muſt doe this which I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to the end that ye doe not repent the more, when as they fall all ſicke togither. Or if there be any one which hath it, then doe as afore ſaid. Alſo ſhéepe are more tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſcabbe, then all other cattell, which commonly commeth as the Poet <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaith:</p>

                           <l>Whereby the ſcabbe, will then encreaſe,</l>
                           <l>Which ye may kill, with tarre and freſh greaſe.</l>

                     <p>Or when they begin to haue the itch, yee ſhal annoint him with gooſe greaſe and tar mixt well togither, with the tender crops of broome in may: ſtampt and boild with gooſe greaſe, &amp; put vnto your tar in like porcion. Then make but two ſheads on both ſides his back bone, from his head to the taile, and anoint with the foreſaid greaſe, and ye ſhall néede no more nointing if they be well vſed after, and kept from ſcratches. Alſo after ye haue ſhorne them, if ye doe not reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die them with the remedy and medicine aforeſaid: which is, to waſh them with ſea, or ſalt water, or in a ſalt riuer, and <note place="margin">Scabbe.</note> then ſhéere and rub them as aforeſaid, which is good againſt the ſcratches with briers and thornes, which wil otherwiſe grow to ſcabbes.

The which aſſoone as it hath taken them, they neuer ceaſe to ſcratch, bite, or rub the itching places, either with his mouth, féete, or hornes, or to rub againſt a trée, or other thing, which lice may cauſe alſo. If thou ſeeſt any one doe this, then take him, and open and ſhed his wool, and ye ſhall ſée there vnder the ſkin red, and ſcratched, or bitten with his mouth, therfore it muſt be ſodeinly remedied, to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the reſt be not infected with the ſame.

                     <p>Sheepe wil haue a ſcab, which ſhepheards call the pocks, <note place="margin">Pockes of ſheepe.</note> and it wil appeare on the ſkin, like red pimples or purples, and they wil be broad like ſpots as broad as farthings, and there dieth many ſheepe thereof, for lacke of looking too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.

there is no froſtes, then it ſhalbe good to waſh them in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Remedies alſo. Some do take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuice of nightſhade mixt with greaſe, and ther with anoint, or garlick beaten togither with tar, &amp; ſo anoint. Or the iuice of pelitory of ſpain, or of arthichoke, mixt with ſtrong vinegar, and therewith waſh it. Other remedies ſhepheards haue the which I know not, but theſe I thinke ſhalbe ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a ſicknes amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt ſhéep, which the ſhepherds cal the wood euil or cramp, which commeth moſt commonly <note place="margin">The wood euil or crampe.</note> in the ſpring of the yeare, and taketh them moſt in their legs and in their necks, ſo that it maketh them hold their neckes awry. And the moſt part of ſhéepe that haue this ſickneſſe, within a day or two, thereof wil die, except they haue ſpéedie remedie, which remedie is beſt, to waſh them a litle, and to change their grounds or going, and to bring them to féede in ſome low paſture. For this grief comes commonly to ſhéep, on lay and hilly grounds, and full of fearny grounds. Other remedies there are, which men do vſe to let blood on the vain vnder the eye. Alſo ſome do ſay, that houſe léeke ſtampt with neates féete oyle, and therewith anoint. Or ſcallions, ſtampt and bound to their legges. Other bugloſſe, the leaues ſtampt and bound to their legges.</p>
                     <p>Shéepe in the ſommer wil be troubled with maggets, the fly wil blow vpon ſmal occaſions. To perceiue when any <note place="margin">Maggots in ſheepe.</note> ſhéepe is troubled therewith, ye ſhal ſée by her biting, ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, ſtarting, and ſhaking her taile: and there moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is moiſt and watry. If it be nigh the hinder partes or taile, it wil be defiled and waxe oftentimes gréene with doonging. Then muſt the ſhepheard clip away all the wooll in that place, to the ſkin: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to caſt a handful of dry mouldy pouder thereon, (which hee ſhould haue alwaies readie in a bag) to dry vp the moyſture. Then wipe away that mould, and whereas the maggots were, laie tarre thereon all ouer. Thus in the ſommer ye muſt euery day ſée wel vnto them, and marke their féeding and going.</p>

ſkinne, (which is a thinne Call that the Lambe is lapt in) which they take, or part there of, and lappes it on a lumpe, and puttes it into hir mouth, and make hir to ſwallowe it. If the Yowe will not eate it: then let hir chew it well vppe and downe in hir mouth: and after that, ſhée will loue hir Lambe and be affraide of it, as others. And to make hir to loue another Lambe, if hirs bee deade, they vſe to take hir Lambes ſkinne, and clappe it on the other Lambes body, &amp; then ſhe will loue the other Lambe, &amp; thinke it is hir owne. If a Yowes lambe die in the birth, ſome Shéepheardes doe take the deade lambe, and rubbes another lambe all ouer therewith: and by that meanes the Yowe reſerues it as hir owne, and will loue it aſwell.</p>
                     <p>Shéep oftimes will be poyſoned by eating ſome euil herb <note place="margin">Poyſon of ſheepe.</note> or other thinge, where vpon they will ſwell, and ſtagger, in in holding commonlie their heades downe, and within a while after: they will foame at the mouth, and then ſoone after, they will fall downe and die. The remedy is, ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards doe vſe aſſoone as they ſpie any ſhéep réele or ſtagger, they take him and open his mouth and vnder his tongue at the roote, there ſhall yee ſee bladders, which they doe rubbe with the powder of loame, or with croomes of bread, and and breake them, than they piſſe in the ſheepes mouth, and ſo waſheth it downe, If yee cannot piſſe, then ye ſhall take drinke, and powre ſome into his mouth, and ſoone after hée will doe wel againe, or giue him the iuyce of woormewood, with wine, or vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Againſt the time of yeaning as towardes the Spring, ſhepheardes muſt then take good héede vnto their flocke of <note place="margin">Yeaning time.</note> yeawes, or any other hauing the gouernment of ſuch cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. Then muſt the ſhepheardes cheriſh wel their yeawes béeing with lamb, for if the yeawes be not then ſtrong, they will haue no force to deliuer their lambs, which cauſeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abortiues or dead Lambes, and oft times they cannot be deliuered without helpe. Therefore in that time, good ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes ought to giue great attendaunce in ſome places where great flockes are, they watche in the nightes as
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:12686:120"/>
well as daies, for perhappes three or foure yeawes maie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to yeane at one time. Wherefore, then the ſhepheard muſt haue helpe, or els they are like to haue loſſe of lambes, and where a yeaws cannot deliuer her Lamb, the ſhepheard muſt helpe her in ſetting his foote on her necke, and with his hands to pluck it from her gently. If it come with the head forward, then it is more eaſie to be taken out. But if the lambe doe come with the rumpe forward, then muſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard put in his fingers, and put a ſmall corde about the houghes of both the lambes feet, and ſo faſten it and plucke the lambe forth. If any lambe do lie ouerwhart or croſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt the ſhepheard with a ſharp knife cut the lamb in three or foure peeces, and ſo take it forth.</p>
                     <p>Alſo if anie Lambe bee like to die when hee is firſt lambde, yee ſhall open his mouth and blowe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <note place="margin">Weake lambs new yeaned.</note> and thereby manie haue recouered ſoone after, and done well. Wherefore in this time of the yeare, ye muſt bee painefull to ſee your yeawes and to bee with them late at night, and earelie in the morning, and to ſee and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken if anie yeawe doe complaine or groane, that yee maye be readie to helpe her, Alſo if any yeaw haue two Lambes and too little milk, thift one lamb as is afore mentioned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome other yeawe, which hath no lambe, thus ye may do &amp; ſaue in lamming time many Lambes.</p>

The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe is, whereas they haue no ſeueralles to put their lambes in, when they ſhould be weaned.

Alſo Ariſtotle ſaith, ſhéepe do commonly conceiue in drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-water, and therefore ſome ſhepheards do giue them ſalt, and do force them to take it, which doth cauſe them to conceiue the rather, and ſalt will kéepe them longer ſafe and ſound without ſickenes.

If your ſheepe be made to faſt three daies and then giue them meat, they will ſoone after waxe fat: in ſommer cold water coming out of the north ſpringes is good for them to drinke: and in harueſt, warme water coming out of the ſouth ſhall be good for them, and then to eate in the later part of the day or night is alſo good for ſheepe. And thoſe ſheepe which are driuen and trauell farre, do ſoone waxe leane, and ſhepheards wil perceiue thoſe that will beſt endure out the next winter folowing, for ſome ſheepe are ſo feeble they are not able to ſhake of the iſe from their backes, and ſome will ſuffer none thereon but ſtill ſhake it off.

                     <p>THe age of cutting and gelding of young lambs (as ſome ſhepheards ſay) is beſt in the wane of the moone, the ſigne and the houre being good, young lambs from three dayes olde till nine dayes olde, for then they are young and tender and maye eaſily be gelt. Yet ſome other do hold, it is better cutting of lambs when they are more ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as of three weekes olde or more. But then is more danger in cutting them. For if they be then ranke of bloud (as ſome will be more then other ſome) then the bloud often will fall into the codde, raines and belly, and there it will lye and cauſe the lambs ſoone after they are cut to die. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put the fine powder of rozen into his codde, and that will drie vp the quarie bloud.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſome do chooſe out thoſe lambs that bee luſtie and fayre, and cuts their eares, or lets them bloud the daye before.</p>
                     <p>Some ſhuts them in a houſe the night before without meat, and then to cut them. Alſo a good ſure way is this: ye ſhall cauſe one to hold the lambe betwixt his legs, or on his lappe, and turne the lambe on his backe, in holding his foure feete vp right together: But if ye ſhall ſee blacke ſpots in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>ankes then cut him not, for he will die, for he is rank of bloud. Then let the cutter take and holde the tippe of the codde in his left hand, and with a ſharpe knife cutte the top thereof an inch long cleane away.</p>
                     <p>Then with his thumbes and his two formoſt fingers on both handes ſlippe ſoftely downe the codde ouer the ſtones to his belly, and then with his teeth holeyng the left ſtone whole in his mouth, drawe it ſoftlye forth ſo longe as the ſtring is: So done, then drawe foorth the other in like maner. Then ſpytte in the codde, ano annoint his flankes on both ſides of the codde with freſh greaſe, and ſo let him or them go.</p>

But if ye draw the ſtones raſhly (as ſome will) not holding downe his cod with their hands, as afore ſaid, and ſuffers the lambe to ſtruggle, whereby it may ſoone breake the ſtring of a vaine in drawing the ſtones, which will then gather to lumps of bloud in his belly and codde, and thereof die within two or thrée houres after: And when ye haue cut them lette them not lye, but ſturre them vp and downe after for two or three houres.

                     <p>Theſe kind of cattell deſire to haue buſhes and bryers, and alio thornes, and other trées, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue plaine paſture groundes or fields. For they féede as well in rough and rude groundes as plaine places. For they feare neither bryer, rocke nor thorne, buſh or other woode, and they loue very well low and ſmall trees, ſhrubbes, as alſo wild trées, crabtrées and ſuch like, or the wild graſſe mellilot: alſo of willowes and young okes, or elmes being not hie.</p>

                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:12686:128"/>
The buckes haue vnder their iawes two wattles or tufts like a beard, which is the better to be eſtéemed of, his body alſo being large withall, and his legs great, his necke playne and ſhort, with great hanging eares: his head ſmall, his haire blacke and thicke, cleane and long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. In many places they dod ſhere them to make man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils for ſouldiours. Alſo the bucke goat when he is of ſeuen moneths olde, he is ſufficient to couple and to couer the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males.</p>
                     <p>For he is of ſo great a heat, and ſo knauiſh withall, that <note place="margin">Goat bucke waxe ſoone old.</note> he will not ſpare to couer his owne damme, though ſhe bee yet milch. Through the which heat he waxeth ſoone olde, and before he be vi. yeares he is nie ſpent. For his youthfull yeares being ſo hot: hath conſumed his ſtrength. Wherefore after v yeares he is not ſufficient to couer the females. The ſhe goat which doth reſemble the bucke afore mentioned, is greatly to be prayſed, if ſhe haue great tets with large vd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durns and full of milke. In temperate countries they chooſe the goates which are without hornes. But in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries windy and ſtormie which is ſubiect often vnto great windes, they take thoſe which haue hornes: but in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ye ſhall ſée that the buckes haue no hornes, becauſe they are moſt vnhappy in puſhing and goring with their hornes, which thing is often dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Theſe cattell ought not to be aboue one hundreth in a heard: although that ſhéepe with wooll may bee a thouſand together in a flocke. And alſo when ye buy goates, it is better to buy all together out of one companie or heard, then to chooſe in diuers partes or companyes, to the ende that when yee woulde lead them to paſture, they doo not ſeparate them ſelues into diuers partes: and alſo it will bee the better for them to agree in their houſes. And too great a heat in ſommer doth annoye theſe cattell verye much, yet more doth the cold in winter: for theſe female goats which do bring forth a kidde in winter, through the cold and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie thereof, it often maketh them bring forth abortiues and dead kids.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:12686:129"/>
Alſo abortiues comes when they giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſome place nothing but acorns for their meat. Wherefore ye muſt not giue them but a quantitie at once thereof.</p>
                     <p>The chiefeſt time to haue them coupled or couered with the bucke, is in Autumne, before the moneth of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to the ende that againſt the graſſe and leafe do ſpring freſh and tender, then ſhee ſhall kidde and bring forth their young the better, whereby to haue more graſſe, and therby to giue the more milke.</p>
                     <p>Alſo their houſes ought to be paued with ſtone, or elſe naturally to be of grauell of it ſelfe all vnder, for theſe kind of cattell bee ſo hot they muſt haue no litter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. But their kéeper to looke alwaies diligentlye vnto them, in clenſing them daylye in their houſes, and in their ſaid houſes not to ſuffer anye fylthye dung, or other moiſture to remayne, or anye other dunghill: For it is cleane contrarie againſt the nature of goates. If the yowes bee of a good kinde, they will bring two kiddes a péece, and ſome times three at once: Which is not good nor yet commended when a goat ſo doth. And alſo being of two yeares, to bring at once three kiddes. If ſo then ye muſt nouriſh the kiddes as ye do the lambes, hauing but ſmall ſuccor. But the young buckes muſt bee a little more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and kept lowe, to abate their heat and laſciniouſnes in them. But the other ye muſt giue them aboundance of milke, and alſo to giue them Elme leaues and ſéedes, and of mellylot hearbe, and of iuie, or the tender croppes of lentil peaſe, or other tender branches and crops. Alſo when a goate hath kydded, yee ſhall reſerue the moſt fayreſt and ſtrongeſt of the two: (If that ſhe haue two at a birth.) For to repleniſh alwaies your heard, the other yee may ſell if yee will, or other waies diſpoſe him. Yee ſhall not giue any kidde to a goat of a yeare, or two yeares to nouriſh, for thoſe kiddes which they bring within thoſe ſaid times, ought not to be nouriſhed or kept, except they bee of three yeares, and thoſe which be but a yeare hauing a kidde, it
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:12686:129"/>
ought ſodainely to be taken away from the damme.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe goats which haue kiddes being of two yeares, ye ſhall let them remaine till they be ready to ſell. And ye muſt not keepe your doaes no lenger then viii. yeares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they being ſore weakened in ſo often bearing, they will become barren. Alſo their kéeper ought to be rough vnto them, in giuing them ſharpe words, and to be diligent, patient, not angry, and yet bold: For to go with them through valleis, on rockes, and deſart places, through bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, ſhrubbes, and ſuch like, and yet not alwayes to follow his heard, as the kéepers of other cattell. But he ought to bee alwaies before this cattell. And to bee more carefull of them then of any other cattell. For theſe in féeding and brouſing or paſtoring doo alwayes obey the buckes, in deſcending and giuing them place, and therefore they muſt bee looked vnto when ſome doo ſitte, looke the other runne not here and there: But ſee that they reſt peaceably and gently all at their owne eaſe, to the ende the yowes hauing the greateſt tettes and vddurns, do not thereby waxe leane or other wayes become euill or ſicke.</p>
                     <p>The goates are nouriſhed almoſt of nothing chargeable. Yet they brouſe and féed wholly together as the ſhéepe, and doe clime vp on mountaines againſt the heate of the ſunne, with greater force then the ſheepe, and they bee of more greater trauell and exerciſe, and are more in ſtrength and ſtouter of nature. Wherfore our aunceſtours did vſe them as they do yet in mountaynes, and wilde places, which is counted moſt meeteſt for them: And to haue their houſes and gouernment as the ſheepe haue, in putting the buckes apart, as they do the rammes: For they are in all thinges gouerned as the ſhéep, and are much conuerſant with ſheepe, in howſing and paſturing alike.</p>
                     <p>But theſe kind of beaſtes are not ſo meete to bee about houſes as ſheepe, for they are more hurtfull vnto all maner of hearbes and bees: therefore they are more meeter to bee in rougher and barren groundes, as buſhes, rockes, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:12686:130"/>
and ſuch. And ſome thinke it good not to haue in a troupe or head aboue fiftie goates, becauſe they will be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging here and there, and are fooliſh cattell and without care, ſoone hanged here and there, which are in more danger then the ſheep: therefore it is more painfuller vnto their kéeper, and not to let them go in cold places, for cold is moſt hurtful vnto them.</p>

And when their ſkin ſhall ſwell or inflame, and that the goat is full of water, which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call <hi>Hydropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> a diſeaſe which cometh by drinking too much water.

                     <p>For goates haue the like diſeaſes as the ſhéepe and other cattell, and as they ſay, the goates are neuer without agues, for it is a common diſeaſe among them, and other diſeaſes they catch in their bringing forth of theyr young kiddes, as afore is expreſſed. This I thinke ſhall be ſufficient here at this time.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo in the tefs of goats, as in yowes, a certaine <note place="margin">The ſtopping of the tets.</note> ſtopping in ſome of their tets, which is a hard matter like a ſtrawe of flegme, which will be in the cundit of the teat, with a little blacke head, ſome will ſticke ſo faſt that the kid or lambe cannot drawe it foorth, and ſo long they can haue no milke. Therefore muſt the ſhepheards ſée to all ſuch things, at the lamming or kidding time, or els the lambs and kids are like to ſtarue.</p>
                     <p>Let the kéeper alſo looke vnto his goats, that the females be not chaſt or hunted when they be great with kids, for if they be, they will be in danger of the miſturning the kids in their bellies, which cauſeth the kids oftentimes to die, &amp; put the goats in great ieopardy: &amp; ſo likewiſe with yowes great with lamb, if they be chaſt being great, it turnes their lambs in their bellies, and makes many miſcary in lambing time.</p>

And when the graſſe is ſtrong and wette, it cauſeth them to bring aboundance of milke to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh their pigs the better: for when ſhe waxeth dry, and hath no milke to nouriſh them with, then muſt yee take them from her, and ſee to weane them, and ſo by litle and litle they will fall to eate graſſe and corne, and ſuch as falles on the ground. And thus in continuance they will waxe more ſtronger, to eate of all other kinde of meate. This order they chiefly vſe in villages where great troopes of hogges are vſed and kept together, bred and brought vp in townes, whereby at length there comes a great profit by them vnto the huſband.

                  <p>Notwithſtanding, I cannot ſaie why they ſpay them except it ſhould be to fat them, or where there is want of meate to feede them.

Of theſe kinde of Beaſtes yee ſhall finde in all countries chriſtened, and ſome are in mountaines as well as in plain countries. But the plaine and moyſt groundes, are far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them, then the hot and drie grounds. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and Commons are moſt conuenient for them to féede on. And where there is great plentie of Oake trées, Beech, Aſhe, and thorne, of Bryers, Hazels, and crabtrees, wilde peare, or Plumtrees, Fearne rootes, and ſuchlike, to féed them withall, from time to time. For theſe ſortes of trees doe not rype al at one time, but in diuers and ſundry times of the ſommer, which are almoſt ſufficient to nouriſh them all the yéere long, with helpe of graſſe and rootes, and ſome helpes now and then in Winter of other meate.</p>
                  <p>And where there is want of ſuch trees, yee muſt haue them to other féeding ground, and the beſt is to haue of dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſlymie and ſoft grounde, then to haue drie and harde ground. For in the in the ſoft ground, they maie the eaſier digge and ſéeke for wormes &amp; rootes in the earth, and to toſſe and tumble in the durty water, which doth them much good in hot time. Wherein they muche delight to tumble them, becauſe ofttimes they would haue water to coole them in, which cooling dooth profite them much and eaſeth them of their great heate, which is a bréeder of the meazels. They <note place="margin">Rootes good for hogs.</note> doe féede in moyſt &amp; marriſh grounds, where they haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſmall and ſweet rootes, as flagge rootes, and the rootes of galingale, of ruſhes, reedes, and alſo the rootes of Daffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dill, which is very good for hogges, knotgraſſe and ſuch like. And likewiſe in fallow fieldes they doe finde ſtore of rootes,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:12686:136"/>
and wormes which doth make them fat. And as for other grounds couered with graſſe, they finde diuers ſortes of hearbes and fruites, ſo that in diuers partes thereof, they may haue beſides, of wilde plums, of peares, or hawes, ſloes and nuts, and ſuch like: and whereas ye ſhall ſée them haue ſcante of meate, ye muſt not then ſpare your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: for then ye muſt néeds helpe them a mornings with ſome meate, and likewiſe at night with ſome: for al the day before perhaps in féeding abroad they haue had litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And therefore all good huſbands ſhould kéepe plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of acorns after Michaelmas, to ſerue them all the yeare if they can. Acorns may be kept in Ceſtorns with water, <note place="margin">Akornes kept.</note> or to be dryed and kept in fats, for ſo ye may kéepe them from rats and mice: or to dry them and lay them on drye boardes, and giue thereof in their waſh, or drye with ſome beanes or other graine when it is good cheape, and what yee ſpend one way, yee may ſo profit an other waye.</p>
                  <p>Unto ſowes that giue ſucke, to eate of gréene hearbes, ſometimes it doth them hurt. Therefore in the morning before ye put them forth to feede, yee ought to giue them ſomewhat to kéepe them in hart: for much eating of greene graſſe in the ſpring, will cauſe them to be loſe bellied, which will make them leane. And ye ſhould not put hogges to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">Stying your hogges.</note> like other cattell, in their ſtyes: but make them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions therein. And to put the ſowes aſunder by them ſelues, and the young pigs by them ſelues. For when they are ſhut vp altogether, they tumble, toſſe, and lye out of order one vpon another, and thereby oftentimes makes the ſowes to caſt their pigs.</p>
                  <p>Alſo thoſe huſbandes that dwell by forreſts or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, it were good for them to haue ſtyes in the ſaide for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and commons, whereby they may at all times feede ſuch hogges as they ſhall ſeeme moſt meete. And there likewiſe vſe to giue them their meat, whereby they may within a while forget the comming to his houſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhall the leſſe bee troubled with them, from time to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:12686:136"/>
time. And it were good to make the walles or hedges of your ſtyes of foure foote hye: for then your hogs or ſowes can not get ouer, nor yet others come vnto them. And ſo open at all times, that the keeper may looke into the ſtye, and to take account of them at his pleaſure, to ſée if he haue all or not, and to ſeee if anie ſowé doe ouerlay, or lye on her pigs, then to remoue her, and ſee vnto the pigs, ſo long as they be yong and tender.</p>
                  <p>The hoghearde or keeper ought alſo in keeping of them <note place="margin">Hogheard watchfull.</note> to be watchfull, diligent, painefull, ſeruiceable with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of a good nature: Being verie carefull to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them, from time to time: who ought alſo to haue in mind the number of all his hogges, ſowes and pigges, both old and young: and to haue regarde and conſider the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and encreaſe of euerie one, from time to time. And likewiſe to take heede of his ſowes that they take no hurt, with dogges, or otherwaies when they are readie to far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro: <note place="margin">Sowes with pigge.</note> but to ſhut them vp in the ſtyes, that they may farro there, for feare of caſting her pigges. For in farroing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, often times &amp; many wayes they periſh, as with the Foxe, or other like chances: which is for lacke of looking to in time. Which to a poore man is a great loſſe, if hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all thinges. Alſo when a ſowe doth farro, the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ought to ſee how manie pigges ſhe hath, (for ſome ſowes will eate of them, aſſoone as ſhe hath farroed them,) and therefore to looke well vnto them, and ſee what they be: and let them not ſucke of any other ſow, but of their owne damme. For if the pigges reſorte out of the ſtye, and goe among others, when ſhe lyeth downe to giue them ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>e, they will ſucke with others, which may thereby ſoone be bitten of the ſtraunge ſowe. Therefore the beſt is, to ſee each ſow ſhut vp by them ſelues, that one hinder not the other: for at length yee ſhall not know the higges of the one ſowe from the other, except ye marke them.</p>
                  <p>And among a heard of many pigges, yee muſt haue of diuers markes, to know which is which. For els it <note place="margin">Marking your<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:12686:137"/>
And among a great number it wilbe a hard and a painfull thing to doe. Therefore it ſhall be good to tell them in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth and comming in, as afore is declared: or to tell them in entring in at a doore, no bigger then one hogge or ſow may paſſe alone, in going in or comming forth. And looke that euerie ſow haue with her but her owne pigs, and ſo manie as ſhe ſhall beſt continue with, to nouriſh well, which is not aboue eight pigs, if ſhe haue any more, it were beſt to ſell the reſt being young, without yee perfectly ſée, that the ſow is well able to nouriſh them: for if ſhe be not, ye ſhall ſoone perceiue by decaying of the pigs, for they will ſoone waxe leane, and euerie pigge will but ſucke his drene or tette.</p>
                  <p>To weans pigs, whereas huſbandmen haue no ſtyes. They wene their pigs in tying a wollen cloth liſt about the vpper ſnowte, with a knot in the middeſt of the roofe of his mouth, ſo remaining vnder the pallet of his mouth, he can not draw any ſtore of milke: whereby the ſow will ſoone waxe drye.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe ſowes which are good bréeders of pigs, they ſhould be rather choſen that ſucke of the hinder tets, and <note place="margin">sowes <hi>&amp;</hi> good breeders.</note> ought to be nouriſhed often with dry and ſod barley, for feare leaſt they beeing young, ſhoulde waxe leane, or fall into ſome ſickneſſe. Alſo the hogheard or keeper ought of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to cleanſe their ſtyes: for although theſe kind of beaſtes be foule and filthie feeders, yet they doe deſire to lye cleane and drye in their ſtyes. Thus much heere for the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and good keeping of hogs.</p>
                  <p>The maner and gelding of hogs, there is two times in the yeare to geld theſe kind of cattell beſt. One is in <note place="margin">Gelding of hogs.</note> the ſpring, and the other in Autumne after Michaelmas. The order how they doe geld: one way is thus. They make two croſſe ſlits or inciſions on the middeſt of the ſtones, vpon each ſtone one, and then put them forth, and ſo annoint them with tarre. There is an other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gelding, which is more gentle, and more faire: but ſomewhat more dangerous, if it bee not well done.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:12686:137"/>
Neuertheleſſe I wil therin ſhew ſomewhat, and not ſo leaue it, which is: to ſlit on ſtone on the toppe, and after ye haue drawne foorth that, ye ſhall put in your fingers at the ſame ſlit, and with your launcet ſlit the ſkin betwéene the two ſtones, and by that ſlit ye ſhall cruſh forth the other ſtone, and ſo draw him foorth gently as the other aforeſaid: and and then to clenſe out the blood, and ſo anoint him with freſh greaſe. And thus ye ſhal make but one inciſion or ſlit on the codde. But this way is beſt for other cattel. For of all ſorts of catel, a boare may beſt be gelded being olde. Alſo againſt certaine ſickneſſe, they giue ſome remedies as hereafter ſhall follow.</p>
                  <p>The ſignes to know beſt when that your hogges haue <note place="margin">Feuer in hogs.</note> the feuer, is this. When they hang downe their heads or heare it aſide; or when they in féeding and paſtoring, do ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly runne, and ſodeinly reſt againe, and ſo fall on the ground as they were aſtonied and giddie. Ye muſt therfore marke which ſide hee holdeth vp or hangeth his head, ſo that yee let him blood on the eare on the other ſide: and ye ſhall alſo open the greateſt vaine vnder his taile, two fingers from his rumpe or buttockes. But firſt yee muſt chafe and beate it with ſome wande or twigge, that it may bléede the better. Then if the infuſion (after yee haue drawne blood) doe beginne to ſwell, yee ſhall cloſe it togither in binding about the taile, the barke of a willow or of elme. And after this, yee ſhall kéepe him in the houſe the ſpace of a daie or two, and yee ſhall giue him as much warme water as hee will drinks, mixt with a pounde of barley meale.</p>
                  <p>And alſo for thoſe hogs which haue impoſtumes or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels <note place="margin">Impoſtume vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the throat.</note> vnder their throates. They ought to be let blood vnder the toong: and when ye haue drawne blood ſufficient, yee muſt rubbe and chafe all his throat and groine with ſalt, and pure wheate meale, beaten togither. Some doe ſay, there is not a better medicine then to make them to take with a horne) ſixe ounces of garum, which yee ſhall lightly haue at the Apothicaries. Then with a ſmall flaxen corde binde
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:12686:138"/>
thereunto with ferules of wood, and let them ſo hang about his necke, as they may touch the impoſtume and curnels, and they ſhal do wel againe.</p>
                  <p>Alſo when as your hogs doe caſt or vomit, is a ſigne <note place="margin">Againſt vomit.</note> their ſtomacke is not wel. Therefore yee ſhal giue them gratings or ſhauings of iuory, with a litle of dride beaten ſalt. And ye ſhal beate their beanes ſmall, and put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the trough with their other meate before they goe to the field, and they wil then remaine the more in quiet there.</p>
                  <p>Alſo there comes ſometimes a ſicknes amongſt theſe <note place="margin">Of a leanneſſe in hogges.</note> beaſtes, ſo that many wil be ſicke togither, inſomuch ye ſhal ſée them waxe leane therewith, and they wil not then ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eate any thing at all: and if ye driue them to the paſture or field, they wil réele and fall downe by the way. And if it take them in ſommer, they wil lie and ſléepe in the ſunne all day, and it taketh them as they had litargie, (which is a ſlée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie <note place="margin">Litargie in hogges.</note> and forgetful ſicknes) if this diſeaſe then happen, they ſhut vp all their hogs togither in one houſe, and lets them there remaine a day and a night, without any meate or drinke. On the next day after, to thoſe that wil drinke, they giue them water, in the which is ſtampt the rootes of wilde cucumbers. And ſo many as haue drunke thereof, they will <note place="margin">To vomit.</note> begin to vomit, and by ſo vomiting, they are purged cleane thereof, and when they haue caſt and cleanſed all the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and filth within their ſtomake, then yee may giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, peaſe, fetches or beanes, mixt with ſalt water, or to caſt of bay ſalt amongſt it, and then they make them to drinke luke warme water. And as it is very euil and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious for all beaſtes (in ſommer) to bee dry, ſo is it moſt chiefly in hogs. Yet I would not haue yee ſhould giue your hogs water twiſe a day, as yee doe other cattel, as goates, ſhéepe, and others: but if ye can in the canicular daies, let them féede nigh ſome riuer, pondes, or low marſhes. For their heat is then ſo great, they cannot ſuffice them to drinke water onely, but they muſt alſo turne and toſſe therein, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in myery and durtie water, the which doeth greatly refreſh and coole them, ſpecially thoſe which haue fatte and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:12686:138"/>
great bellies. And herein nature doth ſhewe them what is good for them.</p>
                  <p>But if the ſituation of the place wil not ſuffer and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ye muſt then giue them largely drinke from the wel, or in ſuch a like place, or els to put plentie of water into their troughes. For if they haue not then all ſufficient thereof to drinke, they wil haue the diſeaſe of the lightes, which is, to be pursy, and ptiſicke. But this diſeaſe is eaſily remedied by putting in their eares the iuice of pomeile, ſo calde in French. In Latin <hi>Conſiligo,</hi> the which I take to bee the hearbe calde, light woort, or comphere.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe your hogges oftentimes wil haue the paine of <note place="margin">Milt pained.</note> the milt, which doth oft trouble them: and then they wil go aſide and crooked with their bodies, which commeth by a great drought as ſome do iudge, but moſt by fruit, for when fruites doe fall from the trées, and lieth on the ground vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp. Theſe beaſtes are ſo vnſaciable in following the ſwéetnes thereof, that thereby they engender this diſeaſe in the ſplene: The which ye ſhal remedie it, by making them troughes to féed out of, of the wood in Latin calde <hi>Tamarix,</hi> which as I thinke is calde in Engliſh quickbeme wood. And ye ſhal therein vſe to giue them their meate and drinke, and that wood wil remedie it. For out of that wood, wil come a water or moiſture, which wil heale the inflamation of that diſeaſe. Sometimes there comes inflamations in the milt, ſo that it bréeds a peſtilence among hogs, which comes by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome times. And alſo the rather by their filthy bodies &amp; féeding, or els by ſome infection through euil nouriſhment. Therfore it wil be good ſometime to kéep them faſting all a night in ſome dark place, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume the ſuperfluous humors in them, which they do encreaſe by their rauening &amp; gréedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Which I wil not here leaue, but to ſpeake ſomewhat thereof hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching the vnnatural kind of ſome of the ſows, <note place="margin">Sowes vnnat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> rall.</note> there be in ſome kinds of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are ſo rauining, they wil not paſſe to deuour their own pigs, which commeth clean a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nature of moſt cattel: &amp; thoſe are not to be ſuffred
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:12686:139"/>
to liue, for they be alwaies dangerous to kéepe. Sowes may endure leaſt hunger, and ſome of them although they haue ſufficient meate, yet they will deuoure their yoong pigs, not onely their owne, but likewiſe others. Therefore ſome doth thinke it not good to nouriſh any hog or ſowe, with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedge and inwardes of beaſtes, as they doe in many places féede them with guttes and inwardes of beaſtes, as in but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers houſes and ſuch like. Nor yet a man ſhould not make any eſtimation of that hog or ſow, that is, deſirous to féede on carion or fleſh. For the vſuall cuſtome thereof, will make them mankinde: and by eating of dead carion and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fleſh, will at length make them fall to catching quicke cattell, and from thence to fall vnto liuely creatures, as I haue heard of credible perſons, ſay, that ſowes haue taken yoong children without the doores, as in barnes, being left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Some out of their cradelles béeing no bodie in the houſe. Therefore let euerie huſbandman beware of the kéeping of any ſuch rauening kinde of beaſt. For they are verie tender of noſe, and will ſmell farre off.</p>
                  <p>A hog is verie hurtfull after two or thrée yeares olde, therefore kill him, and if they fall once to eating fleſh which <note place="margin">To feede a hog fatte.</note> is dead, they will ſoone fall to other aliue, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they doe once laie holde off, be it capon, chikin, ducke, lambe, or pigge, yee ſhall rather kill them, or ye make them to leaue, or to let it goe. And this ſhal bee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in this place for ſuch rauening cattell.</p>
                  <p>A way how to féed a hog fatte in ſhort time, is, ye ſhal take him vp, and put him in the ſtye, and giue him neither <note place="margin">Meaſeld hogs to helpe.</note> meate nor drinke, the ſpace of thrée daies and thrée nightes, and then giue him continually, and let it be chaunged once or twiſe a wéeke. And hee ſhal be ſo gréedie after his great hunger, that he wil alwaies be hungry in eating ſo, that he wil be fat in ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>A prooued way to helpe your meaſeld hog, or boare is, ye ſhal put him vp in the ſtie, and kéep him there thrée daies and thrée nights without meat or water, or any other thing.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:12686:139"/>
Then take flue or ſixe apples, and in the toppes make a hole, and picke out the cores, and fill each apple in thoſe holes with the pouder of brimſtone verie finely beaten: and ſtop the ſaid holes with péeces of apples, and caſt them vnto the meaſeld hog, firſt one or two, and ſo the reſt, and béeing ſo hungry he wil eate them all, then let him ſo remaine two or thrée houres after, and then giue him a litle meate, and no more til the next morning, and the next morning ſerue him ſo againe, and giue him fiue or ſix apples as before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Thus vſe your hogge the ſpace of fiue or ſixe daies, and ye ſhall ſée him waxe as cleane as euer hee was before. Alſo they doe vſe for the ſame, to take the lées of ſope, mixt with ſome ſtrong lée of a bucke, and giues of that, and vſe him as the other aforeſaide, and giue him no meate of an houre or two after. And this (as ſome doe ſay) is counted verie good to helpe the foreſaid diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>How to kéepe and ſaue your hogs from being meaſeld, is this, ye ſhal vſe in the ſommer, ſpecially in the time of the <note place="margin">To ſaue them from meaſeld.</note> canicular daies, or daies of heate, which is from the midſt of Iuly, to the midſt of Auguſt. And in theſe times to giue them chopt, (amongſt their waſh or other meate) of colde hearbes, as of lettis, endiue, ſuccory, violet leaues, of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delion, or ſowthiſtle, fumitory, and ſuch like, which are all colde helpes, and wil kéepe them coole: or to chop amongſt their meate the leaues of dwale, which is verie cold in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Therefore vſe thereof the leſſe portion amongſt their meat. All theſe hearbes aforeſaid, are verie good to kéep them coole. For the cauſe of meaſelly in a hogge commeth <note place="margin">Cauſe of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelry.</note> through the great and vehement heate of his blood, or lying in horſe dung, &amp; fleam togither mixt with his blood, through heate is dride in his bodie, and ſo lieth in the outward parts of his bodie in curnels. And firſt they will appeare in the liuer (through the heate of his ſtomacke) at the rootes of his toong, and in his throat: that when he doe cry, he wil rattle in his voice and crie hoarſe. By this yee ſhal firſt perceiue his infection: and if ye doe take forth his toong, ye ſhal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the curnels there vnder, and by this order ye may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:12686:140"/>
any meaſeld hog. Alſo (ſome do ſay) if you put muſtard <note place="margin">Muſtard is ill for hogs.</note> amongſt your waſhings and giue that vnto your hogges, it will (to vſe much thereof) cauſe them to bee meaſeld at length, or ſuch like which doeth much heate their blood. Alſo to kéepe them from being meaſeld ye may vſe to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their waſh, of mens vrine, and mixe with their waſh alſo of red oker, called red earth, beaten ſmall to pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This wil likewiſe kéepe them from beeing meaſeld. Sope water, and fiſh water is ill.</p>
                  <p>Whenſoeuer ye doe entend to fat any hog, to giue him drye meate is counted chiefeſt, and giue him to drinke béere, <note place="margin">Fatting a hog.</note> or ale and water: and yee muſt not let him goe foorth of the ſtye, not ſo much as to ſée forth thereof, but to open the ſtye dore and to make it cleane: for a hog when he may ſee forth, hee wil haue ſo much deſire to goe abroad, that hee will haue no care to féede. There is not ſo much care to be had in them, as in other cattell, yet to kéepe them cleane, they loue to haue it. And ſo to be fed and not remooued or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into any other place, or by any other meanes troubled: yet ſometimes they are (in the ſtye) a little troubled with <note place="margin">Mice in the flie.</note> myce, in running on their backes, and ſo diſquiets them in the ſtye: which ye may ſoone helpe by ſetting of trappes, to take them alwaies as they come. Thus ye may féede them to bee a foote and a halfe thicke of fatte in ſmall time.</p>
                  <p>If your hogs haue eaten any euill hearbe, as of henbane or hemblocks. To remedie the ſame, yee ſhall giue them to <note place="margin">Hogs ſicke by ill hearbes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> drinke the iuyce of cucumbers, made warme, the which being drunke, wil cauſe them to vomit, and thereby they wil cleanſe their ſtomackes and ſo recouer health againe.

Some rubbes it with nettles and ſalt. Some with plantaine, with ſome burnt allume mixt.

                  <p>There is a ſicknes in ſommer amongſt hogs, which ye <note place="margin">Sicke hogs to know.</note> ſhal ſooneſt know, by plucking a handfull of his briſtles on his backe, and ye ſhall plucke them againſt the haire. If (when yee haue pluckt them) they bee cleane and white at the roote, then he is well and ſound: but if they ſéeme at the roote bloodie or ſpottie, it is to be noted, he is not then well within his bodie.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe hogges are ſubiect oft to the diſeaſe of the mylt, <note place="margin">Diſeaſe of the milt.</note> and likewiſe vnto the peſtilence, which increaſeth by eating of vnwholſome meats &amp; drinks, &amp; by vnwholſome times, for
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:12686:141"/>
their bodies are apt to receiue ill aires, and ſoone corrupte, and moſt of all by their filthie féeding. They are alſo ſubiect vnto feuers and agues, for the which thing, they let them <note place="margin">Peſtilent feuer.</note> blood on the taile. And for the catarre, or inflamation in the necke, growing with certaine curnels, which is thought to be a kinde of lepre or meaſelry. For the which thing, they let them blood vnder the toong: if that wil not helpe, then ye muſt ſlit it and vſe it as ye doe for the garget, which is afore mencioned.</p>
                  <p>Hogs wil haue the catarre or reume, it wil make their eies to water, and a moiſture aſcending vp into their heads, <note place="margin">Catar in hogs.</note> and it commeth to them commonly by eating of fruit when they fall off from the trées, or when there is great ſtore ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and by eaſing of rotten fruit, which bréedeth a corrupt matter, nigh vnto the plague. And likewiſe it doth encreaſe catarres, and inflamations in the bodie. The remedie is, they doe vſe to giue them of olde capars, with their waſh, or other meate, and they vſe alſo to put amongſt their meate, of colewortes, both redde and white. And likewiſe they put of <hi>Thamarix,</hi> which I take to be the quick beame trée, or the hearbe called <hi>Amaranthus,</hi> which ſome doe call floures of loue. And for the ſame, to take of marſh mallowes, and mixe them among their meate, or for to take liuerwoort boyled in honied water and giuen. All the other aforeſaide are verie good to ſtaie the reume or catarre.</p>
                  <p>Hogs wil haue alſo a diſeaſe in the gall, which is called the flowing of the gall, and is when the gall is ſo full of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, <note place="margin">Flowing of the gall.</note> that it flowes in all parts of the bodie. And beſides, wil cauſe a ſwelling vnder the iawes of the ſwine. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is, to ſtampe the inner barke of elder, and ſtraine it with ale or béere, and giue it warme. Alſo ſome takes a handfull of gall woort, ſtampe it and ſtraine it, and giue it with honi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed water. And for the ſwilling, they do rub and chafe it with beaten ſalt, and pure wheate meale mixt togither. And ſome doe firſt cut the ſkin as afore is mentioned, in fleaing it on both ſides, and then to rub it all ouer on both ſides with ſalt, and ſo letteth it goe, and it wil heale ſo againe.</p>

Another way to helpe any hogge, if hee be not far gone <note place="margin">Meaſell to help.</note> with the meaſels, to recouer him againe. Yee ſhal take your hogge and put him in the ſtye for a day and a night without any meate or drinke. Then take a quart of ſtale or old piſſe, or mens vrine that hath béene kept long, and therein put a good handfull of redde earth, or redde oker, made in fine pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with a quarter of a pound of blacke ſope: then ſtir and mix it with the piſſe all wel togither, and then ſet it vnto the hog, if hee make daintie to drinke thereof, ye ſhal then put thereto a quantitie of whay, if he wil not yet take it, then put in more whay, for ſo he wil take it the ſooner, if not, force him to take it: and when hee haue all dronke it, let him ſo reſt two or thrée houres after, and then giue him ſome other meat, not much: and ſo let him reſt without any more meat til the next morning, and then vſe him ſo againe, and let him haue ſo euery morning for a wéekes ſpace or more, as yee ſhall haue cauſe therein, and ye ſhal ſée experience good.</p>
                  <p>How beſt to féede a boore in the ſtall. Some doe vſe to <note place="margin">To feed a bore beſt.</note> giue him of beanes and peaſe, and ſometimes for change, to giue him dry barley, with ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>But if ye wil haue that your brawne ſhal féede wel and be faire, white and tender, yée ſhal giue him no other thing, but faire branne and whay mixt togither ſomewhat thicke: which wil both féede your bore very well, and kéepe him coole alſo from being meaſeld.</p>
                  <p>How beſt to ring your hogs in times conuenient, and becauſe hogs are commonly rauening for their meat, more <note place="margin">Ringing of hogs.</note> then other cattel, it is meet therefore to haue them ringed, or elſe they wil doe much hurt in digging and turning vp corne fieldes, ſpoyling of medowes, defacing of commons, moyling in parkes, turning vp cloſes, diſordering orchards and gardens: and diſtroying all fine paſture for all other cattell. And in moſt places for lacke of good order and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. One neighbour, being negligent and careleſſe, ſpoiles thrée or foure of his neighbours groundes with his hogs, more in a day, then can be repairde againe in halfe a yeare. And the cauſe is chiefly, for lacke of ringing in time
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:12686:142"/>
conuenient, and they ſpoile and turne vp much faire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and paſture grounds, in ſéeking for wormes &amp; rootes, hauing graſſe and féeding inough beſides. One hog (as ſome do ſay) wil turn vp and ſpoile as much paſture ground in a day, as wil paſture ten beaſts in ten daies, which is a great loſſe among poore men, that hath the moſt féeding for their cattell on the commons, to haue ſo much paſture ground de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyd. Wherefore the common ſaying is, the hog is neuer good, but when he is in the diſh. <note place="margin">Prouerbe.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therfore me thinks it ſhall not be here vnméete, to ſpeake ſomething more of the ringing of them: wherein ſome men doe vſe to peg them with pegs of holly, or ſuch like harde wood and horne, but this kinde of pegging will not long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, for they wil ſoone weare or breake aſunder. And ſome do ring them with red wyer, becauſe they wil not ſtand to any further coſt, and that is alſo ſoone worne aſunder, for red wyer is too ſoft. Others doe put ringes of yron, ſome with horſe nailes or ſtrong white wyer, in the groin of their ſnoutes, and thoſe are counted much better to endure, and yet for all thoſe ringes they wil breake the ground, if it be any whit ſoft: therfore it grieueth them ſmally as it ſhould ſéeme.</p>
                  <p>And ſome others do ſlit their groine vnder, but when that is growne whole againe, they wil alſo dig notwithſtanding, for all theſe waies doe ſmally preuaile, if they be not looked to from day to day. To cut the griſtle aſunder is better.</p>
                  <p>Some doe vſe (in the ſpring) to ring and alſo yoake their hogge, at ſuch time as when they may féede or haue bitte of graſſe, and ſo lettes them remaine all the ſommer, for tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of hedges, which is thought not vnméete for the ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of corne. Some others, doe vſe to ring them at Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas, and ſo lets them remain, (if it be a yeare of maſt) vnto Nouember or December, or killing time, but they doe feare hanging in hedges: they do vnyoke them ſoone after Michelmas. They do alſo in ſome places in <hi>Germany</hi> (as I haue ſéene) ring them from the ſpring all the ſommer vnto December or killing time. So that al the ſommer long, ye
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:12686:142"/>
ſhall ſée no medow ground broken or digged with hogs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome rings breake or weare aſunder: ye may there goe a hundreth miles compaſſe ere yee ſhall ſée ſo much grounde digged, &amp; turnd vp with hogs, as ye ſhal do here in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or pariſh, &amp; yet their hogs are as fat &amp; as faire as oures, and they haue no other féed but graſſe, rootes, &amp; herbes in the fallow fieldes. And I was there taught how to ring a hog y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The double ring.</note> hee ſhould lightly neuer dig or breake any medow grounde, though it be light and ſoft. Which is, ye ſhall take a good big white wier, &amp; ſtiffe withal, being two or thrée inches long or more, according to the bignes of the hogs ſnout, and make it ſharpe at both endes, &amp; bow it ſtaple wiſe with two corners nigh an inch wide, then make two holes through his ſnout of the ſame widenes, and put it vp through the griſtle of his ſnout, hard vnto the bent of the ſtaple: then with a paire of plyers, bowe and turne the pointes of the wyer into the holes of his noſthrils, like a ramines horne. So that when ſoeuer hee doe offer to dig or turne vp any thing, the ſharpe endes of the wyer in turning, will pricke him alwaies in the tender holes of his noſthrils: and ſo they ſhal neuer dig, but ſtil gaze on the grounde continually from time to time, and ſhall neuer offer to dig in any kinde of ground, but ſéeke ſtill to gaze. And yet to bee at all times as faire as oures here in Englande, with now and then giuing them ſome meat at home, in their houſes or ſties, and ſomewhat at put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foorth in the morning, and alſo at comming home at night. Thus ye may kéep your common paſturing grounds alwaies whole vnſpoyld or turnd vp, and your hogs to bee in as good liking, with a litle more paine and charge, as the other vnringde. This kinde of ringing hogs, ſhall be ſet in figure heere vnder, for the more perfect and further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof. And this ſhall be ſufficient for the ringing of hogges in this ſort. Alſo to ring hogges they ſhall not dig, ſome doeth put a redde paſte wyer vnder the ſkinne of his ſnout, an inche from the groine, and an inche broade, then wrethe it togither on the middeſt of his ſnout, and it is done. Some doe vſe to cutte aſunder
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:12686:143"/>
the ſinowes on both fides of his ſnout, a ninche from the groine: and when hee would dig, the groine of his noſe will fall downe.</p>

But if ye thinke it wil be a loſſe or ſpoile of meate to giue him much, ye may giue it him in a ſmaller veſſell, and a litle at once.

How to kill him is thus, ye ſhall ſticke him and ſcalde him as ye do another hog, and then cut off his head and his féete, and open him in the backe, in making a narrow chine, then open him and take foorth his inwards, and then with a cloth dry away cleane all his blood within, and take forth the ribs as ye do a balribbe, and cut off the gammons, and ſalt the fillets in a cloſe veſſell, then cloſe and couer it, that no ayre enter: and in nine daies after, ye may not touch or open it. Then cut all the reſt in péeces as yee ſhall thinke beſt, and ſalt them in a barrel with faire and dry white ſalt. Then when ye ſhall néede to take forth any péece to occupy or ſell, put not the reſt ye take forth into the barrell againe, for that wil feſter and hurt the reſt. Therefore take foorth no more then ye occupy: and that péece yee take forth to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie, wil ſerue and endure wel thrée wéekes, beeing lapte and couered with dry ſalt, and ye may kéepe this larde ſo in barrel ſwéete and good, fiue or ſix yeeres to occupie.</p>

A hog dieth and pineth away, if hee léeſe one eye. A hog wil liue xvi. or xx. yeares. Hogs haue many ſickneſſes in their heads and ſides, and being ficke, they will commonly lye in dirtie puddles, and commonly they wil lye more on the right ſide, then on the left. If yee kéepe them without meate thrée daies at the firſt, they wil be fat within fortie daies.

                     <head>The manner of ſpaying of Coltes, Sheepe, and Sowes, whereof I will briefly ſpeake ſomewhat more.</head>
                     <p>YE ſhall vnderſtande that Mare coltes are commonly ſpayed within nine dayes after they are folde, if they be older it is not ſo good, for they ſay in ſpaying it will bee the harder to reach with his finger and to doe that thing wel: for in taking forth the birth, if it periſh, the colt wil die ſoone after.</p>
                     <p>Alſo in ſpaying a yeawe is daungerous, if yee hurt the bagge of birth, or periſhe any part of her tallow, ſhee is like to die ſoone after. The ſpaying of a Sow, is not ſo daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as the other, but maie eaſtlie be done in taking good heede. Alſo in the ſpaying of theſe cattell, when ye haue cut the flanke toward the hinder ribbes two fingers long ſlope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, yee ſhall put and feels with your forefinger, on both ſides the bagge or birth certaine knots like kyrnels or clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters like grapes, which doe cleaue to both the ſids of the bag or birth vnder the raines or rumpe, which yee ſhall touche them with your forefinger, and laye them downe ſoftly to the wounde, and ſo plucke them out and cut it off, and caſt it away, which is but a ſmall ſtring they hang by.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſhall ye doe in likewiſe to the other ſide of the bagge, or birth, when they be out, cut of the ſtring and it is done. If ye periſh the bagge or birth, ſhe wil ſoone die after, what beaſt ſo euer it be. Ye ſhal note alſo in the ſtitching vp the wound, if ye ſtitch the guts withall, ſhe wil die ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as I haue ſeene) except ſhe be ſoone ript and ſtitched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which is done by raſh ſpayers of beaſts in ſtitching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> guttes and the ſkin together, and ſo the beaſtes wil pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and die within few daies after. Thus much here I haue ſeene and learned for the ſpaying of theſe cattel.</p>

                     <p>ASow will haue pigges at a yeere old, and ſhe wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue good ſixe yeres, &amp; when ſhe is with pig, ye ſhall put the bore from her, for he wil hurt the pigs in her belly, and make her to caſt them. The bore wil brim, at ſixe moneths old, at eight moneths, and after three or feure yeeres yee may gelde him. A Sowe ſhoulde not bring vp aboue ſixe or eight pigs, to bring vp more: it wil make her ſoone faile. A Sow great with pig ought to haue ſties by themſelues. For if a ſow do eate her pigs it is no wonder, for ſwine can leaſt away with hunger, for they are hoate beaſts, a ſow ſhould not goe abroade in nine or ten daies after her farrowing, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrinckled tailes of hogs, is ſigne of ſound hogs. Alſo after ye cut or geld, giue them no drinke, and but a little meate. In ſpaying, looke that the ſkin be ſound, iuſt, and cloſe vp, and then annoint it with a little freſh greace, or freſh butter, note alſo, if ye plucke briſtles on the backe of a hog, if there be blood in the endes thereof, he is not then in health.</p>
                     <p>If a hogge bée ſicke of a feuer, he wil hang his head on the one ſide, and ſodaine ſtaie, be giddy and fal, Mark which ſide he holdes his head, then cut his contrary eare, and lette him bleede. Likewiſe two ynches from the rumpe, let him blood vnder the tayle, but firſt with a ſmall wande beate his tayle, and then he will bleede the better. Which blood yee ſhal ſtop with the barke of willow bounde about it, ſo keepe him in the ſtie a day or two after, and giue him warm water mixed with Barley flower. When a Hogge is not well, giue him <hi>Polypody</hi> or Oake ferne rootes boyled in beere or ale, for that wil purge him of flegme, and ſome cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſwine are moſt troubled withal. Againſt ſicknes of the lungs, put the roote of Fetterwoort through their eares, &amp; it wil help them againſt the mezell. Some huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſay, if yee nayle plates of ledde in the bottome within their troughes, it wil preſerue and keepe them
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:12686:147"/>
from being meazell. Alſo the common medicine, is allum brimſtone, red oaker, and Bay beries, of eche like, and put thereto a handful of hare foote, beaten altogether with ſome madder, and put al into a bagge, and caſt it into their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or waſh which they drinke, and ſo renew it twiſe a yere.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, ſome huſbands hold opinion that the mezelry to hogs comes not only thorow heate in Sommer, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by pouertie in Winter: alſo they ſay, if a cleane bore doe brimme a meazell ſow, he ſhal become meazell, ſo like wiſe a cleane ſow being brimde with a mexell Bore, ſhe ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe become meazel, and all thoſe piggs. The beſt time to kil a mezel bore, or hog, is after the changes of the moone. For then the curnils wil ſhew ſmalleſt.</p>
                     <p>Alſo they do feede hogges in ſome part of this Realme ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Feeding of hogs in ſtyes.</note> fatte, onely with figge duſt of Dates, which will feede them in ſhorte ſpace, ſome doe mixe it with warme water, ſome with whay, and ſome doe ſeeth it with water, and make it thicke like a groute, and in other places huſbandes doe fatte their hogs, whereas ſcant of feeding is, with peaſe, and they reſerue in leaſing their corne after harueſt all the charſe, darnell, and cockell, which they ſeeth in water, and make it thicke, &amp; ſo feede them therewith. Thus yee maie make in 14. daies good bako<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of two ynches and more thick of fat.</p>
                     <p>Alſo there is to be noted, (as ſome good huſbandes ſaie,) if ye doe fatte your hogges in a cloſure abroade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out houſing, it wilbe long eare they waxe fatte, for when a raine doth come, it doeth greatly annoye them and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their fatting, for if a hogge lye not drie, and warme, and alſo quiet: he will not bee fatte, in a long ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>Therefore when yee doe intende for to fatte hogges, put not paſt two or three at once together in the ſtye, for when yee put many together, one fighteth with another, both at meate and in lying, which wil hinder their fatting.

And thoſe moules which are in pots and cannot come out wil cry, and the reſt will heare &amp; wind them, and ſo fall vnto them in the pots, and there they wil crie and fight together.</p>
                     <p>Againe ſome do counſell in the gendring time to lead or draw a bich moule with a ſtring about the ground where the pots are ſet, and ſo put her into one of your pots, and the bucke moules will find her out by the trace, and ſo take in the ſaid pots, but ye muſt not tread nie her trare, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wil not follow her: And by this meanes ye may take manye in the ſpring time with pots.
