            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

into two partes.
A Question, and an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
for I doe not take
it to be anie Dialogue, or discourse, but a
plaine Question moued by the Iewes, to
Iohn the Baptist in the wildernes of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
by the waters of Iordan.</p>
            <p>From the building of the second Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
vntill now, they lacked Prophets, and
well worthie they were to bee without
them; for they had killed all that were
sent vnto them, as Steuen challengeth
them, Acts 7. 52. <hi>Which of the Prophets
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2290:4"/>
haue not your Fathers slaine?</hi> Nowe Iohn
comming and preaching according to
the Prophecies that went before of him,
not after the old and ordinary manner of
the Prophets: but crying: <hi>Repent for the
kingdome of God is at hand,</hi> and <hi>Baptizing,</hi>
in the wildernes: the common people, as
their maner is, to follow new things, and
to see a Prophet: hauing seen none a long
time before, they run out of all places and
come vnto him; and not the people only,
but the <hi>Pharises,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Saduces,</hi> also, Mat.
3. 7. Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iohn saw, the <hi>Pharises,</hi> the
<hi>Hypocrites</hi> of the world, come to his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
he mends his stile, and welcomes
them, as Hypocrites shoulde be welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
with <hi>O Generation of Vipers, &amp;c.</hi>
And so performed one part of his office,
which was to cast downe mountains: But
because the way was not yet plaine for
the Lord, except he filled the valleys al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and the valleys trembled nowe as it
were with an earthquake from the hils;
for the common people beeing smitten
through with feare, for the words which
he spake to the Pharises, they come and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2290:5"/>
say (<hi>what shall wee doe then?</hi>) And hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
them mildely, as it followeth in
the Text, comming to a lower kaie. And
this was their Question. The reprehenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Pharises.</p>
            <p>Now if this place seeme to any man,<note place="margin">Ob.</note>
vnmeete for our cause and occasion this
day, which is to reioice and not to heare
reproofe; who altogether are or ought
to be in thankesgiuing, for benefites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lorde (as wee all, and euerie one
haue infinite cause.)<note place="margin">So.</note> Surely he thinketh
no other thing, then I my self sometimes
did thinke: but when I doe remember the
world wherein we liue, and the prouerbe
(<hi>It is good to be merrie and wise</hi>) and call to
minde that the Prophet where hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>Kinges to serue the Lorde in feare,</hi> hee
woulde haue them to <hi>Reioice with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
also,</hi> Psal. 2. I durst not sunder
that, which hee had ioined so together.
Therefore that wee might haue a better
sight of our selues, and a more full sence
of him, with whom this day wee haue to
doe, I thought I coulde not better giue
you exhortation to thankesgiuing, then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2290:5"/>
ioined with some precepts of those due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which doe most of all expresse the
same, that neither I might runne nor you
reioice in vaine: and that <hi>the wise man
might not reioice in his wisedome, nor the
rich man in his riches, nor the strong man in
his strength, but that he that reioiceth might
reioice in the Lord,</hi> as it is in Iere. 9. 23. And
then I say not onely with the Apostle, 1.
Thess. 5. <hi>Reioice alwaies.</hi> But as he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in the 4. Phil. 4. <hi>Reioice alwaies, and
againe, I saie Reioice:</hi> and if there were
such neede, I woulde sing with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
in the 118. Psalme, <hi>This is the daie
which the Lord hath made, Come let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice
and bee glad in it;</hi> or I would daunce
with him before the Arke, or doe any
thing that might prouoke you to ioy: But
our God requireth not such outwarde
things now, let vs therefore offer him our
soules; and to giue the Prince this day
both, <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glorie,</hi> (as shee well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
at our hands) in the name of God
let euery good man striue, and straine
himselfe, (so that he bee found thankefull
vnto God.)</p>

In the Question,<note place="margin">Points no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in both parts of the Diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> brieflie you may note
these thinges, First, who moued it? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
what is the matter moued? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the manner, how they doe propose it?
Where the force of the worde appeareth
at large. Likewise if you please, you may
obserue in the Answere, 1. Who made it?
2. How hee giueth it? 3. What it is in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance?
Where the scope and purpose of
this place doth shewe it selfe vnto you:
within the compasse wherof, are rainged
many dueties of the Minister, and the
Multitude, of the Prince, and of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
of the Captaine, and his Souldiers;
that is of both states, of the church &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and in both conditions, of
Peace, and Warre.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the first, who they were that came
vnto Iohn? generally they were the Iews,
but more, specially they are said to be of
the <hi>Multitude,</hi> of the <hi>Publicanes,</hi> &amp; of the
<hi>Souldiers,</hi> that is, some of no Vocation, as
the (Multitude.) Some of publike calling,
as the (Publicanes.) And some as it were
between both, as the (Souldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mathew
recordeth, that there were some of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2290:7"/>
Rulers there also? but belike they were
too wise to bee lured so soone, Luke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
nothing of them here.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what woulde they haue?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
they seeme to aske somewhat, but they
cannot tell what? For beeing troubled
in minde and ouercome, as it were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and amazed in soul, like poore soules,
they crie out, <hi>What shall we doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, For the manner how they do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
propose it? They are nowe in iest, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to please themselues, or to displease
other, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> handled Paul in
mocking him: Actes. 17. Neither speake
they so gloriouslie, as the foolish young
man doth Mat. 19. <hi>Maister what shall I do
for eternal life?</hi> They haue no great hope
of heauen yet: their case is rather how to
auoide hell, whereof they are afraide.
Much lesse speake they malitiously for to
intangle Iohn: as the Pharises and others
often delt with Christ, they are safe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
from intangling Iohn: themselues
tumbling in Iohns nette. Beeing at a full
point, and driuen to the stand: and albeit
at the first remoue they come not so far,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2290:8"/>
as those which heard Peter preach in the
2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Acts, where three thousand had
their harts wounded, &amp; cry (<hi>Men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
what shallw doe?</hi>) who being instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
beleeued; and baptized, were added
to the Church: yet they are in the way, a
light is risen vnto them, and they begin
to grope and feele after it.</p>
            <p>As yet they seeme somewhat to sauor
of themselues: for the Multitude giuen
alwaies to extreames, either to madnes,
or feare, say (<hi>VVhat shall we doe then?</hi>) The
Publicans accustomed to flatter (an vsual
thing in Officers which gain more by lic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
than by byting,) they speake faire
(<hi>Maister) VVhat shall we doe?</hi> The Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
hoat and rough fellowes, speake after
their fashion bluntly, (<hi>And what shall wee
doe?</hi>)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Multitude,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Multitude</note> is called a <hi>Beast</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
heads; if euer it might be saide of any
Multitude, surly it might be said by right,
of the generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Iews, of that same
seede, which is saide to bee innumerable
for Multitude, Gen. 16. 10. You may haue
a patterne of this Multitude in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2290:8"/>
heere by them, which were before in
the wildernes with Moses, where forty
yeares long, they did nothing else but
grieue the Lord and his seruant Moses, or
if they shal be thought better afterwards;
when they were in <hi>Canaan,</hi> not one of the
Prophets will say so: Isay saith they are <hi>a
people whose necke is Iron, and their browe
brasse,</hi> Isay, 48. 4. And that is more then,
Moses cals the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, out of Gods owne mouth
(<hi>a people of a stiffe necke</hi>) Exo. 32. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
being taught the law so long,
and by so many Prophets, it is otherwise
with them now. Read the holy story, and
by them measure these (I confesse that of
the two, they were better then their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers)
and yet they runne ahead following
the streame, despising both Iohn and
Christ: as Christ himselfe vpbraideth
them, vnderneath a parable of <hi>Children
sitting in the market place, and playing to
their fellowes,</hi> who would neither mourne
nor be merry, for ought that they coulde
do, Mat. 11. They mocked, and more then
mocked Christ, when they assisted Iudas
the Traitor to take him, and brought him
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2290:9"/>
before <hi>Pilate,</hi> following the cause with
wonderfull importunity, crying, <hi>Crucifie
him, Crucifie him,</hi> neuer ceasing vntill the
the only sonne of God were slaughtred.
And with what successe Christ laboured
among them, with all his miracles and
mercies, and whole three yeares prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
(the Church gathered of 120.
soules or there abouts) doth witnes Act.
1. 15. And doth note the Multitude to be
both pestilent and peruerse. And surely
the religion and life of these here, coulde
not be better then theirs there; where all
things were so corrupted as they were, &amp;
yet of this Multitude, some were woonne
vnto the Gospell.</p>
            <p>Then came the <hi>Publicanes,</hi>

                  </gap>blicans</note> men worse
then the Multitude, for you may iudge of
their honestie, when you shal alwaies see
them fellowed with <hi>Harlots</hi> in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
so that a man of good name and
fame would not willingly be seene with
them: and it was obiected vnto Christ, as
a falt when at the conuersion of <hi>Mathew
the Publicane,</hi> hee did sit in his house, and
eat with them; it was saide, that <hi>hee was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2290:9"/>
a friend to Publicanes and harlots. Matth.

            <p>They were not Iewes these, but officers
for Caesar among the Iewes. (They tooke
the tribute.) If it please you to see a proud
Painter that cannot see himselfe, and yet
can draw other mens faces true inough,
read yee the 18. of <hi>Luke,</hi> where a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise</hi>
standeth praying in the Temple, and
praising God for that hee was not like to
other men, as an <hi>Extortioner, vniust,</hi> or an
<hi>adulterer,</hi> and pointing to the poore Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane,
painteth him out thus: (<hi>nor as
this Publicane?</hi>) where hee maketh him
worse then the former, which needed
not, neither did the Pharise so much
brande the Publicane there, as Christ
himselfe, which proposed that parable,
to the Pharisees, rather to shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their
shame, then to note the others sinne, But
in the 18. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> where he sets an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to reconcile men being out, &amp; would
haue a man to deale priuately with his
brother, and <hi>to tell him of his fault alone,
and if hee will not heare thee, then to take
with thee one or two witnesses: and if he will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2290:10"/>
not heare thee yet: then to complaine to the
Church, but if hee will not heare the Church:
let him be vnto thee as an Heathen &amp; a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,</hi>
that is worse than a Pagan. So that it
appeareth there, cannot be a worse man
then a Publicane, which will do wrong,
wil heare no man, nor the Church, that is
neither God nor men: and yet such are
caught here by the word.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie come the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and if it

their fellowes also, which liued after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

            <p>Who platted the crowne of thornes,

            <p>Where the vnspeakable force of the

hated the Publicanes, and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanes
the multitude, and the Soudiers

(<hi>the men of God</hi>) of the which the former
prefers the word before all other things,
and the latter doth almost fellowe men
with Angels, but our point now, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider

which you may see here to be, as it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed

<hi>Quicke and mightie in operation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I speake not of the worde the (<hi>Sonne</hi>)
and substance of his father, but of that
worde, which bringeth the trueth, which
is from euerlasting. As the <hi>Sunne</hi> by his
beames brings downe the light vnto the
worlde, which light was made before the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2290:11"/>
Sunne. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. John cals himself a <hi>voice,</hi>
but not the <hi>worde,</hi> much lesse the <hi>Trueth.</hi>
As the voice is before the word, so trueth
is before them both, of the which truth,
mortall men shoulde neuer bee capable
without the worde, for by the worde the
sonne of righteousnes doth arise vnto vs,
and by the worde things passed and to
come, are made present to our faith.</p>
            <p>After manie waies and diuerslie, this
worde was giuen in former age, as by
<hi>Dreames, Visions, Reuelations</hi> and <hi>Angels,
&amp;c.</hi> But in these latter daies after one v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niforme
manner and order, namely by
the <hi>Sonne, the Lord and heire of all</hi> Heb. 1. 2
A comparison here of the Law and gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
(as two stones smitten together cast
foorth fire) would giue a light; but I had
rather applie my selfe vnto the Gospell,
whereof I am a minister.</p>
            <p>And in the gospell how manie Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors
hath the spirit, to expresse this one
thing vnto vs, for after manie proper E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithetes.
As the <hi>word of faith and trueth,</hi>
The <hi>immortall seede, 2. Pet. 1. The power of
God to saue, Rom.</hi> 1. and the like, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2290:12"/>
to <hi>leauen</hi> for seasoning, to <hi>honie</hi> for
swetening; to the <hi>hammer,</hi> for breaking
the harde flinte. Ier. 23. To <hi>fire,</hi> for bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the drosse. Ier. 5. To a <hi>Sword</hi> for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and to <hi>a two edged sworde,</hi> Naïe it is
said to be sharper the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any <hi>two edged sword</hi>
Heb. 9. 12. The one can but enter the
bodie, and pearce the bones, or if it can
deuide betweene the bodie and the soule
it is all. But this sworde called <hi>the sworde
of the spirit.</hi> Eph. 6. can deuide betweene
the <hi>Soule</hi> and the <hi>spirite,</hi> Gaging the hare
and renting the raines: where no other
sworde, no not that brandishing firie
sword of the <hi>Angel</hi> that kept the garden
of Paradise, can come. Gen. 3.</p>
            <p>Neither are these things spoken of the
worde, as it goeth out of the mouth of
God; for so it exceedeth, as it proceedeth
out of the mouth of Christ, which Iohn
saw as a <hi>Sharp two edged sword:</hi> Reu. 1. 16.
but as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth out the mouth of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;
therefore Peter when he called it the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
seede:</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 23. hee addeth
straight, <hi>&amp; this is the word which we preach
vnto you:</hi> &amp; Paul doth not say the (<hi>word,</hi>)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2290:12"/>
but, (<hi>wee) are the sauor of life or death:</hi> 2.
Cor. 2. 16. I graunt that a hart well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
as an instrument well tuned, doth
sooner answere the sweetnes of it, when
it soundeth) but where is that heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the worde hath made him such a
one? likewise I confesse that men by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
thereof, doe make it weake and
wearish to themselues, but if the worde
bee weake to saue, take heede, for it is
strong to destroye: Water searcheth and
Winde shaketh mightie thinges, and the
voyce of thunder smiteth with terror
the harts of Lyons. Psal. 29. But al these
things can nothing moue <hi>Mans hart,</hi> as
the word doth, which woorketh power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
as well in good, as bad, learned as
vnlearned, Kings, as Priuate persons: In
all men that heare it, one way or other,
it woundeth as well Caine, as Dauid, &amp;
Saul, and Achab, as Iosias and Hezekias;
as well Iudas, as Peter, but after a diuers
maner. <hi>Baltasar</hi> the King when he saw it
written, his loynes loosed Dan. 5. 6. <hi>Iosias</hi>
hearing it read, his heart fayled: 2. Reg.
22. 11. (but after an other sorte.) Why,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2290:13"/>
the <hi>Prophets</hi> themselues, when they were
made but messengers thereof to other
men they crie out, one, <hi>O my loynes, my

Abac. 3. 16? For <hi>it searcheth all the bowels,</hi>
Prou. 20. 27. and cutteth as it goeth with

the soule.</p>
            <p>It sleyeth the wicked man aliue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee woulde fayne haue it die in
a tempest, when he heareth it: yet it leads
him into a <hi>Labirinth</hi> and leaues him not
vntill it sende him to <hi>death,</hi> or <hi>desperation.
Antichrist</hi> if euer hee shall receiue his
deathes wounde, it is not with Iron or
steele but with the <hi>breath of Gods mouth,</hi>
that is the word. 2. Thess. 2. 8. The <hi>Diuell</hi>
himselfe is put to flight in the desert with
no other instrument then with the word.
Matth. 9.</p>
            <p>And it is a wonderfull aduantage that
<hi>Sathan</hi> hath against <hi>Christ</hi> in that he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the first possession in all men, and
except hee were more stronge in deede,
that commeth afterwards, there were no
hope of euer recouering anie one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:2290:13"/>
But these conuerted are good witnesses
here, who is greater, <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>Sathan:</hi> and
not onely these, but their <hi>Corrupters</hi> and
<hi>Captaines</hi> also; euen the <hi>Pharises</hi> and <hi>Sadu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
doe witnesse the same thing, who are
said to be conuerted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.
Men doe verie hardly change their minds;
especially, if they bee <hi>Learned,</hi> or <hi>Rich:</hi> and
hence groweth all the mischiefe among vs,
that men proue <hi>Pharises</hi> in the Church, &amp;
<hi>Cammels</hi> in the common welth: <hi>Knowledge</hi>
maketh not the Pharise, but the proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
nor <hi>Riches</hi> make a Cammel, but wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse;
by which meanes, if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
<hi>Sathan</hi> would stoppe all the course of
the word, but he cannot, for what Ground
the gospel, the <hi>Worde,</hi> hath woon in the

this day, doth confesse, to the glorie
and praise of God, saying, that <hi>The truth is
great, and hath preuailed,</hi> and praying that
it may preuaile for euermore. Amen.</p>
            <p>All these here, as it were with one voice,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2290:14"/>
do acknowledge their sinne past, and their
present ignorance: O when wil our <hi>People,</hi>

will they say, <hi>What shall wee doe?</hi> I would
they woulde but say, <hi>What haue wee done?</hi>
wee could answere them to both, in two

this? (<hi>doe the contrarie.</hi>) Some there are
that can speak smoothly enough, as it were

            <p>You haue heard and heard againe, this
word which is so effectuall heere, but we
haue neither hard, nor seene of any great
successe thereof in you, the fault is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
either in the worde, or in vs, or
else in you; let vs al cleare the word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the <hi>Immortall seede.</hi> And do not
you accuse vs, seeing we neuer sowed the
seede which bringeth foorth that fruite
whereof wee haue cause to complaine,
we make your selues the Iudges, as God
doth make his owne people, Esa. 5. It is
the <hi>Enuious man</hi> hath done it, to whom
you haue yelded rather then vnto vs, for
you will heare when &amp; who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you please,
what and howe you list, there is no rule
with the multitude: teach them and they
will teach you: for euerie man maketh a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2290:15"/>
crosse of his duetie: And albeit they are
not full so bad as those which answered
the Prophet plainely, <hi>We will not do what
thou commandest vs,</hi> Ier. 6. Yet they are
nothing neere so good, as those which
said to Moses, <hi>what soeuer thou commandest
vs, we will doe,</hi> Exo. 19. I would they were
but so forward as these, to say (<hi>What shall
we doe?</hi>) (except they feare the statute of
troubling vs in preaching) which in such
a case I thinke they needed not to feare.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>vertue</hi> and force, which wee
haue shewed to be in the word, commeth
neuer out of the word, but as fire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
out of flint, when it is striken: the
word read profiteth, but to prepare men
for their teachers. Most true was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> Acts 8. When <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
asked him whether hee vnderstood
that he read, he saith, <hi>How can I, without
an interpretor: Faith commeth by hearing</hi> of
the worde, all sides doe consent, but the
question is whether it bee wrought in vs
by the word preached or read? they that
doubt, let them consider the place, <hi>Rom.
10.</hi> 14. and tell mee whether they finde
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2290:15"/>
not, that that hearing, which doth ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
beleeving, be not inseparablie tied to
Preaching, or no. I would not that men
should learne from hence to despise the
reading of Scriptures: (as some haue
done) seing it hath his singular vse in the
Church, But that men so esteeme of vs, as
of the <hi>Ministers of Christ,</hi> that is as <hi>The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposers
of the secrets of God:</hi> 1. Cor. 4.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Position and Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is necessary, and not to be denyed, that
there must be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teaching in the Church,
not onely <hi>Apt to teach,</hi> but they must
teach, except it shall fare with them as it
doth with (<hi>Genus</hi>) in Logicke, to preach
<hi>Potentially;</hi> The labour of an Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
returnes into a ring, that is, it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no ende, and <hi>You are the Lords husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie,</hi>
1. Cor. 3. Wherefore there are two
other Requisites, which hee may not bee
without. 1. <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> to giue meate
and not poyson: The second, <hi>Wisdome,</hi> to
giue to euery man his owne portion, and
that in season too, Luke 12. 42.</p>
            <p>And all this is nothing yet, without the

it, but you haue lost the fruit thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you haue it not: &amp; if it be true, that

descend, no spirit of ours, (not so much as

reason, why Iohn caught so many here, &amp;
Peter more, in the 2. of the Acts. and Paul
more then they both: whereas Christ
himself (whom I hope you do not thinke
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2290:16"/>
inferiour vnto these) who is the Lord; yet
doth conuert fewer then they doe, I
speak of the externall dispensation of his
Ministery in the worlde, for otherwise I
know that neuer any yet was conuerted,
or shall hereafter be conuerted for euer,
but Christ must conuert him; And the
reason of successe in all our labor, is only
of the spirit, who in Iohn 3. is compared
to the <hi>Winde,</hi> which bloweth, <hi>when and
where it listeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith and religion do come with a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but take you alwaies heede of those
spirits which come vnto you without the
worde, there be too many of them in the
world, which are both fanaticall, freneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
and satanicall: therefore after the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and distinction made betweene
<hi>God, and Men,</hi> then obserue you but the
order of the spirit, when he giueth grace,
or increase, not without planting, &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
neither before, but after; as you
may sufficiently perceaue in these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts:

was <hi>the voice of a crier in the wilderness, &amp;c.</hi>
and not only so, but it is further affirmed,
that he was a <hi>Prophet, and more then a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
beeing of all the Prophets, the very
last, and next forerunner vnto Christ,
whose way he made right, and his paths

himselfe to the chiefe, and is not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
backe with the respect of any feare,
or danger, but prouoketh euen them, that

they knew how to strike a dog. His faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
made him bolde, and a bolde Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
is good, but a <hi>bolde man,</hi> and a <hi>colde
Prophet,</hi> are both naught.</p>
            <p>Christ called him <hi>Elias,</hi> for his spirite
surely hee might haue called him <hi>Bonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
the sonne of thunder, as the other
Iohn was called, Mat. 3. 17. for what a clap
of thunder, is this vppon the hils, first to
cal the Pharises <hi>Vipers,</hi> and after to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
them the fire? <hi>The Axe (saith he) is laid
to the roote of the tree, and euerie tree, that
bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen down,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2290:17"/>
and cast into the fire:</hi> This <hi>Axe,</hi> is death, a
violent death: the <hi>Tree,</hi> man, any man, a
Pharisee: the <hi>Fruits,</hi> are workes, and the
<hi>Fire,</hi> is hell: Hel fire. So that he threatneth
them with no lesse than with death and
damnation (as I take it) &amp; that presently
except they doe repent, for he giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
neither day nor time, so that this seemes
to sounde more terrible, than that cry of
Ionas, <hi>Yet fortie daies, and Niniuie shall
be destroied,</hi> Ionas. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>Multitude, Publicanes,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Souldiers,</hi> hearing these things, by and by
begin to looke about them, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the flame to be next the smoke, and
fearing the fire, <hi>the wrath to come,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Iohn spake, they all cry out (<hi>What shall
we doe?</hi>) Vnto whome, hee is said now to
answere, for he opposed before, and that
hardly: and he vseth so great moderation
and mildenes, as he had done seuerity &amp;
sharpenes; and how good saith Solomon
is <hi>a word spoken in season?</hi> Pro. 15. It is like a
sweet shoure, that comes after a drought,
or like a light that shineth in a darke
place. He doth not now flatter, fawning,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2290:18"/>
or fanning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with wind: he leaueth that
vnto the <hi>Politiques</hi> of the worlde, which
throughly serue their God, with reuiling
the good, &amp; praising of the bad, but Iohn
speaketh, though sometimes sharpely, &amp;
sometimes smoothly; yet alwaies truely,
charitably, and to the purpose: let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
his answere.
<q>He that hath two Coates,<note place="margin">

him that hath none.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The first Answere is to the <hi>Multitude,</hi>
and it is very fit, and apt, to perswade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to be mercifull, which seeke mercy them
selues;<note place="margin">Ob.</note> But for all that, it seemes scarce
sound, and perfect counsell, whereof the
people can receiue no profit; for God is
not pleased with good deedes for our ill?
as if there were a lawe to bind him either
to <hi>Accept,</hi> or to <hi>Except,</hi> the one, for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the Iewes did thinke him bounde
by the law, for <hi>Sin,</hi> to take a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and
for a <hi>Soule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">So.</note> a <hi>Sheepe?</hi> I answere, it is true,
that there is nothing in al the <hi>Law,</hi> which
may comfort the <hi>Offendor,</hi> because hee is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2290:18"/>
vnder the <hi>Curse:</hi> and therefore if hee had
shapte his answere out of the lawe? Hee
might haue answered thus? <hi>Perish</hi> and
<hi>Dispaire:</hi> but hee answereth them out of
the <hi>Gospel:</hi> &amp; for many reasons chooseth
the workes of <hi>Charitie,</hi> which he vrgeth
not after the Lawe, but after the Gospel.
And therefore this exhortation depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vppon another <hi>Principle,</hi> and on a
newe <hi>Lawe,</hi> where, to the <hi>Repentant,</hi> his
sinnes are assured to bee remitted: and in
lieu of thankefulnes, a better life is inioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Wherefore hee doth not further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
them now, but spareth them, that
as <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Euangelist,</hi> after the voice of
<hi>Thunder,</hi> heard the voice of <hi>Harpers</hi> from
Heauen, Reuel. 14. 2. So these might hear
of <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> after Anger, Fauour:
and might see after Fire, Water: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
after Commination, Exhortation:
wherein hee handleth them so tenderly,
as the <hi>Samaritan</hi> did the wounded man:
pouring in <hi>olde wine,</hi> and not <hi>new,</hi> for feare
of breaking their <hi>old Bottels,</hi> for he knows
that <hi>the bruised Reede must not be be broken,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2290:19"/>
nor the smoking flaxe be quenched,</hi> Isay. 42. 3.
And therefore wils them rather to <hi>breake
their sinnes by Almes-deedes,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> did
perswade <hi>Nabuchadnezar,</hi> Dan. 4. 24.
Not with any Goates offered vnto God:
but with some <hi>Coates</hi> giuen to poore
men, <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> were Ceremonies which
had their time, but <hi>Loue</hi> is a seruice of all
times both to <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>Man;</hi> and it is most
necessarily required heere for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and respects. First, for the <hi>Multitude,</hi>
as the best thing in their case: <hi>For perfect
loue casteth out feare,</hi> 1. Iohn 4. 18. and (I
thinke they were afraide.) Secondly, for
the <hi>Church,</hi> whose necessitie coulde not
choose but be infinite then in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
when <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and <hi>Tyrannie,</hi> had
possessed all. Thirdly, for <hi>Iohn</hi> himselfe,
who auoideth by it, that same suspition so
oft obiected of the Pharises vnto Christ,
(that hee spake against the lawe) as our
<hi>Pharises</hi> handle vs, because we constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirme, (<hi>That Faith onelie iustifieth</hi>) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the (<hi>Word</hi>) we haue many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
wordes for it, and though otherwise
we preach and teach good works a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2290:19"/>
times, yet it will not serue our turne.
For they conceiue of vs, as of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of all goodnes, where as it is not the
<hi>good woorke,</hi> but the <hi>merite</hi> of our good
workes that we doe so disclaime and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre.
Lastly, it serueth more for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Christ, when such a Multitude
shall be turned and changed by his word
not in <hi>Opinion</hi> onely, which often falleth
out in the common sorte, through incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie,
and temeritie, but by <hi>good works,</hi>
and such as kindely crosse the soule of an
earthly minded man, and for the which
many did depart from Christ both sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
and sad? They should now witnes
to the world, that they esteemed nothing
in comparison of the peace and quiet of
their troubled Soules.</p>
            <p>And there are but two effectes of true
Repentance; <hi>To cease from euill,</hi> and <hi>to
learne to doe good.</hi> Hee pursueth the latter,
which implieth the former: Hee might
haue said, Loue you one another: but lest
a People too much giuen to dissimulation
should only answere in word and tongue;
He calls them as Iohn doth his hearers,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2290:20"/>
1. Iohn 3. 18. Vnto the <hi>Deede</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi>
of Loue.</p>
            <p>By (<hi>Cloath,</hi> and <hi>Meate,</hi>) here he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
all our Substance: for <hi>Foode,</hi> and
<hi>Raiment,</hi> is the effect of all that a man can
haue in this world, 1. Tim. 6. 8.</p>
            <p>But who should relieue the Poore?<note place="margin">Ob.</note> the
Multitude onely?</p>
            <p>It is said to the Multitude,<note place="margin">So.</note> 
               <hi>He that hath
two Coates, let him part with him that hath
none.</hi> There are certaine speciall Dueties,
which doe concerne one, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but to giue to the Poore, belongeth
vnto all Christians, (with this prouiso) <hi>If
they haue it.</hi> For Iohn counts it a disgrace
in the Church, which is the <hi>House of God,</hi>
to see one man with two Coates, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
naked, and yet both one mans ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants:
wherefore that equality, where the
<hi>Plentie of some, supplieth the Penurie of other
some,</hi> is Christian, and not Anabaptistical,
2. Cor. 8. 14. And that inequalitie where
some doe <hi>Surfet, and others are hungrie,</hi> is
not Christian, but Diuellish, 1. Cor. 11. 21.</p>
            <p>I know the Multitude would post ouer
this lesson to the Minister: but if (as they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2290:20"/>
call vs men of a Coate) they could proue
vs to bee men of two Coates, (men that
had it, they should reproue vs the better,
(as we doe them.) If wee did it not, Rich
men would haue all the water stil fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea. Though <hi>Aarons oile,</hi> rested
not on his <hi>Heade,</hi> but ranne downe to his
<hi>Skirts,</hi> and smelt better from his <hi>Clothing</hi>
then from his <hi>Heade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 They doe but dreame that thinke
wee are commanded heere to giue halfe
our goods vnto the Poore, because it is
said (<hi>Let him part with him that hath none</hi>)
In deede <hi>Zacheus</hi> gaue halfe his goods
vnto the Poore, Luke 8. And so did <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
too: but hee perished with his wife
<hi>Zaphira,</hi> for dissimulation, Actes 5. <hi>Christ</hi>
in the 19. and 21. of Matthew, bids the
Prowd young man <hi>To sel al his goods, &amp; to
giue it to the Poore;</hi> (for harde and Knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
wood must haue Iron Wedges.) But
<hi>Iohn</hi> doth not here define, what, or howe
much we should giue, onely he mooueth
vs to keepe our Conscience in pittying of
the Poore; with such things as wee haue,
<hi>And if there be a readie minde,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2290:21"/>
               <hi>God measureth a man, according to
that he hath, and not according to that which
he hath not.</hi> 2. Cor. 8. 12. And if any man
should neglect himselfe by giuing of too
much: (which seldome falleth out) surely
he should offend against himselfe, as well
as the harde and couetous heart sinneth
against others, in giuing nothing, or too
little: And if <hi>You gaue all your goods vnto
the Poore,</hi> not your Coate onely, <hi>But your
bodie? to bee burned for them; Yet without
Charitie it were nothing.</hi> 1. Cor. 13. 3. For
as <hi>Faith</hi> without <hi>Workes</hi> is dead, so <hi>Works</hi>
without <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Loue,</hi> are in the same
Case, <hi>dead,</hi> and <hi>Damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Likewise hee doth not Counsell vs
to giue of our superfluous things, for who
counteth two Coates to be superfluous?
Nay, who holds it not verie necessarie
to haue two Coates, although for speede
in an extraordinarie Iourney, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the <hi>Disciples</hi> for the time, to haue
two Coates, Luke 9. 3. It is a sorie <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
or Seruice vnto God, to Giue of our
superfluous things? it may well serue the
Poore, but better gaue the <hi>Widdow</hi> a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2290:21"/>
little of hir pouertie, then the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
did of their abundance, great for
the heart, which God respecteth rather
then the hand; may be rich, in Pouertie: I
cannot tel what you call <hi>Superfluitie?</hi> No
man knowes what is <hi>Too much,</hi> except he
knoweth first what to call (<hi>Enough</hi>) but if
to giue where there is no need, or of those
things, which wee care not for, bee su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous:
And if there were euer any
worke of <hi>Supererogation</hi> in the world: this
is like to that, but there is no such worke,
nor can bee: for a man may as well giue
more then he hath, or doe more than hee
can doe, as doe more than he ought in
any good (all being a like impossible vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.)</p>
            <p>3 To whom must wee giue? (<hi>To him
that hath neede</hi>) that is, to him that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
then must wee giue to Couetous
men; for they haue not that they haue,
and want as well that they haue, as that
they haue not? But <hi>Iohn</hi> simplie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
vnto vs the <hi>Poore,</hi> whom Christ
would haue in his owne steed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
vntill his comming, saying, <hi>Mee
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2290:22"/>
you shall not alwayes haue with you, but the
Poore you shall haue alwayes,</hi> Iohn 12. 8.
Surely there are many <hi>Poore;</hi> and made
many wayes, as well by their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault,
as otherwise: and as they are almost
without number, so they are altogether
without order, for on <hi>Saboth</hi> daies, when
you are in your best array (they say) they
are in their worst; belike bringing their
<hi>Pouertie,</hi> or <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> abroad, to meete
with your <hi>Pride,</hi> hoping thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
your <hi>Prodigalitie</hi> or <hi>Mercie:</hi> Better
care would be had both <hi>of them,</hi> and <hi>for
them,</hi> but in the meane season thou maist
neuer despise him to whom thou maist
be like, euen when thou doest despise
him: for the <hi>Affliction of an houre wil make
the prowdest stoope and sit vpon the grounde,
and forget all former felicitie.</hi> Sirac. 11. 27.</p>
            <p>4 But what Reasons doth Iohn vse to
moue the Minde?<note place="margin">Ob.</note> for men are very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to alledge reasons not to giue; <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>

12. 1.</p>
            <p>If he had simply commanded vs; it had
beene <hi>Sinne,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> to haue denied
him, but he saith, <hi>Giue, and it shall bee giuen
vnto you,</hi> Luk. 6. 38. For thy <hi>Coate</hi> a <hi>Roabe,</hi>
for thy <hi>Breade that perisheth, the Foode of

Neither shall we want our reward in this

worlds. And godlines is <hi>profitable vnto all
thinges,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>hauing both the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2290:25"/>
promises, of this life, and of that that is to
come,</hi> 1. Tim. 4. 8. And we see, that there
are some <hi>that spend and haue the more, and
others that spare and haue the lesse, as</hi> Syrac.
11. 11. And therfore not only the <hi>Widowe</hi>
of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> found increase by giuing: for if
there bee a <hi>Sowing of Breade,</hi> as there is of
<hi>Corne,</hi> as speaketh Isai, 32. &amp; 20. And if
he that <hi>soweth liberallie, or sparinglie, shall
reape accordinglie,</hi> as saint Paule saith, 2.
Cor. 9. both the Prophet and Apostle, do
shew vs a good reason of this profit, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
that may arise by giuing; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Salomon in the 11. of Ecclesiastes,
biddeth vs to <hi>Cast out breade vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and assureth vs that <hi>After manie daies
we shall find it againe.</hi> Yet you must not vse
<hi>God</hi> for the <hi>World,</hi> for al that. A man were

but for <hi>God,</hi> neither shall any man serue
him so for nought. Therfore he that gaue
the first <hi>Coate</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; all the Coates
that Adams sons haue had, or can haue, &amp;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2290:25"/>
bids vs not to <hi>Care for raiment,</hi> Mat. 6. 28.
Who gaue, I doe not say of two one: but
his <hi>Coate</hi> vnto the Souldiers, and his <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi>
and <hi>Soule,</hi> vnto the sorrowes of <hi>Death,</hi>
and <hi>Hell</hi> for thee. Who saith, <hi>Aske and you
shall receaue,</hi> Mat. 7. 7. Let not him aske of
vs, &amp; go without: or if the <hi>Promises</hi> of god
cannot perswade vs, yet let the <hi>Iudgments</hi>
of God preuaile, to prouoke vs. For hee
shall surely reckon with all them, that
haue woonne this <hi>Worlde,</hi> and lost their
<hi>Soules:</hi> that haue giuen him, either no
<hi>Drinke,</hi> or <hi>Vineger</hi> and <hi>Gall</hi> to drinke, and
as he will recompence any thing in <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
that will recompence to a <hi>Cup of cold
water,</hi> so he will denie any thing in <hi>Iustice</hi>
that denied <hi>Diues</hi> one drop of water: and
in that day only <hi>Mercie shall reioice against
Iudgement,</hi> Iacob. 2. 13.</p>
            <p>But doe I hope that this doctrine shall
take place in these daies, in which <hi>Christ</hi>
hath saide that <hi>Charitie shall waxe colde?</hi> I
doe not expect it, for if Loue should <hi>Rule,</hi>
then God should <hi>Raigne,</hi> for hee is <hi>Loue:</hi>
but the god of this world cannot abide
that, and therefore hee hath sowne all
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2290:26"/>
things ful of <hi>Hatred,</hi> yea euen the Church
hir selfe with the seeds of <hi>Discord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church.</note> which
albeit shee be but <hi>One,</hi> yet shee is not in
<hi>one Vnion,</hi> but laboureth with the paine of
hir wombe, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> did, for the strife
of <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp; <hi>Esau,</hi> Gen. 25. 22. I know now
that I haue a <hi>Woolfe</hi> by the eares, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell whether I should hold him, or let
him goe, (for both is dangerous) I choose
this Text to misse him, and yet he meetes
me, and so meetes me, that I cannot well
auoide him. If the daies were no better
for <hi>Lawiers</hi> to pleade in, then they are for
<hi>Vs</hi> to preach in, I thinke they would hold
their peace: but wee must not hold our
peace, for our tongues are <hi>Trumpets,</hi> not
(<hi>Firebrands</hi>) nor (<hi>Fig-leaues</hi>) but <hi>Trumpets</hi>
to giue warning of any euill approching,
Esay. 58. 1.</p>
            <p>And how euill a thing <hi>Contention is in
the Church,</hi> we haue no neede of forraine
<hi>Stories,</hi> or discourse to learne: our home
maladies, and miseries can teach vs, but
too well: For <hi>Discorde,</hi> hath separated vs
one from another, for all good purposes,
as <hi>Death;</hi> but sets vs one against another,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2290:26"/>
for al euil as the <hi>Diuel.</hi> Wherefore as the
Apostle aduiseth vs in the 16. to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
17. verse, <hi>They are to be noted which
cause this diuision,</hi> &amp; distractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among vs.</p>
            <p>The old faction, which was, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
still, is two fold, of the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
and of the <hi>Papists:</hi> and these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
our Church mightilie, as <hi>Aram</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

and <hi>Manasses</hi> against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and both
against <hi>Iuda,</hi> haue deuowred more. Esa.
9. 21.</p>
            <p>What is the cause? the Cause? of all
this diuision and adoe? for albeit it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
Christians, to imbrace Peace
offring her selfe, and to followe after
her, flying away; because wee can no
lesse lacke <hi>Loue</hi> &amp; <hi>Vnitie</hi> in the Church,
than we may lacke the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone</hi>
in the world: yet notwithstanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
may not so agree, as to betray the
trueth? Why that is the cause say some?
I aske then what truth? I doe not say as
<hi>Pilate</hi> did to Christ, Iohn 18. 38. What
is truth? But what truth? for I hope they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2290:27"/>
be not so foolish, to vnderstand the wise
man, Sirac. 4. 28. <hi>For the trueth contend
vnto death:</hi> Of euerie trueth? If they
coulde Aunswere mee, and Aunswere
truely, that it is for that trueth which
is saide, Iohn 8. 32. <hi>To make vs free,</hi> that
is, for the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and for <hi>Christ:</hi> surely
as well as I loue Peace, I woulde say,
Contende and striue still, and except
there may be <hi>Veritie,</hi> let there be no <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi>
for we haue a iust cause and quarrell
against all the Enimies of that trueth, as
are the two Sects aboue named, and hee
that hath had <hi>Zeale</hi> and stomake against
them, &amp; now hath none, is either <hi>Demas,</hi>
or <hi>Iudas,</hi> chuse him whiter.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, to pretend such a
cause, &amp; not to proue it, or if there be any
other good cause, as <hi>The redresse of some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses</hi>
(which no man in his wits wil deny
to be a good cause) yet to follow it out of
time, and Place, by importunitie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully,
by false, or foolish Libels, which
in deede leaue the Cause, and flie to the
person; and tende to nothing but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke;
I suppose that no wise man can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2290:27"/>
the course; sure I am, the euill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
thereof doth disalowe it; and if his
name should answere his doing herein,
as it seemeth hee woulde haue it by the
<hi>Title,</hi> and <hi>Purpose</hi> of his bookes, sure hee
shoulde bee called for <hi>Marre Prelate,
Marre Preacher:</hi> for there are fewer of
these, and no lesse of those, if not more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
since hee practised so to marre them; I
Iudge not thinges onely by the issue and
euent, but I wish that he had beene more
sober, or more silent.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I exhort both the one, and
the other, (for what haue I to doe with
sides) that they play not in the Church,
as men doe that are fallen out in the
Common welth; where both will be tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of right, but neither wil cease, from
doing of Wrong: So let none pretend
<hi>Conscience</hi> when it is <hi>Couetousnesse,</hi> nor
<hi>Zeale,</hi> when it is <hi>Malice,</hi> and so by bitter
strife &amp; stomake, seeke one to denowre
another, making the <hi>Babilonian</hi> noise,
for the spoile of that <hi>Temple,</hi> which at his
first setting vp, and long after, had no
such noise in it. There was not hearde
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2290:28"/>
the noyse of a <hi>Hammer</hi> at the setting
vp of the Temple, 1. Reg. 6. 7. but the
<hi>Babilonians</hi> made the Noise in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of it downe, 2. Chron. 36. 19.
Wherfore let vs not speake, as the Priests
doe, in the 11. of Iohn 48. <hi>If we let Christ
thus alone, all men will beleeue in him, and
the Romaines will come and take away our
Place, and the Nation,</hi> but rather let vs say,
and assure our selues; that if wee let him
not alone, and beleeue not better in him,
but stande deuiding both his <hi>Coate,</hi> and
<hi>Bodie,</hi> by vnreconciliable hatred among
our selues; Hee will send them, that will
come, and take <hi>all:</hi> and the <hi>Romaines</hi> be
verie readie to be sent.</p>
            <p>Likewise they are to bee admonished
that sill the <hi>Pulpit</hi> too ful with these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies,
I doe not meane our <hi>Lunatike
libellers,</hi> which cast phrases on both sides,
as madde men doe hurle stones, but I
meane <hi>Men</hi> of my owne Profession and
minde, that they consider; that the <hi>Pope</hi>
hath had too long a <hi>Pause,</hi> and hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ground apace, since wee haue spent
our breath about these things, for how so
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2290:28"/>
euer <hi>Martin</hi> flies, he lies in the winde to
make <hi>Martyrs</hi> of vs, and liues as the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamander</hi>
doeth, the better for the fire;
Wherefore the <hi>Prophets</hi> are to be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by a more certaine sounde of the
<hi>Trompe,</hi> to oppose themselues to
<hi>Anhchrist,</hi> and not to pursue so whotly, a <hi>dead
Dogge,</hi> or a <hi>Flie,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith to <hi>Saul,</hi>
1. Sam. 24. 1,. They are to bee counted
our enimies that are <hi>Gods</hi> enimies, and
hate our faith, which stand not vpon smal
difference, but vpon plaine defiance with
vs: and all the other odds is nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that. If <hi>Isaac</hi> may be knowne from <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,
Iacob</hi> from <hi>Esau,</hi> a <hi>Protestant</hi> from a
<hi>Papist,</hi> and the Contrarie; all lesser con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies
should be left off, or followed
in Loue; for the Churches sake: and <hi>The
fruite of Righteousnesse, is sowen in Peace of
them that make Peace,</hi> saith Iames, 3. cap.
18. And when <hi>Paul, Apollos</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi>
shall agree, yet shall you finde the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the people to bee diuision still, as
it was among the Corinthians, 1. Epist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
3. and the Prophets shall haue Worke
enough to vnite, and knitte, their minds
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2290:29"/>
togither, the <hi>Worde</hi> is able to doe it,
and you see by this <hi>Multitude,</hi> it hath
done it; &amp; when that is done, then though
one should say, <hi>I am the Lords, another call
himselfe Iacob, and the third subscribe with
his hand vnto the Lorde, and name himselfe
Israel,</hi> that is, (vse many &amp; diuers names,)
as it is Isa. 44. 5. It shall be no matter, for
all is one thing, when the <hi>Heart</hi> is one.</p>
            <p>I haue ouershot my selfe, and therefore
