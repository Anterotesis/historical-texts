            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His whole undertaking was vowed to your
great name, and this peece of it in writing
presented to your Noble hands, before the
Lord, and the State had placed you in that
high Station in which you now stand: And as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but applaud the happy Prognostick of mine
own thoughts, which found out such a Patron for
<hi>The Harmony of the Evangelists,</hi> as the high Court of
heaven, and of <hi>England</hi> have since called out to bee
the Patron of the <hi>Gospel</hi> it selfe: So can I not but
bewaile the unhappy condition of mine own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilities;
which can neither present any thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then what I now publish, to so great a person:
<pb facs="tcp:52154:3"/>
nor yet could publish any whit sooner, that which <hi>I</hi>
then presented, though it had been better. <hi>Your</hi>
Excellencies candor will helpe to excuse both the
one failing and the other, [give me leave to presage
it] since I know such noblenesse as yours, accepteth
according to what a man hath, and expecteth not
according to what hee hath not. Mine addresse
in this kinde unto your Self, <hi>I</hi> shall not go about to
excuse, but must rather justifie, and though it bee
exceeding bold, yet to mee it seems exceeding rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.
For to whom should a <hi>Staffordshire</hi> student
devote his studies, but to the glory of <hi>Staffordshire?</hi>
and whither should a Treatise upon the <hi>Gospels</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
for patronage, but to the great Patron of the
<hi>Gospel? I</hi> know mine own unsufficiency for such a
work, and am conscious to my self of my many fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in the managing of it, yet could <hi>I</hi> not but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it, in hope of some profit to the Reader;
nor could I but addresse it to such a Patron, in hope
of some intertainment with your Excellency.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Harmony of the Evangelists</hi> in our <hi>English</hi>
tongue is rare to find, especially with that proofe of
the order of the story, and that illustration of the
Text and Language, that a thing of that nature
doth require, &amp; that it hath found in other tongues.
Mine own heart did tell mee, that <hi>I</hi> of all others
was most unfit and unable for such an undertaking
in regard of want of parts, means, and opportunity;
yet could <hi>I</hi> not desist from such an attempt, but
<pb facs="tcp:52154:3"/>
must needs try what <hi>I</hi> could do in this kind, partly
that <hi>I</hi> might bring something toward the building
of the Tabernacle, though it were never so small,
and chiefely that <hi>I</hi> might stir up some pen of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ability, to set to a work of so brave import.</p>
            <p>An assay and tryall of some of my progresse in
such an undertaking, <hi>I</hi> doe here most humbly lay
at your Excellencies feet, and that not onely as an
Oblation tendered to your noblenesse this once,
but also as an earnest of a future tribute of this
kind, till the whole work bee finished, and the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
compleated, if <hi>God</hi> vouchsafe health, strength,
and opportunity, and your Excellency acceptance,
countenance, and incouragement: There is nothing
in the workman, or the workmanship, that can
ground any hope for any such thing, from you, but
there is enough in your own known worth, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and noble disposition, to make me confident,
that you will not onely not reject the work, but
that you will also accept the workman for the
workes sake, because the subject of it is the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists.</hi>
It is now become your honourable profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to bee <hi>the Champion of the Gospel,</hi> and the Lord
hath installed you in an Order, of which, to a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
a <hi>Sweden,</hi> and an <hi>Essex, I</hi> know not what Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
can adde a fourth, that hath been the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
Knight,</hi> or the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> How
you have honoured this your Order, by your great
atchievements, and how the great trust reposed in
<pb facs="tcp:52154:4"/>
you, hath met with as great trustinesse, it is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
of the <hi>Nation</hi> to have tryed, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and it cannot but bee the rejoycing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of your poore suppliant to thinke of, and to
consider: For to have to deale with so constant
worthinesse, noblenesse, and candor, with so great
piety, zeale, religiousnes, and honour, with so much
accomplishment, excellency, and splendor, cannot
but promise a comfortable accesse, a cheerfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
and a desired issue. I have no more to
say [for short speech best agreeth with your great
imployments] but only this, to beg of your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
that among the serious cares and thoughts of
your noble heart, you would remember our poore
wrong'd <hi>Staffordshire</hi> for good: and labour her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
not only from her open enemies, but also from
her seeming friends which do worse devour her.</p>
            <p>And to the Throne of grace it must bee my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
suite and petition, that the Lord would
Crown all your great ingagements with happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
make you stil a blessing, and rejoycing to the

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He veile of the Sanctuary was supported by foure
Pillars,<note place="margin">Exod. 36. 31, 32.</note> and wrought with great variety of workes
and colours: So is the Story of the veile of Christs
flesh by the foure Evangelists, and the Texture of
it of like variety. For one relateth what another hath omitted,
one more largely, what another more briefe, one more plaine,
what another lesse, one before what another after, one after one
manner, and another after another: And so they bring their
severall peeces of Imbroidery, differing in colours, but not in
substance, various in workmanship, but not in the ground-work,
to constitute and make up a perfect and sacred Tapestry and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
in the House of the Lord: And carrying severall faces
in the manner of their writing and composall, like those living
Creatures in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> yet they sweetly and
Harmoniously meet together in the one body and compacture of a
perfect Story.</p>
            <p>To sew these parcels together into one piece, and so to dispose
and place them in their proper order, as the continuance and
Chronicall method of the History doth require, is, <hi>hic labor hoc
opus,</hi> a thing of no small paines and difficulty, and yet a thing
that with paines and industry may bee brought to passe: For in
many passages and dislocations the Text hath shewed the proper
place of such dislocated parcels, and the proper way and manner
to joine them where they should bee joyned, so plainely; and in all
places it hath hinted this so surely, though sometimes more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely,
that serious study and mature deliberation, may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb facs="tcp:52154:5"/>
fix and settle them. Divers great and learned Pens
have laboured in this worke, both Ancient and Moderne, both
Romish and Protestant, but hardly any, if any at all, in our owne
mother Tongue, so fully and largely as a Worke of this nature doth
require: this hath incited me, though the unfittest of all others, for a
taske of so much Learning, Judgement, and Seriousnesse, to
attempt this worke; and if possibly my dimnesse might, to give
some light and facility to the History of the Gospel, and if my
poorenesse could, some contribution towards the building of <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Method that I prescribed to my self in this undertaking
[some glimpse whereof thou maist see in this present Parcell]
was, 1. To lay the Text of the Evangelists in that order, which
the nature and progresse of the Story doth necessarily require.
2. To give a Reason of this Order, why the Text is so laid, more
largely or more briefly, according as the plainness, or difficulty
of the connexion doth call for it. 3. To give some account
of the difficulties in the language of the Originall, as any came
to hand, either being naturally so in the Greek it selfe, or being
made difficulties when they were not so, by the curiosity, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construction,
or self-end-seeking of some Expositors. 4. And
lastly, to cleare and open the sense and meaning of the Text all
along as it went, especially where it was of more abstrusenesse
and obscurity.</p>
            <p>These two last things did I assay and goe on withall a great way
in the worke, with much largenesse and copiousnesse, both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the language, and the manner. For, for the first, I did
not onely poise the Greek in the ballance of its owne Country, and
of the Septuagint, but I also examined translations in divers
languages, produced their sense, and shewed cause of adhering to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or refusing of their sense, as I conceived cause.</p>
            <p>And for the second, I alledged the various Expositions and
interpretations of Commentators, both ancient and moderne, and
others that spake to such and such places occasionally, I examined
<pb facs="tcp:52154:5"/>
their Expositions, and gave the Reader reason to refuse or imbrace
them as cause required. When seeing the Worke in this way likely to
rise to va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nes of bulke it selfe, and of trouble to the Reader, I chose
to abridg this first part for a tryall, and therein having expressed only
those things which were most materiall for the understanding of the
Text where it is lesse plain [for where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne enough, why should

upon it, and omitted [unlesse it be for a tast of what I had done] the
glosses and thoughts of others: I now wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the other parts that are to follow [by Gods good blessing and
assistance] in that large and voluminous method that at the first I
prescribed to my selfe, or in that succisenesse that this present parcell
holdeth out.</p>

be in an annuall tribute to that great name, and to that glory of mine
own Country, yea, of this our Nation, our Renowned Lord Generall,
to whom this undertaking was devoted from the very first thought of
such an undertaking: And I have been constrained thus to doe, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because of mine other occasions, many an lurgent, which deny me
opportunity to follow that businesse as such a bulk would require: and

this being so copious and frequent in the Old Testament, the like will
be thought the lesse strange and uncouth in the New.</p>

speciall notice and observation; and of all other,
that of our Saviours birth, being the fulnesse of time,
may best, as best worthy, make such a challenge. A
time, to which all the holy ones that went before it,
did bend their eyes and expectation, and a time from which all the
Christians that have lived since, have dated their Chronicall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
and computation. And yet how unfixed is this time and age
of the world, in which so great a mys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ery came to passe, and upon
which so generall accounting doth depend, in the various reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of learned and industrious men? It is not onely to bee seen in
their writings, wondered at in regard of the great difference at
which they count, but the fixed time is the more to bee studied for,
upon this very reason, because such men do so greatly differ among
themselves. The onely way to settle in such variety, is to take the
plain and cleere account and reckoning of the Scripture, which hath
taken a peculiar care to give an exact and most certain Chronicle to
this time, and not to rely upon the computation of <hi>Olympiade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls,
or any other humane calculation, which it cannot bee doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
must of necessity leave the deepest student of them in doubting
and uncertainty. Now the Scripture carrying on a most faithfull
reckoning of the times, from the beginning of time to this fulnesse
of it, hath laid this great, wondrous, and happy occurrence of the
birth of the Redeemer in the yeere of the world, three thousand nine
hundred twenty and eight. Which that wee may make good, and
fixed among so much variety and difference, may the Reader gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have the patience to see and to examine the particular summes
by which the Scripture accounteth to make up this totall, and to
<pb facs="tcp:52154:7"/>
study upon those scruples in the severall parcells where they come
that make the account intricate and doubtfull, and to judge upon
those resolutions and satisfactions that shall bee tendered for the
cleering and untying of those scruples.</p>
            <p>And, surely, though the businesse may bee something long and
difficult, which wee shall propose and lay before him, yet doubt I
not, but the profit will fully countervaile his labour, when hee shall
not onely bee resolved of the certainty of the time, which wee now
have occasion, and every Christian hath cause to looke after, but
when hee shall also see, and that, I suppose, not without admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the wondrous and mysterious, and yet alwayes instructive stile,
and manner of accounting used by the Holy Ghost, in most sacred
Majesticknesse, and challenging all serious study and reverence; And
though also this businesse may seem to bee something too <hi>Parergon,</hi>
and excentrick to the main work that wee have before us, the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monizing
of the Evangelists, yet since a prime thing that wee are to
inquire after in the very entrance of this story of our Saviours life,
is, the fixed and certain time of his birth, the Reader will bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to excuse a fault on the right hand, rather then on the left, and
to dispense with too much desire to give satisfaction, rather then too
little, or with none at all.</p>

that the promise was given to <hi>Abram</hi> in the yeere of the
world two thousand eighty three.</p>
               <p>But here is the great question moved, Whether <hi>Abram</hi> were the
eldest son of <hi>Terah,</hi> yea or no? If hee were, then was hee born when
<hi>Terah</hi> was 70 yeeres of age, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 26. and not as this Table lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, at his 130. And if hee were not his eldest son, why hath <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
named him first of all his sonnes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> First, Hee was not his eldest Sonne: for, 1. Hee marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his brother <hi>Harans</hi> daughter [for so all men hold <hi>Sarah</hi> to have
been] and shee was but ten yeeres younger then himself, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 17.
which was impossible, if her Father were younger then hee. 2. Hee
is said to bee but 75 yeeres old, when hee departed out of <hi>Hanan, Gen.
12.</hi> 4. And this was after his Fathers death, <hi>Act. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Now had hee
been born at <hi>Terahs</hi> 70, he had been 135 yeeres old when his Father
dyed: Wee must therefore compute and reckon backward thus, that
since hee was but 75 yeeres old when his Father dyed, it must needs
bee concluded that hee was born when <hi>Terah</hi> was 130. as is laid
down in the Table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Secondly, Hee is reckoned first of <hi>Terahs</hi> sonnes, as <hi>Sem</hi>
is of <hi>Noahs,</hi> not because hee was the first in time, but the first in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
For that <hi>Sem</hi> was not the eldest sonne of <hi>Noah,</hi> is cleere by
<pb facs="tcp:52154:8"/>
comparing these places, <hi>Gen. 5. 32. Noah</hi> was 500 yeeres old when
hee begat his first sonne, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 11. when <hi>Noah</hi> was fix hundred
yeeres old, was the Flood of waters upon the earth, and then was
one of his sonnes an hundred yeeres old: But <hi>Sem</hi> was not so till
two yeeres after, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 10. And yet is hee ever named the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t of
his sonnes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 32. &amp; 6. 10. &amp; 7. 13. &amp; 9. 18. &amp; 10.</p>
               <p>There are some, that not content with this plain, necessary, and
undenyable explication of the difficulty, do hold that <hi>Abram</hi> took
two journeys into <hi>Canaan,</hi> one before his Fathers death, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
after: whereas <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Steven</hi> well compared together, do
plainly shew the contrary, and fully, and sufficiently cleere the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under scruple: That which hath made men to fall into the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
of his two journies into <hi>Canaan</hi> hath been this, that they have
taken the words of God in <hi>Act. 7. 3. Get thee out of thy Countrey, &amp;c.</hi>
and his words in <hi>Gen. 12. 1. Get thee out of thy Countrey, &amp;c.</hi> to bee
of the same time, and spoken in the same place, whereas there is a
vast difference in the words themselves, and so was there of the time
and place where they were spoken. <hi>Steven</hi> telleth, that while <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> or <hi>Chaldea,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 4. before hee dwelt in
<hi>Haran,</hi> God appeared to him, and said unto him, <hi>Get thee out of thy
Country, and from thy kindred,</hi> but not a word of departing from his
Fathers house, for hee took his Father and his whole household a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him, and dwelt with them a good while in <hi>Haran, Gen.
11. 31. And Terah dyed in Haran, ver. 32. Then the Lord said unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram,</hi>
for so should <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 1. bee translated, and not, <hi>Now the Lord
had said:</hi> And his saying was this, <hi>Get thee out of thy Countrey, and
from thy kindred, and from thy Fathers house too,</hi> for that also hee now
left behind him, namely <hi>Nahor</hi> and all his Fathers Family, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> that were fatherlesse children: And this difference
considered, as necessarily it must, it doth make this difficulty which
hath cost so much canvasing so easie, as a thing needeth not to bee

                  <hi>Totall</hi> 480. Now among all these parcels, there is no number
that hath not a text to warrant it, but onely the date of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Joshua,</hi> which yet cannot bee doubted of to have been seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
yeeres; seeing that so many yeeres onely are not specified by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Text of all the 480 mentioned, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 1. And here also
may the reader observe that the yeers that are mentioned in the book
of <hi>Judges,</hi> for yeeres of <hi>Israels</hi> oppression, as <hi>Judg.</hi> 3. 8. 14. &amp;c. are
not to bee taken for a space of time distinct from the time of the

               <p>Now it thus falling out, as it is more then apparent, that <hi>Solomons</hi>
Temple was finished and perfected in the yeere of the world 3000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this belike hath helped to strengthen that Opinion that hath beene
taken up by some, <hi>That as the World was six dayes in creating, so shall it
bee six thousand yeeres in continuance, and then shall come the everlasting
Sabbath.</hi> And indeed the observation could not but please those that
were pleased with this opinion: for when they found that the first
three thousand yeeres of the World did end, in the perfecting of the
earthly Temple, it would make them to conclude the bolder, that
the other three thousand should conclude in the consummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <head>Sect. VI. From the falling away of the ten Tribes under Jeroboam, to the
captivity of Judah into Babylon, were 390.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>These are thus reckoned in a grosse summe by</hi> Ezekiel, <hi>chap.</hi> 4, 5.
I have laid upon thee the yeeres of their iniquitie according to the number of
dayes, three hundred and ninety dayes. So shalt thou beare the iniquity of
the house of Israel, vers. 6. And when thou hast accomplished them, lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
on thy right side, and thou shalt beare the iniquity of the house of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
forty dayes, I have appointed thee each day for a yeere.</p>
               <p>Now these are not to be taken for two different and distinct sums,
as if it were 390 yeeres from the falling away of the ten Tribes, to
the captiving of the ten Tribes, and 40 yeeres from thence to the
captiving of <hi>Judah,</hi> for it was but 200 yeeres and a little above an
halfe, between the two first periods, and above an hundred yeeres
between the two last: but the forty yeeres are to bee reputed and
counted within the 390, as the last yeeres of them; and marked out
so singularly because of <hi>Judahs</hi> rebellion in and under so cleare and
powerfull preaching of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who-prophefied so long a time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them.</p>
               <p>Now for the casting of these 390 yeeres into parcels as the Books
of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles</hi> have done them, the surest and clearest way,
is to make a Chronicall table of the collaterall Kingdomes of <hi>Judah</hi>
and <hi>Israel</hi> while they last together, from yeare to yeare, as they will
offer themselves to parallel one another. In which course some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
scruples will arise before the Student as hee goeth along,
which unlesse hee see and resolve, hee will never be able to make the
account right, and which unlesse hee frame to himself such a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
table as is mentioned, hee will never see nor find out. Hee
will by the very Table, as hee goeth along see, that sometimes the
yeeres are reckoned compleat, as <hi>Reboboams</hi> seventeen are counted,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 1. Sometimes current, as <hi>Ahijams</hi> three, 1 <hi>Kings 15. 1, 2,
9.</hi> and <hi>Elahs</hi> two, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. 8. But this will breed no difficulty, since
it is ordinary in Scripture thus variously to compute, and since the
drawing of his Table wil every where shew him readily this variety:
But these things will hee find of more obscurity, and challenging
more serious study and consideration.</p>
               <p>First, it is said that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> reigned two and twenty yeeres'
<pb facs="tcp:52154:10"/>
1. <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 20. and <hi>Nadab</hi> his Sonne two yeeres, <hi>chap.</hi> 15. 25. yet
that <hi>Nadab</hi> began to reigne in the second yeere of <hi>Asa,</hi> which was in
the one and twentieth yeere of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and so <hi>Nadabs</hi> two yeeres
fall within the summe of his fathers two and twenty.</p>
               <p>Now the reason of this accounting is this: It is said in 2 <hi>Chron.
13.</hi> 20. that <hi>the Lord stroke</hi> Jeroboam <hi>and he died:</hi> that is, with some
ill and languishing disease, that he could not administer nor rule the
Kingdome, therefore was hee forced to substitute his Sonne <hi>Nadab</hi> in
his life time, and in one and the same yeer both Father and Son died.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is said that <hi>Baasha</hi> began to reigne in the third yeere
of <hi>Asa, 1 King.</hi> 13. 28. and reigned foure and twenty yeeres, <hi>ver.</hi> 33.
then it followeth that he died in the six and twentyeth yeere of <hi>Asa,</hi>
as the text reckoneth the yeeres current, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 8. And yet in the
fix and thirtieth yeere of <hi>Asa, Baasha</hi> came up and made war against
<hi>Judah, 2 Chron.</hi> 16. 1. So that this warre will seeme to bee made by
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im nine or ten yeeres after hee is dead.</p>
               <p>But the resolution of this from the originall is easie: For that
text in the Chronicles meaneth not that <hi>Baasha</hi> made warre against
<hi>Judah</hi> in the six and thirtieth yeere of <hi>Asaes reigne,</hi> but in the six and
thirtieth yeere of <hi>Asaes kingdome:</hi> that is, six and thirty yeeres from
the division of the Tribes under <hi>Rehoboam:</hi> For <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oboam</hi> reigned
seventeen yeeres, <hi>Abijam</hi> his son three yeeres, and in the sixteenth
yeere of <hi>Asa</hi> was this warre made: thirty six yeeres in all from the
first division. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> therefore should there be rendred
<hi>the Kingdom,</hi> and not <hi>the Reign,</hi> and the thing were cleare. Now the
text dateth this warre, not from the time of <hi>Asaes</hi> reigne, but from
the time of the division of the Tribes: because that though they
were divided hitherto in regard of their Kings, yet not totally in
regard of their converse and affection, for some of the revolted ones
affected still the house of <hi>David:</hi> but <hi>Baasha</hi> to make the division
sure: buildeth <hi>Ramah,</hi> that none might goe in or out to <hi>Asa</hi> King
of <hi>Judah,</hi> and this was as a second division; and therefore the Text
reckoneth from the first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, it is said,</hi> 1 King. 16. 23. <hi>that</hi> in the one and thirtieth
yeere of <hi>Asa</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> began <hi>Omri</hi> to reigne over <hi>Israel</hi> twelve yeers,
six yeeres reigned bee in <hi>Tirzah: And yet in verse 29. it is said, that</hi> In
the eight and thirtyeth yeere of <hi>Asa,</hi> began <hi>Ahab</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> sonne of <hi>Omri</hi> to
reigne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52154:10"/>
Now how can there possibly be twelve yeeres reigne betwixt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saes</hi>
thirty first and thirty eight?</p>
               <p>Answer. <hi>Omri</hi> began to reigne as soon as ever he had slaine <hi>Zimri,</hi>
which was in the twenty seventh of <hi>Asa:</hi> but he was not sole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
King till his thirty first: For <hi>Tibni</hi> his competitor and corrivall
for the Crowne, held him in agitation and warres till <hi>Asaes</hi> thirty
first. And then was he overcome, and <hi>Omri</hi> acknowledged absolute
King by <hi>Tibnies</hi> souldiers, and so from thence forward he reigned
sole King in <hi>Tirzah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet the doubt remaineth how <hi>Omri</hi> beginning his monarchy
in the thirty first of <hi>Asa,</hi> and ending it in his thirty eight, can bee
said to have reigned but six yeeres, whereas it was eight current.</p>
               <p>Answer. The six compleat yeeres only are reckoned: for the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
first of <hi>Asa</hi> was even ending when <hi>Tibni</hi> was conquered, and the
thirty eight but newly begun when <hi>Omri</hi> died: Such another kind
of reckoning may be observed in casting up the age of <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Ismael</hi> at their Circumcision, compared with the age of <hi>Abraham</hi> at
<hi>Ismaels death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the beginning of the reigne of <hi>Joram</hi> the sonne of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoshaphat</hi>
hath three dates. The first in the seventeenth yeere of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat</hi>
his father, compare 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 51. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 17. and
2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
               <p>The second in the fifth yeere of <hi>Joram</hi> the son of <hi>Ahab, 2 King. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
16.</hi> This was the in the two and twentyeth yeere of his father <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the third at his father <hi>Jehoshaphats</hi> death, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1.</p>
               <p>Now the resolution of this Ambiguity is thus. The first time hee
was made Viceroy, when his father went out of the Land for the
recovery of <hi>Ramoth Gilead:</hi> and because <hi>Ahab</hi> the King of <hi>Israel,</hi>
went with him, <hi>Ahaziah</hi> his Son is made Viceroy in that Kingdome
also.</p>
               <p>The second time hee was Viceroy again in his Father <hi>Jehoshaphats</hi>
absence upon his voyage into <hi>Moah</hi> with <hi>Jehoram, 2 Kings</hi> 3. and
from this time doth the Text date the fixed beginning of his reign,

Fifthly, but a greater doubt meeteth you by farre when you come
to cast up the times of his son <hi>Ahaziah.</hi> For whereas <hi>Joram</hi> was
thirty and two yeeres old when hee began to reigne, and reigned
eight yeeres in <hi>Jerusalem, 2 King. 6. 17. 2 Chron.</hi> 21. 20. and so
died when hee was forty yeeres old; and instantly the inhabitants
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> set <hi>Ahaziah</hi> upon his throne, who was his youngest
Son, yet was this <hi>Ahaziah</hi> forty two yeeres old when hee began to
reigne, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 1. and so will prove to be two yeeres older then
his father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The booke of <hi>Chronicles</hi> in this place meaneth not that
<hi>Ahaziah</hi> was so old when hee began to reigne; for the book of <hi>Kings</hi>
telleth plainly that he was but two and twenty, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 26. but these
two &amp; forty yeers have relation to another thing; namly, to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the house of <hi>Omri,</hi> and not to the age of <hi>Ahaziah.</hi> For count
from the beginning of the reign of <hi>Omri,</hi> and you find <hi>Ahaziah</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his reign in the two and fortieth yeer from thence; as he wil rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
see, that shall make such a Chronicall Table as is mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Originall words therefore, <hi>Ben arbaguim ushethajim shana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
are not to be translated as they be, Ahaziah <hi>was two and forty yeeres old,</hi>
but Ahaziah <hi>was the Son of the two and forty yeeres,</hi> as <hi>Seder Ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m</hi> hath
acutely observed long agoe.</p>
               <p>Now the reason why his reigne is thus dated differently from all
others the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> is, because he in a kind was an impe of
the house of <hi>Omri:</hi> for <hi>Athaliah</hi> his mother, was <hi>Ahabs</hi> daughter,
2 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 18. And she both perverted her husband <hi>Joram,</hi> and
brought up this her sonne <hi>Ahaziah</hi> in the Idolatry of the house of
<hi>Ahab;</hi> therefore is not <hi>Ahaziah</hi> fit to be reckoned by the line of the
Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> but by the house of <hi>Omri</hi> and <hi>Ahab:</hi> see the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist
<hi>Matthew</hi> setting a speciall mark upon the house of <hi>Joram,</hi> at
the notes on <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, there is yet one scruple more arising concerning the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the reigne of this <hi>Ahaziah.</hi> For the same book of <hi>Kings</hi>

of <hi>Ahab, 2 King.</hi> 8. 25. and in the eleventh yeere of <hi>Joram</hi> the son

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The resolution of this doubt will bee easie to him that
hath such a Chronicall Table as wee have spoken of before his
eyes. For there will hee see that <hi>Jehoram</hi> reigned one yeere before
<pb facs="tcp:52154:13"/>
his Father <hi>Ahabs</hi> death: For in the twentyeth yeere of <hi>Ahab,</hi> which
was the seventeenth of <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> did <hi>Ahaziah</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ahab,</hi>
begin to reigne, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 51. being made Viceroy, when his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
went to <hi>Ramoth Gilead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee reigning but that yeere, <hi>Jehoram</hi> his sonne was Viceroy or
began to rule in his stead, the next yeere, namely in <hi>Ahabs</hi> one and
twentyeth. <hi>Ahab</hi> in his two and twentyeth dyed: and so <hi>Jehoram</hi>
became absolute and intire King, and reigned so eleven yeeres: So
that his reign hath a double reckoning, hee reigned as Viceroy twelve
yeeres, but as intire King but eleven.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Amaziah</hi> beganne to reigne in the second yeere of <hi>Joash</hi> King of
<hi>Israel, 2 King.</hi> 14. 1. this was the eight and thirtyeth yeere of his
Father <hi>Joash</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> three yeeres current before his death:
And the reason was, because his Father had cast himselfe into so
much misery and mischiefe, through his Apostasie and murder of
<hi>Zacharies, 2 King. 12. 17, 18. 2 Chron.</hi> 24. 23, 24, 25. that hee was
become unfit and unable to manage the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Vzziah</hi> or <hi>Azariah</hi> the sonne of this <hi>Amaziah,</hi> being but
sixteene yeeres of age in the seven and twentyeth yeere of the reigne
of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the second, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 1, 2. it appeareth that hee was
but foure yeers old at his Fathers death: Therfore was the Throne
empty for eleven yeeres, and the rule managed by some as Protectors
in the Kings minority.</p>
               <p>9. There is also an <hi>interregnum</hi> or vacancy of 22 yeers in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Israel,</hi> between <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the second, and <hi>Zachariah:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
what the reason should bee, is not easie to determine: whether
through warres from abroad, which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> might have provoked
against his house by the conquest of <hi>Hamath</hi> and <hi>Damascus, 2 King.
14.</hi> 28. or through war at home, as appeareth by the end of <hi>Zachari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,
2 King.</hi> 15. 10. or through what else it was, it is uncertain, but most
sure it was that the Throne was so long without a King, since <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
beginning to reigne in the fifteenth yeere of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> and reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
forty one yeeres, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 23. dyed in the fifteenth of <hi>Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah;</hi>
and <hi>Zachariah</hi> began not to Reigne till the eight and thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 8.</p>
               <p>10. Hoshea is said to slay <hi>Pekah</hi> in the twentyeth yeere of <hi>Jotham</hi>
the Sonne of <hi>Vzziah, 2 King.</hi> 15. 30. whereas <hi>Jotham</hi> reigned but
sixteene yeeres in all, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 33. But the reason of this accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:52154:14"/>
is because of the wickednesse of <hi>Achaz,</hi> in whose reigne this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
was, and the Holy Ghost chuseth rather to reckon by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Jotham</hi> in the dust, then by wicked <hi>Ahaz</hi> alive: For in the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Pekah,</hi> the Lord avenged upon <hi>Pekah</hi> the blood-shed and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hee had caused in <hi>Judah,</hi> for hee had slaine of the men thereof
120000 in one day, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 6. Now <hi>Ahaz</hi> had caused this wrath
upon the people in withdrawing them from the wayes of the Lord,
therefore when the Lord avengeth this injury of his people upon
<hi>Pekah,</hi> the time of it is computed from <hi>Jotham</hi> who was holy and
upright, and not from <hi>Ahaz</hi> who had caused the mischiefe.</p>
               <p>11. There is a scruple of no small difficulty about the reckoning
of this twentyeth yeere of <hi>Jotham,</hi> if it once bee spyed out: And that
is this; If <hi>Pekah</hi> began to reigne in the two and fiftyeth or last yeere
of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> and reigned twenty yeeres, as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 27. and if Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham
beganne to reigne in the second yeere of <hi>Pekah, 2 King.</hi> 15. 33.
then certainly the twentyeth yeere of <hi>Pekah,</hi> the yeere when <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shea</hi>
slew him, was but the nineteenth yeere of <hi>Jotham,</hi> and not the
twentyeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> In this very difficulty, hath the Text fixed the time of <hi>Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziahs</hi>
becomming leprous, which else-where is not determined: and
it sheweth that it was in the last yeere of his reigne, when hee assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to offer incense in the Temple, and was struck with the leprosie,
a disease with which the Priests who were to bee the Judges of it,
could not bee touched nor insected, and his sonne <hi>Jotham</hi> was over
the house judging the land, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 5. till the day of his death.
Now that last yeere of <hi>Vzziah</hi> is counted for the first of <hi>Jotham,</hi> in
this reckoning that wee have in hand, and although hee beganne to
reigne as absolute and sole King in the second yeere of the Reigne
of <hi>Pekah,</hi> yet beganne hee to reigne as Viceroy, in the diseasednesse
of his Father, the yeere before.</p>
               <p>12. It is said that <hi>Hoshea</hi> the sonne of <hi>Elah,</hi> beganne to reigne in
the twelfth yeere of <hi>Ahaz, 2 King.</hi> 17. 1. whereas hee had slaine
<hi>Pekah</hi> in the fourth of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> or the twentyeth of <hi>Jotham:</hi> which
sheweth that hee obtained not the Crown immediately upon <hi>Pekahs</hi>
death, but was seven or eight yeeres before hee could settle it quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon his head. It is like that <hi>Ahaz</hi> in this time did disquiet <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
when his potent enemy <hi>Pekah</hi> was dead, in revenge of that slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that hee had made in <hi>Judah,</hi> and that hee kept <hi>Hoshea</hi> out of the
<pb facs="tcp:52154:14"/>
Throne, and for this is called the King of <hi>Israel, 2 Chron.</hi> 28. 19.
as well as for walking in the wayes of those Kings.</p>
               <p>13. It is said that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> began to reigne in the third yeere of
<hi>Hoshea</hi> the sonne of <hi>Elah, 2 King.</hi> 18. 1. Now <hi>Hoshea</hi> beginning in
the twelfth of <hi>Ahaz, 2 King.</hi> 17. 1. it is apparent that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in the foureteenth, and so reigned two or three yeeres with his
Father <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who Reigned sixteen yeeres, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 2.</p>
               <p>The reason of this was, because of the wickednesse of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and
because of the miseries and intanglements that his wickednesse had
brought him into, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 16, 17, 18. and <hi>chap.</hi> 29. 7, 8, 9.
And this sheweth the zeale of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in the work of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the more, in that hee assayed and perfected it so much in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time of his wicked Father.</p>
               <p>14. But yet there ariseth another doubt in the computation of
the times of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> parallel with the times of <hi>Hoshea;</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
hee beganne to reigne in the third yeere of <hi>Hoshea,</hi> as is cleere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
then the seventh yeere of <hi>Hoshea</hi> should bee counted his fifth
yeere, and yet it is called but his fourth, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The beginning of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> reigne, is of a double date:
Hee beganne indeed to bee Viceroy, and to beare the rule in the third
of <hi>Hoshea,</hi> which was the fourteenth yeere of his Father <hi>Ahaz,</hi> but
the time of that yeere was but short, that hee was in the royalty, and
hee did but little or nothing of note that yeere, but the next yeere,
which was the fifteenth of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and the fourth of <hi>Hoshea,</hi> on the
very first day of the yeere, or the first of <hi>Nisan,</hi> hee beganne the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and stirred bravely in the restoring of Religion, 2 <hi>Chron.
29.</hi> 3. and therefore that is owned as the most remarkable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
beginning of his dominion: And so the seventh of <hi>Hoshea,</hi>
and his fourth yeere fall in together. In his sixth yeer the ten Tribes
are captived, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 10. And so the parallelling of the two
Kingdomes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> in their Chronicall Annals is at an
end, and now the times of the kingdome of <hi>Judah</hi> lye in an easie
and continued Chronicle, to the captivity in <hi>Babel,</hi> without any
great scruple: Onely about those turbulent times of <hi>Jehoachaz</hi> and
<hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> there is a little difficulty: For there passed some yeeres
between the death of <hi>Josiah,</hi> and the Reign of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and distempers, though the Text hath mentioned the three
moneths onely of <hi>Jehoachaz:</hi> The grosse summe of 390. between
<pb facs="tcp:52154:15"/>
the division and the burning of the Temple, keepeth all right, and
sheweth how much space this was, when all the other particulars are
taken up, as the 480 between the delivery out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple do, by the time of the rule of <hi>Joshua,</hi> though
the Text expressely hath not determined it.</p>
               <p>So that now adde these 390 yeeres mentioned by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which
was the exact space between the falling away of the ten Tribes, and
the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to the 3030 yeeres, of which age the
world was when the ten Tribes fell away, and wee finde that <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
was destroyed by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jerusalem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, <hi>Anno mundi,</hi> 3420.</note> and the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> in the

               <p>It hath been no small controversie among the learned, that have

the seventy yeeres of the captivity in <hi>Babel,</hi> so renowned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 11, 12. and 29. 10. 2 <hi>Chron. 36. 21. Zech.</hi> 1. 12. For
since there were three captivities of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> by the <hi>Babylonian,</hi>
namely in the third yeere of <hi>Jehoiakim, 2 Chron. 36. 6. Dan.</hi> 1. 1. In
the yeere of <hi>Jehoiachin, 2 Chron.</hi> 36. 9, 10. and in the eleventh of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah,
2 King. 25. 2, 3. Jer.</hi> 52. 4, 5. it may very well bee question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
where those seventy yeeres of captivity did beginne, and where
those 390 yeeres from the falling away of the ten Tribes should ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.</p>
               <p>To omit varieties of opinions and reasons that fix these periods,
some here, some there; these reasons do plainly and sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
that the seventy yeeres of <hi>Judahs</hi> captivity in <hi>Babel,</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
from the third yeere of <hi>Jehoiakim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, Because <hi>Daniel</hi> that measured out the whole space of that
captivity, and that giveth account of the state of the people that time,
beginneth from thence, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because it is most proper to beginne the seventy yeeres
captivity by <hi>Babel</hi> from the very first time that any captivity by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
began.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is prophecyed by <hi>Jeremy, chap.</hi> 25. 11. that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l
<pb facs="tcp:52154:15"/>
the Jews, but also all Nations round about them should serve the
King of <hi>Babel</hi> 70 yeeres. So that those seventy yeeres are to bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the time and space of the absolute Monarchy of <hi>Babel,</hi> and they
are to beginne from the beginning of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
               <p>Now the beginning of his Monarchy is easie to settle, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
third of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> from these Texts: <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 1. and 52. 12. It is
true indeed that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 1. the fourth of <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> is called his
first, and so it might bee very well: for the first of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
might take up part of two yeeres of his Reigne, as any one yeere of
the King takes up much time of two Lord Majors, hee entring his
yeere in the Spring, and they in Autumne. Thus doe the seventy
yeeres beginne from the beginning of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> but the 390
that wee have been so long upon doe not there end, but they end at
his nineteenth, or at the eleventh of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> when the City and
Temple was utterly ruined, and the captivity entirely consummate,
as the chaine of the yeere drawn out to the length, doe really fix it;
and as the very intent and stile of the Prophet doth the like, who in

things being laid together and well considered, they shew why <hi>John</hi>
calleth the Son of God <hi>the Word,</hi> rather then by any other name.
First, because hee would shew that as the world was created by the
Son, so it was most fit it should bee redeemed. Secondly, that as
in him the promise was given, so in him was fit should bee the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
Thirdly, that as hee was the Subject of the Covenant

                     <p>From such places as these forenamed, where the Son of God is
called <hi>the Word</hi> in the Old Testament, it became most familiar and
ordinary among the Jewes to use this title personally for him. And
this may bee a second reason deduced from that that was named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
why the Evangelist here useth it, namely as a name most fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
and commonly known amongst his own people. Examples
hereof might bee alledged out of the Chaldee Paraphrasts, even by
hundreds: It will suffice to alledge some few, <hi>Gen. 28. 20, 21. If the
word of the Lord will bee my helpe, &amp;c. The word of the Lord shall bee

explaineth this title.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This terme, and in this sense also, was got even among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;

                        <hi>And the word was with God, &amp;c.]</hi> The Evangelist goeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
so much, immediately to shew the eternity of the <hi>word,</hi> or of
the second Person in the Trinity, as hee doth to declare how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
it was that that Person should bee incarnate rather then the
first or the third, because by him the Creation was wrought, and
answerably by him it was fittest should bee the redemption, &amp;c. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the words <hi>in the beginning,</hi> have not reference to the words eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
being, but to his giving of being to the Creature: For as they
are <hi>Moses</hi> his owne phrase, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. so are they to bee taken in his
sense, and further back then the Creation it is not possible to bring
his words, and by those of his must these bee understood. They
trace not therefore his Divinity beyond the Creation, nor yet doe
they find it to have begun there, but this they say onely, that then
<hi>the word,</hi> was, and by him were all things made. And this was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for the answering of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> which held that
Christ was not before the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> And this being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the <hi>word</hi> was in the beginning, and created all things, his
eternall being before the Creation will readily inferre it selfe.</p>
                     <p>The Evangelist useth this manner of speech, <hi>The word with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, to shew the subsistence of the Son of himselfe, and his co-existence
with the Father; his subsistence, <hi>hee was,</hi> his co-existence,
<hi>Hee was with God.</hi> Secondly, the distinction of the persons, <hi>Hee
was with God,</hi> and the unity of Essence, <hi>hee was God.</hi> Thirdly, the
relation between the Father and the Son; The Son is said to bee
<hi>with the Father,</hi> as children are <hi>apud Patrem,</hi> but not <hi>è contra.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Phrase, <hi>Hee was with God,</hi> is in <hi>Antithesis,</hi> or opposition to
that that is said afterward, <hi>The</hi> word dwelt among <hi>us;</hi> And this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52154:20"/>
doth illustrate the doctrine and benefit of the incarnation the more,
when it shall bee observed, that hee that in the beginning <hi>was the
word,</hi> and <hi>was with God,</hi> and <hi>was the Creator,</hi> did in the fulnesse of
time, become flesh, and dwell with men, and became their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>

                        <hi>[And the word was God] God</hi> in the clause next preceding is taken
personally for God the Father, but here essentially for the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moses</hi> all along the Story of the Creation called God <hi>Elohim,</hi> by
a word plurall, to denote the distinction of Persons; but at last, in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 4. hee calleth him <hi>Jehovah Elohim,</hi> to signifie also the unity
of Essence. So <hi>David</hi> when hee had spoken of the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>his word,
2 Sam.</hi> 7. 21. amd <hi>the Lord,</hi> and <hi>his Servant, 1 Chron.</hi> 17. 19. Hee
presently concludeth, that there is but one God, though those ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
might seem to make them more. There is none like thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any God besides thee, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. So the Evangelist here,
when hee hath named <hi>The Word,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> and the word being with
God, as two persons distinct one from another, lest this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should breed the supposall of difference, and the mention of
more persons, the surmisall of more Gods, hee preventeth betimes,
and stoppeth all such misconstructions by saying, <hi>The word was
God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ver. 2. <hi>[The same was in the beginning with God]</hi> Hee had said, the
same thing immediately before, but not in the same respect. For
there hee spake of the <hi>words</hi> co-existency with the Father, as hee
explaineth himselfe after it, <hi>The word was God;</hi> but here hee speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of <hi>the words</hi> co-working with the Father in the workes of the
Creation, and accordingly explaineth himselfe after also, <hi>By him were

                     <p>Concerning the repetition of this, it being the same in effect with

affirmative to understand the visible Creatures, which <hi>Moses</hi> had
taught evidently were made by the <hi>Word;</hi> and in the negative, the
invisible, of which there might bee the more doubt, whether they
were made by him or no, because <hi>Moses</hi> hath made no such plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.

backe, and see the method and intention of the Evangelist, and the
reason why hee calleth him by this name <hi>the Word,</hi> rather then any
other. For first, hee was <hi>the Word</hi> by whom all things, and among
them man, were created. Secondly, <hi>The Word,</hi> by which man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
falne, was recovered and obtained life. Thirdly, <hi>The Word</hi> of
light, direction, and consolation to the holy Patriarchs. Fourthly,
<hi>The Word</hi> of promise, in the darknesse of the Law and Prophets:
And hee is now come to bee the <hi>Word</hi> incarnate, and the publisher
of the Gospel, which began from <hi>John, Mark.</hi> 1. 1. And thus hath

in <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. it was taken vertually onely there, for the light that

like. For having in the next foregoing words, excluded one maine
thing [that was much stood upon] from any claime or challenge,
towards the adopting of the Sons of God, or forwarding of the

                           <hi>Apollinaris</hi> from this clause, <hi>the word became flesh,</hi> would wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that the word assumed not an humane soule, but onely hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane flesh, and that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head served that flesh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable soule. Confuted, <hi>Luke 5. 52. Mat.</hi> 26. 38.</note> first, <hi>the will of the flesh,</hi> or ability of nature; Secondly, the
will of man, or power of morality.</p>
                     <p>Verse 14. <hi>[And the word became Flesh,]</hi> Now hath the Evangelist
brought us to the great Mystery of the Incarnation, in the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of which may be observed; First, the two termes, <hi>the word,</hi> and
<hi>Flesh,</hi> expressing Christs two natures; and the word <hi>was made,</hi> or <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,</hi>
their hypostaticall union. Secondly, the word <hi>flesh</hi> is rather
used by the Evangelist, then the word <hi>man;</hi> though oftentimes they
signify but the same thing, as <hi>Gen. 6. 12. Psal. 65. 2. Isa.</hi> 40. 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>First to make the difference and distinction of the two natures in
Christ, the more conspicuous; and that according to the common
speech of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who set <hi>flesh and blood</hi> in opposition to God, <hi>as
Matth. 16. 17. Gal.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to magnifie the mercy of God in Christs incarnation,
the more, in that <hi>flesh</hi> being in its owne nature, so farre distant from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52154:22"/>
the nature of God; yet that hee thus brought these two natures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as of them to make but one person for the reconcilling of man
and himselfe together.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to confirme the truth of Christs humanity, against fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Heresies, which have held that he had not a true and reall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
body, but only Fantasticall, or of the aire.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, to explaine what he said before, that Peleevers <hi>became
the Sonnes of God;</hi> that is, not by any change of their bodily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
but by participation of divine grace: for Christ on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
became <hi>the Sonne of Man,</hi> by assuming of flesh, and not by
changing into it.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, to shew the Plaister fitly applyed unto the Sore, and the
Physicke to the Disease; for whereas in us, that is, <hi>in our flesh,</hi> there
dwelleth no good, but sin, death, and corruption; hee tooke upon
him this very nature, which we have so corrupted, sequestring onely
the corruption from it, that in the nature he might heale the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, he saith, he was made or became <hi>flesh,</hi> and not hee was
made <hi>man,</hi> lest it should be conceived that Christ assumed a person;
for he tooke not the person of any man in particular, but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man in generall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[Was made flesh,]</hi> Not by alteration, but assumption; not by
turning of the God-head into flesh, but by taking of the Man-hood
into God; not by leaving what hee was before, that is, <hi>to be God,</hi> but
by taking on him what he was not before; that is, <hi>to be man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Evangelist saith rather, <hi>He was made flesh,</hi> then he <hi>assumed it.
i. e.</hi> that he might set out the truth and mystery of the incarnation
to the life, both for the hypostaticall union of the two natures, and
their inseparability, being so united. For, first, whereas <hi>Nestorius</hi>
said, <hi>that the word was not that man that was conceived and born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi>
Mary; <hi>but that the Virgin indeed brought forth a man, and hee having
obtained grace in all kind of vertue, had the word of God united unto him,
which gave him power against uncleane Spirits;</hi> And so he made two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Sons, and two severall persons of the two natures: his Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
is plainly and strongly confuted by this phrase, <hi>he was made flesh,</hi>
which by the other, <hi>he consumed it,</hi> might have had more pretext and
colour. Secondly, whereas <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap> averred,
<hi>that Christ had not a true humane body, but onely a body in appearance:</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52154:23"/>
This also confuteth them home, and taketh away all probability of
any such thing, which the word <hi>assumed</hi> might have left more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
since we know that Angels assumed bodies, and those bodies were
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> truly humane: So that in this manner of speech, <hi>The word was
made flesh,</hi> is evidently taught: First, that there are two distinct na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in Christ, the God head, and the Man-hood; for hee saith
not, the <hi>Word was turned into,</hi> but was <hi>made,</hi> or <hi>became flesh.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that these two natures doe not constitute two persons, but onely
one Christ, for he saith, <hi>hee was made flesh,</hi> and not <hi>assumed it.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that this union is hypostaticall, or personall; for he saith, <hi>the
Word was made flesh,</hi> and not <hi>joyned to it.</hi> And lastly, that this union
is indissoluble and never to be separated: For Angels in assumed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
laid them by againe, and were parted from them, but the
<hi>the word being made flesh,</hi> the union is personall, and not to bee
dissolved.</p>

the next clause, <hi>we saw his glory,</hi> importeth: And this Evangelist

flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.</hi> The reason of the
Parenthesis, <hi>and we saw his glory.</hi> may seeme to bee: First, because
hee would explaine what he meant by <hi>Vs,</hi> before he left it, <hi>viz.</hi> us
Disciples, <hi>that saw his glory,</hi> Secondly, because the Apostles be held
not the very fulnesse of his grace and truth, till they had beheld the

                     <p>The Priests were divided by <hi>David</hi> into foure and twenty courses,
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. Not, but that there had beene courses before of them,
but because there had not been so many. For reason it selfe will
tell us, that since they were all bound to the service of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
and withall were so very many in number, they could not
serve there mixedly and confusedly, but must need have some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
and order: some of the Jews say they were divided into
eight courses by <hi>Moses,</hi> foure of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and foure of <hi>Ithamar:</hi> But
for this they have no ground to shew at all. Others that they were
divided into sixteen by him, namely, eight and eight of either fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52154:29"/>
And of the division it selfe, there seemeth to bee some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
in the Text, but not of the divider. For speaking of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
distinguishing them, because they were growne more numerous,
it saith, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 24. 6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, which
importeth thus much, that there was one principall houshold
added to every course of <hi>Eleazar</hi> more than was before, and so
they became sixteene, but of <hi>Ithamar</hi> were onely taken those which
were used before, which were onely eight, and thus did they rise
to 24. <hi>See R. Solomon. &amp; Dav. Kimehi in loc.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These courses thus newly increased by <hi>David</hi> for number, and
thus newly ranked by lot for order, and both for the service of the
Temple, when it should bee built; it is but little to bee doubted,
but that they began their round, when the service of the Temple
did first begin; which round began on the Sabbath, next after the
Feast of Tabernacles, about the two and twentieth day of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<hi>Tisri, 2 Chron.</hi> 7. For on the 23 day, <hi>Solomon</hi> dismissed all
the people to their owne houses, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. after hee had kept the
Feast of Tabernacles seven dayes before according to the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
on the fifteenth day of the moneth, and concluding on the
one and twentieth day, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. and the next day after, or the two
and twentieth day, was a solemne assembly, and that yeere [as it
may bee conceived] the Sabbath day. Now in the weeke of the
Feast, so great was the company of the Congregation, and so
many the multitude of the Sacrifices, that no single course was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to undergoe the service, but then [as also at the other two
great Feastivals] all the courses served indifferently, [and so had
they done at the Temples dedication, 2 <hi>Chron. 5. 11.]</hi> and on the
next Sabbath, the course of <hi>Jehojarib</hi> or the first began.</p>
                     <p>They changed every weeke, comming in on the Sabbath, and on
the next going out, 2 <hi>King. 11. 7. 2 Chron.</hi> 23. 4. So that by the
time of the passeover, they were just gone about; and from thence
they began their second round againe: In the eight course of which
second round; [for so was the course of <hi>Abia, 1 Chron. 24. 10.] Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi>
heareth the glad tydings of the birth of Christs forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
just about the same time of the yeere, that <hi>Sarab</hi> did of the

<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.</p>

But that the Reader may have a full and perfect view of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of these courses: and because he will have frequent occasion
in his reading of the Evangelists, to have his eye upon the passing
of the yeere of the Jews; let it not bee tedious to interpose a Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar,
or Almanack of it, here at the very entrance; with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the courses of the Priests used every weeke at the Temple,
the Lessons out of the Law and the Prophets, used every Sabbath in
the Synagogues; and their Festivals great and lesser, as they lighted
in their seasons; that whensoever hereafter in his Progresse in this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
History of the Gospell, he shall have occasion to looke after any
of these, they may be here ready before his eyes.</p>
                     <p>The Jewes reckoned their yeare by Lunary moneths, as is more
then apparent; by the words that signified a moneth amongst them,
as <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and by severall Stories in the Scripture; and
in this their reckoning, saith,<note n="*" place="margin">On Gen. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Rabbi Solomon, one moneth was full, and
another wanting;</hi> that is, one consisting of thirty dayes, and another
onely of nine and twenty: This computation made their yeeres to
fall eleven dayes short of the yeer of the Sun. And this the holy Ghost
seemeth to hint and to hit upon, when in reckoning the time of
<hi>Noahs</hi> being in his Arke, he bringeth him in on the seventeenth day
of the second moneth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 11. and bringeth him out on the
seven and twentieth day of the same moneth on the next yeere,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 14. and yet intendeth him there but an exact and compleat
yeere of the Sun, but reckoned onely by Lunary moneths.</p>
                     <p>Now these eleven dayes, which the yeere of the Sunne out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stretched
the yeere of the Moone, on every third yeere made up a
moneth of three and thirty dayes; which the Jewes laid after the
moneth <hi>Adar,</hi> or the last moneth; and called it <hi>Veadar,</hi> or <hi>Adar,</hi>
over againe.</p>
                     <p>But not to insist upon any curious inquiry into their embolimism,
or intercalation, nor how the twelve Stewards of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the
foure and twenty course of the Priests, made out their Service,
those in the Court, and these in the Temple, on that additionall
moneth of the leape yeere; which is not a discourse for the present
purpose: we will take up the yeere in its common and ordinary
course and circle; and suppose <hi>[A]</hi> the Dominicall, or Sabbath
day Letter, and trace the courses of the Priests, and the lessons of
the Law and Prophets, according thereunto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52154:30"/>
Now these lessons of the law and Prophets began their round,
one Sabbath before the courses of the Priests; the first <hi>Parashah,</hi> or
Section of <hi>Genesis,</hi> being read at the Feast of Tabernacles: and by
the next Feast of Tabernacles, or the next yeere, all the Law was read
over, be the yeere Leape yeere, or no: For if it were the ordinary
yeere, the Sections in the latter end of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> were made fewer
and longer; but if the Intercalary, or Bissextile, then were they
broke into more, according to the number of the Sabbaths of that
yeere; that by the Feast of Tabernacles, <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> might bee fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and <hi>Genesis</hi> might be begun on againe.</p>
                     <p>Whether these Lessons or Sections of the Law were appointed and
set out by <hi>Moses,</hi> or by <hi>Ezra,</hi> or by some other; and how the like
in the Prophets came to bee paralleled with them; or to be read in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of them; when the persecution of <hi>Antiorhus</hi> forbad the
reading of the Law; is not a time and place to dispute here; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if the Reader shall observe the Harmony betweene the two porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that were read at one time, he will see that the choice of them
was of more then ordinary and common discretion: And sometimes
the taking notice of the portions themselves, will help to cleare and
satisfie some obscurities, which otherwise it were not possible to
cleare and satisfie, as some examples will bee given in their
places.</p>

Thus, or not farre from this forme, went the Jewish yeere, and the

to doe it in the most Holy place, by succession. Fourthly, there
was no Altar of Incense in the most Holy place, but there was one
where <hi>Zacharias</hi> ministred. Fifthly, if these courses began their
round, either with the beginning of the Service of the Temple; or
with the beginning of the yeere Ecclesiasticall, or with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the yeere Civill, or from any of the three Festivals; then was
it not possible that the eighth course should light any whit neere
the Feast of expiation: And where to begin them but from some of
these, who can imagine? Sixthly, it was not so very consonant that
<hi>John</hi> the Baptist should bee borne a High Priest, which bare the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
resemblance of the Office of our Saviour; but a Priest of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
ranke, because a servant to the High. The mis-construction
of <hi>Zacharies</hi> offering of Incense, gave first occasion to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
and long continued mistake of the time of our Saviours

                     <p>Ver. 11. <hi>[And there appeared an Angel, &amp;c.]</hi> As there were two great
mysteries to be shewed in the birth of Christ; First, that God should
become a man; And secondly, that a Virgin should become a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
So the Lord to make way for the beleefe of these two, when
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52154:35"/>
they should be exhibited, did use two Harbingers or preparatives, as
if it were of old and of long time before. First, apparition of Angels
in humane shape. Secondly, Womens bearing children, that were
old and barren. For it would be the easier beleeved, that the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
God might converse visibly among men, in humane flesh, when
it was so ordinarily seen, that the invisible Angels did so in humane
shapes. And it would not be so very incredible, that a Virgin might
beare a child, though she were not come to it by the course of nature,
and though shee had not known a man; when it had been so often
knowne that old women had done the same, though they were past
child-bearing by nature, and even past the knowledge of man. And
this was the maine reason why want of children, is alwayes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
imputed to the defect of the women, that the miracle appearing
the more visible in them, it might prepare beliefe the better
for this.</p>
                     <p>As these two types and fore-runners of those two great mysteries,
were exhibited so often in the Old Testament, that they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
credit, and entertainment for the other when they should bee
exhibited in the birth of Christ: so was it most fit, that they should
bee declared in the birth of him that was to be Christs forerunner
indeed, and when the mysteries they aimed at were so neere to bee
revealed.</p>

appearing of an Angel in the Sanctuary, with a message from God,
was a thing ever hardly seen or heard of before: and it sheweth how
<hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> the ordinary way of Gods revealing his mind
in that place, was now ceased. For God used to reveale his will to
the Priest by a soft voice from off the Arke, but now both Arke and
Oracle were quite gone, and the losse the lesser, when the true Arke
of the Covenant and the Oracle of the will of God, our Saviour
Christ, was so neere at hand. The second Temple wanted five things

                     <p>Vers. 13. <hi>[Thy prayer is heard, &amp;c.]</hi> Not that hee was now
praying for a child; [for his age made him incredulous of having a
child, when the Angel told him of one, and then it is not like hee
would pray for one] and in this place, and at this time hee was a
person representative of the whole people, and therefore was not to
make a private prayer for himselfe: but either the prayers which he
had before made to that purpose, were now come into remembrance,
or rather he was now praying for the delivery of <hi>Israel,</hi> the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their sinnes, and the comming of Christ, in which they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
were joyning with him; and this his prayer, the Angell tells

                     <p>First, they both came when Religion was even perished and

to them neere <hi>Jordan.</hi> To which two parallels more might bee
added, if these two opinions of the Jewes concerning <hi>Elias</hi> might
bee beleeved.</p>
                     <p>First, that hee was of the Tribe of Levi [for they take him to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52154:36"/>
bee <hi>Phin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>has;</hi> as see <hi>R. Lev. Gersh.</hi> on 1 <hi>King. 17.]</hi> Secondly, That
hee restored circumcision when it was decayed; from those words
in 1 <hi>King. 19. 14. They have forsaken thy Covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>[To turne the hearts of the fathers to the children.] <hi>That is,</hi> The
hearts of the Jewes to the Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>For, first, the hatred of a Jew against a Gentile was deadly; and
it was a speciall worke of the Gospel, and consequently of <hi>John,</hi> that
began to Preach it, to bring both these to imbrace <hi>Christ,</hi> and for,
and in him to imbrace one another.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Experience it selfe confirmeth this exposition; for, as
the Gospel belonged to the Gentiles as well as the Jewes, and as
<hi>John</hi> came for a witnesse that <hi>all</hi> through him might beleeve, so did
hee convert and baptize <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers as well as <hi>Jewish</hi> Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Baptisme, at its first institution, was the Sacrament for
admission of Heathens onely, to the Church and true Religion:
when therefore, the Jewes also begin to desire it, and to consent
to the Heathens in the undertaking of it, then was the heart of the
fathers turned to the children.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is the common and constant use of the Prophets,
to stile the Church of the Gentiles by the name of children to the
Church of the Jewes, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 5, 6. 13. and 60. 4. 9. and 62. 5.
and 66. 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly, the</hi> Talmud <hi>expounding these words in</hi> Malachi, <hi>seemeth
to understand them of such a communion or reconciliation, as is
spoken of,</hi> Vid. R. Sol. in lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lib. 18. cap. 7. slew John the Baptist being a good man, and injoyning the
Jewes that exercising vertue, and using right dealing one towards another,
and piety towards God, they should <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, convene or knit
together in Baptisme.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[And the disobedient, &amp;c.]</hi> In <hi>Malachi</hi> it is, <hi>And the hearts of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to the fathers.</hi> But, first, the Holy Ghost is not so punctuall
to cite the very letter of the Prophet, as to give the sense. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it was not very long after the Baptizing and Preaching of <hi>John,</hi>
that the Jewes ceased to bee a Church and Nation; nay, even in the
time of <hi>John</hi> himselfe, they shewed themselves enemies to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
and the professors of it, [as concerning the generall or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of them] therefore hee saith not, that the <hi>heart of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52154:37"/>
the Gentiles, should bee turned <hi>to their Fathers</hi> the Jewes, which
should cease to bee fathers, and should cease to bee a people, but to <hi>the
wisdome of the righteous ones.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[The disobedient]</hi> As in this clause hee refuseth to use the tearme
of Fathers for the reason mentioned, so doth hee also of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relative
<hi>children,</hi> because of his refusing that. And yet hee couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the sense of that title under the word <hi>disobedient,</hi> which word
in its most proper and naturall signification reflecteth upon unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
children, disobedient to their parents. As therefore by his
omitting to call the Jewes <hi>fathers,</hi> hee insinuateth their opposition
against the Gospel, so by terming the Gentiles <hi>disobedient</hi> in stead
of <hi>children,</hi> hee sheweth what they were before they imbraced it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[In the wisdome of the righteous.]</hi> For so is it in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>in,</hi> and
not <hi>to. Wisedome</hi> in Scripture, is often taken for <hi>Religion:</hi> As <hi>Psal.
111. 10. Deut.</hi> 4. 6. &amp;c. and so is it to bee understood here. And
this <hi>Wisdome</hi> is not to be held the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> or the ultimate
end to which these disobedient Gentiles were to bee converted; but
in this <hi>wisdome,</hi> or religion, unto God. For, first, let the two clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of this speech bee laid in <hi>Antithesis,</hi> or opposition one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
[as naturally indeed they lie, the one aiming at the Jewes as
the proper subject, and the other at the Gentiles] and it appeareth
plainly that two severall acts were to bee performed by the Baptist,
as concerning the Jews and their conversion; First, that he should
turn their hearts or affections to God, as in the verse preceding, <hi>He
shall turne many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God:</hi> And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that hee should turne their hearts and affections also to the
Gentiles, whom they hated before, as here, <hi>Hee shall turne the hearts
of the Fathers to the children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, According therefore to this double worke of <hi>John</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Jewes in that part of the Angels speech, must the like dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
bee looked for in this that concerneth the Gentiles, and to bee
understood, though it bee not expressed. For the Angel in this
part purposely changeth his stile, and neither calleth the Gentiles
<hi>children,</hi> but <hi>disobedient,</hi> because they were generally so before the
comming of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor the Jewes <hi>Fathers,</hi> because they ceased to be
so shortly after: nor mentioneth hee the Gentiles turning to God,
but includeth it, partly because hee had set that as the chiefest work
and bent of the Baptist of all, <hi>to go before the Lord, and turne men to him;</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52154:37"/>
and partly hee includeth it in this phrase, <hi>In the wisedome of the
righteous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is not without divine reason that the hearts of the
Gentiles are not said to bee turned to the Jewes, as on the contrary
it was said of the Jewes to the Gentiles, but that they should bee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>in the wisdome of the righteous;</hi> For the enmity, fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
that was betwixt Jew and Gentile, and Gentile and Jew,
proceeded not from the same cause and Originall. The Jew abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Gentile, not of ignorance, but of scorne and jealousy, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because they stood upon their own dignity of being the people
of God, which the other were not, and partly because they were
provoked with suspition, that the other should bee the people of
God when they should not. And therefore, when the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to bee wrought between them, it is said that their hearts
or affections should bee turned to them, for they were pointblanke
or diametrically against them before. But a Gentile abhorred a
Jew out of ignorance, because of his Religion: hating him as a
man separate from and contrary to all men: and accounting that
to bee singular and senselesse superstition, which was indeed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
command and wisedome of God; and not so much detesting
his person for it selfe, as for his religion and profession. Therefore
when the Gentiles must bee brought to affect and to unite to the
Jewes, it must bee <hi>in the wisdome of the righteous,</hi> or in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
knowledge, and imbracing of that religion, which the
righteous ones professed, which the Gentiles till they knew and
understood what it meant, accounted but vanity, singularity, and
foolishnesse.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 18. <hi>[Whereby shall I know this?]</hi> The Jew requireth a signe,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. And his so doing in these times when miracles had been
ceased so long a time, sheweth his doubting to bee the more: and
the appearing of an Angel, when such apparitions were as rare as
Miracles, should have made it to have been the lesse. <hi>For after the
death of Zachary and Malachi, and those latter Prophets, the Holy Ghost
departed from Israel and went up:</hi> and ceased to exhibite his familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
among them, in Vision, Prophecy, and the worke of Miracles;
So that this apparition of the Angel, and this signe given to <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and wonders done in the birth of the Baptist, were as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
entrance and beginning of the restoring of those gifts, and the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52154:38"/>
very dawning to that glorious day of such things as was now to
follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[For I am old]</hi> The very same was the doubt of <hi>Sarah,</hi> Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 18.
12. And here, first, the distrust of <hi>Zachary</hi> doth shew the more, in
that hee that was a Priest and should have instructed others, was
himselfe to seeke in one of the first elements, and Catechisticall
principles of Religion, concerning the <hi>Almighty power,</hi> and <hi>All-sufficiency</hi>
of God. Secondly, the very place where the message
came to him, being the place of Gods immediate Oracles, and the
time, being the time of his praying, and who could have wished
for a better returne of his prayers? doe aggravate his unbeliefe.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 19. <hi>[I am Gabriel]</hi> It signifyeth, <hi>A man of God:</hi> being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the same forme of construction with <hi>Malchizedek.</hi> Hee break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out to utter his name, which Angels at other times [and it
may bee himselfe] and refused to doe, because hee would recall
<hi>Zacharies</hi> thoughts to the book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and convince his hesita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by that very Scripture, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[That stand before God:]</hi> That is, that minister to him, as <hi>Dan.
7. 10. 1 Sam. 16. 22. 2 King.</hi> 5. 25. &amp;c. Therefore those that from
this phrase would collect that <hi>Gabriel</hi> is an Arch-angel, or one of
the prime order of Angels, doe build but upon a very sandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 20. <hi>[Behold thou shalt bee dumb]</hi> The signe given, is in <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi>
himselfe, and not in any thing without him: partly, because
his doubting arose from the consideration of himselfe, and partly,
that hee might carry about him a punishment for his diffidence, as
well as a signe for his confirmation.</p>
                     <p>Now his punishment was twofold, <hi>deafenesse</hi> and <hi>dumbnesse</hi> both;
for because hee had not hearkned to the Angels speech, he was struck

while shee was upon the earth. So that no relation, or story that
concerneth her, but it hath strained it to the utmost extremity, to
wring out of it her praises, though very often to a senselesse, and
too often to a blasphemous issue: As in this story of the annuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there is not a word nor tittle that it thinketh will with all its
shaping serve for such a purpose, but it taketh advantage to patch
up her Encomions, where there is no use nor need, nor indeed any

For having translated it in their vulgar Latine, <hi>Gratia plena,</hi> or <hi>full of

redeeming it according to <hi>Lev.</hi> 27.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to die childlesse, was a reproach among men, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 25.
and to live unmarried, was a shame to women, <hi>Psal. 78. 63. Their
Virgins were not praised;</hi> that is, were not married. Now what a
gulfe is there betweene vowing perpetuall Virginity, and accounting
it a shame, dishonour, and reproach?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if <hi>Mary</hi> had vowed Virginity, why should she marry?
Or when shee was married, why should shee vow Virginity? For
some hold that her vow was made before her espousalls, and
some after.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, it was utterly unnecessary that she should be any such a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
it was enough that she was a Virgin.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, it is a most improper phrase, to say, <hi>I know not a man,</hi> and
to meane, <hi>I never must know him:</hi> and in every place where it is used
concerning Virgins, why may it not bee so understood, as well as
here?</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, while the Romanist goeth about, with this glosse to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
her Virginity, he abaseth her judgment and beleefe: For if she
meant thus, shee inferreth, that either this child must be begotten by
the mixture of man, which sheweth her ignorance; or that hee could
not be begotten without, which sheweth her unbeliefe.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, shee uttereth not these words in diffidence, as <hi>Zachary</hi>
had done, when he said, <hi>how shall I know this;</hi> but in desire to bee
satisfied in the mystery, or the manner, as shee was in the matter.
Shee understood that the Angel spake of the birth of the <hi>Messias;</hi> she
knew that hee should bee borne of a Virgin; shee perceived that shee
was pointed out for that Virgin; and beleeving all this shee desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to be resolved how so great a thing should come to passe.</p>
                     <p>Vers. 35. <hi>[The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, &amp;c.]</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
satisfieth the Virgins question, with a threefold answer. First;
instructing her in the manner of the performance. Secondly, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
her with an example of much like nature in her Cosin <hi>Elisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
Thirdly, confirming her from the power of God, to which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is impossible. Now, whereas, this unrestrained power of God
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52154:42"/>
was the onely cause of such examples, as the childing of <hi>Elisabeth,</hi>
and other barren women; in this birth of the Virgin, something
more, and of more extraordinarinesse is to bee looked after. In it
therefore two actions are expressed to concurre, First, The <hi>Holy Ghost
his comming upon</hi> the Virgin; Secondly, The <hi>power of the most High
overshadowing</hi> her: and two fruits or consequents of these two acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
answerable to them: First, <hi>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
therefore that that is borne of thee shall bee holy.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The power of
the most High shall overshadow thee, therefore that that is borne of thee shall
bee called the Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The comming of the Holy Ghost upon her, was, First, In the
gift of Prophecy, whereby shee was both informed of the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
when the conception was wrought, and also more fully of
the mystery of the Incarnation then before.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Hee did prepare and sanctifie so much of her flesh and
blood or seed, as to constitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> the body of our Saviour: The worke
was the worke of the whole Trinity, but ascribed more singularly
to the Holy Ghost: first, because of the sanctifying of that seed,
and cleering it of originall taint; for sanctification is the worke of
the Holy Ghost: Secondly, for the avoiding of that dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
which might have followed among men of corrupt minds,
who might have opinionated, if the conception of the Mess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>as in
the wombe had been ascribed to the Father, that the Sonne had had
no other manner of generation of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[The power of the most High]</hi> His operating power supplying the
want of the vigour and imbraces of the masculine Parent. For to
that the word <hi>overshadow</hi> seemeth to have aliusion: being a modest
phrase whereby the Hebrews expressed the imbraces of the man in the
act of generation, as <hi>Ruth 3. 9. Spread the skirt of thy garment over thine
handmaid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[Therefore that holy thing]</hi> This title and Epithet, first, not onely
sheweth the purity and immaculatenesse of the humane nature of
Christ; but also, secondly, it being applyed to the preceding part
by way of consequence, as was touched before, it sheweth that none
ever was borne thus immaculate, but Christ alone, because none had
ever such a way meanes of conception, but onely hee.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 36. <hi>[Thy Cosin Elisabeth hath conceived a Son.]</hi> As hee had
informed the Virgin of the birth of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he also of the birth of his fore-runner, of her Cousin <hi>Elisabeth.</hi> For
that hee intended not barely to informe her onely that her Cousin
had conceived a Childe, but that hee heightens her thoughts, to
think of him as Christs fore-runner, may bee supposed upon these
observations: First, that hee saith <hi>A Son,</hi> and not <hi>a Childe.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that such strangely borne Sonnes were ever of some remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and renowned eminency. Thirdly, that if hee had purposed
onely to shew her the possibility of her conceiving by the example of
the power of God in other women, hee might have mentioned
<hi>Sarah, Hannah,</hi> and others of those ancient ones, and it had been
enough.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 39. <hi>[And Mary arose, &amp;c. And went with haste into the hill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

                           </gap>
                        </hi> it were senselesse to seek for
his house in any other place then <hi>Hebron.</hi> This place had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
renowned in ancient time: Here was the promise given of
<hi>Isaac:</hi> here was the institution of Circumcision: here <hi>Abraham</hi> had
his first land, and <hi>David</hi> his first Crowne: and here lay interred
the three couples, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca, Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Leah:</hi> and as antiquity hath held, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> Now there are
many reasons given by Expositors, of <hi>Maries</hi> hasting hither after
the Message of the Angel: As, either to know the truth of what
was told her about <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> or to congratulate and rejoyce with
her, or to minister to her in her great bellyednesse, or that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
in <hi>Elisabeths</hi> wombe might bee sanctified by the presence of Christ
in hers, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But I cannot but conceive this to bee the very reason indeed,
<hi>That shee might there conceive the Messias, where so many types, figures, and
things relating to him, had g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>e before,</hi> namely in <hi>Hebron.</hi> For, First,
this suited singularly with the Harmony and Consent, which God
useth in his workes, that the promise should begin to take place by
the conception of <hi>Messias,</hi> even among those Patriarchs to whom the
promise was first given. Secondly, A kind of necessity seemeth to
lie upon it, that this <hi>Shiloh</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> and the seed of
<hi>David,</hi> should bee conceived in a City of <hi>Juda,</hi> and of <hi>David,</hi> as
hee was to bee borne in another City that belonged to them both.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52154:43"/>
Thirdly, the Evangelists so punctually describing this City, seemeth
rather to referre to <hi>Christ</hi> then <hi>John,</hi> who being of the Priests might
indifferently have been born in any of the Tribes whatsoever. Only
the Holy Ghost giveth us to observe this which may not bee passed,
That <hi>John</hi> that should bring in Baptisme in stead of Circumcision,
was borne in that very place where Circumcision was first ordained,
in the City <hi>Hebron.</hi> It is generally held indeed that the Virgin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in <hi>Nazaret,</hi> and in the very instant of the Angels talking with
her, but whether there bee not as much probability for this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as for that, I referre to the equall and judicious Reader.</p>

                        </gap>, as it is said before, in the LXX, who must

is it rendred here by the <hi>Syrian, Arabicke, Spanish, French, Deodates
Italian, Dutch,</hi> and all <hi>Latines</hi> that are not wedded to the vulgar:
And so is it used by the Lxx, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, The same word in a manner, or one of the same root, in
ver. 52. is opposed to <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, and inevitably beareth the sense wee
follow. Fourthly, if the Virgin spake in the sense the Romanists
would have her, <hi>Hee hath looked upon my lowlinesse to give it its desert,</hi>
shee would prove to bee intolerably proud in the valuing of her
humility.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[All generations shall call mee blessed]</hi> As <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 13. Not only thou
oh Cosin <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> and the Jewish nation that expect the Messias,
but even all the world, and all successions of ages among the heathen,
shall come to the knowledge and confession of Christ, and account
mee blessed in the favour that I have received.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 51. <hi>[Her hath scattered the proud, &amp;c.]</hi> If the Virgin aime these
words, and those of the same tenour that follow, at any particular
persons, as some conceive shee doth, and meaneth the Devils, or the
Pharisees, or the Jews, it might as well bee conceived, that shee
hath respect to the foure tyrannous and persecuting Monarchies in
the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which were now destroyed, as much as to any
thing else: But since the very same words in a manner, are to bee
found in the song of <hi>Hannab, 1 Sam,</hi> 2. they warrant us to interpret
them not so restrictively, as to any one particular example, but of
the generall and ordinary dealing of God in the world, with the

verse of the Section next going before.</p>
                     <p>Now since the Evangelist hath begun with the genealogy, that
also must here bee taken in; and that the rather, because he hath
placed it in the forefront of his Gospel, for speciall reason. First,
that hee might make way for the understanding of those words of
the Angel, <hi>Joseph thou Son of David, Verse</hi> 20. Secondly, that the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
which the wisemen give to our Saviour might be cleared, when
they call him <hi>King of the Jewes,</hi> Chap. 2. 2. Thirdly, that his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true and right <hi>Messias</hi> might bee approved, by shewing that
according to the promises and Prophecies made before concerning
him, hee was descended of the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the stock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

after concerning our Saviour, to try whether he were the true
<hi>Messias,</hi> or no, would be these. First, whether he were of the house

of <hi>David.</hi> Secondly, whether hee were borne in <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and so
wee find them questioning about him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 42. In this regard it
was necessary, that <hi>Matthew an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in these two particulars: which he doth accordingly, shewing
his descent from <hi>David</hi> in this Chapter, and his birth in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi>
in the next Chapter following.</p>
                     <p>The last verse of this Section and chapter, Hee <hi>knew her not, till

the right order of the story, and to bring in Christs birth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its time, if wee lay it here. But since the Evangelist will say no
more of it, but onely this; and because we desire to breake the text
into as few peeces as possible, this shall be let to lie where it doth,

from thence, yet the carnall sense of it, which aimeth onely at the
earthly Kingdome of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and at the exact descent from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
hee closely confuteth to the eyes of the intelligent Reader by
these two things. First, in that hee bringeth the Line along to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonias,</hi>
in whom the seed of <hi>Solomon</hi> and the regall dignity also with
it failed. Secondly, in that hee deriveth the interest of Christ in
that dignity, if it were any, onely by <hi>Joseph,</hi> which according to
the flesh, had no relation at all to him, save the marriage of his
Mother.</p>
                     <p>The Jewes to disgrace the Gospel of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> doe hold that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonias</hi>

Or from the significancy of the word which importeth <hi>requited.</hi> For
whereas <hi>Jechonias</hi> was also called <hi>Shallum,</hi> that is, finished, because

also <hi>Abiud,</hi> in remembrance of this his Fathers glory: And his
second brother <hi>Hananiah,</hi> was also called <hi>Rhesa,</hi> that is, <hi>The chiefe,</hi>
or principall, because of Christs descending from him. These
things wee have now but by conjecture, but that wee may take the
bolder, because the Text in the place alledged in the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> hath
set these two Sonnes of <hi>Zorobabel</hi> apart and distinct from the rest of
their Brethren, as if for some speciall thing more remarkable then
they. But there is no doubt but the Evangelists in naming them by

                     <p>Vers. 23. <hi>[Behold, a Virgin]</hi> The Jews seeke to elude this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Isaiah</hi> by expounding it, either of the Prophets wife, as <hi>Isa. 8.
3.</hi> or of the Kings wife; and from <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 19. they plead that <hi>Almah</hi>
doth not strictly signifie a virgin, but a woman that hath knowne a
man.</p>
                     <p>Answ. 1. There are three words in the Hebrew, that signifie and
betoken Virginity, but this most properly: First, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifieth a
Virgin, but not alwayes: for it properly denoteth a young woman;
yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though shee bee not a virgin, but hath been touched. Secondly,
<hi>Bethulah</hi> is the common word used to denote Virginity; yet as <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
observeth out of <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. it seemeth sometime to bee taken other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
But thirdly, <hi>Almah</hi> properly importeth a <hi>young Virgin,</hi> and not
at all one touched: So that <hi>Naarah</hi> signifieth any young Woman,
though she bee not a Virgin: <hi>Bethulah,</hi> a Virgin though shee bee not
young: but <hi>Almah</hi> importeth youth and virginity both.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Lxx in the place of <hi>Isaiah</hi> cited, translate the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: which denoteth no otherwise then a Virgin.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[Which is being interpreted]</hi> First, this, and other passages of the
same nature in this Evangelist, argue strongly, that <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote
not his Gospel in the Hebrew tongue, as is very commonly held:
For, first, then had this word needed no interpretation, and it had
been very hard to have interpreted it, but by the same word againe.
Secondly, the Jewes in those times that <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote, understood
not the Hebrew tongue in its purity, but had degenerated into the
use and speech of the Syrian. Thirdly, <hi>Jonathan Ben Vzziel</hi> transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Prophets out of Hebrew into Chaldee, a little before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Christ; and <hi>Onkelos</hi> did as much by the Law a little after,
and both did so, because the Jews could not at that time understand
or read the Bible in its owne Hebrew tongue: and how improper
then was it for <hi>Matthew</hi> to write his Gospel in that language?
Fourthly, all the world that used the Old Testament at those times,
unlesse it were such as had gained the Hebrew tongue by study, used it
in the translation of the Lxx, or the Greeke, and it was requisite that
the Pen-men of the New Testament should write in that language,
and according to their stile [as <hi>Paul</hi> writing for, and to Romanes,
and <hi>Matthew</hi> and hee to Hebrewes] that their quotations out of
the Old Testament might be examined by the Greek Bible. Fifthly,
let those that hold the opinion we are confuting, but seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that Christ calleth himselfe by the name of two Greeke letters,
and why; <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
                     <p>Verse 25. [He knew her not till she had brought forth] This
properly falleth in order at <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 7. and there shall it bee taken up
againe.</p>

that spake of <hi>Christ,</hi> from the beginning of the world.</p>
                     <p>Vers. 71. <hi>[That wee should bee saved from our enemies]</hi> This hath
sweet reference to the promise given at the beginning of the World;
from which time he had traced Prophecies in the verse preceding. I
<hi>will put enmity betwixt thee and the woman, and betweene thy seed, and her
seed: Hee shall breake thine head,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. Where, in the former
words of the verse, I will set enmity, &amp;c. there is an expression who
are our enemies; namely, the Serpent and his seed: and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

So that the former verse and this being laid together, they arise
unto this sense, that all the Prophets from <hi>Adam</hi> and upward, had

                     <p>The Taxe is dated by the time of <hi>Cyrenius</hi> his Governing of <hi>Syria:</hi>
First, because <hi>Judea</hi> was annexed to <hi>Syria,</hi> as a member of it: and
in naming the one, the other is included. Secondly, hereby the
losse and want of the Scepter and Law-giver in the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi>
is the better seen, for the subjection of the Jewes by this is shewed
to bee in the third degree. They subject to <hi>Herod, Herod</hi> to <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
and <hi>Cyrenius</hi> to <hi>Augustus.</hi> Thirdly, from <hi>Syria</hi> had <hi>Israel</hi> had
their greatest afflictions, that ever they had in their own Land; as
by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog, Ezek.</hi> 38. or the house of the <hi>North, Dan.</hi> 11.

things to mind: and sayeth as it were the last verse of <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. and
the first of <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. together.</p>
                     <p>The taxing is said <hi>first</hi> to bee made in his time: As first, denying,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52154:56"/>
that ever there was such an universall taxation in the Empire before,
for the Empire was never in that case of universall quietnesse to bee
taxed before: And secondly, importing the taxes of that Country
that followed after: <hi>[Augustus</hi> at this very time laying the platform
subjection and submission of the Empire for succeeding posterities:]
And here, [let it bee said againe] in exact propriety beginneth the

                     <p>This taxing was first by Kingdomes and Countries, then by Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

were divided one from another. Secondly, Cities and Townes
in every Kingdome and Province, were also particularized, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
given that every one should repaire to the place to which by stock

in their severall Cities, their names were taken and inrolled,
and so the Greek word here used doth signifie in the neerest proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Then did they make profession of Subjection to the Romane

of some certaine summe of money which was laid upon every poll.</p>
                     <p>And now, first, are the Jews entring under the yoke of that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
which they never cast off again, but it pressed them into a
finall desolation even to this day. Secondly, They had voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought this misery upon themselves in calling in the Romans
in their civill warres. Thirdly, No sparke of their former freedome
and authority is left among them for their King and Law-giver is

                        </gap>
which hee was borne, as wee have done into the yeere it self, or the

                     <p>The yeere of the world, as wee observed then, was, 3928.</p>

The yeere of <hi>Augustus</hi> is neither so necessary to seek, nor so ease
to find: partly, because there is some difference among Historians
about the number of the yeeres of his Reigne, and partly because
there may bee some about the yeere of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in which Christ
was Baptized, from which wee should count backward: For though
it bee said that <hi>John</hi> came Baptizing in his fifteenth yeere, <hi>Luk.</hi> 31.
yet may it bee questionable, whether hee Baptized Christ in that
yeere or no: But not to swarve from the most common consent of
Romane Historians, that say that <hi>Augustus</hi> Reigned six and fifty
yeeres, and of Christians that hold that Christ was baptized in
the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> then may it bee readily concluded that
hee was borne in the forty second of <hi>Augustus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The time of the yeere at which hee was borne, hath beene much
mistaken, being concluded upon, at the latter end of <hi>December:</hi> This
mistake did first arise by another: for it being misunderstood that
<hi>Zacharias</hi> was the High Priest, and that hee was in <hi>Sancto Sanctorum,</hi>
on the expiation day, when the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> appeared unto him,
they could doe no lesse then conclude, that <hi>John</hi> was borne in the
middle of Summer, and Christ in the middle of Winter. A time very
unfit for people to travaile to their severall Cities to be taxed, but far
more unfit for Shepherds to lye abroad in the fields all night.</p>
                     <p>For finding out therefore the true and right time of his Nativity,
these things are to bee taken into consideration.</p>
                     <p>First, That the time that Christ lived here upon the earth, was
two and thirty yeeres and a halfe, exactly: And so long did <hi>David</hi>
Reigne in <hi>Jerusalem, 2 Sam.</hi> 5. 4, 5.</p>
                     <p>This time was divided into two unequall parts: twenty nine yeers
compleat hee spent as a private man before hee was baptized, for it
is said, hee began to bee thirty, or was entring upon his thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at his Baptisme, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 23. And three yeeres and an halfe from his
Baptisme to his death: This summe was precisely told of by the
Angel <hi>Gabriel, Dan. 9. 27. In halfe that week shall hee cause sacrifice
and oblation to cease:</hi> And is plainly parcelled out by Passeovers and
other circumstances of time, <hi>Mat. 4. 2. Job.</hi> 1. 29. 35. 44. &amp; 2. 1. 13.
&amp; 5. 1. &amp; 6. 4. &amp; 13. 1.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the time of Christs death was at <hi>Easter,</hi> or their
Passeover, as is most plaine by all the Evangelists.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That hee living just two and thirty yeers and a halfe,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52154:57"/>
and dying at Easter; it must needs follow that hee was borne about
the middle of the moneth <hi>Tisri,</hi> which answereth to part of our
<hi>September;</hi> And it is not only probable, but also necessary, if he lived
thirty two yeeres and a halfe exactly; that then as hee died upon
the fiftheenth day of the moneth <hi>Abib,</hi> or at the Passeover; so that he
was borne about the fifteenth day of <hi>Tisri,</hi> at the Feast of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles:
a moneth and a Feast, that had been exceedingly renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in ancient times. In this moneth the World had begun, and
sin had entred into it. In this moneth were all the Father born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Flood, as the Jewes averre, and reason confirmes it. From
this moneth began the circle of the yeere from the Creation, to the
redemption out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> From this moneth began the typicall
yeere of Jubile in the ages after. And in this moneth were the three
famous Feasts of Trumpets, of Expiation, and of Tabernacles. And
like glorious things may bee observed upon the Feast of Tabernacles
it selfe: At that very time did <hi>Israel</hi> fall upon the making of the
Tabernacle in the wildernesse, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. At this very time was the
consecration of the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 8. 2. And at this very time,
was our Saviour borne, and began to carry the Tabernacle of his
flesh; and at this very time was hee Baptized, and began the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Gospel. So that here appeareth one addition more to
the present misery and subjection of the Jewes at the time of this
taxe; that not onely they must leave all their occasions, to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thier own taxing, and promote their own bondage, but that they
must neglect a maine part of the service of God, the <hi>Feast of Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> as <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 16, 17. to attend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
and their owne thraldome.</p>
                     <p>And now, it being considered that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> was but halfe
a yeere older then our Saviour, it will be observable how the foure
points of the yeer, as it may be so said, were renowned with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and nativity. <hi>John</hi> conceived at the Summer Solstice, and
our <hi>Saviour</hi> at the Winter, <hi>John</hi> born at the vernall Equinox, and
our <hi>Saviour</hi> at the Autumnall.</p>

                     <p>This passage is one ground-work whereupon Expositors conclude
that <hi>Christ</hi> was borne without paine to his mother: for that shee
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52154:58"/>
performed the Midwives p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t her selfe, and none to help her. A se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is this: <hi>That he was borne without his Mothers paine, because hee
was conceived without her pleasure.</hi> A third Argument may bee fetched
from the blessing of propagation given to our first Parents in the
Garden. And a fourth from the example of the delivery of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
women in <hi>Egypt:</hi> For first, when God gave this blessing to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
and <hi>Eve</hi> in their innocency, <hi>increase and multiply, Gen.</hi> 1. 28.
it inabled them to beget children agreeable to their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
that is, holy, righteous, and without any symptomes or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents
of sinne, either in themselves, or in the mothers. But they
never begat any child thus, because of their sudden fall. What, did this
first blessing then utterly faile, and never take effect, in its proper sense
and full extent? Could such emphaticall words of God to man in
innocency, fall to the ground without performance? No, they took
place in the second <hi>Adam,</hi> who was borne according to the full
extent and intent of that blessing to our innocent parents; in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
holinesse and righteousnesse, and without paine to his mother.
Secondly, if the Hebrew wonien in Egypt had so quicke and easie a
delivery, as that they were not like to other women: much more
may we thinke the travaile and delivery of the Virgin to have been
quicke, lively, miraculous and painlesse, as <hi>Esa. 66. 7. Before her
paine came, she was delivered of a man child.</hi>

                     <p>The whole Verse is but one Proposition or Axiome, in which the
last clause of all is the subject, and the two former are predicated of it.
And it lieth in this sense, <hi>The good will of God to men</hi> shewed in the
Incarnation of our Saviour, when God himselfe disdained not to
take the nature of man, <hi>is glory to him in the highest, and is peace upon the
earth:</hi> And that this is the genuine and proper meaning and posture
of the words, may be observed; First, by the conjunction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>And,</hi>
put betweene, <hi>Glory to God,</hi> and <hi>peace on earth,</hi> and none between them,
and <hi>good will.</hi> And secondly, the very sense and matter it self inforceth
this construction: For first, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> beareth the same
sense here, that <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> doth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. and 17. 5. of
<hi>Gods good-will,</hi> or <hi>will-pleasednesse</hi> with men. Now, secondly, this
well-pleased nesse of his, with men, was expressed and evidenced at this
time, in the birth of our Saviour, in that God had assumed the nature
of men, and it had never been so cleered and demonstrated before. So
that, thirdly, the birth of Christ being the occasion of the Angels
singing this song, the good will of God towards men revealed, in
this his birth, must needs bee the subject of their Song. And
then fourthly, the other two things expressed in the two other
clauses, <hi>glory on High, and peace on Earth,</hi> must needs be understood as
Predicates; seeing that, being laid, to this expression of God of his
good will towards men, they are but as fruits and consequences of it.
And this reading and construction, how facil and plaine is it, in

comparison of these intricacies and obscurities, that those readings
bring with them, that either breake the verse into three distinct

this is the Genealogy of this man, as it is Recorded by the Jewes

if hee were so holy and devout a man, and confessed Christ, as this
Evangelist relateth of him, how came it to passe that his Sonne
<hi>Gamaliel</hi> was so farre contrary, as appeareth by the education of
<hi>Paul,</hi> in Pharisaicall righteousnesse, and persecution of the Truth?</p>
                     <p>Answ. First, it is no strange thing for holy Fathers to have wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>Secondly, it was thirty yeeres from <hi>Simeons</hi> acknowledging of
Christ, to <hi>Gamaliels</hi> education of <hi>Paul,</hi> or little lesse, and so much
time might weare out the notice of his Fathers action, if hee had

                     <p>TO confirme and prove the Order of this Section and Story, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
some labour, because of an opinion ancient, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
among men, that crosseth the laying of it in this place. It hath
been generally held, and beleeved, almost of every one, that the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
came to Christ when hee was but thirteene dayes old, and it is
written in red Letters in the <hi>Kalendar,</hi> as if it were a golden truth, by
the title of <hi>Epiphany,</hi> at the sixth of <hi>January.</hi> An opinion which if it
were as true as it is common, it were readily knowne where to place
this Story of the Wisemens comming; namely, between the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
of our Saviour, and his Presentation in the Temple, betwixt
<hi>Ver.</hi> 2. and 22. of <hi>Luke</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>But upon serious and impartiall examination of this opinion,
these rubs and unlikelyhoods lie in the way, and make it as incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
for the improbability, as it seemeth venerable for its anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
                     <p>First, to omit the length of their journey from their owne
Countrey to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> their preparation for so long a journey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they set out, and their stay at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the way [for I cannot
thinke that all that passed there while they were there, was done in
an instant.]</p>
                     <p>Secondly, how utterly improbable is it, that after all this hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub
at. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> upon the wisemens question, <hi>where is the King of the
Jewes?</hi> And after <hi>Herods</hi> curious scrutiny and inquiry where the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52154:63"/>
child should bee, and after his implacable indignation upon the
Wisemens deluding or mocking of him as hee did conceive, that the
child that hee had thus eagerly hunted after, should after all this stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and searching come to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as it were into his very mouth,
and there be publikely proclaimed by <hi>Simeon</hi> &amp; <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> in the Temple,
to bee the very same that the Wisemen and <hi>Herod,</hi> though with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
intentions, looked after; For first, it is to bee observed, that it
was seven and twenty dayes from the time that this opinion bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the wisemen to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to the time that <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>
brought Jesus to the Temple; now it is not imaginable, but that in
all this time <hi>Joseph,</hi> that was but at so few miles distance, should heare
what was done at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> upon the Wisemens comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
[if so bee they told him not themselves] and how <hi>Herod</hi> tooke
the matter, when he missed of their unexpected returne. Secondly,
for ought that can bee found in the text to the contrary, it may bee
well supposed that they had their divine warning not to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to <hi>Herod,</hi> while they were at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> might well be
acquainted by them with it. Thirdly, it is not to bee doubted but
they had dispatched what they did at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in farre lesse time
then seven and twenty dayes: [and surely of all men they will not
deny this, that will bring them out either of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or <hi>Persia,</hi> to
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> in halfe the time] And as little to bee doubted that <hi>Herod</hi>
in the compasse of so much time, saw the disappointment of his
expectation of the Wisemens returne, and breaketh out into choler
against the poor Infants of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> Fourthly, now all these things
being laid together, how senselesse a thing will it be, to make <hi>Joseph</hi>
to bring the child for whom all this businesse was, under the Tyrants
nose? Fifthly, or if <hi>Joseph</hi> did not know of all these things, [which
is almost impossible] yet how is it imaginable that Christ
should have escaped the Tyrant, being at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and so publikely
acknowledged and spoken of? It is true indeed that he might have
been sheltered by the divine power, but wee see by his flight into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> that it was not the will of God to use that miraculous means
of his preservation as yet, but another.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and which is the reason that hath moved mee to lay this
Story after our Saviours presentation in the Temple: yea, and to
suppose him to bee two yeeres old, or thereabout, when the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
came; because the text saith in plaine termes, That <hi>Herod sem
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52154:63"/>
and slew the children from two yeeres old and under, according to the time
that he had diligently inquired of the Wisemen:</hi> Now his inquiry was of
the time of the Starres appearing, Vers. 7. and he slew from two
yeeres old and under, according to the time that he had inquired,
and therefore how can it be thought otherwise, then that it was two
yee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es or thereabout since the starre appeared, and consequently so
long since <hi>Christ</hi> was borne? But that this may appeare past all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and that the opinions that bring the wisemen to Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his presentation in the Temple [for there are two severall ones
to that purpose, that of the thirteenth day mentioned before; and
another of some that hold they came not so soone as on that day,
but yet within the forty dayes of <hi>Maries</hi> lying in, or before her Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification]
let it not be too tedious to the Reader, to take a view of all
the Arguments that are, or can bee used, for ought I yet understand;
either for the confirmation of the two opinions, which we refuse,
<hi>viz.</hi> of the Wisemens comming before Christ was forty dayes old,
or for the overthrow of this which we imbrace, that he was two
yeeres old, or thereabout.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This Argument is used by some, but those but a few; not
considering how impossible it was, that the Wisemen should know
the exact time of his birth, but by the time of the Starres appearing.
And it is not only the generall opinion even of all, but also dictated
by reason it self, that the Star was not the Harbinger of his birth,
much lesse so long before; but the concomitant and attendant
upon it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 3. The Wisemen came, while <hi>Mary</hi> lay in at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi>
but <hi>Herod,</hi> either in policy, or for some other occasion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52154:64"/>
the murder of the children till two yeeres after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This both the Text and common sense contradicteth. For
first, in Reason: what policy could there be in deferring, when the
longer he forbare, the harder it would bee for him to find him, for
whom he sought? Secondly, the Text telleth, that assoone as hee
saw himselfe mocked by the Wisemen, he fell to the murdering of
the children: and he might see whether hee were mocked by them,
or not, within a short space after their departure from him at
<hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 4. In that speech of the Evangelist, <hi>Herod slew all the male
children, from two yeeres old and under, according to the time that hee had
inquired of the Wisemen:</hi> the latter words, <hi>according to the time that hee
had inquired,</hi> have relation to the words, <hi>and under;</hi> and to the words
<hi>from two yeeres old.</hi> For this seemeth to bee added by the Evangelist
to this purpose, that he might signifie, that all under two yeeres old
were not slain; but onely those that were there-about, and which
were borne before the Starres appearing, and not after. For hee
thought not that this royall child was borne after it appeared. But
all that were about two yeeres old hee slew; lest if happily Christ
had been borne before it appeared, or miraculously growne, above
the quality of such an age, he might have escaped out of his hands.
And therefore as hee dilated his murther for place, comprehending
the coasts of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> under the cruelty, as well as the Towne it self;
so also did he it for a time, slaying those that were borne, before the
Starres appearing, as wel as at it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This, as <hi>Baronius</hi> confesseth, is a new found glosse upon
that Text, and hee tooke himselfe for the inventor of it, till he met
with it in <hi>Jansenius,</hi> who like a great wit had jumped with him:
Both straining the utmost of their invention to gild over their Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar
tenet, of the Wisemens comming on the thirteenth day.
But first, to omit the strange shape and uncouthnesse of this Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which easily sheweth it selfe to any eye that is not bleered with
prejudice and partiality: As also, secondly, their confident scrutiny
and knowledge of <hi>Herods</hi> thoughts: Let it but, thirdly, be weighed
in the ballance of indifferency; what colour of sense, or equality of
policy can be seen in this carriage of <hi>Herod,</hi> to slay all that were born
two yeeres before the Starre, and none of a day after, or very few?
For might hee not suspect th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

weeke or fortnight after it, as well as before? Judge therefore how
these men that hold, and that truly, that it appeared but just at <hi>Christs</hi>
birth, can handsomely stitch that opinion and this together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 5. But the wisemen found Christ at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and what
should hee doe there at two yeeres old? For <hi>S. Luke</hi> also saith, <hi>Chap.
2.</hi> 29. that when <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> had performed all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law, [he meaneth at the time of her purification, when
Christ was now but forty dayes old] they departed to <hi>Nazareth.</hi> So
that if the wisemen came after these forty daies, they must have found
Christ at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and not at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> And first, to the question, How came he to be at <hi>Behelehem</hi>
at two yeeres old? An answer hath been framed to this long agoe,
by some few that have been of this opinion that we imbrace; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that some of the three festivals in which every male was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before the Lord, drew his Parents, and him with them to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
and they tooke <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in the way, and there the wisemen
find him. A resolution with which if there were no other to be had,
one might rest satisfied reasonably well; yet a more serious searching
into the Text, will give a more warrantable reason, and better assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
then this, which is but mens supposall. And that is this, that as
the parents of <hi>Jesus</hi> knew that it was necessary that he should be born
in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> because of the Prophecy that had told of it before; so
also did they think it as necessary that he should live and be brought
up there, because of his alliance to the house of <hi>David:</hi> And from
thence they durst not remove him, till they had speciall warrant, and
warrant they had none, till the Angell dismisse them into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
This is not a groping of their thoughts, onely by surmisall, as was
theirs of <hi>Herods</hi> mentioned before, but there is plaine and evident
demonstration for it in the text: for when <hi>Joseph</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by an Angel after the death of <hi>Herod,</hi> to returne to the Land
of <hi>Israel,</hi> it is said, <hi>Hee was afraid to goe into Judea, when hee heard that</hi>
Archelaus <hi>reigned in stead of</hi> Herod. Now what should hee doe in
<hi>Judea?</hi> Or why should he rather thinke of going thither, then into
his owne Countrey <hi>Galilee?</hi> But that hee thought of returning to
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> againe, from whence he had come; supposing that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
of the <hi>Messias</hi> had beene confined thither, as well as his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52154:65"/>
birth: But being warned and warranted by an Angel in a dreame,
hee then departed into <hi>Nazareth,</hi> verse 22. By which words it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
not onely that he durst not goe to his owne home till hee
had divine commission; but also that hee had never been in <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi>
since Christ was borne, till this his comming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
otherwise he would have addressed his thoughts thither, and not to

                     <p>And by this are wee to expound the text of <hi>Luke</hi> alledged, <hi>when
they had performed all things according to the Law, they departed to their
owne City Nazareth:</hi> namely, that he speaketh briefly, in what hee
saw <hi>Matthew</hi> had handled at large before: and not so much inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to shew Christs quicke departure into <hi>Galilee,</hi> after his presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Temple, as to draw you to looke for him in <hi>Galilee,</hi> at
the next story following, which fell out very many yeeres after.
And that such briefe transitions are no strange thing in Scripture,
might be shewed at large, but more especially in the Evangelist <hi>S. Luke,</hi>
that we have in hand: as to spare more; in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 14. He bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our Saviour, as it were, from the Pinnacle of the Temple, into
<hi>Galilee;</hi> as if his journey thither, had beene the first thing hee did:
whereas hee returned with the Devil into the Wildernesse againe;
and from thence came to <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Jordan,</hi> before hee set for <hi>Galilee.</hi>
And <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 18, 19. &amp;c. where under these few words, <hi>Saul</hi> was
converted and baptized, preached in <hi>Damascus</hi> a good season,
was laid in wait for, and escaped over the wall, and went to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi>
hee hath comprehended a story of him of three yeeres,
and hath omitted his journey from <hi>Damascus</hi> into <hi>Arabia,</hi> and to
<hi>Damascus</hi> againe, before he set for <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe hath
parcelled it out, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 6. But why should the Wiseman stay so long after they
had seene the Starre, as not to come to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to Christ of
two yeeres after?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> So did <hi>Moses</hi> lie within a daies journey or little more of his
wife and children, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. &amp;c. a whole twelve moneth together
within a few daies, and yet they came not at all together, not for
the distance of the places where they were, but because of the divine
disposall of the Lord, for a speciall reason.</p>
                     <p>And so was it with these men: It was not the distance of their
Countrey from <hi>Judea,</hi> were it either <hi>Arabia</hi> or <hi>Persia;</hi> nay, had it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52154:65"/>

of the Lord, that detained them backe for so long a time, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that Christs stay in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> may leave no excuse behind, if they

Of whose life and actions <hi>Josephus, Egesippus,</hi> and others have
discoursed at large, and it is not seasonable to insist upon them here.
This onely is not impertinent to inquire after, what yeare it was
of the reigne of <hi>Herod,</hi> when this story of the Wisemens comming
to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the butchery upon the children there fell out, that
it may bee seene how long our Saviour was in Egypt, before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

                     <p>
                        <hi>Josephus Antiq. lib. 14. cap.</hi> 26. hath placed the beginning of <hi>Herods</hi>
reigne, under the hundreth eighty and fourth Olympiad, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52154:66"/>
the Consulship of <hi>C. Domitius Calvinus II.</hi> and <hi>C. Asinius Pollio,</hi>
and hath summed the length of it to foure and thirty yeeres from
the death of <hi>Antigonus</hi> his competitor, and seven and thirty from
the Romans first declaring of him King. <hi>Antiq. lib. 17. cap.</hi> 10. And
with this reckoning of the yeers of his reigne, agreeth <hi>Egesippus de
Excid. Jerosol. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 45. and so doth <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his Chronicle
for the latter summe of seven and thirty, but differeth farre from the
beginning of his reigne, placing it under the last yeere of Olympiad
186. eight yeeres at least after the time prefixed by <hi>Josephus.</hi> And
reason hee hath indeed to differ from his beginning. For if <hi>Herod</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his Reigne in the Consulship of the men fore-named, and
reigned but thirty and seven yeeres from thence, it will result in the
conclusion, that hee dyed the yeere before our Saviour was borne,
as may bee easily cast by the Catalogue or number of Consuls from
<hi>Cn. Domitius</hi> and <hi>Asinius Pollio,</hi> which was after the building of the
City, <hi>Anno</hi> 71. to <hi>Cornelius Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Valerius Messalinus,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whom our Saviour was borne, which was <hi>Anno urbis</hi> 751. So
that this account of yeeres that <hi>Josephus</hi> hath given, though it bee
true for the number, yet can it not bee so from that beginning from
whence hee hath dated them. What shall we say then, by begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the thirty seven yeeres of his Reigne, from the time that hee
was King intire, and <hi>sans</hi> corrivall in the kingdome, by the death
of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the last sparke of the <hi>Asmonean</hi> fire? Why, herein
also I find <hi>Dion</hi> differing from <hi>Josephus,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> from them
both. For, whereas <hi>Josephus</hi> hath related that the sacking of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
by <hi>Socius,</hi> and the death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> were under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship
of <hi>M. Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Canidius,</hi> or <hi>Caninius Gallus,</hi> which was
<hi>Anno urbis conditae, 717. Dion</hi> in his Romane History, <hi>lib.</hi> 49. hath
placed the crucifying of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and the making of <hi>Herod</hi> King
by <hi>Antony</hi> under the Consulship of <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Norbanus,</hi> which
was <hi>Anno V. C.</hi> 716. or a yeer before. And <hi>Eusebius</hi> hath still laid
<hi>Herods</hi> beginning a yeere or two after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Baronius</hi> hath found out a date different from all these, namely,
that <hi>Herods</hi> yeeres of his Reigne are to bee begun from the time that
hee received his Crowne from the hands of <hi>Augustus,</hi> after his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Antony,</hi> at the battell at <hi>Actium; Caesar</hi> being then in <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
of which story <hi>Josephus</hi> maketh mention, <hi>Antiq. lib. 15. cap. 10. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
being then a third time Consull, and <hi>Valerius Messalla Corvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:52154:66"/>
his partner. By which account 't will follow that our Saviour
was borne in the nine and twentieth yeere of <hi>Herods</hi> Reigne, and
that <hi>Herod</hi> lived till hee was about nine yeeres old. Which opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
though it best suiteth to the salving of other passages of <hi>Josephus</hi>
in Chronologie about this time, yet it seemeth to bee something too
corrasive an application, and a remedy very harsh, upon these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
                     <p>First, Because by this account of his, both about the wisemens
comming and <hi>Herods</hi> death, hee will have Christ to bee nine yeers
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or thereabout, or according to our reckoning, seven yeers
or little under: Now, in his banishment from his owne Country,
the meanes of his Parents and of his owne subsistence in a foraine
Land for so long a time, is so hard to imagine, that it will breed
another and no lesse a scruple then that in hand.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the transition of S. <hi>Luke</hi> from his presenting in the
Temple, to his comming into <hi>Nazareth</hi> will seem a great deale the
more harsh, if eight or nine yeeres are to bee taken in betweene, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
with such as <hi>Baronius</hi> himselfe, who will have nothing
to come betweene at all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by this opinion must our Saviour bee nineteen yeers old
and more, at the death of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and then how could hee bee,
but beginning to bee thirty in the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius, Luk</hi> 3. For
suppose with the Cardinall that hee was nine yeers old at the death
of <hi>Herod,</hi> then was hee nineteen at the banishment of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who
reigned ten yeers, as appeareth by <hi>Josephus, Antiq. lib. 17. cap.</hi> 15. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Archelaus</hi> was removed from his kingdome, the same <hi>Josephus</hi>
nameth <hi>Cyrenius,</hi> and <hi>Coponius,</hi> as rulers and disposers of <hi>Judea</hi> for a
season. And after <hi>Coponius. Marcus Ambibuchus</hi> was Ruler, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him <hi>Annius Rufus,</hi> and then dyed <hi>Augustus.</hi> Now lay all these
together, and it will follow that our Saviour could not bee lesse
then above twenty yeeres old, at the death of <hi>Augustus,</hi> whereas it
is most plaine by the Gospel that hee was but about fifteene. Let us
therefore take these parcels backward, and as they confute the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
under question, so doe they helpe to settle and resolve the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
in hand. For grant that <hi>Coponius, Ambibuchus,</hi> and <hi>Rufus</hi>
ruled their single yeeres apeece, after the exile of <hi>Archelaus</hi> (as it is
most like they did, and more then yeeres a peece they could not doe,
all things well laid together) and take before them the ten yeeres
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52154:67"/>
current of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and we have thirteene yeeres backward o sour
Saviours fifteene at the death of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and this doth bring us to
his two yeeres of age or thereabout; which was the time when the
Wisemen came to him. So that since <hi>Archelaus</hi> began to reigne, when
Christ was not very much above two yeeres old, for that hee was
something above, [it may bee some moneths] the time that <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
wanted of ten yeeres reigne compleat, will allow, and that hee
could not be more then such a space above, the premises well pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated
will conclude, it will readily and plainly follow, that our
Saviours birth was in the five and thirtieth yeer of <hi>Herod;</hi> and this
murder of the children of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> in his seven and thirtieth; but
a moneth or two, or such a space before his death. Now whereas
some sticke not to say, that he was strucke with the wound of death
that very night that the children were slaine, and dyed not many
dayes or houres after, in that we cannot be so punctuall; but that he
lived not many moneths after, is more then probable, by the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
and computations mentioned, well weighed, and laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

                     <p>That is, <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> or <hi>Magicians,</hi> and so might it not unfitly bee
translated. For, first, though <hi>Magus</hi> and <hi>Magia,</hi> admit of a gentle
construction, and be often taken, not onely in an harmlesse, but in a

and by the Idiom and propriety of that, must the word bee
expounded; and not by Forain and Heathen language and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It is true indeed, that among the <hi>Persians</hi> the <hi>Magi</hi> have beene
renowned for men of excellent wisdome and skill in naturall, and in
other things, and that none were admitted to reigne among them,
unlesse he were well versed in the learning of the <hi>Magi;</hi> and that
<hi>Plato, Tullie, Philo, Plinie</hi> and others, doe extoll <hi>Magia,</hi> or Magick,
to be the very height and perfection of Philosophy: But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who is ever the sure Expositor of it selfe, doth never take the
word, but in the worse sense, for the Devillish and damnable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and practicers of sorcery and unlawfull arts, as <hi>Act. 8. 9. Simon</hi>

sense and reason to refuse the sense of Scripture, for a Scripture
word, and to fetch the interpretation of it from <hi>Persia, Plato, Pliny,</hi>
and I know not whence.</p>
                     <p>2. It doth the more set forth the lustre and glory of the birth of
Christ, and the power of himselfe and kingdome, by supposing that
these men that had beene hitherto devoted to the arts, service, and
converse of the Devill, should now forsake them, and him, and their
owne delight, and their old profession, and dedicate themselves, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes
and gifts, to a child unknowne, farre off, and but poorely
borne.</p>
                     <p>3. Nor is this opinion but newly minted, but it carrieth with it
the passeport and priviledge of antiquity. For <hi>Ignatius Martyr</hi> in his

saith thus, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.
<hi>Then the wisdome of this World grew foolish, Sorcery a toy, and
Magicke a derision:</hi> personating the men in both their contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
and devotednesse, Devillish and divine, to Satan and Christ.
So likewise <hi>Just in Martyr</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho,</hi> speaking of
these same men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

captived or led away as a

to Devils in a more speciall manner:</hi> And to this sense doth the
Gospel of <hi>Matthew</hi> in Hebrew render the word, whosoever transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it. But to spare more, those fathers confesse their opinion to bee
the same with these; [and those neither meane ones, nor a few]
which hold, some of them, that these <hi>Magi</hi> had obtained their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
concerning the King of the Jewes, from <hi>Sibylla Erythraea,</hi> and
others from <hi>Balaam,</hi> to whom they hold that they stood in relation
not onely of Nation and kindred, but also of the same profession and

                     <p>This doth something confirm the foregoing opinion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52154:68"/>
Magicians, if it need any more confirmation. For that the East
was infamous for Sorceries, auguries and incantations is apparent
by <hi>Esa.</hi> 2. 6. as it is understood by the Lxx, by <hi>R. Solomon, David
Kimchi,</hi> and even approved by the context it selfe: But what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of the east this was, whence these men came, is as hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
as it was what manner of men they were. Divers have asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that they were of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> minding, it seemeth, rather the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and worst sense, of both the words <hi>Chaldeus</hi> and <hi>Magus,</hi> which
signifie both one and the same ungodly profession, then the letter of
text, and of other Scriptures. For it plainly telleth that these came
from the East, and all the Prophets that have spoken of the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> have fetched those destroyers from
the North, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Others therefore doe hold them for <hi>Persians,</hi> and that chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the word <hi>Magus,</hi> is thought to be originally a <hi>Persian</hi> word.</p>
                     <p>But first, as was said before, the Scripture word is to bee interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
according to the Scripture Idiom, and so it confineth them to
<hi>Persia</hi> no more then to any other Countrey. Secondly, if it should
be averred, that the <hi>Persian Magi</hi> grew renowned from a family of
that name, or from some Ancestor that was called <hi>Mag</hi> or <hi>Mago,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then from any relation that the word hath to the depth of
Learning, or any notation for a great Scholar: I suppose it would
bee hard to prove the contrary; especially since in <hi>Babylonia,</hi> there
was<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 39. 3.</note> Rab. <hi>Mag,</hi> or the great <hi>Mag,</hi> and in Carthage, <hi>Mago,</hi> two
noblemen or Princes, and yet for ought we know, no great Scholars
neither, of the very same name.</p>
                     <p>More probable therefore and plausible is their opinion [though
it leave the Reader in a <hi>Bivium</hi> of irresolution] that holdeth these
men either for <hi>Arabians,</hi> or <hi>Mesopotamians</hi> about <hi>Haran:</hi> but their
resolution the best of all, that bring them from <hi>Arabia:</hi> and of
this mind is <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> very confidently, in so much that hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
a Prophecy thereto, namely, <hi>Esa.</hi> 8. 4. about the breaking of
the strength of <hi>Damascus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For first, <hi>Arabia</hi> is full Eastward from <hi>Judea,</hi> and the inhabitants
thereof are constantly called men of the East, as <hi>Gen. 25. 6. Judg.
6. 3. Job.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the gifts or presents that the wisemen offered Christ,
were native commodities of the Land of <hi>Arabia,</hi> as gold of <hi>Sheba,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52154:68"/>
Psal.</hi> 72. 15. Frankincense from <hi>Seba,</hi> or <hi>Saba,</hi> as in the verse, <hi>Sua
Thura Sabaei,</hi> and myrrhe from thereabouts, as appeareth in stories:
and it is more probable to thinke that they would bring the choice
commodities of their owne countrey, as <hi>Jacob</hi> sent to <hi>Joseph,</hi> then of
another.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to conceive these men for <hi>Arabians,</hi> doth very well sort
and harmonize with some considerable things in Scripture: As 1.
the first Proselyte to the Jewish Church that wee find mentioned in
Scripture, was <hi>Jethro</hi> an Arabian, and of the seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And so
if wee hold these first Proselytes to Christ, it suiteth very fitly. 2. It
agreeth also with that Prophetick Psalme mentioned before, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 71. 3. With the rule, and dominion, and homage that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and <hi>Solomon,</hi> types of Christ, had over and from that Countrey.
For, 4. much of <hi>Arabia</hi> was the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as well as <hi>Judea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
for the heedfull eye that shall but seriously looke upon the Nations,
that planted there at the first, will find that the whole Countrey was
inhabited by the two Sons of <hi>Ham, Cush</hi> and <hi>Canaan:</hi> and in after

to doe homage to the King of the Jewes, from a Country which
did as much to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> who were types of him, then from
a forain Nation: and to conceive that they were of the seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
rather then of another race.</p>

have seen his Starre in the East, &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>The exposition of this Verse will bee made up, by the resolution
and answer of these three question. 1. What was this Starre that the
Wisemen saw? 2. Where it was that they saw it? And 3. how upon
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52154:69"/>
the sight of it they could conclude that it did relate to a King of the
Jews? To omit the various guesses and furnises that are made, for the
satisfaction of the first <hi>Quaere,</hi> it seemeth to me, that this Star which
these Magicians saw at the birth of Christ, was nothing else but
that glorious and miraculous light that shone about the <hi>Bethlehem</hi>
Shepheards, when the Angel came upon them with the tydings of the
birth of a Saviour, <hi>Lu.</hi> 2. 9. And that these Wizzards being that night
abroad [belike at their study of Astrology] beheld it at distance, and
to them it seemed, being so farre off, like a new and uncouth, and a
wondrous Starre: And the words <hi>in the East,</hi> doe meane the place
of the men, and not of the Starre, and are to receive this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
<hi>wee being in the East have seene his Starre:</hi> Not it in the
East part of Heaven, but they being in the East part of the Earth:
And their beholding it to bee in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> might the more
readily bring them to thinke it betokened the birth of the King of
the Jewes.</p>
                     <p>And thus are the three questions resolved together, if the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
whereupon all is built, bee but firme and solid, <hi>viz,</hi> that the
light or the glory of the Lord that shone about the Shepheards, was
that which the wisemen then supposed and do now call a Starre;
Upon which let us looke a little, and see what probability there may
bee that it was so.</p>
                     <p>First, then it is past doubting, that the Shepheards saw the glory
of the Lord shine round about them, and the wisemen, the new Star
shine at a distance from them, at one and the same time, namely, at
the time of our Saviours birth; For since both these things were to
both these parties as a messenger to impart unto them the tydings of
the birth of Christ, no reason can bee given or supposed why they
should not appeare to them both, to doe this message to them at the
very time when hee was borne: Now the Shepheards at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi>
and the Magicians in <hi>Arabia,</hi> seeing on the very same night, a light
that was to tell them of the very same thing, what reason have we to
thinke that it was not one and the same light?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to conceive that the Wisemens Starre appeared to them
in the East part of Heaven, maketh the matter farre more difficult to
resolve, how they came to know that it denoted a King of the Jewes,
then by supposing that they saw it hanging over the very Center or
middle of the Land of the Jews. For though we cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52154:69"/>
that the spirit of God was their chiefe intelligen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer
in this matter, and so could have taught them so much
wheresoever they had seen the Starre appeare, yet can wee not but
thinke, that it was a likelier way to read this lesson to them, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this light upon the very place where the King that it betokened
was borne, rather then in the East part of Heaven, where it might
seem to denote something among the <hi>Indians,</hi> rather then among the
<hi>Jewes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we know it by experience, that a great light or fire that
happeneth in any place in the night, bee it never so great in it selfe, or
in the eyes of those that are in the place where it is, yet to those that
are a great distance off, it seemeth but as a Star or such a thing. And
that it might not bee so with the Wisemen in this matter, there is
neither Analogy of faith, probability in reason, evidence in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or any thing I know of will deny.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, it is not to bee omitted without weighing, that as
soone as the Wisemen after their conference with <hi>Herod,</hi> were gone
out of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to set for <hi>Bethlehem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> the Starre shewed it self to them
againe. It appeareth now nearer to them, to conduct them to the
place where the Child now was, as it had appeared at greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
at his birth, to signifie to them that he was borne: Then they
saw it over or in <hi>Judea,</hi> which directed them to hearken to <hi>Jerusalem:</hi>
now they see it at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> almost over their heads, to direct them to
<hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

Gospel elswhere, were not such private or peculiar Clerkes, but they
were the publick Scribes or Clerkes of the people: and this their
Office or function consisted in two particulars.</p>
                     <p>First, they were the men that tooke upon them to copy the Bible
for those that desired to have a copy. For so great and various is the
accuracy and exactnesse of the Scripture text in the mysticall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
significances of letters, vowels and accents, that it was not fit
that every one should offer to transcribe the Originall, or that every
vulgar pen should copy things of so sublime speculation: Therfore
there was a peculiar &amp; special order of learned men among the Jews,
whose Office it was to take care of the preservation of the purity of
the Text, in all Bibles that should bee copied out, that no corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or error should creep into the Originall of the Sacred Writ, and
these were called the <hi>Scribes of the people,</hi> or their Scriveners or Writers
of the copy of the Bible. And hence is it that there is so frequent
mention in the Rabbines of <hi>Tikkun Sopherim, The correction,</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Scribes,</hi> or their peculiar and speciall disposing of the
text, which the <hi>Massoreth</hi> at the beginning of the booke of <hi>Numbers</hi>
observeth to have been in eighteen places, which are reckoned there.
These Scribes may be conceived to have been either Priests or Levites,
or both, the men of that Tribe being the chiefest Students in the
Scriptures; and being bound by their calling to bee able to instruct
the people in the same, <hi>Deut. 33. 10. Mal.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
                     <p>They had eight and forty Universities as it were, belonging to that
tribe, for the education of the Clergy in the knowledge of the Law &amp;
the Prophets, <hi>Josh.</hi> 21. and from among the learned of those Students,
were some set apart for this Office, which required profound Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and skill; namely, to be the Copiers of the Bible when any copy
was to be taken, or at least to take care that all copies that should bee
transcribed, should be pure and without corruption.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, these also were the publick &amp; common preachers of the
people, being more constant Pulpit men, then any other of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
taking on them, not onely to bee the preservers and providers
for the purity of the Text, but also the most constant and common
explainers and expounders of it in Sermons. Therefore it is said
of our Saviour, that he taught as one that had authority, and <hi>not as
the Scribes, Mat.</hi> 7. 29. where the Scribes are rather mentioned then
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52154:71"/>
any other order, because they were the greatest and most ordinary
Preachers. And our Saviour himselfe, in <hi>Marke 12. 25. How say the
Scribes, that Christ is the Sonne of David?</hi> instancing in the Scribes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
[whereas the Pharisees, Sadduces, and even all the Nation of the
Jewes held the same opinion] because the Scribes were the men that
were oftest in the Pulpit, and preached more then any other; and so
this Doctrine was heard more from them then others.</p>
                     <p>And thus was <hi>Ezra</hi> a ready Scribe in the Law of <hi>Moses, Ezr.</hi> 7. 6.
both for the copying and preserving pure the Text of the Scripture,
and also for the expounding of it by his Sermons. And such a one is
the Scribe that our Saviour speaketh of, that is instructed to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven, that bringeth out of his treasure instructions out of
the New Testament and Old, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 52. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast on
<hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 13. &amp; 8. 10. and in other-places in stead of <hi>The Prophet,</hi> read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>the Scribe,</hi> taking as it seemeth <hi>the Prophet</hi> in the same sense that
<hi>Paul</hi> doth <hi>Prophecying, 1 Thess. 5. 20. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 5. &amp;c. for the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and making the text speake in the same tenor that it doth here,
<hi>the Priests and the Scribes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Story of our Saviours arraignment, and elswhere in the
New Testament there is mention of the chiefe Priests, and Scribes,
and Elders, <hi>Mat. 26. 3. Marke</hi> 15. 1. importing that the Great
Councell consisted of these three sorts of men. <hi>The chiefe Priests</hi> of
the seed of <hi>Aaron, the Scribes</hi> of the Tribe of Levi, and <hi>the Elders of the
people</hi> meer lay men: These were all deeply and extraordinarily versed
and learned in the Law, but the practise of this their learning had
some difference, as the civill, common and canon: 1. The Elders
judged the people and matters of debate and controversie, but instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
not the people by way of preaching or ministery. The chiefe
Priests judged and instructed, but it was more by resolving questions
and doubts that were proposed to them, as our Saviour asked them
questions, <hi>Luke 2. 46. Hag. 2. 11. Mal.</hi> 2. 7. then by common
preaching Homilies or Sermons. The Scribes were they that were
the preachers or lecturers, and taught the people from the pulpit, as
well as determined upon doubts and debates: And to this triple di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of the great and Seraphicall Doctors of the Jewes, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
seemeth to allude, in 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 20. Where is the wise? Where is the Scribe?
where is</hi> the questionist, or <hi>disputer of this world?</hi> By the first meaning
the Elders of the people, and by the last, the chiefe Priests.</p>

that were most likely to give him an answer? But the latter end of

their Doctrine from the prophecying of <hi>Caiaphas, Job.</hi> 11. 51. as their
notes plead there, ascribing that his prophecying to his Priesthood,
and order, whereas the Text ascribeth it to the yeere and season.

without any mention of the land of <hi>Juda</hi> at all, and so the Chaldee,
and so the Lxx, but only with the addition of one word, <hi>Thou Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> First, There are that give this generall answer to all the
differences in this quotation, that the Scribes and the Evangelist tye
not themselves to the very words of the Prophet, but only think
it enough to render his sense. And this answer might bee very well
entertained, and give good satisfaction, especially, si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e that in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations
from the Old Testament, it is usuall with the New so to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52154:72"/>
do, but that the difference between the Text and the quotation is so
great, that it is not only diverse, but even contrary. Some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, conceive, that the Scribes could alledge the Text no
better without the book, and that the Evangelist hath set it downe
in their owne words, for the just shame of those great Doctors, that
were no better versed in the Scripture, then to alledge a place in
words so very farre different from the Text. But hee that hath been
any whit versed in the writings of the Jewes, will find their Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
or Doctors to bee too nimble textualists to misse in a Text of so
great use and import: especially if hee shall but consider to what an
height of learning they were now come, by the tutorage and paines
of the two great Doctors of the Chaire, <hi>Shammai</hi> and <hi>Hillel,</hi> who
had filled all the nation with learned men the like had not been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Whereas some talke of a <hi>Syriacke</hi> Edition which the
Jewes used at that time more then the Hebrew, and which had this
Text of <hi>Micah</hi> as the Evangelist hath cited it, and that hee cited it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Edition which was most in use; here are two things
presumed upon which it is impossible ever to make good. For who
ever read in any Jew of a Syrian Edition of the Prophets besides the
Chaldee Paraphrast? who wee are sure readeth not thus: or what
Christian ever saw such an Edition, that hee could tell that it did so
read? For this particular therefore in hand, it is to bee answered,
that the Scribes or the Evangelist, or both, did thus differently quote
the Prophet, neither through forgetfulnesse, nor through the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading
of an erroneous Edition, but purposely, and upon a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
intent.</p>
                     <p>For, first, though Ephratah had been the surname of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi>
in ancient times, as <hi>Gen. 35. 19. Ruth</hi> 4. 11. and in the times of the
Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t <hi>Micah,</hi> yet it is no wonder if that title of it were now out
of use, and especially out of the knowledge of this irreligious King.
For the seventy yeers captivity, and the alterations of the State, did
alter the face of the Country, and might easily blot out of use and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
such an additionall title of a Town as this.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This surname of the Town was taken up in memoriall
of a woman, as appeareth, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 19. and when the discourse
concerning Christ, and where hee should bee born, was in hand and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52154:72"/>
agitation, it was more pregnant to bring his birth-place to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to <hi>Juda</hi> from whom <hi>Herod</hi> [though hee were ignorant in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particulars concerning his birth] knew hee should descend,
then to a woman and a title which it is like that hee had never heard
of before. So that this, that in the Scribes might at the first seem
to bee a mis-allegation of the Prophet through some mistake, being
pressely looked upon, with respect had to the times when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
was given, and when it is now cited, and to the severall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to whom, it will shew to bee so quoted upon very sound wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and profound reason, these words, <hi>in the Land of Juda,</hi> being
used by them for necessary illustration, in stead of the word <hi>Ephrata,</hi>
not as proposing it for the purer Text of the Prophet, but as more
sutable, by way of Exposition, for the capacity and apprehension
of <hi>Herod.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Micahs</hi> time the name <hi>Ephratah</hi> was common, but in after times
it may bee it was disused. Howsoever, <hi>Micah</hi> prophecyed to the
Jewes, to whom this title <hi>Ephratah</hi> was familiar, and it is like had
the Scribes spoken to Jews too, they would have retained that title,
but to <hi>Herod</hi> who was not so punctually acquainted with it, it was
not proper to bring a phrase that hee could not understand, or that
was uncouth to him, therefore they explaine it by one that was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
both to him and the whole Nation, <hi>Bethlehem in the Land of
Juda.</hi>

in the Prophet there is none at all, either in the Hebrew, in the

quotation are one cleane contrary to another; in <hi>Micah, Though

reconciling of which difference, it will bee necessary in the first place,
to take a serious survey of the Prophets Text, and then upon the
true interpretation of it, to lay this allegation to it, and to see how
they do agree. The words in the Hebrew, whereupon the main doubt
ariseth, are but these two <gap reason="foreign">

but this their reading I suspect rather to bee taken from this quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Gospel, then found by them in the Text of <hi>Micah.</hi> The
vulgar Latine, <hi>Thou art little among the thousand, &amp;c.</hi> The Italian of
<hi>Brucioli,</hi> and the French, <hi>Being little to bee,</hi> or to bee accounted. And
much to the same tenour with our English, <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and <hi>David
Kimchi. Rabbi Solomon</hi> sheweth his construction of it in this glosse,
<hi>It were fit that thou shouldest bee the least among the families of Juda, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the profanenesse of Ruth the Moabitesse that was in thee, yet out of thee

between the Prophet and the Evangelist, by reading the Prophets
Text by way of interrogation, <hi>And thou Bethlehem art thou the least?</hi>
which answereth in sense to <hi>thou art not.</hi> But to all these interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
alledged, this one thing may bee opposed, that the Hebrew
word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> cannot properly agree with the word <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Syntaxe of Substantive and Adjective; because they are
of two different genders, as the Grammarian will easily observe, and
cannot but confesse. For <hi>Bethlehem</hi> is of the feminine gender, as are
all the names of Cities, and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of another, as it plainly appeareth
by its termination. To construe them therefore together, as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantive
and Adjective, as it is unwarrantable by the Grammar, so
doth it make a sense utterly irreconciliable with this of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list.
To which might bee added also, that these words being thus
conjoyned and construed together, do make but an harsh sense and
construction among themselves, amounting to this, <hi>Thou Bethlehem
in being little, out of thee shall come a Ruler.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their Interpretation therefore is rather to bee imbraced, that
take <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the Newter Gender, as it pleadeth it selfe to bee, by
its very termination [the Masculine and Newter in the Hebrew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indifferently taken the one for the other] and do read it thus:
<hi>And thou Bethlehem Ephrata, it is a small thing to bee among the Princes
of Juda, out of thee shall come a Ruler, &amp;c.</hi> As meaning this, That it is
the least of thine honour that thou art reckoned among the Princes
of <hi>Juda,</hi> as equall with them, for thou hast a dignity above this,
and above them all in that <hi>out of thee shall come a Ruler, which shall
feed my people.</hi> And to this sense and tenour should I interpret the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52154:73"/>
Chaldee Paraphrase, though I know indeed that it is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued
another way: <hi>Chizgner havetha leithmannaah: And thou Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem
Ephratah, art within a little to bee superiour,</hi> or perfect, <hi>among the
thovsands of Judah, &amp;c.</hi> As let the learned in the language judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the words in the Chaldee will not beare that sense: especially
the sense of the first word <hi>Chizgner,</hi> being looked into in the Chaldee,
in <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 12. and 73. 2. <hi>Hos.</hi> 1. 4. and in other places.</p>
                     <p>The Text of the Prophet then being rendred in this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this allegation of the Evangelist, will bee found, not to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
contrariety to it at all, but to speake, though not in the very same
words, yet to the very same ten or and purpose: For while the one
saith, <hi>It is a small thing that thou art among the Princes of Judah,</hi> and the
other, <hi>Thou art not the least amng them,</hi> they both fall into the same
sense, or at least into no disagreement of sense at all. For if it were
to bee reputed a small honour to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to bee reckoned in equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
with the other Princes of <hi>Judah,</hi> in comparison of a greater
honour that shee was to have, in the birth of the <hi>Messias;</hi> it must
readily follow what this quotation of the Evangelist inferreth;
namely, that shee was not the least among them. And thus doth the
Evangelist expresse the Prophets mind, though he tie not his expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his very words, alledging his Text to its cleerest sense, and to
the easier apprehension of the hearer. It is a just exception indeed
tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Jansenius</hi> taketh at this interpretation, because that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
useth not to expresse this sense, <hi>It is a small thing,</hi> by the word
<hi>Tsagnir,</hi> but by <hi>Megnat,</hi> as <hi>Esa. 7. 13. Gen.</hi> 30. 15. and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
But as it is true, that it often useth <hi>Megnat</hi> for that expression;

As <hi>Tikton,</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 19. and <hi>Nakel,</hi> in <hi>Esa.</hi> 49. 6. and why not

families,</hi> and <hi>Dav. Kimchi, the Cities:</hi> The word is once used in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52154:74"/>
very propriety of that sense in which the Prophet taketh it here,
<hi>Judg. 6. 15. My thousand,</hi> saith <hi>Gedeon, is poore in Manasseh:</hi> which St.
<hi>Austin,</hi> and <hi>R. Esaiah</hi> expound that he was Captaine of a thousand;
<hi>Levi Gershom,</hi> that his father was Captain; but the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> and other
Rabbines understand it of the thousand in which his amily was
numbred and inrolled. Howsoever it is understood, it is apparent
by this and other places laid unto it, that the severall Tribes of the
children of <hi>Israel</hi> were divided into their severall thousands, and that
these thousands were inrolled to this or that City, to which they
had relation by habitation, or by inheritance: Villages that were
not so populous, were reduced into hundreds, but Cities into one
or more thousands, according as they were in bignesse and multitude,
<hi>Amos 5. 3. The City that went out by a thousand, shall leave an hundred,
and that which went out by an hundred, shall leave ten:</hi> The Villages were
justly reputed of an inferiour ranke, but the Cities that afforded
their thousands were accounted Princes: and so may the Prophet
bee understood, and so the Evangelist reconciled to him. Now the
reason of their difference in words, though they both redound to
the same sense may be given these.</p>
                     <p>First, because the question in agitation was about the birth of a
King, and the place, where now in answer to such a <hi>Quaere,</hi> it was
fitter to speake of Princes then thousands, for where should a King
bee looked for but among Princes?</p>
                     <p>Secondly the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> used by the Prophet, doth
signifie, both <hi>thousands,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> indifferently, and so <hi>David Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi>
upon that place in the booke of <hi>Judges,</hi> cited even now alledgeth;
<hi>There are,</hi> saith he, <hi>that interpret A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>phi</hi> [which our English readeth
<hi>my thousand] as it were my Father, even as the word</hi> Alluph, <hi>whose sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
is a Prince or Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Evangelist therefore finding the word in the Prophet of this
indifferency, useth it in that sense which best suited with the present
occasion, both in regard of the question proposed, as also thirdly, in
regard of the manner of Christs comming: For it was both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the Jews, and the feare of <hi>Herod,</hi> that hee would come
with a conquering and victorious temporall Sword, and restore them
to a pompous Earthly State, and expell him out of his Kingdome.
Now for the Evangelist to have directed in this quotation, to looke
for Christ among the thousands of Juda, had backed these Opinions,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52154:74"/>
for the terme soundeth of Warre, and it had been a direction where
likelier to find an earthly Warrier, then the Prince of Peace, among
the thousands, or among the Militia: And therefore hee qualifieth
the terme to the best satisfaction of <hi>Herod</hi> and the People; <hi>Among the
Princes.</hi> There is that saith it might be construed, <hi>In Princes,</hi> and not
among them, and the meaning to bee this, <hi>Thou Bethlehem art not the
hast in the Princes of</hi> Juda, that is, in breeding or bringing them forth:
but this relisheth more of wit then solidity, and agreeth better with
the Latine, then with the Greeke Originall.</p>

therefore that is most true which is inferred by <hi>Lyranus,</hi> that those

with the peevishnesse of old age, for hee was now seventy, and with

                           </gap>8.</hi> For that hee was twelve yeers old
at that time, may be conceived upon these collections.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Absolom</hi> began to rebell in the thirty seventh yeere of <hi>Davids</hi>
Reigne, or three yeeres before his death, or thereabout; This is to
bee picked out of that datelesse reckoning of yeeres, 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 7.
And after forty yeeres</hi> Absalom <hi>said, let mee goe pay my vow, &amp;c.</hi> These
forty yeeres are counted from the time that Israel asked a King:
three of <hi>Sauls</hi> Reigne, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 1. and seven and thirty of <hi>Davids,</hi>
and then began <hi>Absalom</hi> to challenge the Kingdome: and the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from that date giveth this hint and intimation, that as their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a King then did sore displease the Lord, so now are they puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the proper kind for it, when they have so many Kings that
they know not well which to follow, and many of them perish in
following the usurper.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, before his open rebellion, <hi>Absalom</hi> had been two yeeres
in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and not seen the Kings face, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 28.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, before that time, he had been three yeeres in deserved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile
in <hi>Geshur, 2 Sam.</hi> 13. 38.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and two yeeres had passed betwixt the rape of <hi>Tamar</hi>
and slaughter of <hi>Amnon,</hi> which occasioned him into that exile, 2 <hi>Sam.
13.</hi> 23.</p>
                     <p>So that counting all these yeeres together, they appeare cleerly
to bee ten at the least, betwixt the rape of <hi>Tamar</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> death:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52154:78"/>
and so are they so many of <hi>Solomons</hi> age at the same time.</p>
                     <p>Now that there was some good space that passed betwixt
these summes of time mentioned, as betwixt the birth of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> and the rape of <hi>Tamar,</hi> betwixt <hi>Absoloms</hi> seeing of the
Kings face, and his breaking out after into that rebellion, and other
spaces, it cannot be denied upon serious and considerate casting up of
the Story: But to find out the exact space and measure of time is
hardly possible; and so is it to determine the age of our Saviour at
the time of his disputing with the Doctors. For though the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist
say that hee was twelve yeeres old, yet hath hee left it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
whether current or compleate: and that it was a whole
halfe yeere under or over, it cannot bee denied, seeing that hee
was borne about September, and this his disputing was at the
Passeover, about March or Aprill. So when wee say <hi>Solomon</hi>
was twelve yeeres old when hee began to Reigne, and when
hee determined the controversie of the two Hossesses, it
is not necessary, punctually to pick out and shew that
space of time to all exactnesse, it sufficeth to shew that the
text bringeth him neere to that age under or over. <hi>See Ignat.

the Festivall weeke, as it can hardly bee doubted, it is not to bee
wondred if they were not so punctually exact, as to bee sure to bring

                     <head>Reason of the Order.</head>
                     <p>ALthough there be a very large space of time betwixt the Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
last preceding, and the beginning of this, yet because the
Reader in his Bible can see nothing mentioned in any of the foure
that may come between, hee will easily satisfie himselfe without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
further discourse, that the order is necessary, and the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
undeniable. But it may bee, hee may wonder why the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
have passed so much time in silence, without any mention at
all of our Saviour Christ, or of any thing done or spoken by him:
But when hee shall observe in the very first words of this Section,
that the Preaching of <hi>John,</hi> and his baptisme was the beginning of
the Gospel, then will hee see that they hasten to that and forward,
as to the main aime, and chiefe intention of their writing, but that
the conception and birth of <hi>Christ</hi> and his forerunner were necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to be related before.</p>
                     <p>In these collaterall columnes of the Text, and forward, where we
shall have occasion to use them so, the Readers eye must sometimes
help to lay them together, where the pen could not, without chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and transposing the naturall method of the Text; as in this
Section now in hand, it had been both as easie for me to have written
the third verse of <hi>Marke,</hi> after the fourth and fifth, as before them,
and more agreeing to the columnes on either side it; but that I would
not be so bold as to change verses without any reason, which <hi>Mark</hi>
not without good reason did dispose as they lie. And this ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have I observed all along as I goe, where occasion is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
presuming rather to trouble the Reader to ranke them with
his eye, then to teare the text in the whole cloth, and then few it
together at other edges. It will sometimes be inevitable, but that we
must invert and alter the order of one Evangelist or other, from
what hee had laid it; but wheresoever that shall bee so, there shall
be such a reason given for it, as I hope shall bee to the Readers satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,

                     <head type="sub">The beginning of the Gospel.</head>
                     <p>THe beginning of that age of the world, which the Prophets so u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimously
pointed out for the time of good things to come;
and which they expressed sometimes by the terme of <hi>The last
dayes, Esa. 2. 2. Mich. 4. 1. Joel</hi> 2. 28. Sometimes, of the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
yeere of the Lord, <hi>Esa.</hi> 61. 1. Sometimes, of <hi>the kingdom of
God, Dan.</hi> 2. 44. and 7. 14. and somtimes, of <hi>a New heaven, and a
New earth, Esa.</hi> 65. 17. And which the Gospel it selfe doth begin
from the beginning of the Ministery and Preaching of <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,
as in this verse, and <hi>Matth. 11. 13. Act.</hi> 1. 22. &amp; 10. 37. So
that though in our Chronicle account, and computation, wee
begin to reckon from the birth of our Saviour the second <hi>Adam,</hi> as
the age of the world before, was reckoned from the Creation of the
first; yet in strict and exact computing, the new world, as one may
call it, or the age of the Gospel, began not before the setting forth
of <hi>John,</hi> to preach and baptize; and this his Ministery is most fitly
called the <hi>beginning</hi> of the Gospel both in regard of his preaching,
and of his baptizing.</p>
                     <p>For, first, the Doctrine and preaching of <hi>John,</hi> was of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
straine, and diverse tenour from the literall Doctrine of the
Law: For that called all for workes and for exact performance,
<hi>Doe this and live;</hi> and, <hi>He that doth not all the words of this Law,
is cursed;</hi> But <hi>John</hi> called for repentance, and for renewing of the
mind, and for beleefe in him that was comming after, disclaiming
all righteousnesse by the workes and performance of the Law, but
proclaiming repentance for non-performance, and righteousnesse
onely to be had by <hi>Christ.</hi> So that here were new Heavens, and a
new Earth begun to bee created; a new Commandement given, a
new Church founded, justification by the workes of the Law cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
downe, and the glorious Doctrine of repentance and faith
set up.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, whereas Baptisme was used before among the Jewes,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52154:83"/>
onely for admission of Proselyte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Religion, <hi>[as vid. Aben Ezra, Gen. 35. Rombani in Asure Biah per. 13.]</hi>
now it is published and proposed to the Jewes themselves to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and undergone, shewing unto them; 1. That they were now
to be entred and transplanted into a new profession. And 2. That
the Gentiles and they were now to bee knit into one Church and
Body.</p>
                     <p>The Ministery of <hi>John</hi> being of so high concernment, as being
thus the beginning of the Gospel, and of a new World, it is no
wonder, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> doth so exactly point out the yeare by the
Reigne of the Emperor, the rule of <hi>Pilate, Herod, Philip,</hi> and <hi>Lysa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,</hi>
the High Priesthood of <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> that so remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a yeere might be fixed and knowne to all the World, and that
the condition and the state of the times might bee observed when
the Gospel began. And here it might have been proper to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
the second part of this our taske, and not to have driven over
this Period of time, and to stop halfe a yeere after it at the
baptisme of our Saviour; but since his preaching &amp; appearing to the
World, is the great and maine thing that the Evangelists looke after,
and since the preaching of the Baptist was but a Preface and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
unto that of his; it is not unproper, &amp; may be very excusable
to make that our entrance to another part, and take this with us in
our motion to our lodging and resting there.</p>

                     <head>Vers. 2. As it is written in the Prophets.</head>
                     <p>It seemeth by the <hi>Syrian, Arabicke, Vulgar Latine, Victor Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenus,
Origen</hi> cited by him, and others, that some Copies read, <hi>As
it is written in Esaias the Prophet:</hi> and so <hi>Jansenius</hi> thinketh it was
so written by <hi>Marke</hi> himselfe, but purposely changed by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the Church, as we read it now, to avoid the difficulty which
the other reading carryed with it.</p>
                     <p>But, first, it were a very strange and impious, though an easie way
of resolving doubts, to adde to, or diminish from the Text at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
as the Text shall seeme easie or difficult: This is not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Bible, but to make a new one, or a Text of ones owne

chap.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the one halfe of the words alledged in the Text, are
not in <hi>Esay</hi> at all, but in <hi>Malachi:</hi> and the first halfe also, for that
is considerable. For though sometime the New Testament in Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
from the Old, doe closely couch two severall places toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
under one quotation, as if they were but one; yet maketh it
sure, that the first alwayes is that very place, which it takes on it to
cite, though the second bee another: as <hi>Acts 7. 7. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ven</hi> alledgeth
a speech of God, as if uttered to <hi>Abraham</hi> alone; whereas it is
two severall quotations, and two severall speeches tyed up in one;
the one spoken to <hi>Abraham</hi> indeed, but the other to <hi>Moses,</hi> almost
foure hundred yeers after; and that to <hi>Abraham</hi> is set the first, for
he is the subject whereupon the allegation is produced.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it is a manner of speech not used in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to say, it is written, or it is said <hi>in</hi> such or such a Prophet,
but <hi>by</hi> him. Wee find indeed, <hi>It is written in the Law, Luke 10.
26.</hi> And, <hi>It is written in the booke of Psalmes, Acts</hi> 1. 20.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52154:84"/>
Yea, <hi>It is written in the Prophets, Joh.</hi> 6. 45. but no where that it is
writen in a single Prophet.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, To read as wee do, <hi>As it is writen in the Prophets,</hi> agreeth
with the ordinary and usuall division of the Old Testament, by the
Hebrews, into <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>Oraictha, Nebbyim Chetubhim,</hi> The Law, the
Prophets, and the Holy writs; approved and followed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 44. and alluded to by the Evangelist here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[Before thy face, &amp;c. Thy way before thee.]</hi> The former is neither
in the Hebrew, nor in the Lxx at all: the latter is in them both,
but clean contrary, for they both have it, The way before <hi>mee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But First, the Evangelists and Apostles, when they take on them
to cite any Text from the Old Testament, are not so punctuall to
observe the exact and strict forme of words, as the pith of them, or
sense of the place; as might bee instanced in many particulars: so
that the difference of the words would not prejudice the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in sense, were there not so flat difference of person, as <hi>mee</hi> and
<hi>thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Majesty of Scripture doth often shew it selfe in
requoting of places, in this, that it alledgeth them in difference
of words and difference of sense, yea, sometimes in contrarietie,
not to make one place to crosse or deny another, but by the variety
one to explaine and illustrate another, as in corresponding places
in the Old Testament might bee shewed at large, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 22, 23.
cited, 1 <hi>Chron. 1. 17. Gen.</hi> 36. 12. compared with 1 <hi>Chron. 1. 36.
1 Sam.</hi> 25. 44. paralleled, 2 <hi>Sam. 21. 8. 2 Chron.</hi> 3. 15. with <hi>Jer.
52.</hi> 21. and very many other places of the like nature: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Holy Ghost having penned a thing in one place, doth by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of words and sense, inlarge and expound himselfe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And the same divine authority and Majesty doth hee also use
in the New Testament, both in parallell places in it selfe, and in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in it, from the Old. So that this difference in hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>My face,</hi> in <hi>Malachi;</hi> and <hi>thy face,</hi> in <hi>Mark,</hi> is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
or crossing one another, but explicatory or one explaining
another, and both together do result to the greater mystery. For
Christ is the <hi>face</hi> or presence of the Father: and so is hee plainly
called, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 14. and in Christ, the Father came and revealed
himselfe among men: and the words in both places, both in the
Prophet and in the Evangelist, are to bee taken for the words of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52154:85"/>
Father; in the one, spoken of the Sonne, and in the other, to
him: In <hi>Malachi</hi> thus, Behold I send my Messenger before mee to
prepare the way <hi>before my face;</hi> that is, before the Sonne, as hee is
in his own nature, the very brightnesse of the glory of the Father,
and the expresse image of his person, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and in <hi>Marke</hi> thus,
to prepare the way <hi>before thy face,</hi> that is, before thee, O Sonne,
when thou commest to undertake the work of redemption, and to
publish the Gospel. And this change of persons in Grammaticall
construction is usuall in the Hebrews eloquence and Rhetorique; as
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 23. My heart rejoyceth <hi>in the Lord,</hi> I rejoyce <hi>in thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>

of <hi>Livia,</hi> the wife of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and by him adopted into the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> and to the Empire: A man of such subtilty, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
avarice, and bestiality, that for all, or indeed for any of these,
few stories can shew his parallell: And as if in this very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Gospel, hee were produced of such a constitution, to
teach us what to look for from that cruell and abominable City, in
all ages and successions.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Tiberius</hi> his fifteenth was the yeere of the world 3957. And
the time of the yeere that <hi>John</hi> began to Baptize in it, was about
Easter, or the vernall equinox, as may bee concluded from the time
of the Baptisme of our Saviour. For if <hi>Jesus</hi> were baptized in <hi>Tis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi>
or <hi>September,</hi> as is cleered hereafter, hee being then but just en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
upon his thirtieth yeere, as the Law required, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. And
if <hi>John</hi> being six moneths elder then our Saviour, as it is plaine hee
was, did enter his Ministery at the very same age, according to the
same Law, it readily follows, that the time mentioned, was the
time when hee began to Preach. It was indeed <hi>Tiberius</hi> his fifteenth
when <hi>John</hi> began to baptize, but it may very well bee questioned,
whether it were so when our Saviour was baptized by him: For
the exact beginning of every yeere of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his reign, was from
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52154:85"/>
the fourteenth of the <hi>Kalends of September,</hi> or the eighteenth of
<hi>August,</hi> at what time <hi>Augustus</hi> dyed: <hi>Sueton in Aug. cap.</hi> 100. That
fifteenth of the Emperour therefore, in the Spring time of which
<hi>John</hi> began to baptize, was expired before <hi>September,</hi> when our
Saviour was baptized, and so his baptisme is to bee reputed in the
yeere of the world 3958. which was then but newly begunne, and
in the sixteenth yeere of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> but newly begun neither, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
you will reckon the yeere of the Emperour, as the Romanes
did the yeere of the Consuls, from <hi>January</hi> to <hi>January:</hi> But this
wee will not controvert, nor crosse the common and constant opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all times, that holdeth our Saviour to have been baptized
in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his fifteenth.</p>

                     <p>First, It maketh a Tetrarchie to bee nothing else, but exactly the
fourth part of a Kingdom, whereas <hi>Pliny, lib. 5. cap.</hi> 18. speaketh
of Tetrarchies that were like Kingdomes, and compacted into king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and hee nameth <hi>Trachonitis</hi> for one. His words are these:
<hi>Intercurrunt, cinguntque has Vrbes, Tetrarchiae regnorum instar singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae,

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, It divideth <hi>Herods</hi> kingdome into foure parts, whereas
it was parted onely into three, to his three Sonnes, <hi>Joseph. Ant.

at all.</p>
                     <p>A Tetrarchie therefore seemeth rather to bee one that was in the
fourth ranke or degree of excellency and government in the <hi>Roman</hi>

first, the Proconsull that governed a Province the second, a King
the third, and a Tetrarch the fourth. So <hi>Mishuch,</hi> and <hi>Shalish</hi>

the government of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in the two Countries of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi>

And this proclaimeth <hi>John</hi> a Prophet, as well as they. And here

word imparted to him, by vision, or dreame, or rapture, or what
other way, it is not so materiall to inquire, as it is difficult to resolve;
onely this is not impertinent to observe, That whereas the race of
the Prophets that were sent to teach and to preach to the people by
the word of the Lord, was expired and extinguished long agoe, in

the gift and spirit of Prophecy, and betwixt being sent by that
spirit for a constant Preacher to the people. <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> and

the spirit of Prophecy upon them, to foretell things to come, but

though there be no such expression concerning it, as is of them:
and if those words, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. So <hi>He was in the deserts, till the day of his

the interpretation might very well be justified, though to avoid cavill
and offence, we have expounded it of places, which the Scripture
calleth <hi>Deserts,</hi> or <hi>Wildernesses</hi> in expresse termes.</p>
                     <p>However, be it in <hi>Hebron,</hi> or out of <hi>Hebron</hi> that <hi>John</hi> was educated,

these in some Cities of the Wildernesse, not farre from <hi>Hebron:</hi> and
if it be said that he baptized also in these Cities where hee preached,
and as yet was not gone downe to <hi>Jordan,</hi> till <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and all <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
heard of him, and came to be baptized, and then hee went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the conveniency of water: I suppose it crosseth nothing, either
in the History or Mysterie, and it averreth no more concerning <hi>John</hi>
now, then we shall find him doing hereafter; namely, baptizing in
other waters beside <hi>Jordan.</hi> And indeed how can it rationally
be understood otherwise, then that <hi>John</hi> baptized first in these Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

                     <p>For, first, it cannot be conceived that hee walked or stood in the

betooke himselfe to Townes or Cities where was concourse of
people.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it can as little be conceived, that when any people in
this or that City embraced his Doctrine, and desired to be baptized,
that he should bring them to the River, which was sometime farre
off, or delay them till all the multitude should meet him there to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
unlesse it could bee shewed that the water of <hi>Jordan</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allowed to be baptized in, and no other; the contrary to which
we shall see anon.</p>
                     <p>The Story therefore and progresse of his Ministery and baptizing,
out of the three Evangelists may be compiled thus: That first hee
came preaching in the Wildernesse of <hi>Judea,</hi> in the Townes and
Cities that were there, about the place of his education; That hee
baptized there those that were converted by his preaching, and that
desired to bee baptized by him: That hee went abroad from thence,
up and down all the Countrey round about <hi>Jordan,</hi> and when his
converts, and the concourse were now grown numerous, he baptized
them in <hi>Jordan,</hi> because there was water enough, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23.</p>

                     <p>The Evangelist useth this title or epithet, in opposition Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
and baptizing of Proselytes, which had been the way and
doore of admission into the Church before. They might very fitly
be called <hi>the Circum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

baptisme of repentance.</hi> For whosoever received circumcision was
ingaged by it to the performance of the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. And
the like was every Proselyte ingaged that received Baptisme. But
this baptisme of <hi>John,</hi> or the baptisme in the Christian Church is
cleane of another nature. For whereas those two challenged of
every one that went through those doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es into the Church, that
they should stand debtors to the whole Law, and bee obliged to a
legall righteousnesse: our baptisme requireth a cleane contrary
thing, namely, that we should bee obliged to repentance, in regard
that the performance of the law is a thing that is to us impossible,
and that we should be buried with Christ in his death, and seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his righteousnesse, seeing that we have none of our owne. Hence
appeareth clearly, first, a reason why the baptisme of <hi>John</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the beginning of the Gospel,</hi> for it opened a doore, and gave an
inlet into the Church upon other termes, then had ever been before.
And, secondly, that baptisme belongeth to Children, though it
be <hi>the baptisme of repentance,</hi> and they know not what repentance
meanes: For it requireth not their repentance at their receiving of
the Sacrament, when they stand but in the doore or entry of the
Church, but it ingageth them to repentance for the time to come, or
when they being now entred into the Church, shall come to the
use of reason, and knowledge of the ingagement: And so was it with
the children that were circumcised: for they when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
that Sacrament, undertooke obedience to the whole Law, and
yet they knew not what, either obedience, or the Law meant: But
that undertaking was, what they were to doe when they came to the
yeeres of knowledge and apprehension.</p>

the preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles, or among all Nations;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52154:89"/>

of <hi>Daniel,</hi> from whence the phrase is taken, and by diverse places
in the Gospel, where it is used; but the full clearing of this, I have
chosen to referre to that difficult place which will call for it to bee
cleared, when the Lord shall bring us thither, <hi>Matth. 16. 19. To thee
will I give the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven:</hi> where I conceive Christ
to have foretold to <hi>Peter;</hi> that hee should bee the first that should

as <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 7. and 10.</p>
                     <p>Now, <hi>The Kingdome of heaven</hi> signifying thus, not barely and
simply the Preaching of the Gospel, but the preaching of it to the
Gentiles and their conversion, it sheweth how proper and pregnant
an argument this was to inforce the doctrine and practice of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
upon the Jews, because the calling of the Gentiles was neere
at hand, which would prove their rejection and casting off, if they
did not repent, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 21.</p>
                     <p>Before the comming of Christ, those foure earthly kingdomes
that are mentioned by <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Chapters cited, bare all the
sway, and domineered over all the world with cruelty and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
but when they were destroyed, at his comming hee set up a
Kingdome of his own, and swayed the Scepter of Righteousnesse
over all Nations, and ruled them with his word and Spirit. And
whereas before his comming also, the Church consisted but of one
Nation and Kingdome; and was couched upon a small parcell of
earth, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and had earthly promises, and earthly
rites; when hee came and published the Gospel, hee gathered a
Church of all Kingdomes and Nations, and Languages under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and built it up with heavenly and spirituall promises and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
and thus <hi>The Kingdome of heaven</hi> may fitly bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

hee,</hi> received his learning from <hi>Simeon</hi> the just: <hi>This was his saying:</hi>

but bee as servants that serve their Master, not for the receiving

had two Scholars which changed his words; they changed them to their
Scholars, and their Scholars to theirs: They stood up and taught after
them, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> his wages at
even? But if our Fathers had known that their is a world to come, and
that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, they would never have said
thus: They stood up and separated from the Law, and from them broke
out the two Sects, the Sadduces, and Baithusaeans: the Sadduces after
the name of <hi>Sadoc:</hi> and the Baithusaeans, after the name of <hi>Baithus.
So hee. Now this</hi> Antigonus, <hi>whose good doctrine had this bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:52154:91"/>
was Scholar to <hi>Simeon</hi> the just, whom wee shall have
occasion to looke after by and by.</p>
                     <p>But the time and occasion of the rising of the Pharisees, is of
more obscurity, and the reason of their name admitteth of more
conjectures; As, whether they were so called from <hi>Perush,</hi> which
importeth <hi>Exposition,</hi> for that they tooke upon them to bee the
great Expositers of the Law by their Traditions; or from <hi>Parush,</hi>
which betokeneth <hi>separation,</hi> for that they accounted and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themselves more holy then others of the people, and so became
<hi>Separatists</hi> from them, as despising them, <hi>Luke.</hi> 18. 9. Either of which
Etymologies carry with them a faire and plausible probability of
their notation, but the last most agreeable to what both the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and other writings have said of them, in regard of their
singularity; and as wee shall have further occasion to descry, when
wee come to meet with them in their Doctrines, Practises or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                     <p>And the time of their first starting up, is yet obscurer: But
to speake mine owne thoughts, I cannot but conceive them
to have been somewhat more ancient then the Sadduces, though
but a little: And that that passage of the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> [when
hee and the Spirit of Prophecy with him was to leave this world]
<hi>Remember the Law of Moses, Mal.</hi> 4. 4. gave occasion to the rising
of the Pharisees, and to the confirming of the Sadduces in their
opinion when they had taken it up. For whereas the Spirit of
Prophecy and revelation was now to depart from <hi>Israel,</hi> God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
revealed as much of himselfe, and of his will to them, as hee
thought fit and necessary: Hee sendeth backe the people in this
defect of prophetick guidance and direction, to the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
to bee their study, and their rule of faith and of obedience.
Hence did a certaine generation among them take occasion and
opportunity, to vent and broach traditions and glosses upon the
Law, pretending them to have descended from <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe, and
to have been handed over to them, from hand to hand, and as
the Prophets while their race continued, expounded <hi>Moses,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
the people in the knowledge of the Law, by the Spirit of
God, so these men (now the Prophets were gone) took on them
to explaine <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Law also, and by a way which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52154:91"/>
to bee of equall authority with the words of the Prophets,
<hi>For that,</hi> say they, <hi>is Gods own glosse upon his own Law, and this hee
taught</hi> Moses <hi>while hee was with him in the Mount: And this,</hi> Moses
<hi>taught</hi> Joshua, <hi>and</hi> Joshua <hi>the Elders, and</hi> Eli <hi>received it from the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and from</hi> Phinehas, <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>from</hi> Eli, <hi>and</hi> David <hi>from</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,

<hi>from</hi> Jeremie, <hi>and</hi> Ezra <hi>and his Schoole from</hi> Baruch. <hi>The Schoole of</hi>

Zechary, Malachi, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah, Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,
Mordecai, Bilshan, Zerubbabel, <hi>and many wise men with them,

                     <p>This namelesse number that were between the time of <hi>Zerubbabel,
Nebemiah, Mordecai,</hi> and those holy men that wee finde mentioned
in Scripture, and between the times of <hi>Simeon the just,</hi> I suspect
to bee the Generation that afforded the rise and originall of Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saisme
and Traditions: For there was a good large space of time
and distance between <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> the just, as might bee clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by severall particulars, if that were needfull. And a preparative,
if not a ground-worke, to Pharisaisme, and traditions seemeth to
bee that famous speech of the great Synagogue mentioned in <hi>Pirk.
Aboth. Per. 1. The men of the great Synagogue said three things, Bee
deliberate in judgement, and raise up Scholars in abundance, and make a
bedge to the Law:</hi> Now the Lesson of <hi>making a hedge to the Law,</hi> by
a fixed and determinate exposition, was to bring on, and into cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
those glosses and traditions which they would produce and
bring upon it. For that the Law should lie to the Commons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any sence about it, to keepe men off from breaking in upon it
by their owne interpretations and expositions of it, they could
soon perswade the People, was a thing not to bee tolerated or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured:
and when they had wrought this lesson home upon their
hearts, then had they glosses ready of their own invention to put
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52154:92"/>
upon it, as to hedge or fence in from private interpretations.
These glosses or expositions they had a twofold trick to bring into
request.</p>
                     <p>First, To pretend strongly that they had descended traditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from <hi>Moses,</hi> and from God himselfe, as the pretended pedegree of
them is shewed before.</p>
                     <p>And secondly, to use a strict and severe precisenesse in their own
conversation, and to pretend and shew a holinesse above other men,
and to withdraw from them as too profane for their society, that
this might bring their persons into admiration, and their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into repute. And thus they came by their name of <hi>Separatists,</hi>
and thus they laid the foundation for traditions.</p>
                     <p>And as the Pharisees took this opportunity and occasion from
those words of the Prophet, <hi>Remember the Law of Moses,</hi> to vent
their foolish and wicked Expositions upon <hi>Moses,</hi> as seeming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to doe the people a singular benefit, and to make as singular a
fence to <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe: So likewise did the Sadduces make use
of the same occasion to confirme themselves in the error they had
taken up, and to assert it unto others, in that in all the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

was comming after him to bee the seed of the Woman, so on the
other, declaring the Jews to bee now become the seed of the Serpent

the most, and the best Expositors understand it of the judgements
of God: and that it is so to be understood, may be strongly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by these reasons.</p>
                     <p>First, because the context both before and after, speaketh of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and vengeance to come upon the impenitent and unfruitfull,
as <hi>wrath to come,</hi> vers. 7. and <hi>casting into fire,</hi> and <hi>fire unquenchable,</hi> ver.

                     <p>First, by <hi>the root of the trees,</hi> might bee understood the root of
<hi>Jesse,</hi> of which mention was made before from <hi>Esay</hi> 11. 1. For
in all the crosses and calamities, Warres, overthrowes, and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
that had befallen the Nation of the Jewes, the stocke of
<hi>Jesse,</hi> or line of <hi>David,</hi> could never bee rooted out, or extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
because the promise that Christ should come of it, did preserve
and keepe it alive, in despight of all opposition, till hee that was
promised did come indeed. But now, seeing that hee was come,
and that that line had no more the shelter, and preservative of the
promise, it also must come to ruine and rooting out as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>the Axe is now laid to the very root</hi> of your confidence
aud boasting: For whereas yee say within your selves, and stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, that ye have <hi>Abraham</hi> to your Father: the time is now come,
that that distinction betwixt who is, and who is not, of the Seed
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> shall be no more regarded, nor looked after: but every
one of what Nation soever that feareth God shall bee accepted of
him, and the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> for not fearing him shall bee rejected,
and that priviledge not respected at all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was as the root of the whole Nation, from
which they derived the sap of religion and policy, but now the axe
of destruction is laid even to that.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, this phrase may be understood, as comparing the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of the Jewes here threatned, with those desolations they had
fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t before: For then, as at the captivitie of <hi>Babylon</hi> for example,
<pb n="941" facs="tcp:52154:95"/>
they were not utterly cut off from their Land for ever, but had a
promise of returning, and returned, and were planted there againe:
but now the vengeance threatned must strike at the very root, and
quite destroy them from being a Nation for ever, and from all hope
of returning to their Country any more.</p>
                     <p>By the Axe being <hi>now laid</hi> to the root of the trees, may fitly bee
understood, 1. The certainty of their desolation. And 2, the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
in that the instrument of their destruction was already prepared
and brought close to them, the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that should ruine their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Nation, being already Masters and Rulers over them.</p>

                        </gap>, in those verses.</p>
                     <p>His answer is an exhortation to almesdeeds, or giving to the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
rather then any other lesson, not that thereby they might
thinke to satisfie for their sinnes, or merit for themselves, but for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52154:96"/>
other important and considerable ends. For, 1. he seteth
them this as an easie lesson, for yet they were but very children in
the Evangelicall schoole: To have put them at their first entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this schoole, to the hard lecture of self-deniall, mortification, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and joy in persecution, and other such things as these, had
been too strong meat for such babes, too difficult a taske for such
infants to take out, and therefore hee setteth them this easie Copy,
and layeth no greater an imposition upon them, then what even
the weakest of them might follow and undergoe, to impart of their
abundance to the poore.</p>
                     <p>2. The tenour of the Gospel is mercy and not sacrifice, <hi>Hosea 6. 7.
Mat.</hi> 12. 7. and therefore he putteth not upon them the cost of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and offerings which were required by the Law, nor the
fasting and pining of the body, as did many of his owne Disciples,
but the lovely workes of charitie and mercy, the first and most visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of which is reliefe of the needy.</p>
                     <p>3. By this he putteth them to tryall, how they forsake the world,
by parting with their worldly goods, how they live by faith in not
fearing poverty though they give of their wealth away, how they
love their neighbour as themselves, in making him partner of what
they have, and how their eyes are fixed on things to come, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
away here, and looking for reward thereof in heaven.</p>
                     <p>And, 4. it may bee very well supposed that among the
multitude that stood before him, the Baptist saw some rich, and
some poore, some in good cloathing, and some in meane, and that
the present object that he beheld might bee some occasion to him to
propose this lesson to be put presently in practice.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, More especially were men of this profession odious
among the Jewes; because, whereas they held themselves to bee a
freeborne Nation, and that they ought not to subject to any, nor
pay tribute, but onely their dues to God, and homage to their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52154:97"/>
own King, these wretches, as enemies to the common Liberty, did
help forward their subjection in exacting of custome, though they
were of the same Nation themselves, complying too much with the
Romanes company, contrary to Jews punctualnesse of sequestrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Heathen, and too too much with their tyranny in aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
those burdens of bondage which they had made heavy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
before.</p>

                     <p>The Baptist in his answer tyeth both hand, tongue, and heart, deed,
word, and thought from the injury of another, their profession
especially tending so much toward injuriousnesse.</p>
                     <p>First, hee forbiddeth them open violence in act, whether by

could not reach, and sewing the Foxes skinne to, when the Lions
was too short. And,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, discontentation and repining at their wages, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was the cause and originall of both the other. And so is that
a main argument used by <hi>Percennius,</hi> which moved the great muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

                     <p>It is observable in both the answers of the Baptist, to the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
and to the Souldiers, that hee gainsayeth not their professions,

                     <p>Divers things there were that concurred, to make the Jewes to
thinke of Christ, when they saw the Baptist, and to muse in heart
whether hee were hee or no.</p>
                     <p>First, the first and the prime one was the agreement of the time.
For they had learned by diverse pregnant evidences both in the
Law and in the Prophets that this was the time when Christ should
come: for now was the Scepter departed from <hi>Juda,</hi> now was the
Law-giver or <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> slaine by <hi>Herod,</hi> now were the Romanes
Lords of their Nation, and now were <hi>Daniels</hi> seventies expired, by
which they knew that this was the time, and now they looked that
the Kingdome of Heaven should appeare, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 11. and they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together from all Nations to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to see its appearing,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. as was hinted before.</p>
                     <p>When therefore, secondly, in this time of their great expectation,
they behold the excellent sanctity, piety, and zeale; the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
strictnesse, austerity and Spirit; And,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the strange, unusuall and powerfull manner of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Baptist, it is no wonder if they entertained a doubtfull
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52154:98"/>
and musing thought of him, whether hee were the Christ or no.
And,</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, their longing desire and earnest wishing after <hi>Messias</hi>
his comming, might something forward such a conceit, for <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilè
credimus quod volumus;</hi> and the Greek word doth import a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
joyned with their expectation. So Christ in <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. is

<hi>desire, Hagg.</hi> 2. 7. It is not unlike but the comming of the wise
men, the words of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> and other testimonies of Christ
then come, were dispersed among very many, and notice taken of
them, and this might bee a strengthening and helping forward of
this surmise: but that the strangenesse of the Baptists birth, and of
what befell his Father about it, should bee any induction or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding
thereunto, as some doe hold, is hard to bee beleeved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
wee can thinke that either this people had forgot to look after
the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> for the <hi>Messias,</hi> or that <hi>Elizabeths</hi> alliance to
that Tribe, for shee was couzin to the Virgin <hi>Mary, Luk.</hi> 1. 36. did

by the Revelation of the Spirit, for it is said onely before that they
mused of the matter in their heart, and put it not to question, it is
farre more probable, that <hi>John</hi> came to know this their thought,
by some outward expression of their own. For among so great a
multitude, when they were all in the same doubt and hesitation, it
was impossible, but there would break out some whisperings, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
arguings, or other token of the generall conceit, that even

                     <p>All the Evangelists have this answer of the Baptist, in regard of
the substance, but in some circumstances there is difference among
them. As first, whereas <hi>Luke</hi> saith, that these words were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
from him by the thoughts of the people, <hi>Matthew,</hi> that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
hath joyned with him in this story, even to the very words,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52154:98"/>
hath no such thing as about the questions aforementioned, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this supposall, but joyneth this as a continued speech to the
Pharisees and Sadduces: but this needeth to breed no scruple, seeing
that it is not onely usuall, but also necessary among the foure, one
to relate what another hath omitted, and one to declare at large,
what another hath done in briefe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, whereas both <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> have set this testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Baptist after other speeches of his made before; <hi>Marke,</hi>
as was mentioned before, hath set it the first of all his Preaching,
and indeed hath mentioned no speech else: But this hee hath done,
partly because hee would hasten to the Baptisme, Preaching, and
Miracles of Christ, partly because <hi>Matthew</hi> had set out the matter
at large before; but chiefely to give us to know that this witnesse
went along with <hi>John</hi> in all his Sermons, and to all companies that
came to bee baptized.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, whereas <hi>Luke</hi> hath alledged this speech as an answer to
the peoples thoughts, <hi>John</hi> hath brought it as an answer to an open
question, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 25, 26, 27. And here it may be questioned indeed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these two speak of one and the same thing, &amp; of the same time:
But the resolution is easie, that they doe not. For as it is plaine
by <hi>Luke,</hi> that these words mentioned by him, proceeded from <hi>John</hi>
before the Baptisme of Christ, so is it as plaine by <hi>John,</hi> that those
in him came from him after: for in <hi>ver.</hi> 26. hee intimateth that
Christ himselfe had already stood among them, but they knew him
not; No nor hee himselfe, but by the Holy Ghost, which hee saw
descend down upon him, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. By which is confirmed what was
said even now, that <hi>John</hi> made sure to beare this witnesse to Christ,
at all times, and before all companies. Now because the eyes of the
people upon himselfe, looked at the strangenesse of his Baptisme, and
the sanctity of his person, therefore doth hee apply this his testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
accordingly, by comparing Christ and himselfe, and his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
and his together, and proclaiming his own inferiority in
both, as farre as baptisme with water onely, is below baptizing with
the Holy Ghost, and further then the servant that unties his Masters
shooes, below him that weares them.</p>

with <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> as <hi>Jansenius</hi> hath conjoyned them, <hi>I
have baptized, and doe baptize you.</hi> Or, rather doth it intimate
that hee still baptized the companies that came unto him, and
then gave this testimony to them concerning Christ. For his
preaching was first of repentance, and then having wonne the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be baptized, he brought them to the water and baptized them
in the name of him that was to come after him, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 4. So that

                     <p>As the forme of the Church was changed at the comming of
Christ, from Jewish to Christian, and from Legall to Evangelicall,
so is it no wonder if the Sacraments were changed therewithall.
For if Christ were to give a new law, as <hi>Moses</hi> did the old, which
the Jewes themselves confesse that hee must, and the Prophets had
foretold that hee should doe; it was also necessary that he should
give these new, as well as other things. But it is some wonder, that
seeing hee instituted the Sacrament that should succeed the Passeover,
so neer to the nature of the Passeover, as that it was a supper as well
as it, that there should such a main distance and difference be between
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52154:99"/>
Baptisme and Circumcision, the one of which should succeed the
other; for what affinity betwixt washing with water, and cutting
off of the foreskin? For the better viewing of the reason of which
difference, it will bee necessary to consider the maine particulars of
either Sacrament apart, and then may the Reader compare them
together in their variety.</p>
                     <p>First, then, Circumcision to <hi>Abraham</hi> was a seale of the promise,
<hi>thou shalt bee the father of many Nations:</hi> but to his seed, of the
promise of the Land of <hi>Canaan, I will give to thee, and to thy seed,
all the Land of Canaan: therefore thou and thy seed after thee, shall
keepe my Covenant, Gen.</hi> 17, 8, 9. And such a different end may bee
observed in the administration of baptisme to Christ himselfe, and
the administring of it unto Christians. The text alledged sealeth the
lease of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> with the seale
of Circumcision, and confineth that Ceremony onely to that Land,
and onely to their continuance there. And upon this inference, [I
will give thy seed the Land of <hi>Canaan; therefore shall they keepe my
Covenant]</hi> it was that <hi>Joshua,</hi> as soone as ever they had set foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Land, was commanded to circumcise them, <hi>Josh.</hi> 5. And
from hence it will follow, first, that that Land must bee considered
dilated, as farre as Circumcision went with the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in
<hi>Ishmaelites, Midianites, Edomites</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hence they will be found to erect circumcision againe
in the Church of Christ, that hold the called Jewes shall have a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
kingdome againe in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, thirdly, hence it may bee resolved why that Sacrament was
deferred so long, and not given to the World before. <hi>Adam, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch,
Noah, Eber,</hi> &amp;c. were not circumcised; because to them a fixed
and setled place for the Church to reside together was not designed,
but when such a one is designed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> then circumcision is
given also.</p>
                     <p>The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was bequeathed to <hi>Sem</hi> by his father <hi>Noah,</hi>
the occasion was, because <hi>Cham,</hi> and his Sonne <hi>Canaan</hi> derided <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi>
nakednesse as hee lay asleepe in the midst of his Tent: when
therefore that Land is to bee setled upon the right heires of <hi>Sem,</hi> to
which God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the Prophetick spirit of <hi>Noah</hi> intended it, a seale,
and an assura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52154:100"/>
slavery. This was a maine reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why Males alone were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
and why in that member; because a male alone, and that
member in him was so derided. Other reasons of the institution of
the Ceremony, and onely for masculines, and in that part, might
concurre for instruction [such as are given by <hi>Lumbard, Aquinas,
Biel, Lyra</hi> and others] but that they were not of the nature or
essence of the Sacrament, and that this forementio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed was the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
and spirit of it, may bee concluded by these two things.</p>
                     <p>First, that Circumcision concerned not the children of <hi>Israel</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but the whole seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> For those children of his by his
Concubines, that lived in <hi>Arabia,</hi> as <hi>Ismaelites, Dedanites, Meda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
Midianites, Shuhites, Amalekites,</hi> and the rest were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as well as <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Palestina.</hi> Those Countreys whither <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
had sent them to inhabite were once in the possession of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites,</hi>
till he obtained them by conquest of the foure Kings, <hi>Gen.
14.</hi> and thither he sendeth them with the seale of Circumcision up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, which gave them interest in the Land there, as well as
<hi>Isaac</hi> had elsewhere: <hi>Abraham</hi> taught his children, and his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
after him to keepe the way of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. which
though this off-spring of his in <hi>Arabia</hi> did not long in other things,
yet in circumcision it did. So that from hence may result the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of another end, and reason of the institution of this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
namely, for distinction, not of <hi>Israel</hi> from other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as <hi>Lyranus</hi> would have it, but of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from all
other people.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, howsoever all the <hi>Israelites</hi> dwelling before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our Saviour out of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as both of the
<hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> dispersion, used Circumcision in Heathens
Lands, and used it lawfully; yet it was because their claime and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> did still continue: nay, this was one
reason why it held up some store of yeers after Christ his comming &amp;
ascension: but when <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was destroyed, and their lease of
that Land of promise, either expired or forfeited, or both; then
did this seale of it fall and come to ruine also, and might not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be used ever after: and when they must for ever relinquish the
Land, they must for ever also relinquish this seale or Ceremony that
had assured it. This well con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>idered, will cause us also to observe:</p>
                     <p>First, that the interest of <hi>Israel</hi> in the holy Land began to shake,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52154:100"/>
when baptisme came to shoulder out Circumcision. Secondly,
that <hi>John</hi> most properly preached much of <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi>
for their earthly one began to cease when baptisme began to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
Circumcision.</p>
                     <p>As Circumcision it selfe had relation to the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eritance of the
Land of the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> so the fixed time for the administration of
it; namely, the eight day seemeth also to have some aim and respect to
the same thing. For seven nations were in that Land, which the
Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> were to subdue and dwell in their stead, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites,
Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites,</hi> and <hi>Jebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,
Deut. 7. 1. Josh.</hi> 3. 10. In correspondency to this number of
seven Nations that were to bee subdued, <hi>Jericho</hi> the first field fought
in that Land, is compassed seven dayes, and seven times the seventh
day. And in like answerablenesse, every child of <hi>Abraham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This then was the ground-worke and Originall of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that every Sonne of <hi>Abraham</hi> might beare in his body the
seale of the inheritance of the Land of promise, and the badge of
distinction from all other people, and that this visible signe might

which appropriated and restrictive ends of the Rite, the necessity

for when there was to bee no more distinction betwixt the
children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and other people, and no one land more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarized
then another, but of every Land and Nation he that feareth
God, and worketh righteousnes is accepted of him; that badge of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d seale of singularity, must either cleane come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or become unnecessary.</p>
                     <p>Now that baptisme did succeed in the stead thereof, some reasons
may be given. As, first, because the Sacraments of the New Testament
were to bee gentle and easie, in stead of the smart and burdensome
ones of the Law. Secondly, because God would comply with men
even in their owne common custome, of washing children when
they are newly born, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4. 9. and turne the common to a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52154:101"/>
use, thereby to catch and winne them the more. But, thirdly,
this one maine reason may serve for all; namely, the neere corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency
that is between the Sacrament, and the thing signified,
and the full significancy that the element beareth of the grace that
it signeth forth. To which, fourthly, might bee added, that baptism
tooke place in the Christian Church, to fulfill the types and predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that had gone before of it under <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and before. As
in the flood and Arke, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. in the passage through the red
Sea and <hi>Jordan, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 2. in the purifications and sprinklings at
the Sanctuary: But especially in foure remarkable particulars, was
this fore-signified and typed out in a speciall manner.</p>
                     <p>First, in <hi>Jacobs</hi> admission of the preserved Sichemites to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and communion, Gen. 35. 2 <hi>And</hi> Jacob <hi>said to his houshold,
and to all that were with him, Put away the strange Gods that are among
you, and be cleane, and change your garments.</hi> Wherein hee injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
them three things for their admission to his Church. 1. To
relinquish their idolatry. 2. To wash or baptize their bodies, for
so must the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Make your selves cleane,</hi> be understood, and
so is it well rendred by <hi>Aben Ezra.</hi> Especially, 3. since hee giveth
order for the changing of their garments: All three containing the
cleansing of their minds, bodies and cloaths. And there observe,
first, that when Circumcision in the next chapter before had proved
a Sacrament of death to the <hi>Sichemites; Jacob</hi> useth baptisme for
admission of Proselytes in the stead thereof. Secondly, that the
company to be admitted are females, [unlesse there were some <hi>Syrian</hi>
male Idolaters] for all the males of <hi>Sechem</hi> were slaine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 25.
or at the least, the most of them, and therefore hee useth a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which women also might come under, for under circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they did not come.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in the admission of the Israelites to the hearing of the
Law, by sanctification and washing, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 10. from which the
Jewes themselves did ground the baptizing of Proselytes, as a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ground.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, at the making of the Covenant at <hi>Sinai,</hi> the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Israel to the visible Church, was by baptisme, or the sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of water as well as of blood, as saith St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 9. 19. yea,
and even the Jewes themselves. <hi>Our Rabbins teach,</hi> saith <hi>Rabbi So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,
that our Fathers entred into the Covenant, and baptisme, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52154:101"/>
sprinkling of blood: for there was no sprinkling of blood without bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.
R. Sol. in loc.</hi> 4. In that in these times of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi>
when heathens converted to the Jewes Religion by multitudes,
their admission to their Church was by baptism, and not by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision.
And the ground worke of this their practise, was, because,
Israel comming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> washed their garments; and the Priests
comming from their common employments, to their function, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
their bodies: Let all be concluded in the words of the Talmud,
<hi>Rabbi Akiba said, O Israel you are blessed: Before whom are yee ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
or cleansed? Or who is hee that cleanseth you? It is your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father, as it is said, I will powre cleane water upon you.</hi> In
Kippurim.</p>
                     <p>Our Masters say, That bastards and Gibeonites, shall bee all justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in time to come. And this is the doctrine of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> as it is written,
I will powre cleane water upon you. <hi>In Kiddushin.</hi>

                     <p>Here the Schooles thinke they find a maine difference betweene
the baptisme of <hi>John,</hi> and the baptism used in the Christian Church;
because that was onely the baptisme of repentance, and the other
of grace, and remission of sins: but that there was no essentiall or

                     <p>Though by this mightinesse of Christ above the Baptist, his
omnipotency or all-powerfulnesse as he is God, may well and truly
be understood, is many Expositors do take it, yet since <hi>John</hi> speaketh
of him, as hee should shew himselfe among the people when hee
came, aud in comparison with himself as concerning preaching and
baptizing, it cannot be but his words have respect to some particular
things, wherein Christ shewed this mightinesse above <hi>John,</hi> yea, even
conversing among men in his humane flesh, and in what respected
his preaching and ministeriall Office. And these may bee reduced
unto these foure heads.</p>
                     <p>First, the power of miracles, which Christ had, but <hi>John</hi> had not:
For <hi>John</hi> wrought no miracle, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 41. Nor was it fit he should,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52154:102"/>
since hee in whom that power rested as in its proper center, was so
neere to come, and so ready to shew it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in the different power of the Preaching of <hi>John,</hi> and
of our Saviour, and their conversion of the people, <hi>John</hi> many,
but Christ farre more, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in the seale and confirmation of their Doctrine and
Ministery; for whereas <hi>John</hi> sealed it with his death, our Saviour
did not onely so, but also with his resurrection.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, in continuance and increase of their preaching, and
Disciples, and this difference <hi>John</hi> sheweth himselfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 30. To
which may bee annexed the excellency of Christs baptisme above
that of <hi>Johns,</hi> which is the very thing that is in comparison, <hi>I bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
you with water, but hee shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <head>SS. The latchet of whose shooes I am not worthy to unloose.</head>
                     <p>The sense is but strained which delighteth so many, namely, that
<hi>John</hi> confesseth under this <hi>simile,</hi> that hee is unable to resolve the
great mystery of the incarnation; Seeing <hi>Matthew</hi> giveth this his
speech in other words, and <hi>Marke</hi> by adding one word more to
these, maketh it more necessary to take them in their literall mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it thus, <hi>Whose shooes I am not worthy to beare,</hi>
and <hi>Marke, The latchet of whose shooes, I am not worthy to stoope down
and unloose.</hi> Both joyntly shewing, that the Baptist hath no mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and figurative meaning in this his speech, but doth in plaine
and downe-right termes averre his inferiority to Christ, that was
to come after him, to bee infinitely great, and more then a servants
that ties his Masters shooes, or carries them, is to his Master. For
these meanest and basest of offices of servant to Master, hee instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
in, that hee might expresse the infinite distance betwixt him
and Christ, the more to the life, and to the peoples apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>SS. Hee shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</head>
                     <p>Hence ariseth that opinion so mightily taken up in the Schooles,
and imbraced, concerning the great disparity and difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Baptisme used in the Christian Church, and the Baptisme
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52154:102"/>
of <hi>John;</hi> for this (say they) could not conferre grace, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth, and <hi>Johns</hi> was but as a mean betwixt the purifications
of the Jews, and the baptisme of Christians. In which, first, the
words of the Baptist are misconstrued, and secondly, there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
pretended where there is none at all.</p>
                     <p>For, first, <hi>John</hi> compareth not his own baptisme with ours, but
his own with Christs. For that hee meaneth not the baptisme that
Christ instituted to bee used by others, but that hee practised and
exhibited personally himselfe, is plaine, In that hee mentioneth not
water in Christs baptizing, which our Saviour himself doth, when
hee speaketh of the baptisme that they meane, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5. and in
that hee saith personally that Christ should baptize, which with
water hee never did, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by the Holy Ghost, wherewith Christ should baptize,
is not meant the grace concomitant to our Christian baptisme, as
they suppose, but his sending down the extraordinary gifts of the
Spirit, as is plaine by our Saviours owne exposition, <hi>Act. 1. 5. For</hi>
John <hi>indeed baptized with water, but you shall bee baptized with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost not many daies hence.</hi> Where using the very same words with
these of the Baptist, and applying the baptizing with the Holy
Ghost plainely and undenyably to his sending down of the Holy
Ghost on Pentecost day, hee hath given a sure, plain and undoubted
explanation of these words.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, neither, if the baptisme of <hi>John,</hi> and the baptisme used
in the Christian Church bee well compared together, will any such
difference or diversity bee found betwixt them, nay, set the form of
words aside, no difference at all.</p>
                     <p>For, first, they both had the same institution from Christ, for
hee that sent the Apostles to baptize, sent also the Baptist, <hi>John
1.</hi> 33.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they both had the same element, water.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they had both the same end, <hi>repentance.</hi> For though
our Christian baptisme is called the <hi>Baptisme for remission of sins, Act.
2.</hi> 38. &amp;c. and a great deale of preeminence of this, above that of
<hi>John,</hi> picked as is thought out of that title, yet is it no more then
what is said of the baptisme of <hi>John, Mark.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, whereas it is commonly said, that one end of our
Saviours being baptized was, that hee might sanctifie our baptisme,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52154:103"/>
how can this bee supposed, if hee received not our baptisme, but
one different from it?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the Disciples were baptized with no baptisme but that
of <hi>John,</hi> for Christ baptized them not, and who other should do,
it cannot bee imagined, and therefore if this of ours bee more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
then <hi>Johns,</hi> wee have a better baptisme then the Apostles that
first administred it.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, and lastly, howsoever the Schooles without any stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
doe hold rebaptization of those that had received the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of <hi>John,</hi> this crosseth their own tenet, that his was a degree
above the washings under the Law, for their imperfection was
shewed by their reiteration, and in this they make his to differ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all. And whereas it is said, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 5. that some that were
baptized with the baptisme of <hi>John</hi> upon <hi>Pauls</hi> instruction of them,
were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus: it was rather their
renewing to their baptisme, then their baptisme to them, and not
that they tooke any other then that of <hi>John,</hi> but that they now
began to entertaine and apply it to the right intent. As it may bee
exemplified in circumcision in any heathen son of <hi>Abraham:</hi> as
in <hi>Jethro</hi> for an instance. Hee was circumcised while hee was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever,
because hee was a <hi>Midianite,</hi> a childe of <hi>Abraham;</hi> now
when hee came to bee a convert, and imbraced the true Religion,
hee was not to bee circumcised againe, for that was to possible, but
hee then beganne to know and apply the right use and meaning of
his circumcision, and so was renewed to it, and not it to him: Or
those words, [When they heard this they were baptized in the name
of the Lord Jesus,] may bee understood to bee the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> and
not of <hi>Luke,</hi> as see <hi>Beza in loc.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This phrase of <hi>baptizing with the holy Ghost</hi> sheweth, first, the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the holy Ghost, which long agoe was departed from <hi>Israel,</hi>
and gone up.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the abundance and plenteousnesse of that gift when it
should bee exhibited, that it should bee as water powred upon them,
as the word is used, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it sheweth whither all the washings and purifyings of
the Law aimed, and had respect, namely to the washing and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of men by the holy Ghost.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">

of <hi>Zion,</hi> and purge the blood of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> out of the middest
thereof, by the spirit of Judgement, and by the <hi>spirit of burning.</hi>
It is easily to bee resolved what <hi>John</hi> meaneth here by <hi>fire,</hi> seeing our
Saviour himselfe hath applyed the other part of his speech to the
comming down of the Holy Ghost on Pentecost day, when wee know
hee appeared in the visible shape of tongues of fire, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. Now
Christs baptizing in this manner with fire, was 1. That the giving
of the holy Ghost might fully answer the giving of the Law, both
for time and manner, for both were given at Pentecost, and both
in fire. 2. To expresse the various operations of the holy Ghost,
which are fitly resembled and represented by the effects of fire: As
1. To inlighten with knowledge; 2. To inflame with zeale; 3. To
burne up corruption; 4. To purifie the nature; 5. To turne the
man to its own qualification of sanctity, as fire maketh all things
that it seiseth like it selfe. 3. To strike terrour in the hearts of men,
lest they should despise the Gospel, and to win reverence to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, for feare of the fire. 4. Hereby was clearely and fully
shewed, the life and significancy of the sacrifices under the Law,
upon whom there came a fire from heaven: intimating that they
are lively sacrifices, and accepted, who are inflamed by the holy
Ghost from above.</p>
                     <p>And thus the two elements that have and shall destroy the world,
water and fire, hath God been pleased to use for the benefit and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of his chosen.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">

                     <head>Ver. 17. Whose fanne is n his hand.</head>
                     <p>By <hi>the fanne</hi> in the hand of Christ, the most Expositors under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the power of judgement that God the Father hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, <hi>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Sonne, Joh.</hi> 5. 22. And thus some take it for an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against security to all: and others, against Apostasie to those
that have been baptized with the holy Ghost: and that as the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
in the former words hath told what Christ would doe, at his
first comming and appearance, so in these, what hee will doe at
his second: but I rather adhere to the interpretation of them that
by <hi>the Fanne</hi> of Christ, understand the Gospel, and his preaching
and publication of the same; and that upon these reasons:</p>
                     <p>First, because unlesse it bee thus taken, wee have not here any
testimony at all given by the Baptist to the people, concerning that
part of the Office of Christ. Now that being a matter of so great
importance, as that the Prophets do more insist upon the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ, and his power in the Gospel, then upon any other
thing that concerned him in the worke of redemption, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in severall respects more regardable then his baptizing with the
holy Ghost, it cannot bee imagined that <hi>John</hi> should omit to beare
witnesse of him for such a thing, nay it had been to neglect to beare
witnesse of him for the chiefe thing of all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, because the Gospel or the word of God is the proper
touchstone that tryeth and differenceth betwixt gold and drosse,
truth and falsehood, pure and vile: and this is the instrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
hee confoundeth every strong hold that exalteth it selfe against
himselfe, <hi>Isa. 11. 4. 2 Thess. 2. 8. Revel.</hi> 1. 16. and 2 16. And,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, because <hi>John</hi> speaketh of Christ as hee should presently
shew himselfe among them, as it is apparent in the verse preceding,
and not as hee should shew himselfe at the end of the world.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>SS. His floore.</head>
                     <p>If these words and those that follow, bee applyed to the whole
Church in all places, and at all times in generall, the application
may bee very profitable and pertinent, as giving warning to all
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52154:104"/>
men to bring forth the fruits of repentance, for feare of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to come, and so the end of this verse may bee of the same use
with the end of the ninth to all men whatsoever; but that by the
<hi>floore of Christ</hi> in this place is meant the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jews alone, may bee concluded upon these observations:</p>
                     <p>First, that the title given, <hi>His floore,</hi> is but the very Epithet of
<hi>Isaiah,</hi> that hee giveth to <hi>Israel, Isa. 21. 10. Oh my threshing, and
the corne of my floore:</hi> which though some Expositors both Jewish
and Christian apply to <hi>Babel,</hi> yet let the Reader upon common
reason, and serious examination bee the Judge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, because the phrase of fanning of that Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth
their finall desolation, <hi>Jer. 15. 7. I will fanne them with a
fanne in the gates of the Land:</hi> and the Baptist seemeth in these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
his <hi>fanne</hi> and his <hi>floore,</hi> to have reference to these two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, because the words being thus appropriated to <hi>Israel,</hi>
they have the more agreement with the verses preceding, which tell
of the wrath to come upon that Nation, and of the axe already laid
to the root of that tree.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the phrase of <hi>throughly purging,</hi> which the Greek word
importeth, [and the same word is used both by <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Marke]</hi>
denoteth a finall separation of the Wheate and chaffe, and an utter
consumption of the wicked, and this being spoken onely to the
Jews, and to those Gentiles that were mingled with them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so fitly bee applyed to any thing as to that Nation, and their
utter desolation; for God had often purged them before; but now
their <hi>thorough purging</hi> is neere at hand, when Christ by the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ne of
the Gospel shall have sifted and tryed them, and found them out,
who was Wheate, and who was chaffe. And,</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, this Exposition is consented to, even by the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the more ancient of whom have held, that the comming of
Christ should bee the finall desolation of their Nation. So doth
their whole <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> confesse, <hi>Joh. 11. 48. This man doth many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and if wee let him alone, all men will beleeve on him, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
shall come and take away both our place and Nation.</hi> And to the
same tenour of confession is that collection of the Talmud cited
ere while from the last verse of the tenth Chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and the
first of the eleventh, where the fall of the forest and <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52154:105"/>
the comming of the branch out of the stemme of <hi>Jesse,</hi> are laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
And to the same purpose doth the Chaldee Paraphrast ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Isa. 66. 7. Before her paines came, shee was redeemed, and before the
pangs of her birth, Messias her King was revealed.</hi> A Text from which
<hi>Rabbi Samuel bar Nachaman</hi> in <hi>Bereshith Rabba</hi> concludeth that the
destruction of the Temple, and the birth of the <hi>Messias</hi> should bee
neere together.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, that this verse, as it was spoken onely, so also is to bee
applyed onely to the Jews, may bee somewhat inferred from the
Titles given to the parties spoken of, <hi>wheat</hi> and <hi>chaffe,</hi> which both
grow from one roote, and come up upon the same stal k: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
fitly both the beleeving and unbeleeving Jews, or the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and wicked of them, both descended from the same nationall
Originall. And to back this observation, it is observable, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
our Saviour maketh his metaphor of Wheat and Tares, because
hee would onely shew the difference betwixt the righteous and the
wicked, the Baptist doth his of Wheat and chaffe, because he would
not onely shew the same difference in condition, but also their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and identity in Nation.</p>

                     <p>By <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>chaffe,</hi> might very well bee understood true and false
doctrine, and the rather because the Scripture elsewhere calleth them
by such tearmes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 28. and maketh the fire of the Word of
God, the tryer and touchstone of them both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12, 13. 15.
from <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 2. and the rather still, because the words are spoken
to Pharisees and Sadduces, which were both very erroneous in their
tenets: but that it will bee very harsh to apply the gathering into
the Garner, and the unquenchablenesse of the fire in re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>erence to
doctrine: therefore the two different titles are severally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to bee understood of righteous and wicked mens persons, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced
in those their severall qualifications: and under this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
may the truth or falsity of doctrine bee also understood:
Now the righteous or Saints of God, are fitly compared to Wheat
in diverse respects, as in goodnesse, usefulnesse, weight and fulnesse,
whereas the wicked on the contrary are like chaffe, in being refuse,
vile, unprofitable, light, empty, and fittest for the fire.</p>

much, for a Leper was said to be gathered when hee was cleansed, 2

manner of speech here, seemeth to bee taken from the gathering
of harvest or ripe fruits, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 16. or from the gathering of
dying men unto their rest as <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 8. 17.</p>

                     <p>THere can be no doubt or scruple about the subsequency of the
beginning of this Section to that that was next before, for the
three Evangelists have so unanimously ranked them together, that
the order needeth no more confirmation. But about this latter part
or the genealogy of Christ there is something more difficulty. For
some Harmonists have brought this line of <hi>Luke,</hi> and that of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
together, some bringing <hi>Matthews</hi> hither with <hi>Lukes</hi> to Christs
baptisme, and others this of <hi>Luke,</hi> to the time of <hi>Matthews</hi> to <hi>Christs</hi>
birth: But as the Evangelists have laid them asunder, so are they to be
kept asunder, and to be disposed in the harmony according as they
lie: for pregnant reasons may be given why the two have laid them at
times so far distant. Why <hi>Matthew</hi> at our Saviours birth, the reasons
were given there, in their proper place; and why <hi>Luke</hi> at his baptism,
may bee the better seen by looking on the promise, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. The
seed of the woman shall breake the head of the Serpent. Matthew</hi> wrote
his Gospel chiefly for the Jewes; and therefore it was necessary for
him to shew and approve <hi>Jesus</hi> for the <hi>Messias</hi> by his Pedegree,
which was the mainest and the chiefest thing that that Nation loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
after, for the judging of the true Christ; this he doth therefore,
at the Story of his birth, and beginneth it from <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was
the <hi>ultima Analysis,</hi> or the furthest that they cared to looke after, as
concerning his descent. But <hi>Luke</hi> a companion of the Doctor of
the Gentiles in all his travailes writeth his Gospel for the Gentiles,
as well as for the Jewes: and therefore hee sheweth Christs descent
at the Story of that time, at which hee was first borne toward the
Gentiles, that is, at his revelation at his baptisme, from whence hee
first began to preach the Gospel. The first words of the promise,

                        <hi>the seed of the woman,</hi> the Evangelist sweetly expoundeth in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie,
shewing through seventy five descents, that he was the seed
of the woman promised to <hi>Adam</hi> in the garden, and therefore hee
draweth his line from <hi>Adam,</hi> in whose loines the Gentiles were, for
whom he writeth as well as the Jewes, when the promise was made.
The latter words, <hi>Shall breake the head of the Serpent,</hi> begin to take
place from the baptisme of Christ and forward: and first in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
against Satans temptations, which is the very next story that
the Evangelist handleth, and then in his preaching of the Gospel, the
power of which must destroy the kingdome of <hi>Satan,</hi> from that time
forward.</p>

                     <p>THe Tabernacle in the wildernesse was six moneths current in
working and preparing for, before it was finished and set up.
For on the tenth day of the moneth <hi>Tisri,</hi> which answereth to
part of our September, <hi>Moses</hi> commeth down from his third Fast of
forty daies, and bringeth with him the glad tydings of Gods recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
to his People, and in sign thereof the renewed Tables, and
the welcome command to make the Tabernacle. From that time
forward the working and offerings for the making of the sanctuary
began, and six moneths after it was finished and erected, namely, in
the moneth of <hi>Abib, Exod.</hi> 40. So long a time was the Baptist con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and borne before the conception and birth of our Saviour,
<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 26. and so long a time did he preach and baptize, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for the great building of the Gospel before our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
came, and by his own baptisme and preaching reared it up. For
as our Saviour was baptized and entred into his ministeriall functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when he began to bee thirty yeeres of age, and that according
to a legall ordinance, as shall be shewed ere long; so likewise did
the Baptist begin to preach when he began to be thirty, which was
six moneths current before. And this may be the better supposed
if it bee but considered how great multitudes were baptized of <hi>John</hi>
before the baptisme of Christ, and how farre he travailed up and
downe to preach. Of the latter, <hi>Luke</hi> witnesseth thus, <hi>And hee came
into all the Region round about Jordan, Preaching the baptisme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,

and were baptized of him.</hi> A space of ground not to be travelled
over [with resting in many places by the way] and a number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
not to be baptized in a short space of time.</p>
                     <p>Now the reasons why Christ that needed no cleansing, being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
it selfe, would be baptized, are given divers;</p>
                     <p>As, first, that by this Symbole hee might enter himselfe into the
society and fraternity of the Christians, as by Circumcision he did
of the Jewes: like a King, [it is <hi>Jansenius</hi> his comparison] that to
unite and indeare himselfe to any City of his subjects, condescendeth
to bee made a freeman of it, as are the ordinary Citizens.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that he might beare witnesse to the preaching and
baptisme of <hi>John,</hi> and might receive testimony from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that by his owne baptisme he might sanctifie the waters
of baptisme to his Church.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that he might give example himselfe, of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of that, which he injoyned to others, and by his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to bee baptized, teach others not to refuse that Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, that he might receive testimony from heaven that he was
the son of God.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, that he might occasion the revealing of the Trinity.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, that he might shew the descending of the holy Ghost
on the waters of baptisme.</p>
                     <p>But, eighthly, the maine reason of all, and that which is equall to
these all, is that which is given by Christ hinselfe, namely, that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
might fulfill all righteousnesse; of which anon.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Ver. 14. But John forbad him.</head>
                     <p>So <hi>Peter</hi> forbad Christ to wash his feet, not in any surly forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but in an holy humility, having an eye upon his owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthynesse.
This refusall of <hi>John,</hi> being of the same nature, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to have had respect to three things according to the severall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
there present, Christ, the people, and himselfe.</p>
                     <p>First, in regard of Christ, because hee needed no baptisme, in that
hee needed neither repentance nor remission of sins.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in regard of the people, lest they might mistake, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52154:108"/>
seeing <hi>Christ</hi> baptized as well as they, might judge him sinfull as well
as themselves.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in regard of the Baptist himselfe, who had told the
people so oft, and so constantly of him that came after him, that hee
was greater then hee: and that his baptisme was more excellent then
his, and how would this crosse that testimony of his, in the eyes
and hearts of the people, when they should see him as an inferiour,
come to bee baptized of <hi>John?</hi> But,</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and chiefely this his reluctancy proceeded from his
true and right comparing of Christ and himselfe together, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and purity of him, with the basenesse and sinfulnesse of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and therefore hee saith, <hi>I have need to bee baptized of thee, &amp;c.</hi>
Not refusing the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rvice, nor crossing the will of Christ, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
the unworthinesse of himselfe, and ponderating the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of the persons.</p>
                     <p>But it may not unfitly nor unseasonably bee questioned here, how
the Baptist knew that this was Christ, seeing that hee saith himselfe,
<hi>I knew him not, but hee that sent mee to baptize with water, the same said
unto mee, on whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding
on him, the same is hee that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost, Joh. 1.
33.</hi> Now the descending of the holy Ghost was after hee was
baptized, and these words, <hi>I have need to bee baptized of thee,</hi> were
spoken before. To this doubt and scruple many answers are given,
but not so many resolutions.</p>
                     <p>First, Some take the words <hi>I knew him not, &amp;c.</hi> to bee spoken by
<hi>John,</hi> to make his testimony to bee without suspition: For <hi>John</hi>
and Jesus being a kin by birth, [for their Mothers were Cozins,
<hi>Luk. 1. 36.]</hi> it might bee surmised that <hi>John</hi> gave so high and large
a testimony of him for kindred and affections sake, therefore hee
protesteth that hee knew him not in any such a way, but onely by
divine revelation. Thus <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Theophylact.</hi> In which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
if there bee any satisfaction at all, which is but little, yet is it
not to our whole <hi>quaere,</hi> but onely to the least part of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, some thus, that <hi>John</hi> before his baptisme knew that he
was the Christ, but not that it was hee that should baptize with the
holy Ghost aud with fire, till hee saw the Spirit descend upon him;
and thus <hi>Theophylact</hi> againe, and upon this hee fixeth, as on the
most genuine and proper resolution: which is very hard to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52154:109"/>
or collect out of the words of <hi>John,</hi> in his whole Sermon:
for this maketh him to distinguish betwixt <hi>Christ,</hi> and him that
should baptize with the holy Ghost, and to make them two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
persons in his opinion, whereas both his own words, and no
doubt the expectation of the people did take him for one and the
same, and that same to bee Christ.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, their opinion is yet farre more strange, that think that
the Baptist took not Christ for Christ, when hee gain-sayeth his
being baptized by him, but for some extraordinary holy man,
and continued in this opinion till the descending of the holy
Ghost confirmed him in the Truth, that hee was the <hi>Messias:</hi>
For it is not imaginable that <hi>John</hi> having the peculiar Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from God to baptize all that should come unto him, should him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
desire to bee baptized by another man. And again, his words,
<hi>I have need to bee baptized by thee,</hi> shew that hee understood that it
was hee that Baptized with the holy Ghost, as will appeare by and
by.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, little lesse improper and equally strained is the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that <hi>John</hi> knew indeed that hee was the Christ,
and that it was hee that should baptize with the holy Ghost, but till
hee saw the descending of the holy Ghost, hee knew not that it
was <hi>onely bee</hi> that should baptize with the holy Ghost, or that hee
reserved the propriety of the power of baptizing to himselfe alone,
and did not communicate it to his Ministers. And this propriety
the Schooles make to consist in these foure particulars: 1. That
hee reserved to himselfe the power of instituting baptisme, though
hee communicated the power of baptizing to others. 2. That hee
can conferre the grace or effect of Baptisme, without the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Sacrament, which the Ministers cannot. 3. That
hee giveth efficacy to baptisme by his death. 4. That baptisme is
administred and given in his name. Which glosse as the Father strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the Text to retort upon the <hi>Donatists,</hi> that maintained
that this Sacrament administred by a wicked minister availed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
so is it but strained, and that strangely too, for how can
it possibly bee collected, that <hi>John</hi> should collect any such thing from
the descending of the holy Ghost?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, More plausible is their resolution that hold that <hi>John</hi>
knew Christ indeed in some measure before his baptisme, but not
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52154:109"/>
so fully as after, when the holy Ghost descended. But,</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, a plenary and sufficient satisfaction to the question may
bee had by these three observations.</p>
                     <p>First, That <hi>John,</hi> though hee knew the mystery of the incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and his excellent and divine graces, and that hee
was neere at hand, yet had hee never seen his face till now, nor
knew hee him by sight till hee came to bee baptized.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That then hee knew him by a present revelation, as
<hi>Samuel</hi> knew <hi>Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> 9. 15. 17. For if in his Mothers womb
hee leaped at the approach of Christ in the womb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of his Mother,
much more may it bee conceived, that by the revelation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hee knew him and acknowledged him now.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the signe which was given him when hee beganne
to baptize, <hi>On whomsoever thou shalt see the holy Ghost descend, &amp;c.</hi>
was not given him for his first knowledge of Christ, but for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of that knowledge that hee had of him before: and for
his assurance and confidence to point him out unto the people.
And such a one was the signe given to <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 3. 12. not for
his first instruction that hee was sent by God, but for his confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in that wherein hee was before instructed, nor that neither so
much for himselfe as for the people.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>SS. I have need to bee baptized of thee.</head>
                     <p>Hee meaneth not, with the baptisme of water, which hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
administred to others, but with the baptisme of the holy Ghost.
For, first, Christ himselfe baptized none with water at all, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 2.
but referred the administration of this Sacrament to others.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Baptisme wherewith hee baptized, was of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and it cannot bee doubted that when <hi>John</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of beeing baptized by Christ, hee meaneth the proper baptisme
wherewith Christ baptized.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is not consonant to reason, that <hi>John</hi> should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of the want of that which hee so plentifully afforded unto
others: but though hee himselfe were not baptized in water, yet
his speciall deputation from God, to bee the first and chiefe batiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
made that hee needed it not.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, bee it granted that <hi>John</hi> speaketh of baptizing with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52154:110"/>
water, as some Commentators would have it, yet are not his words
to bee understood simply of any absolute necessity that hee had of
baptisme, but comparatively betwixt him and Christ, that it was
fitter that hee should bee baptized by Christ, then Christ by him.
For so the phrase <hi>I have need,</hi> is used, not alwayes to import ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
but sometimes conveniency. And so doth the Rabbin word
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> indifferently signifie, and diverse words that signifie necessity in
other tongues.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Ver. 15. Suffer it to bee so now.</head>
                     <p>The Emphasis of this clause is held to bee in the word <hi>now:</hi>
As shewing that howsoever Christ was the Sonne of God, and
should in time reveale himselfe mightily so to bee, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. yet
<hi>now</hi> the time required that that his glory should bee veiled under
his humiliation, and his divinity concealed till its proper season
to bee revealed. This exposition is as currant as any among Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors,
how substantiall let the Reader judge. For,</p>
                     <p>First, the baptizing of Christ by <hi>John,</hi> was not so great a meanes
to veile his Divinity as it was to reveale it: for then hee had the
testimony from Heaven, that hee was the Sonne of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there needeth no other reason to bee looked after why
Christ saith, <hi>suffer it to bee so now,</hi> then what hee himselfe giveth, in
the very next words following: <hi>For thus it becommeth us to fulfill
all righteousnesse.</hi> The word <hi>now,</hi> as it lyeth in the <hi>English,</hi> might
bee taken for the sense of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> so ordinary in the Hebrew,
words of intreating or perswasion, and might very well also suite
with that sense here, if the Lxx translated them but by the Greek
word here used <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but they doe not: therfore may wee the more
justly suppose the word to bee emphaticall in some respect, and the
respect seemeth to bee this. Whereas <hi>John</hi> had told the people
before of Christs baptizing with the holy Ghost, and had told
Christ in the verse preceding, that hee had need of that baptisme,
to that it is that our Saviour giveth this answer, <hi>Suffer it to bee so
now,</hi> as meaning thus: That it was true indeed that hee was hee
that should come after him, and hee that should baptize with the
holy Ghost, of which baptisme <hi>John</hi> had more need from him then
hee of <hi>Johns;</hi> yet the time of that his baptizing was not yet come,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52154:110"/>
for first must hee fulfill all the righteousnesse required of himselfe,
before hee was to powre out or bestow that baptisme of the Spirit
upon others: And therefore must <hi>John</hi> suffer him to bee baptized
<hi>now</hi> with the baptisme of water, for that baptisme of his with the
Spirit was not yet to bee exhibited.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>SS. For thus it becommeth us to fulfill all righteousnesse.</head>
                     <p>The greatest doubt and difficulty in this clause is, what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
meaneth here by <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> which being resolved upon, the
other smaller words, and lesse scrupulous in it, will offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the more readily to bee understood.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Hilary,</hi> though somewhat obscurely, seemeth to construe
it of the righteousnesse of the Law, for <hi>by him,</hi> saith hee, <hi>all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
was to bee fulfilled, by whom alone the Law could bee fulfilled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, but <hi>Hierome</hi> speakes it out more plainly and fully, and
understandeth it of all righteousnesse of the Law and of nature,
either of which indeed were not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> unproper glosse to bee applyed
unto Christ alone; but since the word <hi>us,</hi> joyneth the Baptist also
in the same fulfilling with him, it is not safe to understand it of all
the righteousnesse of the Law, because it is not pious to hold <hi>John</hi>
the accomplisher of it, as well as hee.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Theophylact,</hi> and some others with him goe the same
way with these Fathers named, but they goe somewhat further, for
they adde, that Christ had fulfilled all the Law already, but onely
in this one particular of being baptized, and when hee had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that, hee had compleated all righteousnesse. But the word
<hi>us</hi> spoyleth this exposition, as well as it did that before: and it will
bee some worke to prove that baptisme, taken in its proper sense,
or as <hi>John</hi> administred it, was any part of the Law that Christ was
to fulfill.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, others descant upon the words literally, and take righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
for justice distributive, and baptisme for a speciall part or
act of it: <hi>For hee that is baptized,</hi> saith <hi>Ludolphus, pleaseth God, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
his own soule, and edifieth his neighbour by his example, and so fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all justice, in that hee doth to God, himselfe, and his neighbour what hee
ought.</hi> An <hi>Encomion</hi> of baptisme, and a new invention of fulfilling
the Law, which I suppose was never dreamed of before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:52154:111"/>
Fifthly, to omit other expositions much like this, which some have
given, not neere to the text, nor truth: <hi>Jansenius</hi> and some with
him, but not so largely as hee, doe paraphrase it thus. <hi>According
as I by an humble submission desire to bee baptized by thee, so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
us, because wee are sent of God the Father, to call men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from all unrighteousnesse, and to teach the people, to fulfill and
performe in worke whatsoever is right, omitting nothing, bee it never so
little, which wee know to bee agreeable to the will of God. Therefore
hee importeth not, that by the receiving of baptisme all righteousnesse is
fulfilled; but that by them that are Masters and Teachers of all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
nothing is to bee passed over which is right, although they
bee not bound thereto by necessity, and though the thing it selfe seeme
never so small.</hi> Which exposition though it bee good and sound in
regard of the truth contained in it, yet seemeth it not to be punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and seasonable for this place. For whereas the very marrow and
pith of it lyeth in this, that Christ and <hi>John</hi> being teachers of the
people, must practice themselves what they teach others to practice;
and therefore must Christ bee baptized for example to others: let
the Reader judge whether the inference bee good by this, that <hi>John</hi>
himselfe was never baptized: and consequently whether the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of such a sense to these words, bee fitting and agreeable.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Chemnitius</hi> yet goeth neerer the text and the marke, and
bringeth the word <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> to reflect upon men: explaining it
thus: that since Christ came to conferre and apply righteousnesse
to men, and accordingly to sanctifie every thing and meanes that
might conduce to convey the same unto them, therefore would hee
thus consecrate baptism by his own being baptized, &amp; give vigor to it
to be a seale and strengthener of righteousnesse and grace begun: and
in this sense he saith that it becommeth him to fulfill all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or every thing whereby the righteousnesse of man may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
and promoted, and because <hi>John</hi> was the Minister of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
therefore in the word <hi>us,</hi> he joyneth him also in the fulfilling
with him. To this purpose hee and farre more largely comming
as close to the marke, as any we meet with, and yet [if I judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right]
not so close as to hit it in these two respects.</p>
                     <p>First, in that hee seemeth to hold, and so also doe many others
with him, that Christs performance of the severall parts of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
personally in himselfe, was requisite to the sanctifying of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52154:111"/>
such things to others, whereas his very institution of any such a
thing giveth validity sufficient to it without his owne actuall exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
As in this very thing in hand concerning baptisme, if Christ
instituted that in the hand of <hi>John</hi> for a Sacrament to continue in
his Church for ever, I cannot see what vertue, vigor, or efficacy his
being baptized by <hi>John</hi> added to it, more then his institution of it
before had done, save onely for the more sensible reverence of it in
the eyes of the people.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, and chiefly, because it is harsh and bold, to conceive
that Christ in the performance of any thing that might tend to
mans justification, should take a man to bee a sharer and co-worker
in such equality as the words <hi>thus</hi> and <hi>us</hi> do make the Baptist.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>righteousnesse</hi> therefore in this place may rather be understood
the equity and justice of the Law, and Christs fulfilling of the same.
Not the morall, for that opinion we refused before, but the other
parts of it which were either Propheticall, or figurative and typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.
Not denying his fulfilling the morall Law neither, for that
he performed to a tittle, being without the least taint of finne, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in thought, word, or deed, but rather illustrating and setting
forth his performance of that the more, in that hee was also so
punctuall to fulfill the other parts of the Law which were lesse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall.
And to this exposition of <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> namely, for the
equity of the Ceremoniall or typicall Law, not onely the matter or
thing in hand it selfe, but even every word also that is in this clause
doe give their consent and confirmation.</p>
                     <p>For, first, if we looke upon the Ceremoniall law it selfe, and the
reason why it was given, we shall find that it was neither so exact
and exquisite in regard of it's injunctions, nor so strict or necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to bee performed in it selfe according to the Letter, as it was in
regard of its significancy of good things to come; the force and
vertue of it consisting not so much in its very verball precepts, and
corporall observances, as in its representative and typicall predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and fore-shewing of some better things to come thereafter. And
howsoever those Rites and Ceremonies had their obedience in the
practices of the Jewes, yet their equity and very intent indeed they
had not but in the fulfilling of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if wee looke also upon baptisme which was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
now in agitation, and the baptisme of Christ also, how they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52154:112"/>
                        <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:52154:112"/>

                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:52154:113"/>
were both fully and plainely prefigured under legall Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious
observances, was shewed before.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it was requisite that Christ should fulfill the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Law, as well as the morall, in some kind of necessity, though
not as much for the one as for the other. For as the Morall was
a law of faith, so also was the Ceremoniall a Law of hope, as the
judiciall was also of charity. In the morall law it was shewed to man
what he was to doe, but withall he saw by the same Law his owne
disability and impossibility of performing what was to bee done.
The sight of this driveth man to lay hold of Christ that performed
that Law for him; and thus the law, though it be according to the
letter a message of death, yet in the spirit is it a doctrine of faith
unto life. The Jew being thus entred by the morall law into the
schoole of faith, then came in the Ceremoniall, and was as an usher
of hope: for by those rites and legall observations, the memory
of Christs comming was continually kept fresh, and in the eye and
expectation, and the fruit and application of his performance of
the morall law for the good of men daily read in those typicall and
shadowed lectures: As therefore it was absolutely necessary that
Christ should fulfill the morall law in regard of all men, so was it
respectively necessary that he should answer and accomplish the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall,
in regard of the Jew. For if the outward observance
thereof were for nothing so much, as to lead his eye and expectation
to Christ, and the very life and equity thereof were included in him,
how necessary was it, that for the sake of that people, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
both to them and all others, that he was Christ that was
to come, that he should fulfill th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t part of the Law, as well as the
other? At the least how fitting? And so hee saith in the place
in hand, Thus it becommeth us to fulfill all the equity of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall
law. Now the Ceremony to which our Saviour looketh
in these words, was the washing of the Priests in water, when they
entred into their function, <hi>Exod. 29. 4. Lev.</hi> 8. 6. the equity of
which appeared in him, when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e was baptized at his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Ministery. And this indeed was the mainest and properest
end and reason of Christ being baptized; namely, that by baptisme
he might bee installed into his Ministeriall office.</p>

<hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23. where <hi>John</hi> is baptizing a twelve moneth after this;

and <hi>Judea,</hi> of Pharisees, Sadduces, Publicanes, and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which he now reckoneth up in this <hi>summa totalis</hi> of <hi>All the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
to shew what multitudes were baptized into Christ, before Christ
came to bee revealed.</p>
                     <p>But it may be questioned among all this number, whether there
were any women baptized by <hi>John,</hi> or no. And the doubt may seem
to be equally ballanced, for as the silence of the Text doth seeme
to deny it, so reason on the other side doth strongly affirme it.</p>
                     <p>For, first, the baptism of <hi>John</hi> was such a thing as women might
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> as well as men, in regard of possibility, which they could not
possibly doe by Circumcision.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it was such a thing as they might receive as well as men,
in regard of capability, for women were as ready to repent, as
they.</p>
                     <p>But, thirdly, that which putteth it out of all doubt, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were baptized by him, is the testimony of our Saviour:
<hi>Mat. 21. 32. John</hi> came unto you in the way of righteousnesse,
and yee beleeved him not, but Publicanes and <hi>the Harlots belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him.</hi>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>SS. Jesus also being baptized.</head>
                     <p>About the time, place, and manner of our Saviours baptisme,
the Evangelists have been so silent in this place, that what is to bee
resolved upon them is to bee fetched from and by comparison of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
texts, and collection from other places, whcih about the first
will give very full satisfaction, about the second indifferent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the last, little or none at all. The time then of his being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
that is, the time of the yeere, is onely, or at least, chiefly
to be found, by computing the time or length of his preaching,
and thereby considering the time or season of his death. Now the
length of his preaching, or from his baptisme to his death, was
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52154:114"/>
justly and exactly three yeeres and an halfe, as was touched before:
And from that very thing or in relation to it, that number is so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
renowned in Scripture, being sometimes expressed in the plaine
termes, of <hi>three yeeres and six moneths, Luke</hi> 4. 25. sometimes by
<hi>halfe a weeke, Dan.</hi> 9. 27. sometimes, by a <hi>time, times, and halfe a
time, Dan. 12. 7. Rev.</hi> 12. 14. and sometimes, by a thousand two
hundred and threescore dayes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 3. &amp; 12. 6. and sometimes,
by <hi>forty and two moneths, Rev.</hi> 11. 2. To evidence which account
of his Ministery, first may bee produced the Text of <hi>Daniel</hi> alledged
instantly before, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 27. where it is said, that Messias should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the Covenant for many for one week: <hi>or in that one week</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
namely, which hee reckoneth the last of the seventy: for first,
hee nameth seven weeks by themselves, and then sixty two by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>ver.</hi> 25. which every one knoweth make sixty nine; and then
comming to speak of the last week which was to make up the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
hee saith, that <hi>in that one weeke,</hi> Christ shall confirme the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
for many: and then describing and dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ing the exact time
of that his worke, hee saith, <hi>And in halfe that week shall bee cause sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
and oblation to cease.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that by these weeks are meant weeks of yeeres, or as many
yeeres as a week hath dayes, hardly any man ever denyed, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>cted
the contrary; and that then by halfe a week, is meant halfe
seven yeeres, or three yeeres and an halfe, there can bee as little
doubt or scruple: This then the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> telleth was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
time in which the <hi>Messias</hi> did confirme the Covenant, and was
bringing to an end Sacrificing and other Ceremonies, or the time
of his Preaching the Gospell, which was from his Baptisme to his
death.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if not for proofe, yet for better illustration of the same,
may bee produced that place of the Gospell alledged so lately also
before, namely, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 25. where <hi>Elias</hi> is a glorious type and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Christ, in a sweet and harmonious discord and difference:
For as hee shut up heaven by his prayer, and there was no raine
for three yeeres and six moneths, so Christ opened heaven at his
baptisme, as it is said in the verse in hand, and continued to distill
the divine dew and raine of his heavenly doctrine, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 2.
for the same space of time.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly, as there is such evidence for the time averred, from
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52154:114"/>
a Prophecy, and such illustration from a type, so is there a full
confirmation of it in the Evangelicall story. For <hi>John</hi> hath plainly
parcelled out the three yeeres by foure Passeovers: as the first, <hi>chap.
2.</hi> 13. the second, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 1. the third, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 4. and the fourth,
<hi>chap.</hi> 13. 1. &amp;c. and the odde halfe yeere [which since hee dyed at
the last Passeover must bee laid before the first] was taken up in these
particulars, of his journey into the wildernesse, and forty dayes
fast, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 1. his return to <hi>Jordan,</hi> and abode thereabout, <hi>Joh.
1.</hi> 29. 35. 44. his voyage into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and miracle at <hi>Cana, Joh.
2.</hi> 1. his removall after some space to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and some abode
in it, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 12. and thence his journey to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> to the first
Passeover of the foure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 13. So that it being thus apparent
that the length or space of his Preaching was three yeeres and an
halfe, from his baptizing to his suffering, it being withall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that hee dyed at Easter, it will readily follow that hee was
baptized halfe a yeere before that time of the yeere, namely in the
moneth <hi>Tisri,</hi> or <hi>September;</hi> And it being againe considered that
hee was baptized, when hee was just entring upon a new yeere of
his age, as shall be observed anon, it will thence likewise follow
that hee was born at the same time of the yeere also. And who is
hee that can imagine that the renownednesse and fame of this
month in the Old Testament, both before the Law and under it,
was for any other thing so much as in reference and prefiguration
to, and of these glorious things?</p>
                     <p>Now though there bee these assured evidences of the time of the
yeere when our Saviour was baptized, yet is there but conjecture of
the time of the moneth: And that may most consonantly bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to have been at the Feast of Tabernacles, which beganne the
fifteenth day of the moneth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 33. upon these probable
and not altogether unsatisfactory reasons.</p>
                     <p>First, because hee dyed on the fifteenth day of the moneth <hi>Abib</hi>
or <hi>Nisan,</hi> the day after the Passeover, and to make the odde halfe
yeere, spoken of before, an exact and just halfe yeere indeed, his
baptisme must bee fixed on the fifteenth of <hi>Tisri.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, the two other of the three solemne Festivals, the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
and Pentecost, Christ accomplished, or fulfilled what they sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
by his death at the one, and by the giving of the holy Ghost
at the other, and there is no reason to thinke the third, or the Feast
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52154:115"/>
of Tabernacles any lesse figurative, or typicall then the other, and
as little to think that hee should leave the equity of that unsatisfyed
more than the other, and if hee answered not that in his birth and
baptisme, hee answered it in nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the very nature of the Feast of Tabernacles, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
and reason of its institution have a forcible reference to such
a thing. For though <hi>Moses</hi> hath given but this reason for one Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
and practice which they used in the Feast, <hi>Yee shall dwell in
boothes seven dayes, that your generations may know that I made the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel to dwell in boothes, when I brought them out of the Land
of Aegypt, Levit.</hi> 23. 42, 43. Yet had the originall and institution of
the Feast a great deale more in it. For the maine occasion was this:
<hi>Moses</hi> having after long fasting and prayer made the peace of Israel
with God about the golden Calfe, and having obtained the Tables
renewed, which himselfe had broken, and regained the commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to build the Tabernacle, which had beene suspended because of
that sin; on the tenth day of the moneth <hi>Tisri,</hi> [which according
to our account was about the two or three and twentieth day of our
<hi>September]</hi> he comming down from the Mount, bringeth these glad
tydings of peace &amp; reconciliation to the people, for which that day
was observed for the day of reconciliation or expiation ever after:
and the people now hearing that they must make the Tabernacle in
which God would dwell among them, and that they must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from the place where they were, <hi>viz.</hi> from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> till
that be finished, they then addresse themselves to pitch their tents,
and make them booths for their winter abode there, and instantly
fall upon the worke of the Sanctuary, and this was it that was the
occasion of that solemne Feast in succeeding times. Now let the
substance bee laid unto the shadow, and the Antitype and figure
brought together, and the application is not onely sweet, but also
somewhat evincing. For since the occasion of that feast was God
comming to dwell among the people in his Tabernacle and that
now first begun or exhibited, and this just halfe a yeere after their
first delivery from <hi>Egypt;</hi> observe how fully these are answered in
Christs shewing himselfe to the world at his baptism, in whom God
dwelleth among men; and this the first revelation of him to the
world, and this just half a yeer since <hi>John</hi> began to publish the deliv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry
of men from the bondage of Sin and Satan, by the preaching of the
Gospel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:52154:115"/>
Fourthly, the Consecration of the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was at this
very time, namely, in the seventh moneth, or the moneth <hi>Ethanim,</hi>
which is all one with <hi>Tisri,</hi> and thence the service of it began,
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 2. Now since Christ himselfe averreth that the Temple
was a figure of his body, <hi>John</hi> 2. wee may follow the Allegory
with the more boldnesse, and apply the dedication of that, and the
time of the dedication, to his consecration by his baptisme, to his
ministeriall service, and parallel them both in the very same time.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the certaine and determinate place where our Saviour
was baptized, cannot absolutely bee fixed and resolved upon by any
warrant of Scripture: though many have been so confident as to
point it out, and to shew a crosse set in the very place of the River,
and miraculous curing of Leper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in the water. The Evangelists have
given no more settlement of it then this, that it was in <hi>Judea,</hi> and
that it was in <hi>Jordan:</hi> Two circumstances the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</p>
                     <p>First, because that after that baptisme of our Saviour, we cannot
certainly find <hi>John</hi> baptizing either in the same Country, or
in the same River ever againe. For whereas there is mention of his
being about six weekes after this in <hi>Bethabara, Joh.</hi> 1. 28. that was
both on the other side <hi>Jordan,</hi> and it was a water different from
<hi>Jordan, Judg.</hi> 7. 24. and of his baptizing in <hi>Eno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> a whole twelve-moneth
after this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23. that was also out of the precincts
of <hi>Judea,</hi> and distant somewhat from the banks of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and
the waters there, the waters of the place it selfe and not of that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
And this sheweth the reason more plainly, why <hi>Luke</hi> in the
clause next before this that we have in hand, summeth up the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of all the people, before hee speake of our Saviours; because
that there were now collected out of <hi>Judea,</hi> all the harvest of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
that might bee gathered in by the preaching of <hi>John,</hi> and when
Christ was baptized, <hi>John</hi> was to remove to another place.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, from this, that Christ was baptized of <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan,</hi>
and in <hi>Judea,</hi> it will almost inevitably follow, that he was baptized
in the place, where the river was dried up, and the Israelites first
entred into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> For if it bee considered, 1. That
the Army marched through the channel in two maine bodies the
one on the one side of the Arke, and the other, on the other. 2. That
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ither of these maine bodies were two miles distant from the Arke
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52154:116"/>
on either side, and consequently foure miles from each other.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That these two great squadrons consisting either of
them of so very many thousands marched in an extraordinary
breadth, because they were to passe over in a reasonable time, it will
follow hereupon, even past all denyall, that this their passage took
up all the length of <hi>Jordan,</hi> that it had in <hi>Judea,</hi> or very neere it,
so that the place wee seek for, is within this compasse: and by this
wee may observe the substance sweetly answering to the figure, and
way made through the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> to the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> by
baptisme, in the very same place where there was to the earthly, by
its drying up.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The manner of his baptizing differed not from the
common manner that <hi>John</hi> used with others, save in one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
For hee went into the water, had water sprinkled on him, and
prayed as well as they, but whether <hi>John</hi> used the same forme of
words in baptizing of him that hee did to the other, or some other,
or none at all, is some question and scruple. The least is of the
first, for it may bee readily resolved that hee baptized not him in the
same words, that hee did the others, because hee then should have
baptized him in his owne name, which who can imagine? and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, or in his name which was to come, which had been
to have pointed out another Christ. Betwixt the two latter the
scales are ballancing, and they weigh so even, that it is not much
materiall which way your allowance doth turn them, for the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
it selfe is of farre more curiosity then necessity: For why might
not <hi>John</hi> baptize him in varyed words? As, I baptize thee with
water to the Preaching of the Gospel; or why might hee not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
him without any words at all, since hee received baptisme, not

                     <head>Mat. 3. Ver. 16. Hee went up straight out of the water.</head>
                     <p>The invention of Auricular confession hath invented a strange
Exposition of this clause. For the rest of the people, say some, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the waters, I know not how deepe, after they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
confessed their sinnes unto <hi>John</hi> before they came out, being
detained there by him, untill they had so done, but Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52154:116"/>
hee had no sinne, needed no such confession, and therefore
hee came suddenly out of the water after hee was baptized. A
glosse that includeth impossibilities. For neither was it possible that
so great multitudes should bee baptized in so short a time, if every
one made a singular confession of their sinnes to <hi>John;</hi> nor was it
possible that <hi>John</hi> should indure so long in the water as this worke
would require, and never come out: for if they stood up to the
neck in the river, I cannot think but that hee also stood some deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the water. But this speedy comming of our Saviour out of
the water after hee was baptized, is expressed by the Evangelist, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to shew how neere and close the opening of the heavens was to his
baptizing, namely, that it was almost in the very same instant, as
<hi>Marke</hi> explaineth it; <hi>And straightway comming up out of the water hee
saw the heavens opened, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>This it seemeth was the manner of those that were baptized, as
soon as they were baptized, to come up out of the water and pray,
and this explaineth that before, about confessing their sinnes, that
it was not to <hi>John,</hi> but to God, as soon as they came out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Now since Christ had no sinnes to confesse of his owne, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his prayer tended to another purpose. If wee think it was
for the glory of God, for the conversion of many by his Ministery
which hee was now beginning, for the preservation of the Elect,
and the sanctifying of the Church, and the like, wee thinke not
much amisse, since wee finde his prayers in other places to bee made
and tendered to the same effect. But it seemeth rather that his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
at this time was for what followed upon his prayer, the sending
down of the holy Ghost, and the glorifying of him by a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from Heaven. For first, the Text hath laid his prayer, and
the opening of the Heavens so closely, and so consonantly withall
together, <hi>Jesus praying the Heavens were opened,</hi> as that it seemeth to
point out what was the tenour of his prayer by the consequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt
upon it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In another place there is the like returne upon the like
prayer, <hi>Joh. 12. 28. Father glorifie thy name; there came therefore a
voice from heaven, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:52154:117"/>
Thirdly, it being considered that our Saviour was to enter now
upon the great worke of Redemption, and the preaching of the
Gospell, it will bee the lesse strange to conceive that hee prayed for
the visible sealing of him to that work and office by the Holy Ghost,
and for a testimony of him that hee was the <hi>Messias.</hi>

                     <p>There is no materiall difference in the thing, though <hi>Luke</hi> hath
put <hi>the Heaven</hi> in the singular number, and <hi>Matthew, the Heavens,</hi>
in the plurall, for one followeth the <hi>Idiome</hi> of the Hebrews, and
the other of the Greekes. For the Hebrews cannot call the Heaven
by its proper name, but in the plurall or duall number <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>Heavens:</hi> but the Greekes can in the singular. And so little doth the
Syriack make of this difference of number in the two Evangelists,
that hee translateth it just crosse, <hi>Matthews</hi> plurall in the singular,
and <hi>Lukes</hi> singular in the plurall.</p>
                     <p>About the opening of the Heavens or the manner of the same, as
it is of farre more consequence to inquire, so is it of difficulty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
because of diversity of opinions, and probabilities severall
wayes.</p>
                     <p>First, Some deny the opening of the heavens at all, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that Christ saw them opened, and the Holy Ghost descending,
intellectually onely, or by spirituall vision, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
opened, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 2. But this exposition is very improper, for
<hi>John</hi> saw the same also, and the descending of the Holy Ghost was
in a bodily shape and not imaginary, and the voyce was articulate
and Audible, and not visionary.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Others deny also the opening of the Heavens, but with
another manner of evasion, and exposition. For there was, say
they, no scissure or parting of the Heavens asunder, because they
are incorruptible, but a great, glorious, and miraculous light shone
round about Christ, as if the very highest heaven had been open,
and the light thereof imparted cleerely to the earth: But this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
also is confuted by the word that <hi>Marke</hi> useth, differing from
the other two. For though the phrase, <hi>The Heavens were opened,</hi>
would admit of such a Metaphoricall or comparative exposition,
yet when <hi>Marke</hi> saith expressely, that the heavens were <hi>cloven,</hi> or
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52154:117"/>
parted asunder, for so is his word in the Originall, [the Syriack
expresseth it by the very same word that the Chaldee Paraphrast u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. for parting of the house] it inforceth us to look
for a literal interpretation in it, and not a tropicall.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Aquinas</hi> evadeth the reall opening of them with this
glosse stranger then both the other, and by another intellectuall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
then that that was spoken of before: For it may also bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
saith hee, of an intellectuall vision, namely, that Christ [bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ow sanctifyed] saw heaven open unto men. But this
exposition the word of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> newly mentioned, confuteth
much more then it did the other.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Marke</hi> therefore tying us to a literall sense, and to
understand a reall and proper cleaving of the Heavens indeed, the
doubt now onely resteth, what heaven it was, whether the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>reall
or Aethereall, for so are the heavens properly distinguished, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the significancy of the Hebrew word <hi>Shamaiim,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
a duality, or a thing doubled. <hi>Answer.</hi> It was onely the
Aereall, for that is called Heaven, and the Firmament, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 8. 20.
as may bee confirmed by these reasons:</p>
                     <p>First, Because there needed no further scissure in the Heavens, then
the renting of the clouds in the middle Region, either for the descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Holy Ghost, or of the voyce, or for the satisfying of
the eyes and eares of the spectators, and hearers, that they came from
Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Because the Scripture in other places speaking of things
which came but out of the clouds, yet useth the very same terme to
expresse the clouds by, that is used here, namely <hi>Heaven:</hi> As, The
Lord that gave the Law out of a cloud, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 16. is said to have
spoken from Heaven, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 22. So the like voyce to this here,
that came out of a cloud, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 35. yet is said to come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. And <hi>Elias</hi> that by his prayer shut up the clouds,
that there was no rain, is said to have shut up heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 25.
The opening of the Heavens then was the renting of the clouds, as
wee see them rent, when the lightning comes forth, and out of that
rent came the Holy Ghost in visible shape, and the heavenly voyce.
And thus did the Gospell or Preaching of Christ begin with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of the Heavens which the Law had shut, and thus were the
heavens shaken, when the desire of all Nations came first to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52154:118"/>
openly, as <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 6, 7. The very same difference of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that is betwixt Saint <hi>Marke</hi> and the other Evangelists, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Hebrew, and the Lxx. in <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 1. for the Originall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

maketh it past deniall, that hee saw the opening of the heavens; but
the word <hi>to him</hi> in this place must bee reserved and referred in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
peculiarity to Christ, and the opening of the Heavens <hi>to him,</hi>
importeth a more emphaticall propriety then their opening to his
sight. For, the Syntax and Grammaticall construction that <hi>Marke</hi>
useth, maketh it impossible to fix the words <hi>to him,</hi> any other wayes
then upon Christ: <hi>And straightway,</hi> saith hee, <hi>comming up out of the

propriety of the words, that the heaven was opened to our Saviour,
and yet since it was also opened to the sight of <hi>John,</hi> it doth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
inforce u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to understand it otherwise then onely to his view
or beholding, namely, to his prayer: as the phrase is used by him
himselfe, <hi>Knocke, and it shall bee opened unto you.</hi> For had the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist
intended onely to shew how hee saw this apertion in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
hee might have joyned <hi>John</hi> with him in the same sight; but
hee would give us to understand by the phrase that hee hath used
singularly of Christ alone, that the heavens were not onely opened
to his sight, but for his sake. And from hence may bee confirmed what
was spoken before concerning his prayer, namely, that it aimed at
such a thing, as <hi>Elias</hi> prayed, and the heaven was opened and fire
came down upon his Sacrifice. Thus heaven that was shut to the
first <hi>Adam,</hi> because of his sin, is opened to the second, because of his
righteousnesse, and to all that by faith are partakers of it.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Mark. 1. Ver. 10. Hee saw the heavens cloven.</head>
                     <p>This is to bee understood as that before, of Christ onely, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:52154:118"/>
the same sense, or to the same purport. But since it is certaine
that <hi>John</hi> saw this as well as hee, as is also observed before, and
yet none of the three Evangelists that record the Story, have given
any undoubted or plaine evidence of any such a thing; it may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be questioned whether the rest of the people which were there
present did see this sight as well as <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>John. Theophylact</hi> is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
in the affirmative; For <hi>all of them,</hi> saith hee, <hi>saw the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
comming upon Jesus, lest they should thinke that the voice, This is my
beloved Sonne, had been spoken concerning</hi> John; <hi>but upon the sight of
the holy Ghost they might beleeve that that voice was concerning Christ.</hi>
And of this opinion are very many others with him, and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veile;
for who could conceive any other thing? And yet upon the
weighing of these Reasons following, wee may very well bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to beleeve the contrary, or that this Heavenly specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and divine voice was conspicuous and audible to none, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>John.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, because <hi>John</hi> after this doth himselfe tell those that were
present at this time, that there had stood one among them, but they
knew him not, that that was hee that was to come after him. For
the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 26. must of necessity bee rendred in
its preterperfect signification; for <hi>John</hi> spake not those words till
after Christ was baptized and gone, for hee was at that time in his
temptation in the wildernesse.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, because Christ himselfe also telleth the Jewes, that
they had never heard his Fathers voice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 37. and among those to
whom he speaketh, were divers that had imbraced the doctrine and
baptisme of <hi>John, Ver.</hi> 35. and it may very well bee supposed, some
that were present at his baptisme at this very time. The maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the contrary Opinion have spied this scruple and difficulty
arising upon that Text, and have gone about to salve it, but with a
very improper and dangerous plaister: holding that though they
heard this voice, yet they heard not the voice of the Father, but
of an Angell which spake in his name, which shall bee examined by
and by.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is improbable that when Christ had such another
testimony from Heaven at his transfiguration, that he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
it from nine of his Disciples, and charge the three silence that
heard it, and saw what was done, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 9. and yet should let

                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:52154:120"/>
this voice and vision from Heaven bee so publike, as to bee heard and
seen of all the people.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>John</hi> himselfe telleth that this Revelation was given
chiefly, if not onely, for his sake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 33.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the preaching of the Baptist was the meanes that God
had ordained to bring the people to the knowledge of Christ, <hi>John
1.</hi> 7. 31. and this Revelation, to bring the Baptist to it.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, had all the people been partakers of this sight and voice,
<hi>John</hi> had needed no more to have pointed Christ out, but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would have knowne him as well as hee, nor could the opinion
have ever prevailed, as it did, that valued <hi>John</hi> above him.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, when <hi>John</hi> shewed him forth with the singer, with <hi>Behold
the Lambe of God,</hi> presently Disciples followeed him, which they
would have done much more, had they thus seene and heard him,
pointed out from heaven; but it is plaine they did not the one, and
thereupon it may be boldly concluded that they did not the other.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, to which may be added, that God ordained preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
partly of <hi>John,</hi> partly of Christ himselfe, and partly of his
Disciples, the way to bring the world acquainted that hee was
Messias. And these divine revelations were for the instruction and
confirmation of them his preachers, who were chosen wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
for such a purpose, that they thereupon might the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
confirm the people. And hereupon it is observable, that
while the Baptist was at liberty, our Saviour contented himselfe
with his testimony and preaching, but whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> he was shut up, then
instantly chose he others.</p>
                     <p>Now if any doubt of the possibility of this, and question how
could <hi>John</hi> see and heare these things, and the other company that
was present not doe so as well as hee: The answer may bee readily
given by example of <hi>Elishaes</hi> servant, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 17. and the two
men that went to <hi>Emmau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, Luke</hi> 24. For the mountaine was full of
Horses, and Chariots of fire, and <hi>Elisha</hi> perceived them, but his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
did not till his eyes were opened in a more speciall manner.
And Christ it is like was in the same shape and appearance upon the
way when they knew him not that he was in the house when they
did, but til then their eyes were holden. Yet if any one will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that the people saw the flashing of the opened Heaven, and
heard the noice of the voice that came from thence, and tooke the

one for lightening, and the other for thunder, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 29. we will
not oppose it, for now was the season of the yeere fit for lightning
and thunder: but that either they saw the holy Ghost, or distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
the words of the voice, any more then <hi>Pauls</hi> companions
did, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 7. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 9. the reasons alledged doe

kind of difference of speech betwixt what goeth before about the

that hee speaketh thus. <hi>And Jesus being baptized went straightway out

                     <head>SS. The Holy Ghost descended.</head>
                     <p>This descending of the Holy Ghost was, first, partly for the sake
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52154:122"/>
of <hi>John,</hi> for this token had been given him, when hee first began
to preach and baptize, whereby to know Christ when hee should
come, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 33.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, partly for Christ, that hee might thus receive his
consecration and institution for the Office that hee was now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon, the preaching of the Gospell. This was as his anointing
to install him into his function, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes were with
materiall oyle to enter them into theirs, as <hi>Isa. 61. 1. The Spirit
of the Lord is upon mee, therefore hath hee anointed mee, hee hath sent mee
to Preach the Gospel.</hi> And,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, partly for the businesse and matter that was now to goe
in hand, namely, Christ beginning to preach accordingly. For,</p>
                     <p>First, the Gospel is the Spirituall Kingdom and Scepter of Christ,
in and by which hee was to rule all Nations for ever, and therefore
it was agreeable that the Spiritualnesse of that should bee sealed and
confirmed by the holy Spirits, shewing himselfe even in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it. The carnall rites of <hi>Moses</hi> were now to vanish, and his
corporall and ceremoniall observances to bee changed into a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
worship: and neither at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> nor at mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> nor
elsewhere, must there bee any more adoration, with fleshly and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ceremoniousnesse, but hee that will worship God must worship
him in spirit, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 21. Therefore it is no wonder, if the Holy
Ghost do now reveale himselfe, now when his sway of spirituality,
and dominion, by sanctification is to begin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Holy Ghost was departed from <hi>Israel,</hi> after the
death of the last Prophets, as was observed before, and now hee is
to bee restored againe, therefore himselfe commeth visibly and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
at this his restoring, and lighteth upon him to whom it
belonged to give and distribute the gifts of the Spirit, to whom
hee pleased. For as <hi>John</hi> had told that Christ should baptize with
the Holy Ghost, so is that power and priviledge now sealed unto
him in the sight of <hi>John,</hi> when the Holy Ghost commeth down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him and there abideth.</p>

this his presence upon earth, in such or such a place, by some

                     <head>SS. In a bodily shape.</head>
                     <p>First, It was convenient that the Holy Ghost should reveale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
at this time: First, for the sake of <hi>John,</hi> who was to have
a sensible signe, whereby to informe him which was the <hi>Messias,</hi> as
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In regard of the Holy Ghost himselfe, whose worke
in the Church was now in a more speciall and frequent manner
to bee shewed under the Gospel, namely, that hee might bee expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and revealed to bee a personall substance, and not an operation
of the Godhead onely, or qualitative vertue. For qualities, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
and acts cannot assume bodily shapes, nor ought but what
is in it selfe substantiall.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That a full and cleere, yea, even a sensible demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Trinity might bee made at this beginning of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
For it may bee observed in Scripture, that the Holy Ghost
hath a speciall regard to expresse this mystery upon singular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that we might learne to acknowledge the three Persons in
one Godhead, as hee also doth the two natures of Christ, that wee
might acknowledge them in one person. So the very first thing
that is taught in all the Bible, is this very mystery: For when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:52154:123"/>
beginneth the story of the creation, hee beginneth also to teach
that the three Persons in the Trinity were co-workers in it. <hi>God
Created,</hi> there is the Father. <hi>God said,</hi> there is the Word, or the
Sonne. <hi>And the Spirit of God moved,</hi> there is the Holy Ghost. And
the very same mystery is intimated by the Prophet, treating upon
the very same Subject, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 5. Thus saith God the Lord, hee
that created the Heavens, and <hi>they</hi> that stretched them out: That
wee might learne, that <hi>Of him, through him, and to him,</hi> the Father,
Sonne, and Holy Ghost, <hi>are all things, Rom.</hi> 11. 36. So <hi>Moses</hi> also
when hee is to teach concerning the creation of man, hee first teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that it was the Trinity that created him. <hi>Gen. 1. 26. And God
said, Let us make man after our Image.</hi> Hee saith, <hi>Let us,</hi> to shew the
Trinity of Persons: and hee saith, <hi>In our Image,</hi> not in <hi>our Images,</hi>
to shew the unity of essence; That every man, even from the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the story of his Creation might learn to remember his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
in the dayes of his youth, as <hi>Solomon</hi> with the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Boraiecha,</hi> answereth the same mystery, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 1. So likewise at
the confusion of tongues the Trinity is expressed, <hi>Gen. 11. 7. Let us</hi>
goe down and confound their language: as it is also at the gift of
tongues, <hi>I</hi> will send <hi>the Comforter</hi> from <hi>the Father, Joh. 15. 26. Act.
1.</hi> 4. Such a one also was the blessing pronounced by the Priest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the people, when hee dismissed them from the daily service of
the Temple, in the name of the Trinity, <hi>Num.</hi> 6. 24, 25, 26. the
name <hi>Jehovah</hi> or <hi>the Lord,</hi> three times repeated, for denotation of
the three Persons, as <hi>Paul</hi> explaineth it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. When <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
also beginneth to rehearse the Law to <hi>Israel,</hi> and to explaine it,
the first thing hee teacheth them is the Trinity in Unity, and Unity
in Trinity, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 4. Heare O Israel, <hi>the Lord, our God, the Lord,</hi> is
one. Three words answering the three Persons, and the middle
word <hi>our God,</hi> deciphering fitly the second, who assumed our nature,
as is well observed by <hi>Galatinus.</hi> To these may bee added, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of <hi>Moses</hi> his revelation with the name of the Lord, three
times rehearsed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6. The Vision of <hi>Esay</hi> with three <hi>Holies,
Isa.</hi> 6. 3. The beginning of <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. and of <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. and many,
again of the like nature, which the heedfull reader will observe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
How fitting then was it that at the beginning of the new world,
and the new Law, and the baptism of Christ, the three Persons should
be revealed, especially since he ordained baptism to be administred in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52154:124"/>
their names Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the
Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.</p>

                        </gap> a Dove.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is thought by</hi> Austin, <hi>and after him by</hi> Aquinas, <hi>that this was
a very living Dove, not of the flock indeed of common Doves, but
immediately created by God for this purpose, but created as true a
living Dove, as any of them: and the reason they give for this their
opinion is this.</hi> Because it is not to bee said that Christ alone had a true
body, and that the Holy Ghost appeared deceiveably to the eyes of men, but
that both those are to bee said to bee true bodies: for as it was not fit that
the Sonne of God should deceive men, so was it not fit that the Holy Ghost
should deceive them neither. But it was no difficulty to the Creator of all
things, to make a true body of a Dove, without the helpe of other Doves,
as it was not hard for him to frame a true body in the wombe of the Virgin
without the seed of man. <hi>So they, too punctuall where there is no
necessity, nor indeed any great probability. For,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, what needed there a reall living Dove, when an apparent
onely would serve the turne? For the descending of the Dove was,
that there might bee a visible domonstration of the Holy Ghost his
resting upon Christ, and anoynting him for his Ministration: so
that the visibility of the Spirit was as much as was required, and
there needed no reality of a living body.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Text saith expressely in all the Evangelists, that it
was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>like</hi> or <hi>as it were a Dove;</hi> which plainly sheweth the
similitude to such a thing; and not the being of the very thing it
selfe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In apparitions of the like nature, when the furthest
end of the body appearing, was but for visibility, the bodies that
were seen, were not of the very existency and nature of those that
they represented, but of another. As the Angels that appeared in
humane shapes, had not very living humane bodies, but onely bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
assumed and framed to such a representation: And so the fire
in the bush, on <hi>Sinai,</hi> and with the cloven tongues, was not very
reall fire, but onely a visible resemblance of it, and the like must
bee held of this Dove, or else it will bee such an apparition as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was before, nor since.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:52154:124"/>
Fourthly, The parallell betwixt the appearing of our Saviour,
in humane flesh, and the appearing of the Holy Ghost, in a living
Dove, is not onely very improper, but also somewhat dangerous.
For if they appeared alike, then may the holy Ghost hee said to bee
a very Dove [for Christ was a very man,] and that were impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and in its kind, to bee incarna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, [for Christ was incarnate,]
and that is dangerous. And,</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, as for fallacy or deceiving there could bee none, no more
then there had been in all other apparitions since the world began,
since in such things, the veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> and reality of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ody that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
was not looked after, but onely the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that lay hid under that body.</p>
                     <p>Now reasons why the holy Ghost appeared in the shape of a
Dove, rather then of any other creature, are conceived, some to
have concerned Christ, some to have concerned the Holy Ghost
himselfe, and some to have concerned man. As,</p>
                     <p>First, to shew Christs innocency, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly, to shew the like graces of the holy Ghost; and <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>

in those that are baptized.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, to answer the figure in <hi>Noahs</hi> flood; for as a Dove did
at that time bring tidings of the abating of the waters, so doth it
now of the abating of the wrath of God upon the preaching of
the Gospell. These are the common and most current reasons that

It is enough. What is the reason? Because in them it revealed the end of the
Messias.</hi> In <hi>Megillah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now here it may bee doubly questioned: First, why they called
it <hi>Bath Kol, The Daughter of a voyce,</hi> and not a voyce it selfe? And
secondly, whether this voyce that wee have in hand, were such a
voyce as that or no? To the first, if the strictnesse of the Hebrew
word <hi>Bath</hi> bee to bee stood upon, which it alwayes is not, it may
bee answered, that it is called the <hi>Daughter of a voyce,</hi> in relation to
the Oracle of <hi>Vrim and Thummim:</hi> for whereas that was a voyce
given from off the Mercy Seate, within the vaile, and this upon the
decay of that Oracle, came as it were in its place, it might not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly,
nor unproperly bee called a <hi>Daughter,</hi> or successor of that voyce.
But to the second, and which is more materiall and pertinent to the
subject in hand, it may bee answered, that this voyce was not of the
nature of their <hi>Bath Kol,</hi> upon these two reasons.</p>
                     <p>First, because this voyce came descendingly from heaven, but their
<hi>Bath Kol</hi> cannot bee proved to have descended; or at least to have
constantly come from heaven. For the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> hinc, which gave
warning of the destruction of the City, came not from above, but
from the Temple, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 6. And this can hardly bee denyed to
have been one of their <hi>Bath Kol</hi> voyces: And if wee will beleeve the
Jewish Authours in every place where they give examples of this
their <hi>Bath Kol,</hi> it will appeare rather to bee such a voyce as came to
<hi>Samuel,</hi> which was so farre from a perpendicular descending, that
hee could not distinguish whether it were the call of <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, because, whereas the Jewes repute their <hi>Bath Kol,</hi> both
the last and the lowest kind of divine revelation among them, this
kinde of a voyce from heaven, was both ancient, as <hi>Gen. 21.
17.</hi> and 22. 11. and also most honourable, <hi>Exod. 20. 22. Deut. 4.

by God for that purpose, which some do hold, is not onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52154:126"/>
was the age of the Priests, when they entred their Office, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. 3.
the age of <hi>Joseph,</hi> when hee came to promotion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 46. and
the age of <hi>David,</hi> when hee began to Reigne, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 4. Now how
this is to bee understood is some controversie: Some there are that
take it thus, that <hi>Jesus</hi> was now fully and perfectly thirty: Others
thus, that hee now beganne or drew on to bee full thirty, and so
preaching three yeeres and six moneth, that hee dyed at thirty three
yeeres old and an halfe.</p>
                     <p>But this interpretation, the phrase used by the Evangelist, and the
common and ordinary manner of the Scriptures reckoning of the
ages of men, and of other things doth sufficiently contradict: For,</p>
                     <p>First, in that <hi>Luke</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, hee was baptized,
<hi>beginning to bee as it were thirty:</hi> the word <hi>beginning to bee,</hi> denyeth
his <hi>being</hi> thirty compleat; and the word <hi>as it were,</hi> denyeth his
<hi>drawing</hi> upon thirty compleate likewise: For if hee were <hi>full</hi> thirty,
then hee <hi>beganne</hi> not to bee so: and if hee were drawing on to <hi>full</hi>
thirty, then was hee not drawing to <hi>as it were</hi> thirty, but to thirty
indeed. By the phrase therefore, is to bee understood, that hee was
now nine and twenty yeeres of age compleat, and just now entring
upon his thirtieth: and this the Evangelist hinteth so clearely, that
it needeth not much confirmation: For that hee was in his thirty
current and not compleated, is plaine by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>as it were</hi> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that is, thirty yeeres old, after a certain reckoning: and that
hee was but now entring upon this his thirty current, is as plain by
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>hee began</hi> but to bee so.</p>
                     <p>To which also, secondly, may bee added the common and current
use of Scripture in reckoning of ages, either of men or beasts, to
account the yeere which they are now passing, for a yeere of their
age, bee it never so newly or lately begun: Examples of this it is
needlesse to give, the thing is so usuall and obvious to every eye.</p>
                     <p>So that now to take up the times of the world, and of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
according to this computation, they result to this.</p>
                     <p>First, That since hee was borne in the yeere of the world 3928.
<hi>stilo veteri,</hi> but newly begunne, hee was baptized in the yeere of the
world 3957. but newly begunne, by the same stile likewise.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That since hee was borne in <hi>Tisri,</hi> hee was also bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in <hi>Tisri.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That since his last residence in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to his first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52154:127"/>
publickly in the worke of the Gospell, were full seven and
twenty yeeres: all which time hee had lived either in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the
Town of his Mother, or in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> the Town of his supposed
Father, and so his birth in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> is utterly grown out of the
thoughts and observation of the people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly, That hee hath now three yeeres and a halfe to labour
in the Gospell from his Baptisme to his crucifying,</hi> Rabbi Janna
<hi>said,</hi> Three yeeres and a halfe the glory of God stood upon Mount Olivet,
and preached, <hi>saying,</hi> Seek the Lord while hee may bee found, call upon
him while hee is neere. <hi>Midr. Tillin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That hee lived but two and thirty yeeres and an halfe:
and that his thirtyeth yeere was the first yeere of his preaching, and
not the last yeere of his private life. Compare the date of <hi>Davids</hi>
Reign in <hi>Hierusalem, 1 Chro. 29. 27. The time that David Reigned over
Israel, was forty yeeres: Seven yeeres reigned hee in Hebron, and thirty

                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That if <hi>Hierusalem</hi> were destroyed exactly forty yeeres
after our Saviours death, as it is apparent it was, both in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
and Heathen Stories, then that destruction of it befell just in the
foure thousandth yeer of the world, and so as the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi>

it bee not an error in the Text, and were not a miscarriage in the
Evangelist, to reckon a man for an ancestor of Christ, that the world
never saw, or that never was upon the earth.</p>

of <hi>Cainan,</hi> and from whence hee took it, namely from the Greek
Bible, or the Septuagint, which hath inserted it in those places of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
that are alledged; but when this is resolved, the greater scruple
is yet behind, of his warrantablenesse so to doe, and of the purity of
the Text, where it is so done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="209" facs="tcp:52154:128"/>
The Seventy translatours indeed read <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 24. thus, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaxad
begat Cainan, and Cainan begat Sala, and Sala begat Eber.</hi>
And in Chap. 11. they say, <hi>Arphaxad lived 135 yeeres, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
Cainan, And Cainan lived 130 yeeres and begat Sala, and Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan
lived after hee begat Sala 330 yeeres.</hi> And from hence hath
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> without controversie taken in <hi>Cainan</hi> into this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy,
a man that never was in the world, but the warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
of this insertion will require divers considerations to
find it out. As let the Reader bee pleased seriously to rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
upon these.</p>
                     <p>First, That the Seventy Translatours did that worke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly,
and for feare: For the Scripture was the treasure of
the Jewes, which made them more glorious then any Nation
under heaven. Therefore to communicate this their riches
to the Heathen, whom they abominated and detested, was as
much against their heart as what was most. So that had not
the feare of the power of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> brought them to the worke
of the Translation, more than their own good will, there had
been no such thing done. <hi>Ptolomy Lagus,</hi> the Father of <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Philadelphus,</hi> for whom they translated, had carryed away
an hundred thousand Jewes captive into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as saith <hi>Ariste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
so that the feare and dread of that house lay upon them,
that they durst deny it nothing, which otherwise they
would most vehemently have done such a thing as this, to have
communicated their Scriptures to the Heathen in a vulgar
tongue.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Translation then being undertaken for feare,
and with so ill a will [that as <hi>Aristeas,</hi> who was present at
the worke, saith, the Translatours were very unwilling to goe
for <hi>Aegypt,</hi> though hee interpret it, because loath to goe from
<hi>Eliazar</hi> the high Priest] and that the Jewes kept a mournfull fast
every yeere, sorrowing for that work of the Translation. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee expected that the Translation will bee done with any
more fidelity, then barely what will keepe the Translators out
of danger.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Therefore they strive as much as they can, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
the Truth and treasure of the Scripture from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52154:129"/>
and as much as they dare to delude them. Their chiefe
meanes for this, is to use an unpricked Bible, in which the
words written without vowels, might be bended divers wayes,
and into divers senses, and different from the meaning of the
Originall, and yet if the translation were questioned, they
might pricke or vowell the word, so as to agree to their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation.
How they have dealt in this kind, there is none that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
laid the Hebrew Bible, and the Septuagint together, but hath
observed.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Their differences from the Originall which
were innumerable, were partly of ignorance, they themselves
not being able to read the Text alway true in a Copy unvowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
But this ignorance was also voluntary in them, they not
caring to mistake, so that they might doe it with their own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
                     <p>Their generall care was, that since of necessity they must tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
the Bible, as little of it might bee imparted and revealed by
the translation as was possible.</p>
                     <p>Their particular and speciall heed was also, that those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Text, which is translated Literally, or according
to the true meaning, might prove dangerous any wayes to the
Nation of the Jewes, or bring them into distaste with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
King for whom they translated, should bee so tempered and
qualifyed that no hazzard might arise, nor any such matter
might bee seen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly, It was a common speech among the Jewes, and
rang ordinarily in their Schooles, and Pulpits,</hi> That the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
soules of Jacobs family, that went downe into Aegypt, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent,
or answerable in worth to all the seventy Nations of the
world.</p>
                     <p>This was a dangerous doctrine for the Jewes, if it should
come to bee knowne, (as it could not choose but bee) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
when their puissant enemies should finde the numbers
agreeable, of seventy Soules, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. and seventy Nations, <hi>Gen.
10.</hi> To prevent any such danger, the Translators thought it
a sure way, to spoile the just number in both places, and so
they did reckon seventy five soules, and seventy two nations,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52154:129"/>
both which accounts are followed by Saint <hi>Luke, Act.</hi> 7. and in this
place.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The severall persons reckoned <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. Every one of
which was the Father and originall of a severall Nation, be just se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty.
The Translators to spoyle the summe, which night prove
perilous, have added two more, and both of the same name, <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi>
the one the immediate sonne of <hi>Sem,</hi> the other his Grandchilde,
or the sonne of <hi>Arphaxad.</hi> For ver. 22 of that Chapter, they read
thus. <hi>The sonnes of Sem were Elam, and Ashur, and Arphaxad, and
Lud, and Aram, and Cainan.</hi> and ver. 24. thus, <hi>Arphaxad begat Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,
and Cainan begat Sala.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which additions, these two things are very observable.</p>
                     <p>First, The place where they have thrust in these two men: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so close to <hi>Sem,</hi> as could not possibly bee closer, unlesse they
would have had him to have had two sonnes of the same name,
<hi>Cainan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The name it selfe, that they have thus chosen twice
over, namely <hi>Cainan,</hi> which signifyeth <hi>mourning</hi> or <hi>lamenting.</hi> So
<hi>Enosh</hi> called his sonne, <hi>Gen</hi> 5. 9. Because of the lamentable corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion in those times: And it is without doubt, the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators
in the iterated choyce of this word, or heavy and dolefull
name, intended to shew some inward sorrow: the cause of which
may bee best imagined, by laying the name, and the place of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>The blessing of <hi>Noah</hi> upon <hi>Japhet, God shall inlarge Japhet, and
hee shall dwell in the tents of Sem, Gen.</hi> 2. 27. The Jewes themselves
of old, understood, to aime at the Greeke tongue, <hi>viz.</hi> that God
should use that as a meanes for the admission of the Heathen to the
secrets and mysteries of the Jewes Religion. This was their vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all times, to heare, or to thinke of the Gentiles being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as appeares by <hi>Jonah,</hi> Chap. 4. 1. by the <hi>Nazarites, Luk.</hi> 4. 28.
and by them of <hi>Jerusalem, Act.</hi> 22. 21, 22. For <hi>Moses</hi> had plainly
told them, that their calling in, should bee the others casting off,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 21.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, it could not but bee a most vehement sorrow, and
maine vexation to these Translators, that they, perforce, and so sore
against their wills, must bee made the instruments, by translating

of <hi>Sem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This sorrow, as their Nation expressed by a mournfull Fast, so
did they themselves among other things, by a <hi>lamenting</hi> and <hi>sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
name, <hi>Cainan</hi> twice over, put in so close to <hi>Sem,</hi> as if they
called on him to mourn with them, because his tents were now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locking
for the entrance of the Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, God using the Septuagint, as the Key for admission
of the Heathen, and as an Harbinger to the New Testament, left it
not there, but therein used it also in allegations from the Old, yet
oftentimes differing from the letter of the same, but never without
speciall reason.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> as hee followed the Doctour of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> so hee wrote his Gospell for the Gentiles: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whereas <hi>Matthew</hi> writing his for the Jewes, deriveth the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy,
but from <hi>Abraham</hi> the first Father of the Jewes, This E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist
writing for the Gentiles, fetcheth the Line from <hi>Adam,</hi> the
common Father of all, both Jewes and Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>This is the aime and scope of this Genealogy, and the reason why
it is set at Christs Baptisme:</p>
                     <p>First, To shew that there was no distinction of persons in the
promise given to <hi>Adam,</hi> for all Nations were then equally in his
loynes: for this, the holy line runnes down to him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That therefore all Nations have equall interest in the
<hi>Messias,</hi> and that in the preaching of the Gospell, which Christ
beganne from his Baptisme, there should bee no difference of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
made, as there was before. This being the intent of the Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
placing here, as the very placing of it doth inevitably evince,
it is not onely warrantable, but also admirably divine, that <hi>Luke</hi>
taketh in <hi>Cainan</hi> from the Seventy.</p>
                     <p>For first, writing for Heathens, hee must follow the heathens Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in his quotations.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In Genealogies hee was to bee a Coppier, not a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and chiefely, In following this insertion of the Lxx.
hee imbraceth not their error, but divinely draweth us to looke at
their intent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:52154:131"/>
When <hi>Jude</hi> mentioneth <hi>Michaels</hi> striving with <hi>Satan</hi> about
the body of <hi>Moses,</hi> hee approveth not the story as true, which
hee knew to bee but a Talmudick Parable: but from the Jews
own Authors, hee useth this as an argument against them, and
for their instruction.</p>
                     <p>So though <hi>Luke</hi> from the Lxx, the Bible of the Heathen,
have alledged <hi>Cainan</hi> the sonne of <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> hee alledgeth
it not as the truth more then the Hebrew, but from the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagints</hi>
owne authority, or from the matter which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
in distaste of the calling of the Heathen, hee maketh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
use and instruction to the Heathen concerning their
calling.</p>
                     <p>First, they put in two men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. that they might dissemble
their arrogating of singularity above all Nations, and to make
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> beleeve, that there was no such distinction of people
held by them: [but they thought otherwise.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Luke</hi> reserves the one of these in his pedegree (for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could not come in it,) to teach the Gentiles really, what
they did in dissimulation, that there was no such distinction
of Nations in the sight of God, even the Lxx. themselves being
witnesses.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They used a mournfull name for the men whom
they inserted, in detestation of the comming in of the Gentiles;
<hi>Luke</hi> reserves this also for the comfort of the Gentiles, which
were now to bee called in: To teach them from the Jewes own
confession, that the divulging of the Gospell in vulgar langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
should bring <hi>Japhet</hi> into the tents of <hi>Sem:</hi> which thing
was now ready to beginne, when Christ at his baptisme is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
to preach the Gospell, and to send it abroad to bee
preached both to Jew and Gentile. And what the Lxx. in their
<hi>Cainan</hi> sorrowed to see afarre off, <hi>Luke</hi> in his <hi>Cainan</hi> calls to
behold now with comfort neere at hand.</p>
                     <p>Thus are the Censers of <hi>Korah</hi> and his company though
ordained for an evill end by them, yet reserved in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
for a good by the command of God.</p>
