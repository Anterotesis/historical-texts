            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT was the ſaying of our Bleſſed Lord to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Jews,</hi> in the caſe of Tribute, <hi>Render to</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſar'<hi>s, and to God, the things that are God's.</hi> As this diſtinction ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by all Men, in the Conduct of their lives, ſo the KING has given Us an Illuſtrious Example in His own Perſon that excites Us to it; For while HE was a Subject, HE gave <hi>Caeſar</hi> His Tribute; and now HE is a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> gives GOD his Due, <hi>(viz) The Sovereignty over Conſciences.</hi> It were a great ſhame then, for any <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-Man</hi> (that pretends to <hi>Chriſtanity,</hi>) not to give GOD his Due. By this Grace HE has relieved His Diſtreſſed Subjects from Their Cruel Sufferings, and raiſed to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a New and Laſting Empire, by adding Their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Their Duty. <hi>And We Pray GOD to continue the</hi> KING <hi>in this Noble Reſolution</hi>; For HE is now upon a Principle, that has good <hi>Nature, Chriſtianity,</hi> and the goodneſs of <hi>Civil Society</hi> on its ſide, a Security to Him beyond all the little <hi>Arts of Government.</hi>

            <p>Now, ſince the KING's Mercy and Goodneſs have reached to Us throughout the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and Principality of <hi>Wales</hi>; Our General <hi>Aſſembly</hi> from all thoſe parts, met at <hi>London</hi> about Our <hi>Church-Affairs</hi> has appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Us to Wait upon the KING with Our Humble Thanks, and Me to Deliver them; Which I do by this ADDRESS, with all the Affection and Reſpect of a Dutiful Subject.</p>
