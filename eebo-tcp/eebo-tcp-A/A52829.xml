         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DECLARATION OF WAR, By the <hi>States-General</hi> againſt the <hi>French, Hague, March</hi> 12. 1689.</head>
            <p>THat the States-General being in perfect Peace and Tranquillity in the Year 1672, with ſuch an entire Confidence in the Treatles of Peace, Friendſhip and Alliance Eſtabliſhed between the French King and this State, That they were unprovided of whatever might ſerve for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt ſo powerful a King, not being able to imagine that the ſaid King, without any juſt cauſe, would break the ſaid Treaties, were yet contrary to all expectation fallen upon with ſo ſudden and heavy a War, that the State was in a ſhort time brought into great danger, and might have been entirely ſubverted, had they not reflected upon the Reaſons which the ſaid King Declared had mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the War, to wit, the Encreaſe of his Honour and Glory; and firmly truſted that Almighty God would not ſuffer their deſtruction, undertaken with ſo great Injuſtice, whereby they were encouraged in that deſperate ſtate of Affairs, under the prudent Conduct of his Highneſs the Prince of Orange, to ſtand our all extremities in the defence of the true Reformed Religion, their Liberty, &amp; Country; That it having pleaſed God to pour out his Mercies upon the State, after the ſpilling of much innocent Blood, &amp; the great ſuffering of the Inhabitants by the Cruelties of the French, a Treaty of Peace, Commerce, &amp; Navigation was Concluded in the year 1678. with the French King at Nimeguen: which the States on their part exactly &amp; religiouſly obſerved; but that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the French King ſoon after, by a publict Edict, laid heavy burthens upon the Commerce of the State, and endeavoured from time to time, by all manner of way, as well in, as out of Europe, to moleſt the ſame: fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the taking of their Ships and Goods, and ſought, as far as in him lay, as well directly as indirectly, entirely to ruine their ſaid Commerce and Navigation, cauſing even their Ships of War to be viſited by force, and ſome of them to be attack'd in time of Peace; That the ſaid King had finally by new Impoſitions and Vexations hindred the Inhabitants of theſe Countries from vending in France, their Manufactures, and product of their Fiſhery, and had on frivolous pretences laid ſuch great and unjuſt impoſitions upon their Trade, that it was impoſſible for them to continue it any longer; ſlighting with great contempt all the Inſtances made by the States on occaſion thereof, and denying their Ambaſſadors in France the Honour and Reſpect which they had always enjoyed; That the ſaid King having begun the Terrible Perſecution againſt thoſe of the Reformed Religion within his Kingdoms, had involved therein the Subjects of this State, reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there on account of their Trade, forcing Women from their Husbands, and Children from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and treating even the Conſuls of this State in a cruel and unheard of manner, contrary to the Law of Nations, and the expreſs Tenor of the Treaties; That the ſaid King had farther ſhewed his ill deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this State, by the continual motion of his Troops towards their Frontiers, thereby to oblige them to make extraordinary Preparations by Land and Sea, to the exhauſting of their Revenues; That he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with fair Words and ſolemn Aſſurances, and even by Overtures of an Alliance, endeavoured to amuſe them, but that when ever they went about to provide for their own ſecurity, and the farther ſtrengthning of the Treaty of Nimeguen, by making Defenſive Alliances with any of the Princes their Neighbours, He had always oppoſed them, &amp; even threatned them with a War on account thereof. Laſtly, that the ſaid King has in ful Peace cauſed the Ships, Goods, &amp; Perſons of the Subjects of this State who were reſiding in France, upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith of the Treaties, to be ſeized, and the Maſters and Seamen of the ſaid Ships to be impriſoned, and moſt babarouſly treated, to force them to change their Religion, and the ſaid Ships, Goods and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to be ſold, although it is expreſly ſtipulated by the Treaty of Commerce, that in caſe of a War, the Subjects on both ſides ſhall be allowed ſix months time to retire with their Goods, or otherwiſe to ſell or diſpoſe of them; which was followed with the plundering and burning of diverſe Villages within the Territories of this State; and afterwards with a Declaration of War, for which no other reaſon was given than that the States had made Extraordinary preparations by Land and Sea, although they had aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ured the ſaid King that they were only intended for their own neceſſary defence, and that they would not concern themſelves with the Election of Cologne; That the States having thus made manifeſt the Evil Deſigns and Machinarions of the French King againſt this State, do admoniſh their Subjects ſeriouſly to reflect upon the Treatment they are to expect from him in matter of their Religion, Liberty, Eſtates, and Perſons, and that they will call to mind the cruel Perſecution he has undertaken againſt his own Subjects, and in what manner the Towns and Places, who thought they had ſurrendred upon good Conditions have been Treated, and whole Countries deſtroyed which his Troops have been forced to quit. Upon all theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and for the preſervation of their Religion, and Liberty and the repairing the Injuries ther Subjects have ſo unjuſtly ſuffered, the ſaid States do Declare War againſt the ſaid King of France, and all his Subjects Countries and Dominions, both by Sea and Land, ſtrictly commanding. 1. That none of the Inhabitants of this State, or any Forreigner reſiding within their Territories, ſhall tranſport any thing to France that's uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in War, or Correſpond with the French to the prejudice of the State. 2. That all Contraband Goods which ſhall be taken going to France, ſhall be declared Prize. 3. That good ſecurity ſhall be given by all perſons car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying any Contraband Goods out of theſe Countries, that they are not deſigned for France. 4. That all ſhips laden with contraband goods as ſhall be found on the French coaſts ſhall be taken for good prize. 5. That all ſhips ought to have lawful Paſs-ports. 6. The Men of War not to moleſt any Ships having ſuch Paſs-ports, and not being bound with any Contraband Goods to any Ports in France. 7. That ſuch as ſhall be found offending here-In, ſhall be puniſhed with Confiſcation of Ship and Goods. 8. That the Commanders of the Ships of War ſhall punctually govern themſelves in this matter according to the Treaties made in relation thereunto, with other Kings, Princes, and States. 9. That the Admiralties ſhall have the Cogniſance of theſe Offences. 10. 11, 12. The Moneys ariſing by ſuch Confiſcations ſhall be diſpoſed of, as has been heretofore practiſed in like Caſes; And as to the Seiſure, &amp;c. former Placaers to be obſerved. 13. None of the Inhabitants of this State ſhall Inſure any French Ships or Goods, or others bound to France, on Forfeiture of the Sum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured.</p>
