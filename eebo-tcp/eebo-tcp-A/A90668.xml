            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>From this ſeparation which Chriſt made with his Church, it comes to paſſe, that there are no more any legitimat children engendred, to wit, holy men, and perſons truly honeſt: As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide, by the commerce ſhe hath with Adulterers, are generated ſuch Baſtards in Chriſtianity, as Hypocrites, in whoſe number the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> are underſtood, and others, who under a ſpecious vayle of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

Were it fitting for the <hi>Deity</hi> to wonder, I would without doubt much wonder at ſo great an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the perſon of the Eternall <hi>Word.</hi> I know well 'twas he, who for the love of his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> went under a ſervile ſhape, as far as upon the Croſſe, to expoſe his life, to gaine valuable merits to purchaſe her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.

to objects of privat intereſt, and temporall benefit. Profit and delight are the two Poles, wheron the Firmament of <hi>Roman</hi> deſigns doth wheel about. If Chriſt and his Law be embrac'd, it is not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd for the true finall end, but as means to compaſſe ſome terrene bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, which transform'd me to wonder, while I obſerv'd, how much <hi>Chriſt</hi> was vilified amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> conſidering how much he ſerves their turn for the increaſe of their temporall intereſts. You ſhall find all vices reduc'd in this City, as to their proper center, and which is worſe, blanch'd over with ſpecious titles of Holines.

               <p>Adulation hath founded here her Palace, for you ſhall hear it preach'd moſt impudently, that the <hi>Pope</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre, notwithſtanding, that his actions are the very topps of error. Tell me, O reverend Fryer, if the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot erre, wherfore are ther Decrees and Ordinances of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels inſtituted? 'Twere enough for every one to be regulated by his will only, without importuning any Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, or attending any rules from the univerſall conſent of Chriſtianity. But to unbowell unto you my true

God furgive them, who ſomenting a Paraſiticall Doctrin, introduce ſo many abuſes to Gods Houſe, ſo frontles and void of ſhame; Theſe being dandled with ambition, have tranſported Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Seat from <hi>caves,</hi> to <hi>thrones</hi> of gold. Theſe being carried away with avarice, do declare this magnificence to be neceſſary for the dignity of the Church, together with thoſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dominions, ſo expreſly forbidden by Chriſt. Poor Church, to what a caſe art thou reduc'd! The time was, when the Clergy were reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd for the ſanctity of their lives.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115379:38"/>
for the profoundnes of their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for the fame of their miracles.

Ther is no action exercis'd in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but you ſhall find it conjoyn'd with the intereſts of earthly emolument.

that he might only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd to a gentler gaole; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for his full liberty, he was forc'd to ſuffer the better part of his Eſtate to be confiſcated. But, feariug that by his appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> this act of mine might be too narrowly winnow'd, and ſo I might run a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the precipitation of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes not yet ſo firmly grounded, to ſecure my ſelf from after-claps, I cal'd him to me, and rebuking him for his coorſe carriage towards me at firſt, it made me, by right of that incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency I held over him, to reform all miſdemeanors, to teach him how to comply with Church-Governors for the future. In fine, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of his loſſes paſs'd, I made him a friendly promiſe, to point
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115379:46"/>
him out a way how he might be made capable to wear an <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick</hi> habit, and ſo aſcend to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a <hi>Prelat;</hi> for they under the <hi>Roman State,</hi> amongſt the multitudes of their miſeries, have no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort but this, that they may eaſily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to ſuch a condition as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to revenge upon ſome others the wrongs they receive themſelves.</p>
               <p>By theſe means I knew how to feather my neſt ſo well, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd afterwards to <hi>Rome,</hi> to live in the luſtre of a conſpicuous <hi>Prelat,</hi> by introducing into my houſe the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pomp and exces of the old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I parallel'd any other in orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of rich hangings, of magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Coaches, in number of Grooms and

Laquays, and ſpecially, in multitude of Courtiers, and gelded Muſitians; The greatnes of <hi>Rome</hi> being ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to ſhew her ſelf barbarous, yea, in the pomp of <hi>Eunuchs.</hi> Eleven youths did undergo the martyrdom of <hi>Origen,</hi> of purpoſe to devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the luxury of my pleaſures: Poor boyes, by what a ſtrange effect doth the luſts of others make you chaſt! While I did lead this ſplendid life, the Cardinall, my Protector, came to the Popedome. By this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, my hopes ſoar'd very high, nor did ther much time paſſe, when I ſaw my perſon, being a creature of the Popes, advanc'd to the dignity of the <hi>Hat;</hi> ſo I mounted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Cardinal,</hi> wherin I ſtand now. Now if my voice had ſtrength

to unmask every particular thing, you would be ſtruck with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to diſcover a life ſo impious in the perſons of them who glory in the title of Chriſts Diſciples. I'le tell you in a word, that from the time I obtain'd the Cardinalſhip, I never kept <hi>Lent,</hi> I never recited my <hi>howrs,</hi> I never confeſſed to God, but now, in theſe extreme agonies of my ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: Such being the cuſtom almoſt of all Cardinals, who finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a poſture to aſpire to the keyes of Heaven, do think perchance to be able one day to find a way to enter there, without any neceſsity of good works. But wo is me, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive now to have deviated from the way of Heaven; I diſcern too well by the light of <hi>divine</hi> grace (which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115379:48"/>
knows not by what exces of mercy may pleaſe to ſave me for all this) that to lead an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> life, as is now accuſtom'd, is nothing at all to live like a Chriſtian: But if <hi>Pagans,</hi> yea <hi>Atheiſts</hi> perceiving their own errors, have hopes to be ſaved, why ſhould I deſpair? This is the only argument of my hopes, although I think the ſalvation of an <hi>Infidell</hi> more eaſie, then that of a <hi>perverſe Christian;</hi> becauſe my ſoul finds at this very moment, that the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> is more eaſily illuminated, then the <hi>will</hi> humbled and rectified, being too tenacious of her delights in thoſe pleaſures, which ſhe muſt now relinquiſh with the <hi>Hat,</hi>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115379:50"/>
But the diſtaſts of this Prince requir'd further ſatisfaction; A fancy took him at laſt to return to <hi>Savoy,</hi> wher being come, he found the Court ſo rent into faction, by the domeſtick grudges betwixt the brother <hi>Tomaſo,</hi> the Coſin <hi>Mother,</hi> and the <hi>Tutres</hi> of the pupill <hi>Duke,</hi> that he concluded within himſelf, that ſome Princes may be born ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to find peace.

               <p>The title of <hi>prohibition,</hi> conſidered in it's own eſſence, is not as ev'ry one imagines, either ſhamefull or infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; for were it ſo, the Tree of Life which was <hi>prohibited</hi> to our firſt Parents, and the Terreſtriall Paradiſe which was <hi>prohibited</hi> to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſhould partake of the infamy and ſhame; As alſo the holy ſcripture vulgariz'd, which is <hi>prohibited</hi> to the ſimple, and certain reliques which are <hi>prohibited</hi> to all prophane hands. In ſumme, all thoſe things which are prohibited, either by nature, or by the Law, to our appetit or deſires, ſhould be infamous: He is deceiv'd who breaths with ſuch an opinion; for <hi>prohibition</hi> of it ſelf can bring

               <p>The cauſes have bin divers, why <hi>Rome</hi> hath accuſtom'd from time to time to <hi>prohibit</hi> Books; The moſt ancient cauſes were, a zeal to preſerve the purity of Religion, and a care that the lives of Chriſtians ſhould not be corrupted with thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins,

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115379:55"/>
which is the center wher all Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals terminat their cours, being drawn down by the weight of that earth wherof humanity is compos'd.

to death, the further he is from good operations: He exceſsive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loves the pleaſure of his nephews, nor doth he operat any thing, but what aymes at their intereſts. He never reflects upon the incumbency of his charge, and if at any time ſome flying thought repreſents unto him his own duty, he diſcerneth well, that a kind of relation paſſeth 'twixt the Papacy, and his perſon; but he flattereth himſelf with this fond conceit, that the Papacy is more bound to ſerve his perſon, than his perſon the Papacy. He deteſts in the extreme the memory of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, the moſt effectuall means that the garding Angels uſe to tame the proudeſt ſouls. He will not as much as think on death, or if ſomtimes he

is brought to think on't, by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the phyſick into poyſon, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes his cogitation preſently, in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating how he may aggrandize his Houſe before lie goes. If I ſhould tell you how often I found him chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meriſing within himſelf, how he might make it poſsible to render the Popedome Electif, and to depend no more upon the Conſiſtory, but ſolely upon the perſon regnant, that he might eſtabliſh it in his poſterity, you would be amazed at thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant imaginations, that often poſſeſſe the mind, even of the Vicar of Chriſt.

drain the patrimony of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> for to enrich their own Houſes with the ſpoiles of the holy Church. But the avidity of <hi>

Ther was was ever yet in the world a greater number of thoſe, who wiſh to be Princes, then Principalities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Hence it comes, that to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe theſe from the tenacious hands of others, ther muſt be <hi>force</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily us'd, becauſe hardly any reaſons can be found which may perſwade the mind of man to lay down volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily the right of a free dominion,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115379:57"/>
which makes <hi>

               <p>I could tell you ſome further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and fury of his. He accounts often upon the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> but he finds the Enterpriſe to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of <hi>deſire,</hi> than <hi>hopes:</hi> He thinks upon the Duchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> lending his eare unto the gloſing offers of ſome Miniſter of a <hi>Tramontane</hi> Crown; but he dares not truſt to that, for if others ſhould intervene, he cannot leave all to the <hi>Barberini.</hi> He fixes his eyes upon <hi>Lucca,</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it a petty State, he doubts whether the benefit will counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile the charge. He hath a months
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115379:58"/>
mind to <hi>Mirandola,</hi> but being feudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the Empire, and a place that breeds ſome jealouſie 'twixt the neighbouring Princes, he is afraid to draw <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Lombardy</hi> on his back; Laſtly, he turns his eyes to <hi>Parma,</hi> and this enterprize being made leſſe difficult by the advantage of ſome pretences, he purpoſes to deprive the poor Duke (beginning with <hi>Caſtro</hi>) of all his poſſeſsions. I put him in mind how much it did misbecome Biſhops, and other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats of the holy Church, who make profeſsion of a life diffring from ſwordmen, to change the Croſier into Musket-reſts, Rockets into Corſlets, and their Myters to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions.

But I omit many Extravagances wherwith this capricious ſoul hath abus'd my laſt patience. Once he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a reſolution within himſelf, not to give any ſatisfaction at all to the Princes of Chriſtendome, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that I often put him in mind, that this was the baſis wheron was founded the conſervation of the Chriſtian obedience.

                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having underſtood the complaints of the Tutelar Angell of <hi>Urban</hi> the eight, enters <hi>Rome,</hi> wher he attends the perfecting of the Proces, but an accident befell him, which inforc'd him to fly, as he was going along, another Angell comes in his way, whom he encounters with theſe expreſsions:</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu come, O heavenly Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, peradventure to charge me from his divine Majeſty, that I ſhould avoid <hi>Rome.</hi> Behold, how I have left her already before

your comming; for <hi>divine inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fore-run the very flight of Angels.</hi> But now that I am come out of <hi>Rome,</hi> let us repoſe awhile, and I will relate unto you the unexpected cauſe of my haſty departure.</p>
               <p>You know already, O Angell of God, that I was ſent from Heaven to Earth to hear the complaints of Mortals, and to forme a Proces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this adulterous and naughty <hi>Spouſe.</hi> I lighted to this purpoſe in many places, wher having fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by all degrees of people her diſſolut deportments, to confirm with my own eyes what came from other tongues, I reſolv'd at laſt to come to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. I paſs'd too and fro at firſt in the froc of a Fryer; There, as I went through a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115379:61"/>
little blind Hamlet, I was call'd in to confeſſe a dying Cardinall; which gave me warning, that the habit deſcrying me to be a religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, twas likely, that entring ſo to <hi>Rome,</hi> I might (according to the cuſtome) be queſtion'd for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of my Orders, or the licenſe of my ſuperiors; I herupon, to evade the telling of any lye, held it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to lay down the <hi>Froc,</hi> and take my <hi>ſword.</hi> So I came into <hi>Rome,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to lodge in ſome Convent of Fryers, who being us'd to thruſt themſelves into worldly affairs, more than the <hi>Seculars</hi> themſelves, I thought I could there very leiſurely have a free and exact information of all things, ſpecially, becauſe the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſpeech is retyr'd now into
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115379:61"/>
Cloyſters for more ſecurity, in regard of the extreme rigor which is us'd to puniſh thoſe who ſpeak any thing againſt the Court. The Monaſtery wher I was lodg'd, was famous for the ſtudy of Letters, and ſo it was frequented by many learned men; (But the greateſt concourſe was of ſtrangers, who ſo abound in <hi>Rome</hi> of all Nations) wher deſiring to know what conceit Forreners had of that Church, I diſputed often upon ſome points of Religion. Ther hapned to come thither a <hi>Turk,</hi> rather to heare, as I imagine, the noiſe of the diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſee faſhions, then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his judgment; ſo I ask'd him his opinion of Chriſtian Religion, wherunto beyond all expectation, he anſwered thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:115379:62"/>Amongſt the <hi>Turks</hi> it is held for certain, that God doth favour thoſe people moſt, wher he is truly ador'd, ſo, from the proſperity of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Empire, we infer, that our faith is good, and the obſervance of it not diſpleaſing to God. Touching the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, we have an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ſhe was not naught, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſhe was adulterated, and made naught by Chriſtians themſelves. But in the ſtate ſhe is now in in this City, we beleeve her to be abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to God Almighty, ſpecially, ſince we ſee that of late yeares ſhe goes annichilating, and mouldring away by little and little, by her own inward and endleſſe diſcords. Such was the concluſion of the <hi>Turk,</hi> which made me, I confeſſe, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115379:62"/>
not a little, while I obſerved, that even thoſe who profeſſe not much knowledge, can deduce from far fetch'd Principles, conſequences ſo near the truth. Having had <hi>his</hi> opinion, I went on in making a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcrutiny, and I fell to expoſtulat with a <hi>Greek,</hi> who was usd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to <hi>Rome</hi> for the opportunity of ſtudying in <hi>Clementin</hi> Colledge, who anſwer'd to my interrogatories thus:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches are Siſters iſſued from one Father: But the <hi>Greek</hi> is the <hi>firſt born,</hi> and I know not by what wiles the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> came to take away her birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. For this cauſe they live in moſt grievous diſguſts one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But the <hi>one</hi> enjoyes the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of all her paternall goods,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115379:63"/>
wheras the <hi>other</hi> lives as <hi>Eſau</hi> did; excluded, and under the dominion of another. Touching the particular cuſtoms of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I ſay nothing; for he that cenſures her in this <hi>City,</hi> ſhews he knows not his own danger, and he who approves her carriage, underſtands not the Law of Chriſt. With ſuch words the <hi>Greek</hi> ſatisfied my demands. As touching the opportunity which was offer'd me, to mingle ſpeech with a <hi>French-man</hi> upon the ſame ſubject, I underſtood his conceit thus:</p>
               <p>The name of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is reverenc'd by a great part of the Kingdome of <hi>France;</hi> but the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our Governors hath never permitted the <hi>Pope</hi> to extend that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115379:63"/>
of pre-dominion beyond the Alps, which he doth exerciſe in <hi>Italy,</hi> for our policy is ſupported by particular <hi>Gallican</hi> Rites: And the reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>French</hi> being naturally impatient, and now that almoſt half <hi>France</hi> (to withdraw it ſelf from under the <hi>Roman</hi> yoake) is infected with Hereſie, certainly if the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould exerciſe upon the conſciences of that ſpritfull people the tyranny he doth exerciſe in <hi>Italy,</hi> the reſt of that great Kingdome would fall from him quite. Such were the expreſsions of the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> which did ſtir in me a curioſity by way of oppoſition, to hear what the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would ſay. Nor was it difficult for me to obtain my deſire, by meeting with a Nobleman of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115379:64"/>
                  <hi>Sevill,</hi> who frequenting the ſame Convent, I entred into his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and he rendred me ſatisfied by ſuch diſcours.</p>
               <p>Friend, to ſerve you, I will ſpeak, beyond my cuſtome of this Nation, with all ingenuity of heart: The reverence which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do profeſſe to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, may be conſidered in two manners, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>outward.</hi> If you ask me of the <hi>inward</hi> reverence, ſuppoſe it to be not unlike that of other people, who have full knowledge of her cuſtoms; (The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being of a genius apt to eſteem things as they are in value) But if you ask me of the <hi>outward</hi> reverence, know, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation in extern apparance ſhew themſelves very obſervant of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115379:64"/>
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Church, becauſe, that having found her alwayes moſt partiall to the intereſts of their Crowns, they hold themſelves oblig'd by termes of gratitude to correſpond with her at leaſt in <hi>outward</hi> obſervance. My King knows well how available for the depreſsing of the ſuſpected great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his Subjects hath bin the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the holy <hi>Inquiſition:</hi> He lives mindfull of that promptitude ſhew'd in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to deny an abſolution to the Houſe of <hi>Borbon,</hi> untill he had conform'd it ſelf to the <hi>Austrian</hi> ſatisfaction; And laſtly, he knows how much to this very houre, the pragmaticall <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have ſerv'd him to dilate in every part, with their own advantage, the bounds of the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Empire; So
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115379:65"/>
that in contemplation of all theſe reſpects, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oblig'd to reverence the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, in exterior appearance at leaſt, though ſhe were far worſe then ſhe is.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Spaniard</hi> did terminat his period, while my diligence, which deſiſted not to procure all punctuall advertiſements, brought me to diſcourſe with an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> who gave this modeſt anſwer:</p>
               <p>Sir, I am declar'd an Enemy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, therfore my words, I preſume, can gain no credit with you, but if you deſire to know what reſpects this Church finds <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> read our Doctors, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance your curioſity will be fully ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:115379:65"/>Thus, O Angell of God, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in <hi>Rome</hi> to bring to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the proces which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o my charge againſt the adultreſſe <hi>Spouſe;</hi> And paſsing one morning by a Church, wher they were caſting out a Devill, I went in, becauſe of the noiſe, and then the ill ſpirit knew my perſon, and began to cry out, her's Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> her's Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> Truly, he is come in an ill time from Heaven, to view the ſtate of that Church for which he ſhed ſo much ſweat: Good Saint, what motives brought him to this lower world? Was it to ſee how his labours fructified? Ah, the pure grains of that Doctrin which his Eloquence ſowed in the Vineyard of the Lord, are turn'd to tares, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115379:66"/>
become food for ravenous birds, ſuch as theſe are, who ſtand about me now, to diſconjure me with their hideous noiſe. Vpon this cry, the Prieſts began to fix their looks upon me, wherupon, fearing to be diſcovered, I ſoftly retyred; but the words took ſuch impreſsions in the mind of the Exorciſt, that he did conjure the ſpirit by violent threats to manifeſt who I was, who, not being able to reſiſt the violence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd I was Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of humane ſhape (he knew not why) wandred now upon earth.

The Courtier, O Angell of God, ſpoke to me thus in very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per phraſe; for in theſe times, <hi>Saints</hi> uſe to be call'd <hi>Strangers</hi> in the State <hi>Eccleſiastick;</hi> whither I was aſtoniſh'd or no, to ſee my ſelf thus ſurpriz'd and diſcover'd, judge you; I thank'd his <hi>Beatitude</hi> in the beſt manner I could, for his courteous
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115379:67"/>
offer, and excus'd my ſelf not to be able to receive that honor, in regard I was of neceſsity to depart from <hi>Rome</hi> within a few houres; when I had diſ-intangled my ſelf thus from the Courtier, I cal'd my thoughts to counſell, and feeling, that my heart did preſage me ſome ſiniſter acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I reſolv'd upon flight; And I was gon but few paces further, when the ſame Courtier came again, and told me, thus: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the eight doth remand me to you, O holy <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſecond his firſt invitation, but if in caſe you are reſolv'd not to grace his Palace with your preſence, I have order to propoſe another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to you: In your Epiſtles we read, O Apoſtle of God, certain paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which manifeſtly contradict
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115379:67"/>
the humors of our holy Father, <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> the eight, he prayes you to mend them, becauſe it is not fitting that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould gain-ſay the will of <hi>Peters Succeſſor;</hi> And if you deſire to know which are thoſe paſſages, one amongſt the reſt is, that, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. Vrban</hi> the eight would, that from this ſo univerſall a propoſition, the ſouls of <hi>Popes</hi> ſhould be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; He thinking it not fitting, that the <hi>Popes</hi> ſhould be ſubordinat to any other Law, but that of their own affections and fancy, for ſo their actions ſhould not be cenſur'd by every ſenſles man, as they are ever and anon now adays: His Holines alſo much deſires, that theſe words be utterly expung'd, which aſsigning
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115379:68"/>
to every Biſhop in his own incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bencies, do ſpeak in particular. <hi>Diaconos habeant non turpe lucrum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes,</hi> Let them have Deacons not given to baſe lucre. Theſe periods diſpleaſe in a high meaſure <hi>Vrban</hi> the eight, for he of neceſsity muſt have about him his <hi>Nephew-Cardinals.</hi> Here the Courtier ſtopp'd, when I poor <hi>Paul</hi> fell to diſcourſe with my ſelf thus: See, thou art in danger to be entrapp'd, notwithſtanding that thou haſt been confirmed in the ſtate of grace, but what could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted leſſe in <hi>Rome?</hi> perceiving at laſt that he attended no anſwer, I put my ſelf to reaſon with him thus: O <hi>Papall</hi> Meſſenger, the buſines which you propound to me, is of no light moment; for he who is tender
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115379:68"/>
of his own repute, cannot be eaſily induc'd to un-ſay himſelf: You know that my Doctrin hath run through the world till this day without alteration, Now what will people ſay to ſee it now differ from times paſs'd! And who will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf, that the alteration proceeds rather from the malignity of ſome convicted Heretick, than from <hi>Pauls</hi> pen. Moreover, to what purpoſe will it be to vary Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Doctrins, when the Popes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to them, do operat ſtill according to their own fancies? But now, that his <hi>beatitude</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire this ſuperfluous alteration, I will not fayle to ſerve him in the beſt manner that God ſhall inſpire me. The Courtier departed with this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115379:69"/>
anſwer, which he took for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but I, to reſerve my ſelf to execute what God had enjoyn'd me, did immediatly fly away from <hi>Rome,</hi> being warned from Heaven ſo to do. I was ſcarce out of the City, when I remembred to have left my ſword behind, and being in ſuſpenſe with my ſelf, whether I ſhould return to fetch it or no, I ſpie comming after me, one who was alſo a Forrener in the ſame Convent wher I had lodg'd, and often ſhew'd me arguments of love, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming near me, cryed out, friend, be gone, be gone, I come after you of purpoſe to tell you, that you were ſcarce gone, but another Courtier came to ſeek you, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of your flight, he carried
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115379:69"/>
newes therof to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and a little after the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf came to your lodging, who finding not your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, took away your <hi>ſword,</hi> ſaying in a kind of choller, that if <hi>Pauls pen refuſe to ſerve me, his ſword ſhall.</hi> This ſword ſhall force Princes to bend and bow at my feet; This, this ſhall conſerve <hi>Caſtro,</hi> ſubdue <hi>Parma,</hi> and ſhew the world that ther is no neceſsity of reaſon, wher the edge of a ſlaſhing ſword can make way.</p>
               <p>Giving a thouſand thanks to my friend, who knew not what <hi>Paul,</hi> nor what ſword the <hi>Pope</hi> ſpake of, I took my leave of him, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued my flight, being troubled in my thoughts, that my armes ſhould be left in ſuch a hand, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes them to the ſervice of ſuch

               <p>You know already, O Apoſtle of God, that I am of thoſe Angels, which never deſcended before to Earth, and if in ſtrange Countries the curious mind of the Paſſenger deſires to ſatisfie it ſelf, I confes that amongſt other things which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to ſee, one was a Monaſtery of <hi>Nuns,</hi> who were ſo much ſpoken of in Heaven, that I took them to be Angels on Earth. Being come therfore to one of the prime Cities of <hi>Italy,,</hi> I took the forme of a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115379:72"/>
ſtrange youth, and entred at the privateſt hower I could into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachall <hi>Parlatory.</hi> I found at the windowes a young <hi>Nun,</hi> which had no other buſines it ſeems, but to attend the comming of ſome body. I was ſcarce ſpyed by her, when ſhe ask'd me an account of my Country, and what fancy took me to traverſe the world up and down in that manner, I, bethinking my ſelf of Heaven, anſwered, my Country, moſt gentle Siſter, is too far diſtant from this place, and wherunto few of this Region arrive Touching the fancy that leads me thus to traverſe up and down the world, it is no other, then a curioſity, which often drawes youthfull lightnes to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their own profit, and to regard
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115379:73"/>
others. Fooliſh youthfulnes, which canſt not learn how to value thy Countries good but afar off; then <hi>I</hi> added, happy are they, who never departing from within the Paradiſe of theſe holy wals, ſeem as ſo many Angels alwayes appearing before the face of God. She being as full of ſpirit as ſhe was, of beauty, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thus:</p>
               <p>O how many oſ us would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly change our Paradiſe for your Peregrination, wherfore then do you complain ſo cauſleſly of your Travels? which being no other then the motions of a civill life, it cannot chuſe but be ſo much the ſweeter to elevated minds, by how much the higher the motions of their ſouls are: Behold the <hi>Sun,</hi> behold the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115379:73"/>
                  <hi>Planets,</hi> which never ſtaying ſtill in one place, delight to be continuall Travellers in the Vnivers. <hi>I</hi> being much taken with the vivacity of her ſpirit, replyed:</p>
               <p>It is true Lady, that the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Planets</hi> are in a kind of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all peregrination; but ther are in Heaven <hi>fixed</hi> Stars alſo, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe haply they are more noble, are ſuperior to the other, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nearer to the Throne of the Almighty. Thoſe <hi>Nuns</hi> then, who to ſerve God are alwayes permanent in one place, like the <hi>fixed</hi> Stars, may more then any other Mortals, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves with an aſſurance that they are nearer God. The beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous mayden ſigh'd at theſe words, and then anſwered:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:115379:74"/>God, <hi>I</hi> deny not, dwels nearer to the <hi>fixed</hi> Stars, but not to deſperat ſouls; And now you diſcover your ſelf to be a true ſtranger, that you are not acquainted with our miſerable condition. The cruelty of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and the rigor of our deſtiny hath penn'd us in here for ever; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> concurring herunto by admitting any pretext whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, bear with me Sir, that I ſpeak thus. It is a hard fate to be borne to a perpetuall priſon, while 'tis ſeen, that all other living creatures have the whole world to ſolace themſelves in; And that priſon, which it ſeems the very Infants do fly from, when they ſally out of their mothers wombs, before they have as it were any ſenſe of life, we are conſtrain'd
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115379:74"/>
to endure, after that nature hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-us the perfect uſe of ſenſe, and life, and the knowledge of our own miſeries; the deſtiny of that Mortall muſt needs be a hard one, who is born to live in reſtles infelicity. This Cloyſter, which ſurrounds our liberty, is not as you imagine, a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe;</hi> for in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> there dwels no diſcontentment; It is rather a <hi>Hell,</hi> where in the flames of inextingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhible deſire, the naturall affections of our humanity are condemn'd to be tortur'd every minute. I will not ſtand to expreſſe the cauſe why our Parents are ſo inhumanly cruell unto us, for it is too well known, that for to ſpare that dowry which is due to our ſex, they condemne us 'twixt theſe wals, to be depriv'd for ever of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115379:75"/>
any worldly delight, for no other cauſe, but becauſe we are borne wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Yet you muſt know, that the ſhutting us thus by force between theſe ſtones, cannot deprive us of thoſe carnall affections, which may well be <hi>cover'd,</hi> but not <hi>quench'd</hi> in that religious habit which you ſee about us; Nor can this kind of life conduce to Heaven, conſidering ther is no concurrence of the <hi>will,</hi> which is ſo acceptable to the all-knowing Lord. We are rather deſtinated to an Abiſſe, by a cours clean contrary to our genius, being bereft alſo of that common priviledge, which other ſouls uſe to have to go to Hell what way they pleaſe. In ancient times it was the cuſtom to ſlay the Victimes firſt, and then ſacrifice them to good,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115379:75"/>
becauſe haply the principall Seat of the corporeall affections lying in the bloud, 'twas not held convenient to offer his divine Majeſty any Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſt, which was not firſt purg'd by effuſion of that bloud from all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſsions; But this is not obſerv'd in us by our Parents, who do make ſacrifices of us, with all our bloud and paſsions about us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then how can we beleeve that it is gratefull to God? and being not gratefull to him, conſider in what a deſpair our ſouls are plung'd in, which ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhut out of the world here, without any aſſurance to enter Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven herafter, in regard we have not power to extinguiſh our naturall affections, and ſo are in danger to precipitat our ſelves headlong into
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115379:76"/>
Hell, through a kind of ſuppos'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, If Chriſt died to reduce us to ſuch a hard condition, O how better were it for us that he had not died. Be not offended, O ſtranger, at theſe words, for the toungs of the damned can bring forth nothing but blaſphemies: Yet we know that Chriſt hath no hand in this our hard condition, for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his death had for it's principall object the <hi>freedome</hi> and enlargement of ſouls, not their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. The <hi>Popes</hi> are moſt in fault, by yeelding to the cruell covetouſnes of our Parents, to transvert the keyes of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> iuto the keyes of a priſon. It was not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no, it was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of <hi>Herod,</hi> that, by reaſon of the humanation of our <hi>Saviour</hi> caus'd ſo many Innocents to be ſlain. Behold,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115379:76"/>
we are in a caſe equall to theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we being yet innocent chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, under a mark of holines, we are ſegregated and cut off from the ſociety of the living, ther being no difference 'twixt us and them, but that they died before buriall, and we are buried before death. Nor can our innocency, or our fears pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile any thing; nor are thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges ſufficient, which nature hath granted theſe faces of ours (for which peradventure you ſtiled us Angels) to implore from others piety any ſuccour, having found the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo ingratefull, while we conſider that the time was when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was freed by an Angell out of priſon; but now clean contrary Angels are caſt into

               </p>
               <p>But whither doth the violence of a juſt paſsion tranſport me thus to rave? Helas, the name of <hi>Angels</hi> doth not ſuit with our condition, and leſſe with our operations: For although we are brought Innocents hither, yet we cannot preſerve our ſelves long in this Monaſtick life from the motions of deſperat paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; The Religion which clap'd us in here is not ador'd, but deteſted by ſome of us; vanity and feminine wantonnes is here in the height; Here dwels curioſity in exces, and deſire of knowledge in worldly matters without end; Ambition, envy, diſcord, and hatred, is never wanting amongſt us: Laſtly, her's

But what ſhall I ſay of that mayden <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity</hi> for the conſervation wherof we are principally penn'd in here? I leave that for you to imagine, it being not permitted to femal modeſty to make any further expreſsions in this kind; I only tell you this, that we procure all means poſsible to outrage and abuſe it, and not without reaſon, for if this <hi>chaſtity</hi> hath bin the principall thing that hath retrench'd our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties in this manner, we ought to aym and bend our chiefeſt forces to be reveng'd of our chiefeſt Enemy. And here this beautuous <hi>Nun</hi> bluſh'd, and broke the thread of her diſcours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:115379:78"/>I confsſſe unto you, O holy <hi>Paul,</hi> that if I had a breaſt capable of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene affections, I would doubtles have tenderly reſented the miſery of this diſcontented ſoul; but compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is vain, wher ther is no power to comfort; therfore I held it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to take my leave, that I might not imbitter her paſsions any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo at my departure I ſaid, when I came in hither, O moſt beautuous <hi>Nuns,</hi> I look'd upon you as on ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Seraphims; but hearing the ſtate of your hard condition, I find you to be the unhappieſt creatures that live under the Law of Chriſt.

the ſpirit of a ſleeping reſentment was ſeen to ſtir.
