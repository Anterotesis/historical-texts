            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Here, my Lord, the Cuſtom of Dedications calls upon me, prompting me to put on the Poet, to draw the Patron; and though moſt Performances of this kind are as full of Flattery as the Plays are of Satire, I might attempt your Lordſhips Character without being obnoxious to that Cenſure. But what Pen will dare engage ſo Lofty and Difficult a Theme? Some of the Beſt have modeſtly declin'd it, and been reduc'd to ſpeak like the reſt of the World, who ſtrive to give ſome Idea of your Lordſhip, by that of <hi>The Fine Gentleman;</hi> a Character you maintain among the Brave, the Witty, and the Fair, by ſo undiſputed a Title as confirms you a living honour to your great Anceſtors, even to the glorious Name of <hi>Boyle,</hi> that has ſo long been an honour to this Iſland and its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

            <head>PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Am almoſt aſham'd to mention the extraordinary Succeſs of a Play which I my ſelf muſt condemn; yet I am glad I was not miſtaken in my opinion of the generous Audience, which was ſo indulgent, that I'm willing to think I was the more kindly us'd for being a Stranger. I will ſtrive to deſerve the Favor better by attempting ſomething more correct than this Play, which, tho it makes no unpleaſant Figure on the Stage, and is thought ſufficiently entertaining, is not altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd as I cou'd have wiſh'd. For, I would have the Plot, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Humour begin and run through the whole Play together, a thing but ſeldom practis'd of late. I cou'd not follow that method in this, becauſe I began it upon two Acts ſuppos'd to be written by a perſon now dead, and given me by Mr. <hi>Verbruggen.</hi> Though there is no manner of Buſineſs in 'em, nor the leaſt proſpect of any, I lik'd 'em ſo well as to continue 'em and fit a Plot to 'em, but as the Lovers were not brought together yet, and there are none but genteel Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters in 'em, I was oblig'd to make my three Acts ſo very long, that (when I brought 'em to be acted) without the other two, they were found to exceed by above an Act the due length of a Play. This oblig'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e not only to ſtrike out intirely Mr. <hi>Verbruggen</hi>'s two Acts, but to ſhorten mine, and with ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations make 'em Five. I alſo alter'd ſome Characters that I might uſe thoſe two Acts another time: (For, I think 'em too pretty to be loſt.) But I have not borrow'd the leaſt word or hint out of 'em; for, tho there is a ſatirical Wit and a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Spark in them, as well as in this Play, they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="tcp:104584:4"/>
different, beſides thoſe are general humours which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Writer takes a priviledge of bringing in where he pleaſes. I thought my ſelf oblig'd to ſay ſo much, becauſe ſome People either maliciouſly or through a miſtake have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the two firſt Acts are not mine. I am willing to own a Debt, when I borrow, contrary to the Example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of moſt Dramatick Writers. <hi>Plantus</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> borrow'd from the Greek; I wou'd borrow, from my own Countrymen, but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere</hi> and moſt of 'em have been ſo glean'd, that there's ſcarce any thing left. I have far'd better among the <hi>Italians,</hi> for I muſt own my ſelf indebted to 'em for the hint of the two Scenes where Love is made in Jeſt, as alſo for ſome Speeches and Thoughts here and there, and were their Author known I wou'd name him. When ever any thing in <hi>foreign</hi> Plays will ſeem to me fit to divert us here, I will freely make uſe of it, and as freely acknowledge it. Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi> ſaid very juſtly, that we do not borrow from Foreigners out of Poverty, but out of Lazineſs. Nor will I value the baſe and notoriouſly falſe Inſinuations of envious impotent Poetaſters, and, leaſt of all, thoſe of a pitiful conceited noiſie ſcribling wou'd-be-quack, below naming; one whoſe wretched Riddles, Songs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were deny'd a place in my late Miſcellanies, tho, <hi>like other things of his,</hi> recommended <hi>by himſelf,</hi> as if written by a Lady. Such an invidious Traducer is well coupled with an idle ſharping Dialoguemonger, whoſe <hi>Zany</hi> he is; like him, ſo baſe as to detract, in the moſt barbarous manner, from thoſe who never wrong'd him, and ſo cowardly as to deny it: But they might as well charge thoſe of ruining themſelves by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage who have not yet committed that Folly, as of ruining a Bookſeller by Books, by which he owns he was a gainer: Had I but room, I wou'd ſtigmatize that Brace of Libellers; for, how deſpicable ſoever ſuch Scoundrels may be, they are to be fear'd as well as hated; for, what is more to be hated than a profeſs'd Lyar, or more to be fear'd than a publick Slanderer.</p>
            <p>Let me leave this ungrateful Subject to acknowledge my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to Mr. <hi>John Eccles,</hi> who not only ſet my three Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues to moſt charming Notes, but humour'd the Words to Admiration; we need not fear Muſic ſhou'd decline, while we have ſo fine a Genius to ſupport and raiſe it.</p>

               <p>Stay, let me tell that—Why, a Beau is a kind of a two-legg'd thing, that talks, and walks, and dances,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104584:12"/>
and ſings, and dreſſes, and looks like ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Man and a Woman, that ſeldom keeps a ſecret better than the latter, and ſtrives to outdo 'em in taking care of the outſide, conſcious there's little within. It riſes to go to Bed, is two hours at the Toilette a dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, diſpatching of Duns, and ſpoiling gilt paper to diſpatch it as Billets Doux, ſometimes to its ſweet ſelf, and all day making Love to its dear Carcaſs and ſweeter Cloths.</p>

Sometimes Beau is Mr. <hi>Smerk</hi> with his diminutive Band and powder'd Bob: ſometimes <hi>Daſh</hi> a Lawyers Clerk, that pomatum's his Face, waſhes it with Milk and Water, and is two hours turning up his hair at night, that it may ſit in Curls the next morning.

She's vaſtly Rich too, and I have ſcarce enough left to Live. What ſhall I do? If I Court her in Earneſt, I may be made her Jeſt, and all the World's. Thus Love begins by Fooling, till we Fool our ſelves; and what is worſe, we know it, yet go on.</p>

Let him read good books moderately, but chiefly the great book of the world, not to be found with Pedants. It coſts ſo little more to breed a man like a Gentleman, than it does to breed others like Clowns, that I wonder there are ſo many of the latter with good Paternal Eſtates.</p>

                  <l>Wealth may be loſt, but never what we gain</l>
                  <l>By reading Books, and moſt by reading Men.</l>
