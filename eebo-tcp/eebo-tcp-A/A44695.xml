            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE
THE
Lord Haversham.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Offer this Discourse, <hi>My Honoured Lord,</hi> to
Your Perusal, in Confidence that the Subject
and Design of it will be so far Grateful to
<hi>Your Lordship,</hi> as in some Degree to Atone
for the Imperfections of the Management.</p>
            <p>I Believe it will not Offend against <hi>Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi>
very Accurate Judgment of Things, that I
have not been so sway'd by an Authority, which hath
signifi'd much in our Age; as to represent the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
State</hi> of Man, as a <hi>State of War,</hi> which either
must signifie Man in his Original Constitution, to
have been a very ill-natur'd Creature, or must signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his Nature to be less Ancient than Himself.</p>
            <p>FOR I cannot Doubt, but the Author of that
Maxim, would have Disdain'd their Way of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who by <hi>Nature</hi> Mean <hi>Vice.</hi> Or to have been
<pb facs="tcp:99795:3"/>
Guilty of so Pious a Thought, that God at first
made Man any better Thing than we find Him.</p>
            <p>I Shall the less passionately Lament my Infelicity
in losing the good Opinion of Men of that Sentiment,
if I stand Right in <hi>Your Lordships.</hi> Not knowing
any of your Rank and Figure, in the World, with
whom I Count it a greater Honour to Agree in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or do less Fear to Disagree.</p>
            <p>IN Matters of Secular Concernment, it becomes
Me not to Profess any Judgment at all, besides the
Publick, unto which in Things of that Nature, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Private Mans ought to be, and is professedly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.</p>
            <p>YET within that Compass, notwithstanding the
Just Esteem <hi>Your Lordship</hi> hath of the Noble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
which do then Illustriously Shine in the
Military Profession, when there is a Necessity of their
being red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>c'd to Practice: I Apprehend that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Your Lordship</hi> hath no more gratful Thoughts
of <hi>War,</hi> than I, nor more ungrateful of the Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Means of Preserving <hi>Peace.</hi> That which is the
Reproach of Humane Nature could never Originally
belong to it. Nor can any thing more expose its Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious
Depravation, than it should ever be Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
the Sword should Dispute <hi>Right,</hi> and the
Longest, Decide it.</p>
            <p>IN the Matters of Religion which is every Mans
Business, and whose Sphere as it is Higher, must be
<pb facs="tcp:99795:3"/>
proportionably Wider and more Comprehensive; I
Hope it is <hi>Your Lordships</hi> constant Care to add unto
<hi>Clearness and Rectitude of</hi> Thought, the <hi>Pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of Taste; and that you apprehend it to consist
not more in a Scheme of Notions, than of Vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
and that your Love to it proceeds from hence,
that you Relish it and Feel you Live by it; You are
hereby Fortified against the Reproach that attends it,
from their Contempt of it who are every Day assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heaven, and would have the War not ended, but
only transferr'd thither-ward.</p>
            <p>THAT which though some Vent, and others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
as Wit, even <hi>Paganism</hi> it self has Condemn'd as
Foolishness. <hi>Your Lordship</hi> is in no more Danger
to be alter'd hereby from your chosen Course, than a
Man in his Health and Senses, by Satyrs against Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Drinking.</p>
            <p>I Reckon <hi>Your Lordship</hi> is so much taken up
with the great Things of Religion, as to be less ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with the Adventitious Things Men have Thought
fit to affix to it. I do not more Emulate <hi>Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
in any Thing, than a Disdain of Bigotry; nor
more Honour any thing I Discern in You than True
Catholicism.</p>
            <p>AND Recounting what Things and Persons do
truly belong to a Church, I Believe <hi>Your Lordship</hi>
is not professedly of a Larger Church, as Counting
it too Large for You but too narrow, and that You af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="tcp:99795:4"/>
not to be of a Self-distinguisht Party. Nor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Opportunity of avowing the Just Honour,
and Obligations I have to <hi>Your Lordship,</hi> and
<hi>Your Noble Consort,</hi> with my Sincere Concern for
Your Hopeful and Numerous Off-spring, did any
Thing more Invite this Address to <hi>Your Lordship,</hi>

            <p>YOUR Happy Return with <hi>PEACE</hi> in your Retinue,
has rais'd a Spring-Tide of Joy, that overflows the
Nation. This great Blessing, We Primarily owe with
our most Solemn and Dutiful Thankfulness to the
GOD of <hi>PEACE,</hi> who has Calm'd the Tempestuous World,
and Chang'd the black Scene of Horror, and Misery; wherein the
most Tragical Cruelties were Acted, Cities were Fir'd, and the
Fires quench'd in the Blood of the Citizens, wherein Death and
Despair appear'd in their Terrible Shapes: And has introduc'd
a Bright Scene of Prosperity, wherein Innocence and Liberty,
Commerce and Abundance are secur'd. <hi>This</hi> we Owe, as to the
Secondary Cause, with our most Humble Gratitude to Your MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTY;
Your open and generous Opposition in the Field of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
has Tam'd our Potent Enemies; who presum'd to Level all
Obstacles to their Lofty Designs, as if their Power had been E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to their Pleasure. They had broke through the Circles of
Justice and Honour, but Your MAJESTY has fix'd such Bounds,
as may prevent their Swelling Exorbitancies for the Future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>EVROPE,</hi> has seen with Admiration Your Courage and Heroick
Heat guided by an Equal Light, and Superior to all Dangers in
War: There is a Just Expectation that an Equal Honour will
attend Your MAJESTY, for Your Ruling Wisdom, Your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
Temper'd with Equity and Goodness in the Counsels and
<pb facs="tcp:99795:5"/>
Arts of <hi>PEACE:</hi> You are the Glory of Your Subjects Abroad,
and their Delight at Home. Your Influxive Presence is the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Breath the Kingdom Draws, the Vital Band that Unites its
Parts, and prevents their Breaking into Confusion.</p>
            <p>YOUR MAJESTY is Ordain'd for Victories. Thereare more
Noble Conquests to be obtain'd over worse than Foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
Prophaneness in Manners, and Pernicious Doctrines in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that Fight against the Soul, and notwithstanding our
<hi>PEACE</hi> on Earth, Expose us to a Fearful War with Heaven.
WE Live in an Age of Degenerate Wickedness: Wherein are
Numberless Numbers of resolv'd Loosness, who by their bold Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties,
defie the Supream MAJESTY of Heaven: These WE
Hope by Your Authority and Influence, may be Restrain'd, if
not truly Reform'd; for whereas other Princes assume an Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Prerogative to Live as they List, to satisfie their Vicious
Appetites without Controul; Your MAJESTY Exhibites such
Excellent Vertues in Your Practise, as may be a Persuasive Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
and Commandingly Exemplary to Your Subjects.</p>
            <p>AND whereas, there are such Doctrines frequently Publish'd,
as are Infinitely Injurious to the Person and Office of our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour; WE Hope Your Pious Zeal for his Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
will put a stop to the Licentiousness of the Press, that the
Contagion of the Dead, may not Corrupt the Living. <hi>This</hi> will
be a most pleasing Sacrifice of Praise to the Blessed GOD, who
has Preserv'd Your most Precious Life in Raging War, and from
more Imminent Dangers, by the Dark and Cruel Conspiracy of
Wicked Enemies.</p>
            <p>WE Humbly Renew the Assurances of our inviolable Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and our Continual Prayers, That GOD would Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Your Sacred Person, and make Your MAJESTY al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Happy in Your Government, and Your Subjects Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in their Obedience.</p>

            <p>YOU so generally know the Occasion of this our
Solemn Assembly, at this Time; that none can
be in Doubt concerning the suitableness of this
Portion of Scripture for our Present Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>OUR Business is to celebrate the Divine Goodness, in Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our King Abroad, and Restoring him Home in Safety, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had been the Happy Instrument of bringing about that
Peace, which puts a Period to a long Continued, Wasting, and
Dubious War, under which We, and all <hi>Europe</hi> have groaned
these Divers Years. And if we find the favourable Workings
of Providence to concur and fall in with a Divine Word, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to GODS own People; as this for Instance, <hi>The Lord
will Bless his People with Peace:</hi> i e. He will vouchsafe this Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to his own People in the fittest Season, as it must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
this adds so much the more grateful and pleasant Relish,
to the Mercy we are this Day to acknowledge. It cannot but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99795:6"/>
do so with Right Minds, unto which nothing is more agreeable,
than to desire and covet such Favour as GOD shews to his <hi>own
People,</hi> and to be made <hi>glad with his Inheritance,</hi> Psalm 105. 4, 5.
from an Apprehension, that there must be somewhat very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
in such Mercy as GOD vouchsafes to his own, to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Peculiar and Select, severed and set apart for himself, from
the rest of Men.</p>
            <p>'TIS true indeed, that <hi>Peace,</hi> abstractly considered, is neither

besides GODS own People, have a more peculiar benign A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
upon them, and are attended, with reference to <hi>them,</hi> with
such Consequences, as wherein others, without being made of
this People of his, are not Sharers with them. Some Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there is of this in this <hi>Psalm,</hi> which the <hi>Title</hi> speaks, <hi>a
Psalm of David,</hi> and which some think to refer unto the Wars
managed by him in his Time with the <hi>Moabites,</hi> signified by the
Wilderness of <hi>Cadesh,</hi> and the <hi>Syrians,</hi> signified by the Cedars
of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> of whom he speaks in the Prophetick Stile, as if, by
the terrible and amazing appearances of GOD's Power against
them, they were Thunder-struck, like the Trees of a Forrest,
or as the Hinds that are wont to inhabit amongst them. And
so it is concluded, and shut up with this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> in the End
of the <hi>Psalm. The Lord will give Strength to his People, the Lord
will Bless his People with Peace:</hi> i. e. He is in War <hi>their Strength,</hi>
and their <hi>Felicity</hi> in Peace; in War, He is the Author of all that
Power, wherewith they are enabled to oppose and overcome Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Enemies; And in Peace, he is their truly felicitating Good,
and makes them, by his own vouchsafed Presence, a truly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
People.</p>
            <p>IT is the latter of these, <hi>Peace,</hi> unto which the Present Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
confines us. And concerning that, we might, in the</p>
            <p>1. PLACE, Note, from the Text, That wheresoever it is
brought about, GOD is the Author of it, <hi>GOD will Bless his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with Peace.</hi> That Title which the Scripture gives him, The
<hi>GOD of Peace,</hi> with the many Expressions of like Import, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it abounds, can leave them in no Doubt, concerning the
Divine Influence and Agency in bringing about the grateful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
of Peace, after desolating Bloody Wars, who have any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99795:6"/>
Reverence for the Sacred Oracles. And indeed, to insist upon
such a Subject as this, in a Case so plain, so acknowledged
amongst Men that believe the Bible, were to Reproach the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory,
as if it were made up of <hi>Scepticks</hi> and <hi>Atheists,</hi> or of
them that did not believe this World was made by GOD; or that
it was made by him only by some casual Stroak, and without
Design, that he cared not for his reasonable intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
when he had made them, what became of them, nor did
at all concern himself, in their most considerable Concernments.
I shall not therefore insist upon this, which seems rather slid in,
and supposed in the Text, or taken for granted: For among a
People in visible Relation and Subjection to GOD, it had been as
great an incongruity industriously to assert and prove such a
thing, as it would be, by an Elaborate Discourse, to prove that
there is a Sun in the Firmament, unto Men that continually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
and enjoy its Light and Influences, and to whose Sense, the
Vicissitudes and Distinctions of Day and Night, by its Presence
and Absence, are brought under constant Notice every Four and
Twenty Hours.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore, I say, pass on to what appears more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be the Design of the Text. And that seems to be two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
<hi>First,</hi> To represent to us in general, the great Blessing
of Peace; wherein, when GOD sees it sit, he is pleased to make
his own People Partakers with others. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because it is
not without Design, that it is said, <hi>He will Bless his People with
Peace;</hi> unto whom 'tis plain, this <hi>alone</hi> is not an appropriate Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
it seems further designed to intimate, and couch in, the
Concurrence and Concomitancy of such things, as, superadded
to Peace, will make it a compleat Blessing. <hi>The Lord will Bless his
People with Peace.</hi> He will give them Peace, so, and upon such
Terms, and with such Concomitants and Consequences, that to
them it shall prove a real and a full Blessing. These two things,
therefore, I intend to insist upon,</p>
            <p>1. TO shew you how valuable a Good, and (in the Large
and Common Sense) a <hi>Blessing,</hi> Peace is, as it stands in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to Bloody and Desolating Wars. And then</p>
            <p>2. I shall shew you, what Additions and Concomitants are
necessary to make it a compleat Blessing, such as may be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
and peculiar to GODS own People, and so make use of
the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99795:7"/>
1. I shall shew you Briefly, how valuable a good Peace is in
it self, as it stands opposed unto Bloody and Destructive Wars.
And this will best be seen, by stating and viewing it in that
Opposition, and by representing to you somewhat of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of War; which we may do, by viewing it in its <hi>Causes,</hi> in
<hi>it self,</hi> and <hi>in its dismal Consequences,</hi> wherewith it is wont to be
attended.</p>
            <p>CONSIDER it in its <hi>Causes,</hi> and they are principally <hi>these two,</hi>
the Wickedness of Men, and the just Vengeance of GOD there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
These two concurring, and falsing in together, must be
understood to be the Causes of so great a Calamity among Men
in this World. And I shall only consider these two in their
Complication, and not speak to them distinctly and separate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>VERY Plain it is, That War is a Mark of the <hi>Apostacy,</hi> and
Stigmatizes Man as Fallen from GOD, in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Effect
of their having sever'd themselves, and broke loose from the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Government. From whence are Wars? Are they not from your
Lusts?</hi> Jam. 4. 1. GOD most Justly Punishes Mens Injustice, not
by Infusing Malignity, which he needs not, into their minds and
Natures, and which it is impossible He can be the Author of,
whose very <hi>Nature</hi> it self is <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> but
having Forsaken Him, Rebelled against Him, Disclaimed Him as
their Ruler, Refused any longer to be Subject to Him; they are
Forsaken of Him, and left to take Vengeance for it on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
of which there cannot be a greater Instance, than that,
when Controversies do arise between Men and Men, between Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Nation, Kingdom and Kingdom, one People and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is presently to be <hi>Decided</hi> by a <hi>Bloody Sword.</hi> This speaks
a Monstrous Degeneracy in the <hi>Intellectual World,</hi> and from the
Original Rectitude that belongs to the Nature of Men, which in
his Primitive State did stand in a Temperament of Reason and
Love. That there should be Differences about <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> in a
Creature of that Constitution, is it self an Horrid Thing; but
then that such Differences are to be Determined only by Violence,
that presently they must hereupon Run into War! Good GOD!
What an Indication is this, That <hi>Reason, Wisdom, Justice,</hi> and
<hi>Love</hi> are fled from this Earth! And it speaks <hi>Rebellion</hi> against GOD
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99795:7"/>
in the Highest Kind, 'tis a Subversion of the most Fundamental
Law of his Kingdom over the Intelligent World, <hi>Thou shalt Love
the LORD thy GOD with all thy heart, with all they soul, with all thy
mind, with all thy might, and thy Neigbour as thy self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'TIS impossible there should be any such Thing as <hi>War</hi> in the
World, but by the Violation of this most Fundamental Divine
Law, the Principal and most Important Thing that this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
does as it were Consist in over reasonable Creatures, their
Loving Him above all, and one another as themselves. This <hi>Law,</hi>
observed, must make this <hi>Earth</hi> another <hi>Heaven:</hi> This <hi>Law,</hi> Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and Broken, makes it another <hi>Hell.</hi> Man being Faln from
GOD, and having lost their Acquaintance with Him, and all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of Divine Things, think to Repair their Loss out of this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
World; whereof no Man thinks he hath enough. <hi>Desire of
more,</hi> blinds their Eyes that they cannot Judge of Right and
Wrong. Hence every Man's Cause is Right in his own Eyes. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite</hi>
is the only <hi>Measure</hi> they Judge by. And <hi>Power</hi> (whatsoever
of it any one can grasp) the Instrument by which they Execute their
perverse Judgment. A Dismal Spectacle, and Subject of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
to the Inhabitants of the Purer and more Peaceful Regions!
To behold a Divine Off-Spring, the Sons of GOD, now Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
into Sons of the Earth, and Tearing in pieces one another,
for what some Posses, and others Covet!</p>
            <p>YEA, and to a Calm, Uninteressed Spectator on our own
Globe, this can be no grateful prospect to View the History of
all Times, and Nations, and take Notice how full it is of such Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy!
<hi>Countries</hi> from Age to Age made <hi>Akeldama</hi>'s, Fields of Blood,
on this Account, of extending or Confining Empire and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of Invading anothers, or Defending ones own!</p>
            <p>BUT hereupon it is not strange, when a World of Intelligent
Reasonable Creatures are thus gone off from GOD, and in Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against him, in the most Fundamental part of his <hi>Government,</hi>
that He suffers them to be the Executioners of His Just Wrath upon
one another.</p>
            <p>AND if we thus look upon War, First, in this <hi>its Complicated
Causes,</hi> it is the <hi>Opprobrium,</hi> the Reproach of Humane Nature, of
Intelligent Reasonable Creatures.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Next</hi> look upon it <hi>In it self,</hi> and what is it, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Humane Lives,</hi> of <hi>Creatures made after the Image of
GOD?</hi> Of whom He has so High a Value, and whose Lives, even
for that very Reason, He is pleased to Fence and Secure by a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99795:8"/>
Law, Whoever sheds Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed,
for in the Image of GOD made He Man.</hi> But here is a Formed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of <hi>Destroying Humane Lives</hi> by multitudes; Lives of Creatures
bearing the <hi>Image of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND by how much the more Necessary this is in many Cases,
so much the more Grievous and Calamitous a Thing it is, that
when to Cut Off and Destroy by multitudes so <hi>Precious Things</hi> as
<hi>Humane Lives,</hi> is <hi>Tragical</hi> and <hi>Horrid,</hi> not to do it is so much
<hi>Worse!</hi> Yea, That <hi>War</hi> it self is become an Art, and that the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and Skill which belong to it are Laudable Excellencies, is all
Aggravation of the Sadness of this Case.</p>
            <p>AND if we do consider the Consequences and Effects which
do ensue upon such <hi>War,</hi> How full of Horror and Frightfulness are
they! And those most of all, that are least of all thought on, and
that lye most out of view: For, besides that Property is gone, and
no Man knows what to call his own, Laws lose their Force, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
their Authority, and Reverence, Civil Government is Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey'd
and Despised, Common Order is Violated and Turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Confusion; Families torn in pieces, Countries laid Waste and
Desolate, Towns and Cities Sack'd, Ravag'd, and made Ruinous
Heaps. Besides all this, (I say) the Sacred Rites and Mysteries of
Religion are Neglected and Profaned, its Holy Solemnities inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
Worshipping Assemblies are broken up. Men have little
Opportunity left them to mind their great Concerns with GOD,
and for another World; Care for Immortal Souls, when it is most
Necessary, is thrown out of doors, and Reasonal Creatures, that
should be employed in Adoring and Worshipping their <hi>Great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
the <hi>GOD of their Lives,</hi> are Employed in Designing the <hi>Mutual
Destruction</hi> of one anothers Lives: And it may be, that is least
consider'd, which carries the most of Horror in it, that multitudes
are hurried down to Perdition, neither <hi>Dread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> by themselves, nor
<hi>Apprehended</hi> by the Destroyer; Souls are passing in shoals into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
they not considering it who are sent, nor they that send
them! And what sport does this make for <hi>Devils,</hi> those Envious
<hi>Apostate Spirits,</hi> that first drew Men into a like Apostacy, that
when GOD had given this Earth to the Children of Men, Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to themselves a worse abode amidst <hi>Infernal Darkness</hi> and <hi>Flames,</hi>
they should be Tearing one another in pieces about this their
Portion, under the <hi>Sun,</hi> making <hi>GOD</hi>'s <hi>Bounty</hi> to them the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their <hi>doing all manner of Violence to one another!</hi> That the
<hi>Prince of the Apostacy,</hi> the <hi>Vsuping God of this World,</hi> should have the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99795:8"/>
               <hi>Opportunity</hi> of <hi>Peholding Man</hi> sometime, by <hi>Divine Grant</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi>
of it, now its slave, and his Captive by it! Led by him at his will,
into whatsoever is most <hi>Repugnant</hi> to the Will, and the very Nature
of his Maker. That whereas he was at first made after <hi>GOD</hi>'s
<hi>own Image,</hi> a <hi>God-like Creature</hi> resembling his <hi>Maker,</hi> especially in
<hi>Spirituality,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> he now more resembles in Sensuality
<hi>Beasts,</hi> and in malignity <hi>Devils,</hi> and both, by an <hi>Inordinate Love</hi> of
this World; the <hi>Friendship</hi> whereof, and a mind <hi>Cornalized</hi> by it,
is <hi>Enmity against GOD. (Jam.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 7.) And whereof also,
because every Man thinks his own share too little, he becomes any
ones <hi>Enemy,</hi> that hath more of it than himself.</p>
            <p>AND thus have <hi>Devils</hi> the pleasure of <hi>Beholding Men</hi> by this
very <hi>Gift</hi> and <hi>Expression</hi> of <hi>GOD's Love</hi> and <hi>Kindness</hi> to them,
Transformed into <hi>Emnity,</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> of himself and one another,
Forsaken of Him, and Destroying each other, and hastening once
more into their Horrid Society; that as they were Accomplices
with them in their first <hi>Rebellion,</hi> they may be <hi>Partakers</hi> and <hi>Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates</hi>
with them in <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> and <hi>Torment.</hi> The most dismal part of the
<hi>Story,</hi> is that which lyes most out of sight.</p>
            <p>NOW let all this be considered and put together, and surely
<hi>Peace</hi> is a <hi>Valuable</hi> Thing, It speaks Man in some degree return'd
to himself, and in a right mind, when he can Agree and be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to let another live Quiet and Unmolested by him; one Man
another Man, and one Nation another Nation.</p>
            <p>THUS far does <hi>Peace</hi> appear a <hi>Blessing,</hi> a-part and by it self,
a <hi>Valuable Good,</hi> and, according to the Common Notion and Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
it may be called a <hi>Blessing,</hi> wherewith GOD <hi>Blesses</hi> His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in common with others. But we are further to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.</p>
            <p>2. WHAT Things are requisite to make this a <hi>Real,</hi> and a
<hi>Compleat Blessing,</hi> Capable of being Appropriated unto GOD's own
peculiar People. Which seems also to be Intended here, <hi>The
LORD will Bless His People with</hi> Peace. In Speaking to this, I
shall do these Two Things:</p>
            <p>1. MENTION the <hi>Requisites</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p>2. SHEW their <hi>Requisiteness:</hi> Or, Shew what is <hi>Requisite</hi>
to make <hi>External Peace,</hi> a Real and Peculiar <hi>Blessing.</hi> And
then shew you upon what Account the Addition and Concomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy
of such Things is <hi>Requisite,</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99795:9"/>
            <p>1. I shall shew you the Things that are requisite.</p>
            <p>1. SUCH Peace as we have been hitherto speaking of, is then
truly a Blessing, when there is in Conjunction with it, a very Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Effusion of the Spirit of GOD. In such a Concomitancy,
<hi>Peace</hi> will make a People, a Blessed People. When, after such
a Calamitous Dispensation was over, and at an End, as we
read of, <hi>Ezck.</hi> 39. wherein <hi>ver.</hi> 23. GOD is said to hide his
Face; and many of his People were carried into Captivity, and
many fell by the Sword, it comes at length to this, He will no
more hide his Face, or cover it with so ireful and gloomy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
and Appearances that it cannot be comfortably beheld.
'Tis for this very Reason, <hi>Because he pours forth his Spirit upon the
whole House of Israel,</hi> as it is in <hi>verse</hi> 29. of that Chapter, Pouring
forth, signifies a Copious Communication; and if the Spirit of
GOD be copiously communicated, the best of Blessings are in great
abundance contained in it, which will infer, or countervail what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is valuable or needful besides, to make the State of such a
People a Blessed State.</p>
            <p>2. IT will be so, when the Gospel of <hi>Peace</hi> has its free course,
and a large spread in the World. When, in Conjunction with
<hi>beating of Swords into Plow-shears, and Spears into Pruning-hooks, the
Law goes forth of Sion, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem;
and Nations shall say, Come, let us go up to the House of the Lord,
and he will teach us his Ways, and we will walk in his Statutes;</hi> as
in that of <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 2, 3. And</p>
            <p>3. WHEN, according to the Dictate of Divine Wisdom, <hi>Kings
do Reign</hi> (as <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15.) <hi>and Princes decree Justice;</hi> when GODS
People <hi>have Judges, as at the first, Counsellors as at the beginning,</hi>
Isa. 1, 26. <hi>able Men, Men of Truth, fearing GOD, and hating Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousuess,</hi>
Exod. 18. 21. When he is pleased to set Kings on the
Throne, <hi>that scatter the Wicked with their Fyes,</hi> and so to <hi>establish
the Throne in Righteousness;</hi> when there is a Design driven, by
those that bear the Civil Sword, the Sword of Justice, to be a
Terror to Evil-doers, but a Praise to them that do well; so as
it may be said upon this account, they are the Ministers of GOD
for good, whom he has been pleased to set in such Stations.</p>
            <p>4. WHEN GOD <hi>gives Pastors after his own Heart,</hi> that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and do make it their business, to <hi>feed his People with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and Vnderstanding.</hi> When he inspirits such to cry migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
to warn Men off from Sin, When Watchmen, set over his
People, are faithful in the business of their Station, at once both
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99795:9"/>
to save their People and Themselves, from having their Blood
required at the Hands of either. This will make a peaceful
State, an happy State; it will contribute a great deal towards it.
And again, when hereupon, in the</p>
            <p>5. PLACE, Wickedness languishes, the Lusts of Men droop
and wither. There is some visible restraint, if there be not an
universal Mortification, of such Fruits of the Flesh as those that
are spoken of <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, wrath,
strife, sedition, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revilings,</hi>
and such like, that are inconsistent with a share in the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Kingdom of <hi>GOD,</hi> as it after follows. This does
much to the making a peaceful State of Things, a Blessed State;
it takss away much of the Occasion of further Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>GOD</hi> and such a People. But</p>
            <p>6. WHEN there is a very great Diffusion of an Holy new
Nature, which carries the Matter higher, and is a great Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though in certain Conjunction with the former; as it is
when the Lusts, and Works of the Flesh do cease to be Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Rampant among them, who Live under the Gospel,
through the victorious and more powerful Operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Grace breathing in it. For then by the Influence of the same
Spirit, not only such vicious Inclinations are pluck't up by the
Roots, as certainly withstand a Peoples Felicity; but such posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Principles are implanted, as tend to promote it. Yet since
this Conjunction is not constant, but such insolencies of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as more directly tend to make a People miserable, may
be represt by Inferiour Causes: I therefore more expresly add,
that then <hi>Peace</hi> may be reckon'd a certain, and a full Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
when with it we behold a Divine Offspring continually
rising up, of Men appearing to be Born of <hi>GOD,</hi> and to have
received a <hi>GOD</hi> like Nature; apt to do Good, and become
Blessings to the World. When there is a Rising Generation
of such! Not proselyted to this or that Party, but to real substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Godliness and Christianity. When Multitudes are thus turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the Lord, When there are numerous Conversions, a
new Creation is springing up in visible and multiply'd instances,
so as that Holiness comes to be both an extensive and illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing; when <hi>Multitude</hi> comes to give Reputation to seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Religion; when it is no longer a Reproach to be a visible
Fearer of <hi>GOD,</hi> because generally Men are so. When it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99795:10"/>
look'd upon as no fashionable Thing, to be a despifer of God,
and Heaven, and to breath out Contempt, of the Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that gave us Breath. And</p>
            <p>7. WHEN hereupon, the Divine Government obtains and
takes place in the Minds and Consciences of Men. When his
Authority is owned with Reverential Submission. Then <hi>GOD</hi>
does Bless a People, when his Fear spreads far and near; <hi>GOD
shall bless us, and all the Ends of the Earth shall fear Him;</hi> as in
that <hi>Psalm</hi> 67, the latter end. And again,</p>
            <p>8. WHEN there is a manifest Power and prevalency of
Divine Love amongst Men, that bear the same Name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
when that <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> Rules in their Hearts, unto
which they are all called in one Body. When they observably
keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of <hi>Peace.</hi> When
they have <hi>Peace</hi> one towards another, so as that it may be seen
that they are all the Sons of <hi>Peace,</hi> the Children of the same
Father, who has conveyed it into them, as part of that Divine
Nature, which he communicates to the Regenerate Seed, when
there is a natural Propensity to one another, that they can no
more Violate and Tear that vital Bond of Love and <hi>Peace</hi> that
is among them, than they can endure to Tear their own Flesh,
or pluck out their own Eyes. When <hi>Peace</hi> among Christians,
appears to be a connatural Thing, not the product of Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
and prudential Considerations only; but a Nature, which
none can more endure to Counter-Act, than to offer Violence
to themselves; a Thing which Nature admits not, whose Laws
never allow it to Act against it self. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> WHEN, upon all this, GOD appears to be <hi>Reconciled</hi>
unto such a People, <hi>For in His Favour is Life.</hi> When all these
Things do concur, as so many Indications of His being at <hi>Peace</hi>
with them, <hi>i. e.</hi> That He has intirely Forgiven them All Former
Offences, <hi>That their Sins and Iniquities He remembers no more;</hi> And
these concur with such Things as partly Make, and partly Argue
them, the Objects of His Delight, <hi>That He has Written His Law in
their Hearts,</hi> He has <hi>Put His Spirit into them,</hi> He has made them a
<hi>Company of God-like Creatures like Himself, whose very Nature is
Love;</hi> they are his Living Resemblances in that very Respect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
herein His <hi>Vertues,</hi> who has <hi>Called them out of Darkness,
into His own Glorious and Marvelious Light.</hi> Hereupon, such a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may reckon themselves secure of GOD's own Prefence, <hi>He is
in the midst of them,</hi> and His <hi>Glory</hi> ceases to hover, becomes with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99795:10"/>
them a Fixed Thing, settles its Station, as not about to discontinue
or remove; their Land may now be called, <hi>The Land of</hi> Immanuel,
and bears the Inscription <hi>GOD with us.</hi> The <hi>Tabernacle of
GOD is with them,</hi> and He is resolved to <hi>Dwell with</hi> them, and be
their GOD, and a-vow them before all the World for His <hi>Peculiar
People.</hi> After the <hi>many things</hi> that do concur together, in an Inferiour
kind, as the concomitants of a meerly External Peace as, <hi>That their
Sons grow up as Plants, their Daughters as so many Polished corner Stones,</hi>
that join together the Walls of a Pallace, that their <hi>Garners be full,</hi>
their <hi>Sheep numerous, their Oxen strong,</hi> &amp; that <hi>there be no complaining in
their Streets;</hi> after all these things, it is subjoned, Yea, <hi>Happy is the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whose GOD is the LORD.</hi> All the foremention'd things, alone,
will never make a Blessing worthy of a People peculiar to GOD.
But when it can be said, That the LORD is their GOD, they are
an Happy People indeed, <hi>Psalm</hi> 144. 12. 15. Such as these are the
Things <hi>Requisite</hi> to make <hi>Peace</hi> a Compleat <hi>Blessing.</hi> But now
we are</p>
            <p>2. TO shew you the Requisiteness of the Concurrence and
Concomitancy of such Things to the mentioned Purpose; or
how it may appear, that such Things as these are necessary to
compleat this Blessing, or to make it a truely valuable, or a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Blessing. In Order hereto Note,</p>
            <p>1. THAT there is such a Thing, as a <hi>special Blessing,</hi> very
distinguishable from such Blessings as are meerly Common. We
read of one <hi>Jabez,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron,</hi> 4. 9, 10. said to be <hi>more honourable
than his Brethren.</hi> And somewhat very remarkable (as we are
to reckon, when to the Divine Wisdom it was thought fit to be
inserted amidst a Genealogical Discourse) is further said of him;
<hi>viz.</hi> That he called to the <hi>GOD of Israel,</hi> saying, <hi>O! that thou
wouldst Bless me indeed,</hi> &amp;c. And 'tis added, <hi>GOD granted what
he Requested.</hi> It seems, besides what goes under the Common
Notion of <hi>Blessing,</hi> he reckon'd there was somewhat more Peculiar,
which he calls <hi>Blessing indeed.</hi> There is a known <hi>Hebraism</hi> in
that Expression. What we read <hi>Bless me indeed,</hi> is, <hi>Bless me in
Blessing me;</hi> q. d. Let me have <hi>a Bleessing, within a Blessing;</hi> Let
me have <hi>that</hi> Blessing, whereof the <hi>other</hi> is but a <hi>Cortex, the
outside.</hi> Let me have that Blessing, that is wrapt up and enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the external Blessing. And because 'tis said, <hi>And GOD
granted his Request,</hi> we have Reason to understand, it was som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
very peculiar that <hi>GOD</hi> vouchsafed unto him: And that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99795:11"/>
account which some give us, has a look that way; that <hi>GOD</hi> vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
him somewhat more extraordinary in the kind of Mental
and Intellectual Endowments: For we are otherwise informed,
that this <hi>Jabez</hi> became a noted <hi>Doctor</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that
the City, called after his Name, was thereupon afterwards the
Residence of such as were most Learned in their Laws, <hi>Vatabl.
apud Critic.</hi> That is to be <hi>Blessed indeed,</hi> to have these Things
conferr'd, that do reach the Mind, and affect the inner Man;
to be blessed with Spiritual Blessings from the Heavenly Places,
as in that <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. There is a Spiritual sort of <hi>Blessing,</hi> that may
be enclosed in the External <hi>Blessing:</hi> And particularly in this of
<hi>Peace,</hi> which while it is common to the <hi>People of GOD,</hi> with
other Men is it self not common.</p>
            <p>2. I further Note, That the things I have mentioned to you, they
are of <hi>that special kind,</hi> they are either immediate Spiritual Blessings
or Subservient to such. Whereupon now we may, from several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
evince to you, that, <hi>without them,</hi> such an External
Good as <hi>this of Peace,</hi> is not a compleat Blessing:</p>
            <p>1. IT is no Argument of <hi>GOD</hi>'s <hi>Special Favour.</hi> The Best and
most Valuable Blessings are from the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, the good
pleasure of His Will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5. Other Men may enjoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Benefits, may both Prosper in War, and Flourish in Peace,
as well, and often more than <hi>GOD</hi>'s own <hi>People.</hi> You Read of a
Time, wherein <hi>the whole Earth</hi> is said to be <hi>at Rest and Quiet, Is.</hi> 14.
7. Therefore meer <hi>Peace</hi> is no mark of Special <hi>Divine Favour,</hi> and
so is not Abstractly considered, a Compleat Blessing; not a <hi>Self-desirable</hi>
Thing.</p>
            <p>2. MEN are not made by it the better Men; they may enjoy
<hi>Peace,</hi> and being Carnal-minded Men before, may still continue
so, as great Strangers to <hi>GOD</hi> as they were, as Vain and Sensual,
as Profligate and Licentious, as Useless in the World, as Mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous;
every way as Ill Men as ever. And</p>
            <p>3. THEY may, by meer External <hi>Peace,</hi> become so much the
worse Men. <hi>That</hi> may be an Occasion to them of their growing
worse and worse. <hi>The Prosperity of Fools</hi> (i. e. of Wicked Men)
<hi>slays and destroys them, Prov.</hi> 1. 32. 'Tis an Observation, that runs
through the Course of Time, that as Wars at length beget an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
Peace; so <hi>Peace,</hi> infers free Trade and Comerce, and that
<hi>Plenty,</hi> and that, Pride and Wantonness; so these run us back in an
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>esie, but unhappy Circle to be <hi>as we were,</hi> in War again. And if
tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> prove not the present or the speedy Consequent, <hi>that</hi> ensues
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99795:11"/>
which is worse than War, unless <hi>GOD</hi> vouchsafe that other sort of
Blessing, which will Influence, and Better Mens minds. Vice springs
up in the more fattened Soil. Mens Lusts will soon prove more
Oppressive Tyrants than they can have freed themselves from, by
the justest and most prosperous War, and will subdue them to a
far Viler and more Ignoble Servitude. An ingenious Writer of
those Affairs,<note place="margin">Vell: Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercul.</note> observes, that the former <hi>Scipio</hi> open'd the way to
the <hi>Roman Power;</hi> the <hi>Latter,</hi> to their <hi>Luxury.</hi> Their <hi>Vertue</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht,
and they were conquered by their own Vices, who before
could Conquer the World.<note n="â€ " place="margin">Sen.</note> That Noted Moralist says, <hi>Infirmi est
animi, non posse pati divitias.</hi> 'Tis a weak mind that cannot
bear a prosperous condition: But where are there minds strong
enough to bear it, if they be not Blest from Above with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
better than that <hi>Prosperity it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Men may, notwithstanding meer External <hi>Peace,</hi> he as misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in this, and in the other World, as if they had never known it;
and much more, if by it they have been the more wicked. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you consider, Are they a <hi>Blessed People?</hi> Or, Is that a <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Man,</hi> between whom and Eternal Misery there is but a breath?
He may but breathe another breath, and be in the midst of Flames;
Is he Happy this moment, that may be as Miserable as any Devil
the next? Those things can only be compleat Blessings to any, that
are inseparable ones, and that will make them for ever Blessed. For
me to have but such a Blessing, as does not make me Blessed!
What an unblest Blessing is this! A <hi>Philosopher</hi> can tell you, Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
cannot be a thing separable from my self; not a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Arist.</hi> It can much less be such a thing as may leave me miserable
to all Eternity, least of all, what may make me so, by degenerating
into a Curse, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE these are demonstrations that <hi>meer External
Peace,</hi> without such Additions as you have heard of, can never be a
<hi>Compleat Blessing,</hi> nor such as can be understood vouchsafed to the
People of <hi>GOD,</hi> as their Ultimate and Consummative Felicity.</p>
            <p>IT must in the mean time be acknowledg'd, that as a People
may belong to <hi>GOD, Externally</hi> more than another People; and
may some time be <hi>Externally</hi> more reformed than <hi>at other times;</hi> so
<hi>Peace,</hi> with other <hi>External Good</hi> Things, may thereupon be afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, as <hi>Less-expressive Marks</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi>'s Favour, and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their more Regular Course. And by the Tenor of <hi>GOD</hi>'s
particular Covenant with the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> might more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99795:12"/>
be expected so to be. Yet this is a State wherein it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
or safe for any finally to acquiess.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I therefore now come to the promised</hi> Vse, <hi>which will correspond
to the two</hi> General Heads <hi>I have been discoursing of First,</hi> To let
you s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e what cause of Thanksgiving we have in reference to the former,
the Blessing of Peace abstractly considered. <hi>And, Secondly,</hi> What
Cause of Supplication we have, in reference to the latter, the Additions
that are requisite to make it a Compleat Blessing.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As to the former,</hi> Since <hi>Peace</hi> is so Valuable a Thing, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
a-part, as you have heard it is. This points out to us
<hi>The matter of Than<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>sgiving,</hi> for which this day is appointed, That
<hi>GOD</hi> has preserved our KING, amidst so innumerable <hi>Dangers</hi>
abroad; That He has brought him home to us in <hi>Safety;</hi> That He
has made him the Instrument of That <hi>Peace,</hi> that we find is at
length brought about, wherein he is returned to us a <hi>Greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,</hi>
than if he had Routed and Destroyed never so Potent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of our Enemies in the Field, we have Reason to understand
the matter so. By prevailing in War, he had only Conquered by
<hi>Force;</hi> by prevailing for Peace, he has Conquered by <hi>Wisdom</hi> and
<hi>Goodness.</hi> By prevailing in War, he had only Conquered the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Power of our Enemies, or their baser part; by prevailing for
Peace, he has Conquered their minds. By prevailing in War, he
had brought about the Good only of one side; by prevailing for
Peace, he has brought about the Real Benefit of both sides, a far
more diffusive Blessing. By prevailing in War, he had Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Enemies; by prevailing for <hi>Peace,</hi> he has Conquered Enmity it
self. By prevailing in War, he had over-come other Men; but
in prevailing for <hi>Peace,</hi> considering his Martial Spirit, and his high
Provocations, he has done a far Greater Thing, he has Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself, whom none ever Conquered before.</p>
            <p>BESIDES what this Great Blessing of Peace, generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
contains in it self, we ought to Amplify it to our selves,
being brought about by such means, wherein we have so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
a Concern. This ought to add with us a very Grateful Relish
to it, for it is a Glory to our Nation, that <hi>GOD</hi> has set a <hi>Prince</hi> on
the <hi>English</hi> Throne, that could signifie so much to the World; the
Beams of that Glory, <hi>GOD</hi> hath cast on him, reflect, and shine upon
His People; to be made the <hi>Head</hi> among other Nations, and not
the Tail; <hi>GOD</hi> hath in His Word Taught us, Not to count it an
inconsiderable thing. And it is our more peculiar Glory, that
our KING is Renowned, not by throwing <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99795:12"/>
every where <hi>round about him;</hi> but by spreading the Benefits includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Peace</hi> through the Neighbour-Nations. And is Returned to us,
leaving the rest of <hi>Europe</hi> only to Lament that they all live not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Government; I pray <hi>GOD</hi> he may meet with no Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Returns; and that none may be so ill-minded as to grudge at
Power so lodg'd as to save us, who were less concern'd at its being
lodg'd, where it could only be designed to destroy us. In the
mean time, it might Excite us to the higher pitches of Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to Almighty <hi>GOD,</hi> for this Blessing of the <hi>Present Peace,</hi> if
we did consider,</p>
            <p>BOTH, what it hath Cost.</p>
            <p>AND whereto it is Improvable.</p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>Former Consideration</hi> I shall not insist upon, lest any
should make an undue use of it.</p>
            <p>AND the <hi>Latter,</hi> I leave to the following Head, which we are
next to proceed to, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> TO shew what matter of Supplication remains to
us <hi>upon the latter Account,</hi> that is, with Reference to such
things as are yet wanting to make this <hi>Blessing of Peace</hi> a <hi>Compleat
Blessing,</hi> and without which it cannot be understood to be such;
but we may be left, at last, a most miserable People; and so
much the more miserable, by how much the higher Favours we
have to account for, that not being Improved, must have been
thrown away upon us. The Mercies included in the Peace, will
be unimproved and lost, without the mentioned Additions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
all the several Heads that were Recited belong to one, <hi>Viz,</hi>
That of <hi>Spiritual Blessing; That</hi> therefore <hi>in the General,</hi> we have
to pray for, that <hi>GOD</hi> may be said to <hi>Bless us indeed,</hi> to <hi>Bless us in
Blessing us,</hi> viz. <hi>That He would Bless us with Spiritual Blessings in the
Heavenlies,</hi> (i. e. in Heavenly Things, or from the Heavenly Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
<hi>in Christ Jesus,</hi> as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>LET us I Pray you Learn to distinguish between a <hi>Self-desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Good,</hi> that <hi>in its own Nature, is such,</hi> so immutably, and
invariably that it can never degenerate, or cease to be such;
And <hi>what is only such by Accident,</hi> and in some Circumstances
may be much otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SPIRITVAL Good,</hi> that of the Mind and Spirit, and
which makes that better, especially that which accompanies Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 9. That runs into Eternity, and goes with us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the other World, is of the <hi>former Sort.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99795:13"/>
            <p>EXTERNAL Good, <hi>is but</hi> Res Media, <hi>capable of being</hi>
to us, <hi>sometimes Good, and sometimes Evil, as the Case may
alter.</hi> Blessings of this kind <hi>may become</hi> Curses. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 2. I will
Curse your Blessingsâ€”yea I have cursed them alreadyâ€”. <hi>A
Mans</hi> Table may become his Snare, and that which was for his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
a Trap, <hi>Psalm</hi> 69. 22.</p>
            <p>MEERLY External Blessings, are Curses, when they become
the fewel of Lusts, when they animate Men unto Contests a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Heaven, rebellions against the Divine Government; when,
like <hi>Jesurun,</hi> Men wax Fat by them, and Kick against Heaven,
<hi>Deut,</hi> 32. This we are always liable to, till Spiritual Blessings,
intermingle with our other Blessings. And nothing should more
convince the World, that the kindest and most benign Part of
the Divine Government lies in immediate Influences on the
Minds of Men, and that consequently their own Felicity depends
thereon. Let all things that can be imagined, concur in the
kind of <hi>External Good;</hi> and they can never make him an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Man, that has an ill Mind: He will always be his own
Hell, and carry that about with him wheresoever he goes; He
will be a constant Spring and Fountain of Misery to Himself;
Misery, and he cannot be separated from one another. <hi>There
is no Peace to the Wicked, saith my GOD; but he will be always
a troubled Sea, whose Waters cast forth Mire and Dirt,</hi> Isa. 57.
20, 21. <hi>The Philosophy of Pagans</hi> would have made them asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to Place their Felicity in any Thing without, or Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
to themselves.</p>
            <p>BUT we are <hi>Christians,</hi> and shall we not much more be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
to take <hi>other,</hi> or even <hi>opposite Measures of Blessedness,</hi> to
those which are given us by our <hi>Divine Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO be <hi>Toor</hi> in <hi>Spirit;</hi> upon just accounts <hi>Mourners,</hi> Meek,
<hi>Hungry and Thirsty after Righteousness, Merciful, Pure in Heart.
Peace-Makers.</hi> To submit <hi>to be persecuted for Righteousness-sake.</hi>
These are his Characters of a Blessed Man. And He places
that Blessedness it self in Congenerous Things, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3, 4,
5, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>LET us Learn from him; and Collect that nothing but
Wickedness can make us miserable. What an overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Deluge have we in View? Tending to subvert <hi>our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Our Civil</hi> State together! Nor have we another Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Remedy in view, but the Spirit of GOD, if He will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to pour it forth. <hi>The great Enemy of Mankind is come
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99795:13"/>
in upon us like a Flood; and only the Spirit of the Lord can lift up
a Standard against him,</hi> Isa. 59. 19. The Spirit of the Lord
would be to us as a purifying Flame, to burn up our Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and enkindle in us that Divine Love, that would make us
<hi>Zealous of good Works.</hi> And this should be with us the Matter
of earnest and incessant Supplication, not with Diffidence, for
<hi>He will give his Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> Luke 11. 13. Nor with
diminishing Thoughts of the Necessity and Value of the Gift.
Take heed of that, for that were to be miserable and undone
by a Principle; To be misled by a prophane false Judgment,
into the Contempt of the most highly valuable Things, that are
most necessary to our true Welfare. And which are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Gift of the Spirit, as you may see by comparing
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. and <hi>Luke</hi> 11. with one another. In the one Place it
is said. <hi>He will give good Things to them that ask him;</hi> in the
other Place it is said, <hi>his Spirit;</hi> implying, that the Gift of the
Spirit Involves in it <hi>all good Things.</hi> And certainly nothing can
be good to any Man, till he hath that Spirit that makes him
Good: And we are greatly concerned, to Supplicate mightily
for the Effusion of that Blessed Spirit, for these two Purposes
especially. <hi>First,</hi> That there may be a larger Diffusion amongst
us of <hi>Vital Religion,</hi> whereby we shall be at Peace with GOD.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Christian Love</hi> may more abound, whereby Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
may be composed to mutual Peace, and more dispos'd to
mutual Communion with one another.</p>
            <p>1. THAT there may be a larger Diffusion of <hi>Vital Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
Wherein stands indeed their being at Peace with GOD,
when there is a mutual amplexus between him and them, Mind
touching Mind, and Spirit Spirit; when He does, by His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
embrace the Spirits of Men, and infuse Light and Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and adapt and suit them for <hi>his Communion.</hi> To
this Purpose, we have great Cause to beg and supplicate ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
for a greater <hi>pouring forth of his Spirit</hi> that this
<hi>living Religion</hi> may spread amongst us: For we appear to be
under a Doom, while it does not so, <hi>that seeing we should see,
and not perceive, &amp;c. Isa.</hi> 6. O the fearful guilt incurr'd
one Lords Day after another! When great Assemblies meet
together, Multitudes are besought and supplicated, that they
would be Reconciled to GOD, but too few Listen. Peace
with GOD, seems not a valuable Thing with us, <hi>His Favour
in which is Life,</hi> is little set by. When, with many a one, a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99795:14"/>
Treaty is continued, in Order to Peace, through many Years,
Seven, Ten, Twenty, Thirty, nay Forty Years; and yet this
Treaty brings not about a Peace at last; but they stand out
still, hardened in their Impenitency, Infidelity, Obstinacy, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
against GOD and his Christ, through the Power and
Dominion that an Earthly, Vain, Carnal Mind has in them, and
over them. What can our Peace with Men signifie in this
Case? What <hi>do we not know, that the Friendship of this World is
Enmity against God?</hi> James 4. 4. 1 John 2. 15. And that it is
as impossible, for a Man to be a sincere Lover of GOD, and
an over-intense Lover of this World, as to have <hi>two GODS,
i. e. two Supream Powers</hi> to govern him, two <hi>Supream Goods</hi> to
satisfie him. This must breed a perpetual War, till the Case
alters between Thee, and Him that made Thee; and <hi>Woe to
him that strives with His Maker!</hi> To have the Wrath of GOD,
Armed with Omnipotency, engaged against Thee; and yet
that thou shouldest not covet Peace, that yet thou shouldst
not cry for Peace! To have the Peace-making Blood of thy
Redeemer, crying to Thee, O he at Peace with GOD! To
have Him that shed it thus bespeaking Thee, I am ready to
do the Part of a Days-man; I have dyed upon the Cross, that
I might do so, that I might effect and bring about a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
GOD and Thee. I am ready to Mediate, make Use
of Me. I will undertake on GODS Part, that He shall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
Thee, that He shall Forgive Thee, and let the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
fall, if yet thy Heart, on thy Part, will yeild, melt,
and relent, and thou cry for Mercy. He came with this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
into this World, the Proclamation of Angels at His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spake his Design, <hi>Glory to GOD in the Highest, and Peace
on Earth, and Good Will towards Men.</hi> Shall not all this be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved?
Or shall Men pretend to believe it, and not Consider
it, or not Look upon it, as a considerable Thing?</p>
            <p>2. AND there is as much need too, that we supplicate for
this Spirit, as a Spirit of mutual Love among Christians, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
them to one another. Which indeed is also but to
Christianize them, to make Vital Religion take Place with them.
For that same Spirit of Christ, which animates his Body, and
makes them his Living Members, makes them such to one another.
And the Matter speaks it self, That opposite Spirit unto truly
Christian Peace and Love which appears amongst us, nothing but
the Spirit of Christ can overcome; we are not to expect a Cure
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99795:14"/>
of our Distempers in this Kind, but by the pouring forth of this
Blessed Spirit: And if there be not a Cure, we are certainly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the pouring forth of his Wrath. And Things look with a
Threatning Aspect upon us to this Purpose. Now that Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
is so Inviting, GODS Call so Loud, and the Way so
Plain. That yet an Indisposition to Peace should be so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
that Breaches should be kept open by Trifles, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Things, of which no Man of Sense can pretend to
give an Account. That there is Strife, too manifestly not from
the Love of <hi>Truth</hi> whereof not one Hair needs be Lost (nor
of any other valuable Thing) but meerly from the Love of
Strife; when as to the most Material and Important Truths,
Men are agreed, but would <hi>seem</hi> to disagree; they Mean the
same Things, but impute to one another a different Meaning;
and pretend to know the others Mind better than themselves,
that on that pretence they may Quarrel with them! All this
looks Fatally. And <hi>our unjust Angers at one another,</hi> are too
expressive of <hi>GODS just Anger with us all;</hi> that his Good
Spirit, that Spirit of Love, Peace, Kindness, Benignity is so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
Resisted, Vexed, Grieved, and Despited by us. And
the Consequences are likely, <hi>for some Time,</hi> to be very Dismal.
Though when GOD hath proceeded in a Way of Punitive
Animadversion, so far as he shall Judge necessary for the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of his own Name, and the Honour of our Religion so
scandalously misrepresented to the World, it will be easie to Him,
by one Victorious Effort of that Spirit to reduce the Christian
Church to its Original, genuine Temper; and make it shine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
in its own Native Light, and Lustre. But in the Mean
Time, I cannot see, that there is greater need of an over-pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Influence of the Holy Ghost, to draw Men into Union
with Christ, and thereby to bring back Apostate Souls to
GOD, or to work in them <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> than to bring
them into Union <hi>upon Christian Terms,</hi> with one another. Or
that the Love of this World, or any the most ignominious sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Lust, or Vice (Drunkenness, Gluttony, or any other) are
more hardly, or more rarely overcome, than the Envy, Wrath,
Malice, which Christians ordinarily, are not at all shy of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
toward one another.</p>
            <p>I speak upon some Experience, lamenting that having this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
(which Sense of Duty will not let me balk) I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
so much Cause, to mention that foregoing Observation. For
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99795:15"/>
I cannot forget, that sometime Discoursing with some very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Persons about the business of Union among Christians, it
hath been freely granted me, that there was not so much as a
Principle left (among those the Discourse had Reference to)
upon which to Disagree. And yet the same fixed Aversion to
Union, continued as before; as a plain Proof, they were not
<hi>Principles,</hi> but <hi>Ends,</hi> we were still to differ for. In this Case,
what but the Power of an Almighty Spirit can overcome? To
quote Texts of Scripture upon such Occasions, signifies nothing,
even to those who profess a Veneration for those Holy Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of GOD. Let such Places be mention'd, as are expresly
directed against Division, Wrath, Strife, Slandering or Backbiting
one another, and they avail no more, than if the Vice, were
the Vertue, or the Vertue the Vice; no more than if it were
a Command to Christians, to Malign, to Traduce, to Backbite
one another. To urge so plain and numerous Scriptures in
these Cases, it is to as little Purpose, as to oppose ones Breath
to a Storm; It is the same Thing, as if all Scriptures, that
had any Aspect or Look this Way, were quite put out of
the <hi>Canon,</hi> and all this, with Men zealous for the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scripture. And indeed it is come to that pass
as to look like a Jest, to expect that any Man should be sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Scripture, or the most convincing Reason agreeable thereto,
against his own Passion or Humour, or against the (supposed
though never so grosly mistaken) Interest of his Party.</p>
            <p>NOR is it meer <hi>Peace,</hi> that is to be aimed at, but <hi>free, mutual
Christian Communion</hi> with such, as do all <hi>hold the Head, Christ.</hi> As
Peace between Nations infers Commerce, so among Christian
Churches, it ought to infer a Fellowship in Acts of Worship. I
wish there were no Cause to say this is declined, when no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is left against it but false Accusation; none but what must
be supported by Lying and Calumny: Too many are busie at
inventing of that which is no where to be found, that Exists
not in the Nature of Things, that they may have a Colour
for continued Distance. And is not this, to fly in the Face
of the Authority under which we Live? <hi>i. e.</hi> The Ruling Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Kingdom of Christ, the Prince of Peace? 'Tis strange
they are not ashamed to be called Christians; that they do
not Discard and Abandon the Name, that can allow themselves
in such Things! And 'tis here to be Noted, that 'tis quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Thing, what is in it self <hi>True</hi> or <hi>False, Right</hi> or <hi>Wrong,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:99795:15"/>
and what is to be a <hi>Measure</hi> or <hi>Boundary</hi> of <hi>Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
Are we yet to Learn, that Christian Communion is not
amongst Men that are perfect, but that are Labouring under
manifold Imperfections, both in Knowledge and Holiness! And
whatsoever Mistake in Judgment, or Obliquity in Practice, can
consist with <hi>holding the Head,</hi> ought to consist also with being
of the same Christian Communion; not the same <hi>Locally</hi> which
is impossible; but the same occasionally, as any Providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
at this or that Time; and Mentally, in Heart and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
at all Times. And to such Peace (and consequently Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion)
we are <hi>all called in one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ody,</hi> Col. 3. 15. We are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
required to <hi>receive one another</hi> (which cannot but Mean
into each others Communion) and <hi>not to doubtful Disputations,</hi>
Rom. 14. 1. If any be Thought to be Weak, and thereupon
to Differ from us in some or other Sentiments, if the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
consists <hi>with holding the Head,</hi> they are not, because they
are Weak, to be Refused Communion, but Received; and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ecause tbe Lord has Received them,</hi> Ver. 3. All that we
should think Christ has Received into his Communion, we ought
to Receive into ours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 7. Scriptures are so express to
this Purpose, that nothing can be more.</p>
            <p>AND, indeed, to make New Boundaries of Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
is to make a New Christianity, and a <hi>New Gospel,</hi> and
New Rules of Christ's Kingdom; and, by which to distinguish
Subjects and Rebels, and in Effect to Dethrone Him, to Rival
Him in His highest Prerogative, <hi>viz.</hi> The Establishing the Terms
of Life and Death, for Men Living under his Gospel. It is
to Confine Salvation, in the Means of it, to such or such a
Party, such a Church; arbitrarily Distinguished from the rest of
Christians. As if the Priviledges of his Kingdom belong'd to a
Party only; and that, for instance the Lords Table were to
lose its Name, and be no longer so called, but the Table of this
or that Church, constituted by <hi>Rules of their own Devising.</hi>
For if it be the Lords Table, they are to keep it Free, to be
approach't upon the Lords Terms, and not their own. In the
mean time, what higher Invasion can there be of Christs
Rights? And since the Christian Church became so overwise,
above what is Written in framing New Doctrines, and Rules
of Worship, How miserably it hath Languish't, and been Torn
in Pieces, they cannot be ignorant who have read any Thing
of the History of it.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:99795:16"/>
            <p>AND indeed there is not a Difference to be found, amongst
them <hi>that hold the Head,</hi> but must be so Minute, that it cannot be
a Pretence for Refusing Communion. For true Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
will at least Resolve it into Weakness. And Men are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
so kind to themselves, that he from whom another dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
will be very apt to think himself the stronger; then does
the Rule conclude him, <hi>You that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e Strong, bear the Infirmities
of the Weak,</hi> and do not Dispute with them, but Receive them.
This Obligation immediately lies <hi>on the Strong,</hi> and therefore
must take hold of them that think themselves so, not to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
with the others but receive them, and <hi>because the Lord
has Received them.</hi> Does He take them into his Communion,
and will not You take them into Yours? To profess want of
Charity in Excuse, is to Excuse a Fault by a Wickedness. It
is to Usurp Christs Judgment-Seat, and Invade His Office, <hi>Rom.</hi>
14. 4, 10. Therefore wheresoever there is any such Case to
be found, that let a Man be never so sound in the Faith, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so Orthodox, let him be in all Things else never so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
through his whole Conversation, if he do not submit to
some doubtful Thing, Thought perhaps a Matter of indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on the one side, and unlawful on the other; this Person
must be excluded Christian Communion, for no other known
Pretence, but only that he <hi>presumed to Doubt</hi> somewhat in the
imposed Terms; for <hi>this very Doubt</hi> he is to be Treated as
an <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Publican,</hi> or indeed no more to be Received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Communion, than a Dog or a Swine. How will this
be Justified at Christ's Tribunal!</p>
            <p>BUT how much less justisiable is it, if not only <hi>Communion be
Pefused,</hi> but <hi>Ruine Designed,</hi> to such as Differ from us about
those our Arbitrary Additions to Christs Rules, and Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Christian Communion.</p>
            <p>AND scarce can a very serious Person (even in so serious
a Matter) forbear to Smile, when they see them that have
done so much harm to their <hi>Felion-Christians,</hi> attempt to justifie
it, only in Effect from their having Power to do it; which would
as well justifie any Thing, since no Man does what he could
not do.</p>
            <p>NOR yet do I look upon this Proneness, to innovate and
devise other Terms of Christian Communion than Christ hath
Himself appointed, <hi>as the Peculiar Character of a Party:</hi> But as
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Symptom</hi> of the diseased State of the Christian Church, too
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99795:16"/>
plainly appearing in all Parties. As I also reckon it too low
and narrow a Design, to aim at a <hi>Oneness of Communion</hi> among
Christians of this and that single <hi>Party</hi> and <hi>Perswasion;</hi> which
would but make so much the Larger <hi>Vleus,</hi> and <hi>Tumor</hi> a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
unnatural <hi>Apostem</hi> or <hi>Secession,</hi> in the Sacred Body of our
Blessed Lord. Nothing in this Kind, can be a Design worthy
of a Christian, or suitable to the Spirit of Christ, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>t to have
<hi>Christian Communion Extended and Limitted,</hi> according to the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi>
and <hi>Limits</hi> of <hi>visibly Serious and vital Christianity.</hi> And
hereof, that distinguishing Judgment, which is necessary, is as
little difficult as in <hi>Private Conversation</hi> between a <hi>Visible Friend,</hi>
and a <hi>Visible Enemy,</hi> or <hi>in Publick</hi> and Political, between a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Subject,</hi> and a <hi>Visible Rebel.</hi> So far as a Discrimination can
and according to Christs Rules (not our own unbounded Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)
ought to be made, any serious <hi>Living Christian,</hi> of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Party or Denomination; I ought to communicate with
<hi>as such, and with only such.</hi> For <hi>Living Christians</hi> to <hi>sever</hi> from
one another, or to mingle with the Dead, is an equal Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.
Nor must our Judgment of any such Case, be guided
by meer Charity, but must guide it, being it self guided by the
known Laws of Christ.</p>
            <p>TO Summ up all, when once we shall have Learned to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christianity, and <hi>accidental
Appendages,</hi> And between Accidents of Christ's appointing, and
of our Devising, and to dread affixing of our own Devices to
so Sacred an Institution. Much more when every Truth or
Duty contained in the Bible, cannot be counted Essential or
Necessary, when we shall have learnt not only not to add Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our own to that Sacred Frame, but much more not
to presume to insert them into the Order of <hi>Essentials</hi> or <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,</hi>
and Treat Men as no Christians, for wanting them.
When the Gospel shall have its Liberty to the utmost Ends of
the Earth. When the Regenerating Spirit shall go forth with
it, and propagate a Divine and GOD like Nature every where
among Men. When Regeneration shall be understood to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the communicating of such a Nature, and such Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Men. When the weight of such Words comes to
be apprehended [<hi>He that hateth his Brother, abideth in Death,</hi>
1 John 2.] When to be Born of GOD ceases to signifie with
us, being Proselyted to this or that Church formed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
by Humane Device. When Religious Pretences
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99795:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Cease to serve Political Purposes, when the Interest of a
Party ceases to weigh more with us than the whole Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Interest. When Sincerity shall be Thought the noblest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishment
of a Christian, <hi>When the Wolf also shall direll with
the Lamb, and the Leopard shall Lie down with the Kid: And
the Calf, and the Young Lion and the Fatling together, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Child shall lead them. And the Cow and the Bear shall feed,
their Young Ones shall lie down together: And the Lion shall Eat
straw like the Ox. And the Sucking Child shall Play on the hole
of the Asp, and the Weaned Child shall put his Hand on the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice-Desn.
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
For the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as
the Waters cover the Sea,</hi> Isa. 11. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Then will our Peace
be as a River, and our Righteousness as the Waves of the Sea.</hi>
Isa. 48. 18. And <hi>the Glorious Lord will Himself be to us a
Place of broad Waters,</hi> Ch. 33. 21. Where Straits, and Rocks,
and Shelves, shall no more Affright or Endanger us. But if
these Things take no Place with us, then have we Cause to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that the Things of our Peace are yet hid from our Eyes.</p>
