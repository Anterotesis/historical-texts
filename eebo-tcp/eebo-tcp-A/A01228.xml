            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Fyre, ayre, earth, water were euery howre in an vproare,</l>

               <l>Fyre, ayre, earth, water were brought to a peacable order,</l>
               <l>When they lodged apart, each one in seueral harbor.</l>
               <l>Thus by a disioyning, Elements were mightily ioyned,</l>

Poets and Painters (men say) may well goe together, sith pen and pencill be both alike free, and doo equally challeng the selfe same prerogatiue. <hi>Cicero</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Fabius</hi> a famous Romaine, thought it an especiall commendation, to be surnamed <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> And, <hi>Antiquissimum è doctis fuit poetarum genus,</hi> saith the same <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero.</hi> When I talke of Painters, I meane not the ridiculous fraternitie of silly Wall-washers: neither doe I euer once thinke of our loftie rimers, when I make mention of Poets. Yet a wall may bee colored by an elegant Painter, but the conceite and elegancie is more then the colour: and poets (seeking as well to please, as to profit) haue well made choyce of verse, yet the making of a verse is no part of Poetrie: otherwise, the sweete and inimitable poeme of <hi>Heliodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> should be no Poeme, and euery vnreasonable rimer should weare a Lawrell garland. Both poetry, a speaking picture, and paynting, a dumbe poetry, were like in this, that the one and the other did vnder an amyable figure and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some veyle, as it were, couer the most sacred mysteries of auncient philosophie. Nay, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himselfe by his symbolicall kinde of teaching, as also <hi>Plato</hi> by his conceited parables and allegoricall discourses in his bookes called, Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus, Timoeus, and Symposium, may make any man beleeue, that as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Indians, Aethiopians, and Aegyptians kept their doctrine religiously se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for feare of prophanation, so the Grecians by their example, haue wrapped vp in tales, such sweete inuentions, as of the learned vnfolder may well be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vonderfull though to a vulgar conceit, they seeme but friuolus imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Yea that song of the most wise <hi>Salomon,</hi> called for the excellencie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the song of songs, is altogether mysticall and allegoricall, least any man thinke my speech but a tale, in attributing so much to poeticall tales: which, mee thinkes, may well bee compared to sweete grapes couered with leaues and bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, or to the old Sileni, which being but ridiculous in shew, did yet inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conteine the sacred image of some God.

Poeticall songs are Galeries set forth with varietie of pictures, to hold euery mans eyes, Gardens stored with flowers of sundry sauours, to delite euery mans sence, orchyards furnished with all kindes of fruite, to please euery mans mouth.

And as <hi>Vranius</hi> himself for his vertue was called <hi>Caelus,</hi> heauen, soe <hi>Vesta</hi> his wife, because she was a fruitefull and happy mother, was called <hi>Terra,</hi> the Earth. Of these two, <hi>Saturnus</hi> was born, wholy addicted to husbandry and tilling of the earth, and of nature slowe and heauy, like the earth. Allegorically thus; <hi>Saturnus</hi> is Sonne to <hi>Caelus,</hi> because he is the first Planete, and nearest to the highest heauen. He is also sonne to the earth, as in most of his naturall proprieties resembling the earth.

Thirdly <hi>Saturne</hi> by his influence worketh such a constitution and temperature in mens bodies, as is altogeather agreeable with the qualities of the earth, to wette, cold and dry, making them in whom he is predominant, sad, melancholicall, graue, heauy, pale, giuen to husbandry, building, and such like exercises. Whereupon he is figured as an olde man, sad, euil-fauoured, musing, badly cloathed, with a sithe in his hand, a fit instrument for his earthly practise. He afordeth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching wit, profound cogitations, perfect knowledge, sage and graue aduice, constancy of minde and perseuerance: by reason that the earthly nature of his mother is qualified and tempered with that of his caelestiall Father. Lastly, as of his Father he causeth perfection and excellency of minde, so by his mother he is the author of deformity and destruction of the body,</p>
               <p>His wife was called <hi>Ops,</hi> his owne sister, borne of the same Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Allegorically, <hi>Opis</hi> signifieth help or assistance, noting the ayde and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the earth herself towards the tilling of fyldes, building of howses, and founding of Cities. Soe is she worthily both sister to <hi>Saturne,</hi> as borne of <hi>Caelus,</hi> whose influence is the best mainteyner both of husbandry and earthly habitations: and also wife to <hi>Saturne,</hi> for that as he is the agent, soe herself is the patient in husbandry and fortification. <hi>Saturne</hi> bereft his father <hi>Caelus</hi> of those instruments which are fit for generation: <hi>Cronos,</hi> that is, <hi>Saturne,</hi> is time, time is the measurer of the worlds motion; therfore, as one world, soe one time, one <hi>Saturne;</hi> and <hi>Caelus</hi> can get no more like him, sith all is now spen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The borowed and common eye, which all they vse by course, is this infused light, deriued from one of them vnto another. <hi>Perseus</hi> beareth <hi>Gorgon;</hi> hee maketh men wonder at his excellent prowesse: Historically, <hi>Athenaeus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that in <hi>Lybia</hi> there was a kinde of beast like a calfe, killing with the very sight: one of them was brought dead to <hi>Marius,</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> his skinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so diuersly colored that none there, could gesse what beast it was, and that <hi>Perseus,</hi> by likelihood, killed some of these, figured here by <hi>Medusa.

O, it was a sweete sight, to beholde so many sageheads and gentle spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites thus vnited and assembled together. All being ready, they all made haste: some embarqued themselues, some traueled by land: others stayed in villages adioyning, expecting some heauenly apparition or reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from aboue. They that were in the ship, began to consult of their attempt; when, loe, on the sodayn, (such grace the heauens afforde to them that be heauenly affected) there came a straunger, yet an <hi>Aca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as our selues
<pb facs="tcp:5955:58"/>
were delighted in dressing and keeping of Gardens, so did we choose vs distinct names &amp; additions of seueral hearbs accordingly: so that one was called a Violet, an other a Thistle, this Lettuce, that Succorie; the rest, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Borage, Hmlock, Pasnip, Cowslip, Rosemary, or some like. But so it fell out on a day, as we were thus busied in our Harbour, we heard of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte scattered abroad, that a general deluge and inundation of waters should happen that yeare, as was foretolde by some idle Prognosticators. This straunge newes troubled the whole countrey; and, among others, vs poore Gardiners: who, hauing read this lewd Almanack, and considering the florishing discourses of these Astrologicall doctors (which threatned the Vines, Gardens, and Orchyards, with blasts, frosts, caterpillers, and a thousand such phantastical dangers) layd our heads together, and dealt, as I am about to tell you. First we offered sacrifice to <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Priapus,</hi> and then concluded, to send some of our Vniuersity as ambassadours to heauen: who by this one iourney, might doe a double seruice: the one, in seeing whether these tale-tell Astrologers had any ground for their predictions; the other in obtaining grace &amp; mercie of the Gods, by graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting plen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It were good, me thinks, <abbr>qd</abbr> he, to finde out a great &amp; mightie Egle, so strong, that some two of vs might mount on his back, &amp; he beare vs vp to the skies: Mary, we had need to look, that these 2 be not too heauy, or ouer-fat &amp; corpulent, lest the Egle be ouercharged. Therefore the <hi>Fennel,</hi> and the <hi>Violet,</hi> in my fancy, be the fittest for this purpose, as being deft and nimble fellowes, and as light as may be. Nay, sayd <hi>Cowslip,</hi> there is no reason at all to vse the help of an Egle in this matter, because you know that <hi>Iupiter</hi> himselfe was once trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an Egle, and caried vp to heauen an other kinde of burden, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Fennell</hi> or <hi>Violet.</hi> Then out stept <hi>Hemlock,</hi> with his fryse bonnet, and sayd, that he had sound a better and more compendious way to heauen, then that. It were not amisse, <abbr>qd</abbr> he, if we had a cart; because the iourney is long: and, the ambassadours may by this meanes trauel with greater ease and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie. Besides this, they may therein conuey to <hi>Olympus,</hi> some of the best fruites of our Gardens, to present the Gods withal when they come thither. The graue aduice of this fore-casting <hi>Academike,</hi> was generally wel liked of: sauing that they could not conceaue, who should draw the Cart: and therefore this inuention, the more pitie, came also to nothing. All the <hi>Academike</hi> Gardiners deuised and mused much, how it might be brought to passe. Some remembring <hi>Lucians</hi> ship, thought it best to goe by water: Others, rather by land, through some great forrest, as <hi>Dante</hi> did: at last, they all agreed, that the surest way was, to make ladders of the poles that bare vp their hoppes, and by the meanes thereof, to builde and rayse vp a towre that should ouer-looke the whole worlde: and so might
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:5955:58"/>
they in short time pierce the clowdes: and by certaine engynes still draw vp new stuffe to increase the height of their fortification, if occasion were. The towre begun, and halfe ended (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These three gathered diuers fruites, Raysons, and hearbs, to present the Lordes and Ladies of heauen withall, and to request diuers boones in the behalfe of our Vniuersitie. So we brought and accompanied them with great ioy, euen vnto the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp; saw them mount vp chearefuly. <hi>Hemlock</hi> was one <hi>Damoetas,</hi> of the Deareles parck, <hi>Fac-totu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeclinabile</hi> to the Lady of the Lake. <hi>Pasnip</hi> was a braue peece of a man, about foure and thirty yeares olde, fayre, streight, and vpright, so nimble and light, that he might well haue walked on the edge of a sworde, or poynt of a speare. The <hi>Thistle</hi> was more auncient, as hauing passed full fortie yeares, and was wholly addicted to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
               <p>After much mounting, when the learned <hi>Thistle</hi> was almost at the first heauen, he began to obserue and marke, whether <hi>Strabo, Ptolomaeus,</hi> and other measurers of the world, had made a good suruey thereof. He viewed the toppe of the mount <hi>Parnassus,</hi> where <hi>Lactantius</hi> and <hi>Plutarchus</hi> apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the limites of the deluge; and perceauing that from thence, it was a thousand thousand myles vp to heauen, hee laughed at their follie, and made a mock of <hi>Berosus,</hi> who would needes finde out the centre of the earth, by the Arke of <hi>Noah.</hi> Thus iesting at their ignorance, and hauing his head full of Cosmographicall Proclamations, he began to discourse to his companions, of the situation and distance of kingdomes, mountaines, seas, riuers, &amp; woods, of the eleuation of the Poles, the rising of the stars, &amp; the names of euery prouince, with their lawes, statutes, customes, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of discipline. He shewed new-found worlds, neuer known to <hi>Africa, Europe,</hi> or <hi>Asia.</hi> He made <hi>Aristotle</hi> an asse, who neuer thought that al the <hi>Zone</hi> vnder the <hi>Zodiake</hi> was habitable. With these &amp; the like specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and sweete sightes, they passed the time, and continued further on their iourney. And further let them continue a while, sayd the ruler of the company that came from Dawes crosse, in the mean time, whilst your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners are mounting vp to heauen, let vs learne of you, what became of the fearful prediction of those Astrological masters. Content, <abbr>qd</abbr> the strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp; thus it fell out. When these famous Astrologers with their nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, poynts, measures, Astrolabes, signes, &amp; instruments had concluded for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that this inundation should ensue, which would ouerflow &amp; drown the whole world, so that not one person should escape aliue, publishing this their conceit abroad, by printing of their Almanacks and Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb facs="tcp:5955:59"/>
shewing from day to day, in the houses of great men and palaces of princes, the signes, the eclipses of the moone, the coniunction of the planets, and other such fantasies, portending, as they sayd, this future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation; they made euery man feare, and many run vp to hills, that, if they must needes dye, they might die last, and see others drownd before. Among the rest, the Prior of Saint <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> remoued from London to Harrow hill, and there bestowed an hundred markes, in fortifiyng and furnishing himselfe agaynst the flood. And now the time was at hand, when all should come to naught: When (I know not by what reuolution or influence) the ayre on the sodaine began to be black, clowds to lowre, and rayne to powre downe so fast, that euery man verily beleeued, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologicall predictions would prooue true in the ende, sith they seemed so likely in the beginning. This made men, women, and children, tag and rag, to climbe vp to trees, to the tops of houses, castles, and steeples, to saue their liues. All the world being thus on an vprore, there came an odde Astronomer, peraduenture hauing lesse learning, but surely more wit then the others, who seeing, what a pitifull howling and lamentation was made on euery side, began with bitter words and vehemencie of speech to inueigh agaynst the former Astrologers, saying, they were seditious fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, worthy to be clapt by the heeles, and that all was starke false which they had put downe to the terror of the poore people, who of all other deaths were most vnwilling to be choakte with water. This new doctor was for his labour, accompted a foole of wise and foole: for, still as hee thus preached, it rayned still. At last, about two or three houres after, as God would, the ayre began to cleare vp, the rayne ceased, the storme was past, and all was well agayne. Then came foorth the amased people, from trees, rocks, and Castles, distracted betweene hope and feare, scarce resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued whether themselues were dead or aliue, as if they had come from the new-found worlde, or out of <hi>Trophonius</hi> den: and by degrees comming to their former sence and witte, made great feasts and bonfires, for ioy that they had escaped a daunger which neuer hangd ouer their heads. The Astronomer that gaue out this comfortable contradiction, seeing that all fell out according to his speech (although peraduenture himselfe thought as the rest did) bare himselfe loftily, was made a doctor, and dubbed a knight for learning, which was neuer in his head: and the rest were scorned for fooles, which had published the contrary Prognosticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Shortly after this, the first Astrologers, seeing themselues fouly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, and that this other doctor, by some Seraphical instinct, had foretolde the trueth, came vnto him, reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced him as a Demy-God, &amp; desired him to imparte vnto them, the ground of this his knowledge, and conceipt: which done, they would acknowledge him for their onely master and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:5955:59"/>
Capten in all their Astrological speculations. What ground, <abbr>qd</abbr> he? Mary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the surest ground, I assure you. For, are you such sottes, to imagin, that in this my prediction, I had regard to any astrological diuination, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a most sure and vnfallible consequence of reason, better then a thousand obseruations of signes and constellations? If this your vniuersall deluge had happened, my grand masters and doctors, who would then haue beene left aliue, to prooue me a lyer, all the world being drowned? If it happened not, (as in trueth it so falleth out) I was sure of the generall applause of the people, for this my plausible Prognostication. All the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatio sapientum</hi> laughed hereat: And now, (<abbr>qd</abbr> the chiefe of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany) it is like that your fellow Gardners, are almost at heauen by this; therefore, continue your discourse, as they, I hope, haue continued their iourney. With a good will, <abbr>qd</abbr> the stranger, and thus it came to passe. My fellowes at last came to a fayre and playne clowde, which tutched the very top of their tabernacle, thinking they had beene at their iourneies end, and that it had been an easie matter, to haue dispatched the rest on foote: but they missed their ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ke, and came short of their account, which troubled them not a litle. And as they stoode thus consulting with themselues, how they might safely passe further, beholde, there came on a sodayne, a man and a woman, riding on a litle clowde, as though it had beene a courser: who saluted them courteously, and bade them welcome; demaunding what they sought for, in so high a place, where it was very difficult to mount vp further, and more daungerous to goe downe agayne. We are <hi>Academikes,</hi>

                  <hi>Pasnip,</hi> and being of late troubled and perplexed with the repugnant conceipts of Astrologers, and menaced and threatned with their vnhappy predictions, haue traueled hither of purpose to vnderstand whether their diuinations be true or not: and if, as they say, the Gods haue determined to plague vs, and our gardens with sterilitie and inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then haue we diuers petitions to be preferred to the immortal Gods, on the behalfe of our selues and our Orchyards: which being once perused, and accordingly considered by their diuine Maiesties, wee haue brought with vs such simple fruites, as our poore abilitie could afforde, to present their coelestiall Deities withall. It is a straunge thing, sayd the man on the clowde, to see you here so high: but what contradiction finde you among your Astrologers? Me thinks you presume very much, in daring to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend great clerkes, and mount vp to the skies, your selues being but Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and ignorant men.

Well then, my friends, you must know, that there be diuers wayes here, all which will bring you to one and the same ende. True it is, that there is one way, through which very few passe; because they see so many strange and most myraculous apparitions, that when they returne agayne to their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions below on the earth, they can meete with nothing there, to the which they may fully compare or resemble those heauenly myracles, when they seeke to make reporte thereof to their friends, or other company, desirous of their coelestiall newes. And in trueth, for any one that commeth hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a commendable desire, to reforme the disorders of mans life, there be fiue thousand, that ambitiously are driuen forward by a foolish curiositie.</p>
               <p>When wee brought hither <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Proclus, Auerrois,</hi> and others that haue discoursed of the heauens, wee conducted them by such a way, that they saw but eight Sphaeres: <hi>Albertus magnus, I sake,</hi> and many others were guided through an other passage, and found out nine Sphaeres; and thus haue they euer from time to time, repugned their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes conceipts. Without doubt, <abbr>qd</abbr> 
                  <hi>Hemlock,</hi> I beleeue it is, as you say: for, so among vs below, if a man aske how many miles it is from <hi>Tugford</hi> to <hi>Tasley</hi>; seauen sayth one, eight sayth another; nay, so many men, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different numbers of miles: insomuch, that hee which would indeede know the trueth, had neede to bring a line with him, and measure the miles himselfe.</p>

                  <hi>Iupiter</hi> seeing these strangers aryued in heauen, in habite of ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, bade them draw neare, himself then sitting in counsayle. Where, the iolly proloquutor <hi>Hemlock,</hi> in the name of the rest, began a braue oration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; when he came to the poynt to vse these words: Loe here, the present which <hi>Priapus,</hi> the God of our earthly Garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, hath sent to your coelestial Maiesties: he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d nothing at all left in his pannyers. <hi>Iupiter</hi> moued hereat, whould heare him no further; but catching him and <hi>Pasnip</hi> by the hayre of the head, threw them downe from heauen, to their Gardens on earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne: With this transformation, that they should both thencefoorth haue the forme and nature of that roote, and weede, whereof they bare the names. The <hi>Thistle</hi> being all this while in heauen, and perceauing how rygorously his fellowes were handled; scratched off all his tender haire from his head, for very griefe and anguish; so that it neuer after grew vp so firmly agayne, but that euery yeare once (for a memoriall of this admy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable accident) euerie little blast of winde blewe it all about the fieldes and Gardens.</p>
               <p>Thus perplexed, heeintreates <hi>Intellectus,</hi> and humbly besecheth him, that he would not forsake him in this extremitie. <hi>Intellectus</hi> pitying his wofull plight, excused him to the Gods, giuing them to vnderstand, that hee had neither in worde nor deede offended their diuine Maiestie.
<pb facs="tcp:5955:61"/>
Wherefore <hi>Iupiter, Phoebus,</hi> and <hi>Mercurie</hi> gaue him this prerogatiue and preheminence, that he might assigne new names to his nephews and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding posteritie, as <hi>Artichauks,</hi> and such like; which should euer after be had in great estimation among other fruites of the Garden, and serued at mighty mens tables as a dish of great dayntines and delicacie: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward gaue <hi>Intellectus</hi> leaue to leade him all about heauen; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use his petitions, that his Patent might be sealed accordingly. As the <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> was about to view the heauens; Stay, <abbr>qd</abbr> 
                  <hi>Intellectus,</hi> thou must first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the good will of <hi>Time</hi>; who must also haue a sight of these thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes: therefore reade them, and let me heare what they are.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="petition">
               <head>The petition of the Gardiners.</head>
               <p>INprimis, that Hemlock neuer grow in Gardens; but onely in ditches and such like obscure and vnpleasant places, fitte for so vnsauorie and loathsome a weede.</p>
               <p>Item, That none vnder the degree of an Esquire, haue his bed stuft with the downe of a thistle.</p>
               <p>Item, That whosoeuer eateth buttered Pasnips without pepper, may dye without Auricular confession.</p>
               <p>Item, That no man, vnles he may dispend foure nobles by the yeare in good free-holde, shall breake his fast with an Artychauck pye.</p>
               <p>Item, That none aboue the age of seuen yeares, if he nettle his hande, shall be ridde of his payne by rubbing the place with a Dock, and saying, In Docke, out Nettle.</p>
               <p>Item, That if any maried man vse any nosegay, wherein the flowers be odde in number, he may stand in daunger of <hi>Acteons</hi> penaltie.</p>
               <p>Item, That whosoeuer drinketh Claret wine without Borage, or Sack without a sprig of Rosemary, may neuer be ridde of his Rheume by drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Muscadell before he goe to bed.</p>
               <p>Item, That if a man be like to haue a Feuer quartane, for want of a figge, the master of the Garden, by the aduise of two Phisitians, may giue him leaue to pluck and eate.</p>
               <p>Item, That: Nay, <abbr>qd</abbr> 
                  <hi>Intellectus,</hi> no more Thats; for, this is too much already. These fooleries must not be any part of thy petition: thou shalt onely demaund a good stomack and taste, to the ende, that euery thing may be to thy good content and liking.</p>
               <p>So they passed on, towards the auncient pallace of <hi>Time. Time</hi> was a great man out of all measure, shewing a kinde of maiestie in his forehead. His face had three seuerall semblances: his browe and eyes resembling middle age; his mouth and cheekes, youth: his beard, olde age. He had before him three great glasses, looking now in one, now in an other: and,
<pb facs="tcp:5955:61"/>
according to that which he saw in them, he framed his countenance: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ioyeus and mery, sometimes graue and moderate, sometimes sad and heauy. On his left side, was Weeping; on his right side, Laughing. His gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was of such a color, as the <hi>Thistle</hi> could not possibly discerne it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, as hee tolde mee, hee marked it seriously, neither knew hee how to tearme it.
