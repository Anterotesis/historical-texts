         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſeek and deſire a true reformation of the

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ive me leave, moſt famous and renowned
City, and ye the Right Honourable Lord
Major, the Right Worſhipfull Aldermen,
and religious Common-Councell and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners,
to congratulate and rejoice with you,
for that honour which the Lord hath laid on you in theſe daies
of great confuſion. You, under God, have been the guard of
this preſent Parliament, by which ſo great things have been
done for the ſafety and defence of three Kingdoms. Your
free contributions of your wealth and ſubſtance, have been
the ſinews of this warre, undertaken for the defence of our
Religion, Laws and Liberties. Few Counties in this
Kingdom have been able to defend themſelves, much leſſe to
help others, except thoſe whom you have encouraged, and ſet
on work by your example, and to whom you have been a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
againſt the enemies, who by you have been terrified
from invading them. All the aſsociated Counties have
cauſe to bleſſe God for the vicinity and neighbour-hood of
<hi>London.</hi> And all the reſt of the Kingdom may ſay,
If the Lord had not helped us by the Forces, Arms, and
ſupplies of men and money from <hi>London,</hi> we had been
<pb facs="tcp:113677:3"/>
utterly deſtroied and laid waſte. But the chief glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on you by God, is your courage for the truth, and
true Chriſtian Religion; your earneſt ſtudy, and conſtant
endeavour for promoting an happy Reformation of the Church
in Religion, Dostrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Word of God; your zeal against Sectaries,
Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, and Blaſphemers, who labour
cunningly to corrupt your ſervants, to ſteal away the hearts
of your wives and children, to pull many fair feathers
out of your wings, and to draw Diſciples after them, and
your ſtanding steadfaſt in the old paths, and walking in
that good way, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 16. which the Lord Chriſt by his
Apoſtles hath praeſcribed to the Vniverſall Church; In
which all the pure primitive Churches of old, and all the
beſt reformed Churches have walked from the daies of your
Fathers, untill this day. God hath inabled you wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
by his grace, to reſiſt the ſubtle temptations of the
world and the Devil. I know when you were courted
with offers of greateſt honours and priviledges, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
you from your purpoſe and reſolution, of ſtanding
for the common weal of State and Church, and of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
and upholding of the props and pillars of this Land,
when it trembled, and was ready to be diſsolved.</p>
            <p>I cannot forget that ſad time, full of fears and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
when (the chief command of your City, being in the
hand and power of Malignants, who had alſo a strong
faction, by which they attempted to overthrow you) it was
the opinion and profeſsion of ſome of the moſt faithfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,
aud wiſe members of Parliament, that unleſſe God
did put into your hearts a reſolution to ſtand up for them,
they had ſmall hope of ſaving either the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from ruine, or our Religion, Laws, Liberties, and their
<pb facs="tcp:113677:3"/>
own lives from deſtruction; and in that juncture of time
the Lord did put ſuch a ſpirit of courage, fortitude and
holy zeal into you, who were the main body of the City,
that you stood up, and appeared openly for the worthy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
of your Religion, Laws and Liberties, whereby they
were animated to proceed vigorouſly in their wonted courſe
of juſtice, to the terrour and aſtoniſhment of all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and diſturbers of our peace. After this you have
been strongly aſſaulted by ſpirituall wickedneſſes divers
waies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by cunning ſeducers, who uſurping the name and
outward ſhew of rare Saints, have ſtollen away the hearts
of many, and with feigned ſanctity and large promiſes
of a pure platform and modell of Church-Diſcipline and
perfect Reformation, according to Chriſts own inſtitution,
have drawn them into Schiſme, and ſeparation from their
own Congregations. But you, by your wiſdom have quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſmelled out their fraud, and vain boaſting of great
things, which they can never perform and bring to
paſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you have been tried, (when Scriptures fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, and favoured not their modell) with bold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of new lights, which you have ſcorned, as wiſe
men are wont to ſcorn, and not vouchſafe to look after thoſe
<hi>ignes fatuos,</hi> wandring lights and night fires, by which
fools, who follow them in the dark, are lead into danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pits, boggs, ditches, and downfalls.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they have repreſented unto you Presbyterian
Government as a Bugbear, and cruell monſter, worſe then
Popery and Prelacy, unto which if you ſubmit, you and
your children are made ſlaves for ever, to the lust of proud,
peeviſh, tyrannicall Priests; And allthough many cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
<pb facs="tcp:113677:4"/>
fools, and unſtable ſouls, are hereby terrified and
skared out of their wits, and run wilde after ſeverall
dangerous ſects, and know not where to reſt: Yet you are
no ſuch ſtrangers to the Goſpel, nor ſo little acquainted
with the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, as to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with ſuch skarecrowes; but rather by ſuch rabid
railing againſt Government of the Church by Claſsicall
Presbyteries, you have been moved and ſtirred up (after
ſerious conſideration, and conſultation had with your god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Paſtours, and Teachers, diligent ſearching of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and good aſſurance of underſtanding of divine truth
gained to your ſelves) to be more earneſt and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in promoting that Presbyterian Government, beſides
which there is no mention of any other in all the writing
of the Apoſtles; nor any other acknowledged or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
in any well reformed Churches in all the Chriſtian
world.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtolicall Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> conſiſting of
many thouſands and ten thouſands of beleevers, and ſo
many particular Congregations, was altogether governed
by the Apoſtles and Presbyters, Aſſemblies, Synods and
Presbyteries, as appears, <hi>Act. 11. 30. and 15. 6. and</hi>
21. 18. The Chriſtian Church of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> gathered
unto Chriſt in ſeverall Nations, Countries and Cities by
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> had every one their Presbyters, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to have rule over them in the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.
23.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that great City of <hi>Aſia,</hi> had
alſo divers Presbyters, whom the Holy Ghoſt had made
overſeers to watch in common over it, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 17, 28.
And of them S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. ſaying,
<hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of
<pb facs="tcp:113677:4"/>
double honour.</hi> Alſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Creet,</hi>
and appointed him to ordain Presbyters in every City,
and ſuch overſeers as were fit to rule the Church, <hi>Tit.
1. 5. Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were Presbyters, and called
themſelves ſo, as they with others governed ſeverall
Churches, <hi>1. Pet. 5. 1. John 2. 1.</hi> and <hi>John 3. 1.</hi>
Wherefore, ô <hi>London,</hi> thou that haſt choſen the beſt
part, rejoice in the Lord thy God, who hath made his
glory to riſe upon thee, and his light to ſhine upon thy
grave Senatours, thy religious Common-Councell, and
all thy true hearted Citizens; and hath led them into
thoſe waies which be in Chriſt, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
taught every where, and in every Church, <hi>1 Cor. 4.
17.</hi> For the encouraging of you, worthy Citizens, in
your conſtancy, and for the confirming of them that are
weak and wavering, I have framed out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
this brief diſcourſe, concerning that one uniform
Church-Government, which Chriſt by his Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
and appointed to be ſet up in the whole univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
Church, and to be obſerved in all other Churches,
members of the univerſall. Here you have the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
patern ſhadowed out in a ſmall compaſſe, of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
for the eſtabliſhment whereof in this City
and Kingdom, you have ſtood up and appeared openly at
ſeverall times. If the Lord be pleaſed to bleſſe you with
courage for his truth, and with conſtancy and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
till you obtain your deſire, which is the deſire alſo
of all Orthodox faithfull Miniſters in the Land, then
ſhall <hi>London</hi> be called, The City of the Lord, the <hi>Zion</hi>
of the holy one of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> And they who deſpiſe her and
ſtand up against her, to hinder the work of God in her
hands, ſhall bow down at the ſoles of her feet, and her
<pb facs="tcp:113677:5"/>
enemies ſhall lick the duſt, even lick up the duſt of her
feet, for they ſhall not be aſhamed who wait for the Lord,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 23.</p>
            <closer>This is the praier of <signed>your ſervant in
the work of the Lord, and humble
ſuppliant for your proſperity at
the throne of grace.

and land full of confuſion; as the giddy-headed multitude, which
are like clouds without water, carried about with every winde
of Doctrine, and dream of new lights beginning to appear, do
call into queſtion the ſaving doctrines of aeternall truth, and the
chief Articles of the Chriſtian faith, firmly beleeved, conſtantly
profeſſed, and never doubted of by any true Chriſtians: So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
many of the wiſeſt Stateſmen, who are eſteemed the pillars of
the Kingdom, and the ſtay of the State, do doubt and make
queſtion, whether there be any Church Government <hi>Jure
Divino,</hi> and by the will and appointment of Jeſus Chriſt? What
that Government is? Who are the Governours? And by what
rules and laws they ought to govern? And how farre, and in
what things, matters and cauſes, power is given to them by
Chriſt to rule and govern in the Church? For the anſwering of
all ſuch queſtions, and removing of all ſuch doubts and ſcruples,
I will endeavour, out of love to the truth, and zeal to the honour
of Chriſt, and the advancement of his Kingly power in his
Church, to lay down ſome ſure grounds of Doctrine, gathered
out of holy Scripture, and proved by clear teſtimonies of Gods
ſpirit, ſpeaking in the infallible written word.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I take this as an undeniable principle, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
Chriſt hath with his own mouth commanded, or by his
ſpirit moved his Apoſtles to teach by writing and word, or by
example and practice, concerning the well ordering and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his Church in any place, which is as uſefull in
all places, and the reaſon of it ſtands firm in all ages, and it may
be practiſed profitably by ordinary Paſtours: Alſo whatſoever is
neceſſarily preſuppoſed, or included in any thing, which Chriſt
in the Goſpel commandeth, or of neceſſity muſt follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
is <hi>Jure divino,</hi> and by the will and appointment of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:113677:6"/>
Secondly, becauſe the main queſtion which comes to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
upon which all the reſt do depend, is, Whether there be
any proper and particular Church-Government diſtinct from
Civill Government: The anſwer is eaſy, and ſuch as may fully
ſatisfie any reaſonable Chriſtian. For firſt, in every Nation,
Kingdom, and ſtate wherein Chriſtian Religion is publikely and
generally profeſſed, all the people are to be conſidered two
waies. Firſt, as men and members of a civill ſociety or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Wealth. Secondly, as Chriſtian men and members of the
Church, the myſticall body of Chriſt. As they are members of
the Common-wealth, they are to be ruled by the laws of men
which are there in force, and do binde them to obedience in
temporall things to their Kings and Civill Magiſtrates, and to
good order and behaviour among themſelves, for the peace and
ſafety of humane ſociety, and of the civill State. And this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
may be among them who are <hi>Turks,</hi> Heathens and
nor Chriſtians, for it is common to all men of all Nations, States
and Kingdoms. But as they are Chriſtians and members of the
Church, Chriſts myſticall body, ſo they are to be governed by
the law of Chriſt, which bindes them to the obedience of
him in all things, which concern their ſpirituall eſtate, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life, and bleſſednes, and to holy communion among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſpirituall things. Theſe two States and Governments
are ſo diſtinct and different, that either of them may ſtand alone
without the other. There are and have been divers earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
well ordered, and wiſely governed in all outward tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
things, in which Chriſt hath had no Church, neither was
Chriſtianity known or profeſſed. And again, Chriſt hath had a
Church well governed, and flouriſhing in Religion, grace, and
godlines, when there was no civill Government, King, or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Magiſtrate to help or uphold it, but all ſet againſt it, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecute,
vex, and make havock of it; as it was in the daies of
Chriſt and of his Apoſtles, and in divers ages after: And yet
Chriſt was the King, and the Church was his Kingdom in which
he ruled, and is called the Kingdom of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 28.
and that Kingdom of heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 2. &amp; 4. 14. Now a
Kingdom is not an Anarchy, that is, a confuſed multitude with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Government; but a Monarchy, in which there is one King
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113677:7"/>
who is ſupream Governour. And in the Church, which is Gods
holy hill, and ſpirituall <hi>Zion,</hi> Chriſt alone is the King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 6.
&amp; <hi>Zech. 9. 9. Joh.</hi> 12. 15. and the head, and ſole ruler, <hi>Mat. 2. 6.
Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22. and the Government is on his ſhoulder, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6.
He alſo alone is the Lord, and Law-giver, <hi>Iſa. 33. 22. Iam.</hi> 4. 12.
and his Word is the law and rule of Government, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 3. yea
the law, and rule by which the ſpirit ruleth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. and to
which he is limited in moving and working, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 13.</p>
            <p>3. But that Church-Government may be more clearly and
diſtinctly underſtood: we are further to diſtinguiſh between
the ſupreme power of Government, which is onely in the
hand of Chriſt; and the delegated power, which he hath given
to his Miniſters, to exerciſe under him a ſubordinate and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſteriall
Government.</p>
            <p>The ſupreme Government which is in the hand of Chriſt is
Monarchicall: For to him alone all power is given in heaven
and in earth, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 18. and he is ſet at Gods right hand, far
above all principalitie, and power, and might and dominion, and
every name that is named both in this world, and in that which
is to come. And God hath put all things under his feet, and gave
him to be head over all things to the Church which is his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 21. 22. And this power of Government is proper
to him, and he reſerves it to himſelf. But the ſubordinate and
Miniſteriall power of Government, he gave to his Apoſtles and
to their Succeſſours, <hi>Mark. 16. 15. Joh.</hi> 20. 21. where he ſaid,
As my father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you. Go into all the world,
and preach the Goſpell to every Creature. And promiſed to be
with them alwayes to the end of the world, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 20.
And leſt any ſhould thinke that this rule and Government of
the Church, was limited to the Apoſtles, and was to dye, and
and to expire with them: The Scriptures do fully prove, and
plainly demonſtrate, that it was alſo by Gods appointment
imparted to others in the Apoſtles dayes, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28.
where the Apoſtle writes, that God hath ſet in his Church, not
onely Apoſtles, Prophets and others of extraordinary gifts; but
alſo teachers, helps, and Governments. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 8. The
Church is compared to a naturall body, and the ſeverall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof, having gifts differing according to the grace that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113677:7"/>
is given them, are commanded to exerciſe their gifts, and to
wait on their ſeverall offices, as Prophets on propheſying;
Miniſters on miniſtering; Teachers on teaching, and he that
ruleth on ruling with diligence. And 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 12. the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
are intreated to know them that labour among them
and are over them in the Lord, and admoniſh them, and to eſteem
them very highly in love for their works ſake: and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17.
Let the Elders that rule well (ſaith the Apoſtle) be
counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they that labour
in the word and doctrine: and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. He inioynes the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to remember them that have the rule over them: and verſ.
17. to obey them and ſubmit themſelves, becauſe they watch
for their ſoules, as they that muſt give account: and verſ. 24. he
ſaith, Salute them that have the rule over you. All which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and many others, wherein ſeverall acts of Government
are commanded to be done by Paſtours and overſeers of the
Church, other acts of diſcipline commended, when they were
done, and the neglect of them blamed, do prove a Miniſteriall
Government in the hand of Church rulers <hi>Jure divino,</hi> and by
the appointment of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>4. The ſubordinate and Miniſteriall Government which
Chriſt hath ſet up in his Church, is not Monarchical, as that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Government is which he reſerves to himſelf; Neither is
it Civil, left to Civil Magiſtrates, who judge and rule over men
in Civil ſtates, and ſocieties, and about temporal and worldly
affaires of this life, ſuch judging and dividing our Saviour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed,
<hi>Luke.</hi> 12. 14. ſaying, Who made me a judge or a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
over you? when a man requeſted him to ſpeak to his brother
to divide the inheritance with him. And he told <hi>Pilat,</hi> that his
kingdom was not of this world. <hi>John.</hi> 18. 36. They who rule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him in his Church muſt meddle onely with ſpiritual things
which concerne mens ſpiritual eſtates, and eternal life and the
ſalvation of their ſoules. And they are all equal in title, honour
and office, even Elders, ſtewards and diſpenſers of holy things.
There is no one cheif Lord above the reſt in the whole Church
on earth, or in any part thereof, whether National, Provinciall
or Claſſical Church. But of the Apoſtles who were the chief Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
and rulers in his Church, he ſaid, Whoſoever will be great
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113677:8"/>
among you, let him be your miniſter. <hi>Math.</hi> 20. 26. and <hi>Luk.</hi>
22. 26, And as <hi>Peter</hi> received this leſſon from his Lord, ſo he
gave charge to all Presbyters of the Church, fellows in the
Presbytery with himſelf, that they muſt take the overſight of the
flock, and not be as Lords over Gods inheritance, but as enſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to the flock, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. The authority and title of Lords
our Saviour will have left to the Kings and Rulers of ſtates and
Kingdoms on earth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 25.</p>
            <p>5. The Government of the Church which is Eccleſiaſticall,
our Saviour gave in common to all his Apoſtles, who were
the Paſtours of the Church univerſall, and the firſt teachers of all
Nations, who had a charge and Commiſſion from Chriſt to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and build up Churches in all the world, and to teach
and inſtruct all people to obſerve all things whatſoever he
had commanded them, as we ſee in the Scriptures before named,
<hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. 20. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>John.</hi> 20. 23. and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where the exerciſe of the power of the Keyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven, which was given to Peter as the mouth of the
reſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 19. is alſo given in common to them all, as they
were the Church repreſentative, and ſtood in the place of all
Paſtours and Teachers to the end of the world. In ſo much as if
any two or three of them were gathered together in his Name,
he promiſed to be in the midſt of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. 18. 20. and
<hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23. And as the Lord Chriſt gave this power to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
ſo they exerciſed it ſometimes in common all together in
the generall Aſſembly of the Diſciples, Brethren and Elders, as
<hi>Act.</hi> 1. 15. in the election of an Apoſtle in the place of <hi>Iudas,</hi>
and <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 2. about the election, and Ordination of the ſeven
Deacons, and <hi>Act.</hi> 15 6. about the deciding of a great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
concerning Circumciſion and other legall rites not to be
impoſed on the believing Gentiles. And ſometimes two or
three of them, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> when they were ſent to Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
to confirme the Church there, <hi>Act.</hi> 8 14. And <hi>Barnabas</hi> and
others who were ſent to confirme the firſt Church called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
at Antioch, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 22. 23. And <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and
<hi>Silas</hi> in ordaining Elders in every Church by them converted
to Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. But yet they altogether, and everie one
or two by themſelves exerciſed, and commended to the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113677:8"/>
and Presbyters by them ordained, the ſame uniforme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the ſame way in Chriſt both for Doctrine and
Diſcipline. So the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles plainly teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 17. writing thus, <hi>for this cauſe have I ſent to you
Timotheus, who is my beloved ſonne and faithfull in the Lord,
who ſhall bring you into remembrance of my waies which be
in Chriſt, as I teach every where in every Church,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor. 7.
17. So ordain I in all Churches.</hi> And he who had the care of
all the Churches (as he ſaith,) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. keeps them to
the ſame cuſtome, as is implied, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. where ſpeaking
of new faſhions for which ſome are ready to contend, he ſaith,
<hi>If any man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtome,
nor the Churches of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Now this miniſteriall uniforme government ſetled by
Chriſt and his Apoſtles in all Churches, Nationall, and Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and Claſſicall in every Circuit, as it was in the hands of the
Paſtours, Presbyters and overſeers, ſo it was Ariſtocraticall. But
as the whole Church and multitude of believers had liberty in
elections to nominate ſuch as they found moſt fit to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers
and officers, and orderly to give their approbation of the
Acts of the Elderſhips, ſo it is in ſome part Democraticall. As
we ſee in the election of the ſeven Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. The twelve
Apoſtles appointed that ſeven men of honeſt report, and full of
the holy Ghoſt ſhould be ordained. The multitude choſe them;
and ſet them before the Apoſtles, who ordained them with
prayer and impoſition of hands. So alſo <hi>Act.</hi> 15. The Apoſtles
and Elders came together, to conſider of a matter, and to decide
a Controverſie brought unto them from the Church of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,
verſ. 6. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> debated the buſineſſe and gave
the ſentence, together with the Elders, and all the brethren, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the whole Church approved the ſentence given by <hi>Iames,</hi>
and thereupon a decree was framed in the name of them all,
verſ. 23. And in the ordaining of Presbyters in everie Church,
<hi>Act,</hi> 14. 23. As the Apoſtles <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> with <hi>Silas</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and layd on their hands, ſo the people holding up their
hands, approved the election and ordination. Theſe examples
and theſe practices of Church government in Synods and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Presbyteries performed by men who had received inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113677:9"/>
from Chriſts owne mouth, and were inſpired and moved
there unto by the holy Ghoſt, and the reaſon of them ſtill ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in force; they do ſhew that ſuch Synods and acts of Church-Government
are according to the will and appointment of
Chriſt and are uſefull and neceſſary to the end of the world.
And all Churches ought to conforme unto this ſpeciall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſome do object, that the Apoſtles were men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
gifts and calling, and had an infallible aſſiſtance of
the holy Ghoſt, which did lead them into all truth, and could
do in their Synods and Aſſemblies things, which ordinarie Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
and teachers cannot do, they could ſay, It ſeemed good
to the holy Ghoſt and to us, and could take upon them the care
and overſight of all Churches. But now it is well if one or two
of the wiſeſt Miniſters can teach or rule one particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;
It is too much for them to meddle with the common
Government of many particular Churches. And therefore the
examples of the Apoſtolicall Churches do not binde the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of theſe times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this I anſwer, Firſt, that it was neceſſary, that the
Apoſtles and Evangeliſts ſhould be extraordinarily called, inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt, that he might lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all truth, and call to their remembrance all things whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Chriſt had taught them, and commanded them to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in all Churches to the end of the world; otherwiſe they
could not have been the infallible penmen of the Scriptures,
which are the certain rule both of Doctrine, and Diſcipline,
Neither could their example and practice have been an heavenly
paterne of Divine Authority, to all ſucceding ages. But after
the publiſhing of the Goſpell by them to all the world, and
their writing of the holy Scriptures, and leaving them recorded
for a ſure rule of teaching and ruling to all Chriſtian Churches,
there is no more need of any ſuch extraordinary calling and
gifts in their Succeſſours, but ordinary Paſtours, and Teachers,
by the ordinary light and direction of the holy Ghoſt, who
hath made them Overſeers over the Church, may be as able to
exerciſe Diſcipline and cenſures, as to preach and propound
ſound and ſaving Doctrine in the Church, out of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113677:9"/>
of the Apoſtles, which are as plain a rule, and as certain a
direction for ruling as they are for preaching. And to confirm
us in this aſſurance, we have the promiſe of Chriſt, that he will
be with his Miniſters in all ages to the end of the world, as he
was with his Apoſtles, not only in teaching and Baptizing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but alſo making them obſervers of all things whatſoever he
had commanded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This objection is of no more force againſt the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Apoſtles in their practice, and acts of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in Synods, and greater-Presbyteries: then it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
preaching their doctrine contained in their writings. For
they were men of extraordinary calling and gifts, in teaching
as well as in ruling. And if that be a good reaſon againſt ruling
after their example: It is ſo alſo againſt preaching of the ſame
word and doctrine which they wrote and preached.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Although the Paſtours and Teachers which ſucceed
the Apoſtles, are unable to work miracles, and to write infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Scriptures, and give unchangeable rules to all Churches, as
the Apoſtles did, becauſe they have not ſuch extraordinary gifts
and calling: Yet in things which are in the power of ordinary
Presbyters and Paſtours, as meeting many together in Synods
and Presbyteriall Aſſemblies, to decide and determine contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,
according to the Scriptures, it is a thing as eaſy and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
for them wherein to imitate them: as for many Lords
and Commons to meet in a Parliament, to remove grievances
in the Common-wealth. And certainly ſo farre as God makes
us able, we are bound to follow their practice and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The more extraordinary gifts that the Apoſtles
had, the leſſe need they had to meet in Synods and Aſſemblies,
either all, or divers of them together. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
had an infallible ſpirit, and did diſpute againſt the errour at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
and condemned it by as infallible a ſentence, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
did at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> And yet for a paterne to all ſucceeding
Churches, and to make the judgement and determination of
more authority in all Churches of beleeving Jews and Gentiles,
and to ſhew the unity of ſpirit and uniformity of doctrine and
diſcipline among them all, an appeal was made to a generall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113677:10"/>
Synod, of all the Apoſtles and Elders at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And
therefore (the neceſſary uſe and reaſon of ſuch Synods and
Claſſicall Presbyteries, being ſtill the ſame in all ages; And
ordinary Miniſters of Chriſt having more need of common help
and aſſiſtance, becauſe many eies ſee more then one, and many
heads conſulting together, will better ſearch out the truth and
true ſenſe of Scripture in doubtfull matters, and of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment)
The objection doth make more for the confirmation
of the doctrine, to wit, that the practice and examples of the
Apoſtles in the manner of governing the Church, is of divine
authority, and ought to be eſteemed the will and appointment
of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>7. Now out of theſe points plainly proved by cleer texts of
holy Scripture; We may eaſily raiſe a perfect definition or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of that Government partly Eccleſiaſticall, which Chriſt
as King of his Church, hath ſet up therein, namely this, That
it is the exerciſe of power and authority in matters ſpirituall,
which concern the ſalvation of ſouls; given by Chriſt to the
Paſtours and Elders of his Church, for the gathering, building
up, and well ordering of it, and for the perfecting of the Saints,
the members thereof. For the confirmation of this definition in
every part and member of it, we have expreſſe words of holy
Scripture.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Commiſſion which Chriſt the ſupream Lord gave
to his Apoſtles, and to their ſucceſſours in all ages to the end of
the world, was not only by preaching the Goſpel to make men
Diſciples, but alſo to open the kingdom of Heaven, and by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme
to admit beleevers and Diſciples into it, and to teach
them to obſerve all things, whatſoever he had commanded them,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. But to ſhut out unbeleevers as being under
damnation, and in the kingdom of Satan, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. And
that by this Commiſſion not only power and authority was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them to propound the word by way of doctrine; but alſo to
uſe the rod of diſcipline, and to correct and cenſure all ſuch as
were offenders, untractable and puffed up: the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
ſheweth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 20, 21. Where he ſaith, that when he cometh
to <hi>Corinth</hi> he will know, not the ſpeech of them that are puffed
up, but the power, <hi>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113677:10"/>
in power,</hi> even to uſe the rod of correction, and ſharp cenſure,
as the next words ſhew, <hi>viz.</hi> What will you? Shall I come to
you with a rod? or in love, and in the ſpirit of meeknes? And
what this rod is, the next chapter immediatly declares; in which
he gives them a charge, In the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to
excommunicate in their ſolemne Aſſembly the inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8. and Chap. 13. 10. He doth plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that to him and his fellow-Miniſters, the Lord hath given
power and authority even to uſe ſharpneſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That this power is not carnall, nor exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
worldly matters: but is ſpirituall and mighty through God,
exerciſed in pulling down the ſtrong holds of ſin and Satan, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down imaginations, and every high thing which exalteth it
ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity
every thought, to the obedience of Chriſt; The Apoſtle affirms,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This power and authority is given to be exerciſed
for edification, not for deſtruction, as the Apoſtle teacheth,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8. &amp; 13. 10. <hi>even for the perfecting of the Saints,
and for the edifying of the body of Christ,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 12.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The exerciſe of this power and authority is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and the waies of it the ſame in all Churches: No ſupreme
Magiſtrate hath power to alter it, it is not to be uſurped, nor
contended for by any to whom God hath not given abilities, nor
called thereunto. It belongs to the Paſtours and Teachers who
have a calling to expound publikely the Word and law of Chriſt,
and to their aſſiſting Elders who are fit to judge accordingly. For
ſuch the Apoſtles appointed to be their ſucceſſours; and not civill
Magiſtrates which were not known in the Church, till many
years after the days of the Apoſtles. And to the Apoſtles and
their ſucceſſours the Lord Chriſt gave this power to rule his
Church, and it continued in their hands in all the Apoſtolicall
Churches: The ſame waies which the great Apoſtle of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
obſerved himſelf, he taught in every Church, every where,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 17. and ſo he ordained in all Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 17.
And when any ſwerved from the inſtitution of Chriſt in the uſe
of the ordinances, and contended for forms and faſhions, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the common rule and cuſtom; The Apoſtle reproved
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113677:11"/>
and blamed them, as appears, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16, 17. The Paſtours,
Elders, and Teachers who labour in the Word and Doctrine,
and watch for the ſouls of the people, and by the holy Ghoſt are
made overſeers over the flock, are the Governours, and rule over
them in the Lord, and they ought to ſubmit themſelves to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and guided by them, as being the ſtewards of Gods houſe,
his Church, and diſpenſers of the myſteries of Chriſt, as theſe
places following do ſhew; Act. 20. 28. <hi>Take heed to your
ſelves, and to all the flock over the which the holy Ghoſt hath
made you overſeers, to feed the Church of God.</hi> And 1 Cor. 4. 1.
<hi>Let a man ſo account of us, as of the Ministers of Christ, and
ſtewards of the myſteries of God.</hi> And 1 Theſ. 5. 12. <hi>We beſeech
you, brethren, to know them that labour among you, and are
over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you: And to esteem them
very highly in love for their works ſake.</hi> And 1 Tim. 5. 17.
<hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
eſpecially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> And
Heb. 13. 7. <hi>Remember them who have the rule over you, who
have spoken to you the Word of God:</hi> and verſ. 17. <hi>Obey them
that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they
watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give account.</hi> Theſe
and divers other Scriptures do clearly ſhew what that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, which Chriſt hath appointed in his Church.</p>
            <p>8. The next part to be conſidered is, to whom Chriſt Jeſus
firſt committed this Government, and where he firſt ſetled it,
and in what Church, from whence it is derived, propagated
and communicated to all other Churches which ſhall be
in all ages. And in this the Goſpell is very clear. For it tells us,
that he firſt and immediately committed it to his Apoſtles as
they were to teach all Nations, and to be the Paſtours of the
univerſall viſible Church. In their hands and in that Church he
firſt ſetled it, for the uſe of all the members thereof, even all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
Provinciall, Claſſicall and particular Churches, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Goſpell preached in every Nation, Countrey, State,
City, and Circuit. That the Lord Chriſt, having all power in
Heaven, and earth given unto him, did give Authority to the
Apoſtles to preach the Goſpell to all Nations, to baptize them,
and to teach them to obſerve all things, whatſoever he had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113677:11"/>
commanded them, I have before ſhewed out of the Goſpell,
<hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. 20. That he gave to them the keyes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, and power to open and ſhut, to binde and loſe,
to remit and retaine ſins, it is manifeſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 19. Where
he ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> (when he anſwered in the name, and as the
mouth of all the reſt, Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living
God.) <hi>I will give to thee the keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven, and
whatſoever thou bindeſt one earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and
whatſoever thou ſhalt loſe on earth ſhall be loſed in heaven:</hi> and
<hi>Math.</hi> 18. 18. where he gave the ſame power to them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
and <hi>Iohn. 20. 23. Whoſeſoever ſins ye remit, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them, and whoſeſoever ſins ye retaine, they are retained.</hi>
And that they ordained Presbyters, Biſhops, Paſtours and
Teachers in the name of Chriſt, and by the Authority which he
gave them, it appeares, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. where it is written that
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ordained Presbyters in every Church of the
converted Gentiles: and <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. where <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſheth
the Presbyters whom he had ordained in the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
to take heed to the flock over which the holy Ghoſt had
made them Biſhops, that is overſeers. And they appointed the
ſame order and forme of Government in all Nationall and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
Churches, and in every Claſſis and particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
as in <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſo in <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Aſia,
Galatia, Macedonia, Creet</hi> and the reſt, as divers Scriptures,
(beſides thoſe before named, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8.
and 13. 10.) do abundantly teſtifie, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12. where Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
and Teachers, as well as Apoſtles, are ſaid to be given by
Chriſt, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the worke of the
Miniſtery, and for the edifying of the body of Chriſt: and
1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 12. where he mentioneth ſome who laboured among
them, and were over them in the Lord, and <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 6. where
we read of a generall aſſemblie of Apoſtles and Presbyters ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
to conſider a great matter and to decide a controverſie,
and ſend out their decree to all Churches, and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. 2. &amp;c.
where the office of a Biſhop, that is a Paſtour or overſeer, is
commended for a good worke, and the qualification and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of ſuch after triall and examination is deſcribed, as alſo
of Deacons. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. where mention is made of ruling
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113677:12"/>
by Elders, and by them who labour in the Word and Doctrine:
and verſ. 22. of ordaining by laying on of hands: and alſo Chap.
4. 14. And <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. 2. and <hi>Iames.</hi> 5. 14. where
Elders of the Church and their worke and behaviour is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.
In all theſe places we have Church Government ſet
forth in Presbyteries, and in the hands of Presbyters, and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall
Biſhops, Paſtours and Teachers lawfully called, and
upon due triall ordained by impoſition of hands, as being that
Government appointed by Chriſt, and obſerved in all Churches.
But of no other forme of Government do we read in any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts in the New Teſtament.
For as there is but one God and Father of all, and one Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, and one faith, one Baptiſme and one whole univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
Church, which is but one body, moved and informed by one
Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 4. 5. So every member of this
one body in every Nation, City and Countrey, and every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of Chriſtians, whether Jewes or Gentiles, is inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
moved and guided by that one ſpirit, as the Apoſtle teſtifieth,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. 13. as Paſtours and Teachers:
ſo alſo governments are ſet in the Church by God, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
diſtributeth gifts to them as he himſelfe will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11.
and 28. And there is but one law to all, which is the word of
God, which is called the law of Chriſt, <hi>Gal. 6. 2. and the law of
the ſpirit of life, Rom.</hi> 8. 2. becauſe the ſpirit ſpeakes to none, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth move or guide any Chriſtian but by this word and
law of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16. 13. 14. (as was before ſhewed) What
Church ſoever doth ſwerve or decline in any materiall or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
point of Doctrine or Diſcipline from that one law, and
rule of Chriſt, which is the heavenly paterne ſhewed to us in
the Scriptures, as the Paterne of the Tabernacle was ſhewed to
<hi>Moſes</hi> in the mount, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 40. That Church comes ſo
much ſhort of Apoſtolicall perfection, and hath in it too much
mixture of humane policy and infirmity. Whatſoever new
light, proud, vaine, fooliſh and fanaticall perſons may pretend:
all ſound and ſtable Chriſtians both ought, and will looke to
the law, and to the teſtimony of Chriſt; <hi>and if any ſpeake not
according to this word it is becauſe there is no light in them, Iſa.</hi> 8.
20. In reſpect of this our uniforme Government by one law the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113677:12"/>
word of Chriſt, and one ſpirit, the ſoule and life of the whole
viſible Church, it is a body uniforme, <hi>homogeneall and ſimilar.</hi> And
as in all naturall uniforme bodies, every part hath the ſame name
with the whole, as every particular part of aire is called aire,
and every river, fountaine and drop of water is, water and is ſo
called, as well as the whole element: Even ſo every Nationall,
Provinciall, Claſſicall and particular congregation in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
City, and circuit, is a Church and is ſo called, as the
Church of <hi>Judea, Act.</hi> 11. 22. 26. the Church of <hi>Antioch, Act.</hi>
13. 1. the Church of <hi>Corinth, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 2. and of <hi>Theſſalonica,
1 Theſſ.</hi> 1. 1. and the Churches of <hi>Galatia, Gal.</hi> 1. 2. yea and the
particular Congregation in the houſe of <hi>Aquila, and Priſcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,
Rom.</hi> 16, 15. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 19. and in the houſe of <hi>Nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,
Coloſſ.</hi> 4. 15. and of <hi>Philemon,</hi> verſ. 2. are every one called
the Church, as well as the univerſall body is called the Church,
<hi>Math. 16. 18. Epheſ. 1. 22. Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 24. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>9. The principall parts of this Government of Chriſt which
allwayes ought to go together, and are inſeparable in every
well ordered and conſtituted Church, are two. Firſt, Doctrine,
which the Apoſtle calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Secondly, Diſcipline,
which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.
which our Saviour in alluſion to other Scriptures, calls <hi>the keyes
of the Kingdome of heaven, Math.</hi> 16. 19. For as keyes do open
and ſhut the doore of an houſe: ſo do both Doctrine, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
open and ſhut the Kingdome of heaven, Chriſt his true
Church. They open it to believers, and to humble and paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
perſons; and ſhut it againſt unbelievers, and ſcandalous
obſtinat ſinners, who continue in their impenitency after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.
And for this cauſe our Saviour calls Doctrine and
Teaching by expounding that word and law aright, <hi>the key of
knowledge, Math.</hi> 23. 13. and Diſcipline he calls <hi>the key of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Revel.</hi> 3. 7. alluding to the words of the prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 22.
where the Lord ſaith, <hi>that he will lay the key of the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
upon the ſhoulder of Eliakim, ſo he ſhall open, and none ſhall ſhut,
and he ſhall ſhut, and none ſhall open,</hi> that is, I will commit the
Government into his hands (as the words before ſhew) to
rule the houſe of <hi>Juda</hi> as a Father. The preachers of the word
by convincing Doctrine do wound the wicked, and are ſaid to,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113677:13"/>
               <hi>root out, to pull, and throw down, and to deſtroy,</hi> Jer. 1. 10.
Yea and to torment the world, to ſmite the earth with plagues,
and to ſhut heaven, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 6, 10. And by the converting
word of the Goſpel, and the miniſtery of reconciliation, to heal
the broken in heart, to open the priſons, and to ſet captives at
liberty, <hi>Iſa. 61. 1. And to build and to plant,</hi> Jer. 1. 10. <hi>And to
open the right way into the ſheepfold,</hi> Joh. 10. 16. The key of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
alſo doth by cenſures, which are according to the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Word of God, ſhut out ignorant and ſcandalous perſons from
Communion with the children of the Kingdom, purgeth out the
old leaven, and ſo bindeth the obſtinate, that they are bound in
heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18 &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7, 13. But by declaring in the
name and word of Chriſt abſolution and remiſſion of ſins to
perſons penitent, it opens the door of the Kingdom, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
into Chriſts ſheepfold ſuch as are brought back from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſtray, and loſeth ſuch as are bound, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of the power of theſe two keys, conſiſts in divers publike
acts done with authority, by commiſſion from Chriſt. Firſt,
the main act of doctrine is preaching the Word, as the mouth of
God to the people, and applying it fitly to all ſorts of perſons,
inſtructing the ignorant, diſcovering to them the corruption of
their nature by which they are Children of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.
and ſo humbling them in their own eyes, driving them out of
themſelves, drawing them to Chriſt by the promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
wooing them, and as Ambaſſadours for Chriſt, praying
them in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.
and eſpouſing them to Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. And on the other
ſide, reproving, rebuking, and admoniſhing with authority, as
meſſengers of God, all inners and tranſgreſſours, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2.
&amp; <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 13. Threatning and denouncing judgements, hell, and
damnation againſt all that are hard hearted and impenitent, as
the Apoſtles did, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 23. and 13. 10. <hi>Rom. 2. 1, 2, 5. 1 Cor.
6 9. Heb. 20. 26, 29. Iam. 5. 1. 2 Pet. 2. 13. Iude verſ.</hi> 4. 11,
14 15.</p>
            <p>Theſe acts of doctrine private Chriſtians may perform mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
among themſelves, and according to the meaſure of grace,
which God hath deſtributed to every one, they are in brotherly
duty, and in Chriſtian zeal and charity, bound to perform them
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113677:13"/>
privately. But publike Miniſters only, called of God, and ſent
to preach, can do them with power and authority, as Gods mouth,
and Chriſts Ambaſſadours: and their word is to be received as
the Word of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. and as a meſſage from heaven,
with fear, reverence, and trembling, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 5.</p>
            <p>The acts of diſcipline which are to be performed by Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
alſo, not as preachers in the pulpit before all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
but as Presbyters in the Conſiſtory, are divers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, receiving accuſations before witneſſes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
            <p>Secondly, publike admonition, and perſonall reproof, and
rebuke of ſuch as are convicted of offence and ſcandall, by two
or three witneſſes, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 20. Tit.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, after admonition condemned and ſcorned, and the
authority of the Elderſhip deſpiſed and ſleighted, theſe ſcorners
are to be refuſed and rejected, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. which cannot be, if
they be admitted to the holy Communion. The Apoſtle injoins
every faithfull Miniſter to withdraw himſelf from perverſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of corrupt mindes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. And he commands the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that they withdraw
themſelves, from every brother that walketh diſorderly, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
3. 6. Certainly he is blinde, and hath the eye of his reaſon put
out, who doth not in theſe forenamed places ſee and underſtand,
that all ſcandalous, perverſe and ſtubborn perſons are by the
Commandement of Chriſt, which is <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> to be refuſed,
and not admitted into holy Communion, which is <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio
minor,</hi> that is, leſſer excommunication.</p>
            <p>The fourth act of diſcipline is, the cenſure of the greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
which is the utmoſt cenſure of a Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
even caſting him out of Church communion for his obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
in his ſcandalous ſins, and refuſing to hear, and obey the
Church. After this ſentence given againſt any perſon, he is in
our Saviours phraſe to be eſteemed as an heathen man, who is
no member of the Church for the preſent, but ſhut out of Gods
Kingdom, and in the Apoſtles phraſe he is delivered to Satan,
and taken captive by the Devil, and held in his ſnare, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 26.</p>
            <p>This cenſure is according to the will, and by the appointment
of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. Where he ſaith of him who will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113677:14"/>
not hear nor obey the Church. <hi>Let him be to thee as an heathen
and as a Publican.</hi> The Apoſtle in the name of the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, commanded the Elders of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> by
this cenſure, and with the power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
againſt the inceſtuous perſon, to put him away from among
them, and to diliver him unto Satan 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 5, 13. And he
himſelf delivered unto Satan <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1 Tim.
1. 20. And theſe acts of diſcipline are not puniſhments of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
not execution of juſtice in a rigid ſenſe; but Medicinall
corrections of mercy, and fatherly chaſtiſements laid on the
perſon cenſured, not in hatred to hurt him, nor in rigour to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the law: But in love, hope, deſire, and godly zeal for a
three-fold end and uſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the mortification, humiliation, and repentance of
the obſtinate ſinner, that he may be made ſenſible of his danger,
and aſhamed of his ſin, and heartily ſorrowfull for it, and full
of contrition: this is intimated by the Apoſtle, where he ſaith,
that delivering unto Satan, is for the deſtruction of the fleſh,
(that is fleſhly corruption by mortification) that the ſpirit may
be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20.
he ſaith that he delivered unto Satan <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi>
that they might learn not to blaſpheme, and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the preſerving of the body and the reſt of the
members from infection, for obſtinate ſcandalous ſinners will
infect others: this the Apoſtle ſheweth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6, 7. Saying,
<hi>Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
purge out therefore the old leaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, For vindicating the Church and Chriſtian Religion
from reproach and ſcandall, and all ſhew and appearance of
countenancing and cheriſhing vile ſin and wickednes, which
will raiſe an ill report commonly, that Chriſtian Religion is
worſe then Gentiliſme, and tolerats ſins, the names of which are
loathed among civill heathen. This the Apoſtle implies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 1. ſaying, <hi>It is commonly reported, that there is fornication
among you, &amp; ſuch fornication as is not ſo much as named among
the Gentiles.</hi> And certainly the Jews who were, according to
to their law, ſo ſtrict in keeping from the Paſſeover, all ſuch as
had any uncleannes on them, might juſtly reproach Chriſtians,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113677:14"/>
if they ſhould admit ſcandalous ſinners ſpiritually leprous and
unclean to the Lords Supper, and into holy communion with
them, and not caſt them out.</p>
            <p>There is beſides thoſe cenſures before named, another moſt
dreadfull cenſure mentioned in Scripture, and called by the name
of <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> that is, the curſed untill the Lord
cometh. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. This is a curſe which the Church denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
againſt deſperate back-ſliders, and Apoſtates, who after il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination,
profeſſion of love to Chriſt, and a taſte of the good
Word of God, and of the power of the world do come, do ſin
againſt the holy Ghoſt, and fall away into hatred and deſpight
againſt the truth, of which the ſpirit hath convinced their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
into malignant perſecution of all true godlines, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an impoſſibility of being renewed by repentance, <hi>Heb</hi> 6. 4.
This cenſure (to ſpeak no more of it) is a ſentence and judgement
of the Church, declaring and pronouncing, that ſuch perſons
are reprobates and deſperate enemies of God, finally accurſed,
paſt hope of recovery, given up to the judgement of the laſt day,
when the Lord ſhall come to render vengeance in flaming fire, to
all them that hate him, and that they are to be ſhunned and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
as fire brands of hell. Of this curſe we have divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
in Scripture, as that which God laid upon <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.
That which <hi>Enoch</hi> denounced againſt the old world, of which
<hi>Jude</hi> in his Epiſtle makes mention, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. That of <hi>David</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Doeg</hi> and other enemies, and againſt the traitour <hi>Judas,
Pſal.</hi> 109. and that wherewith the Lord curſed the reprobate
Jews, when he forbad the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> to pray for them <hi>Jer.</hi>
7. 16. &amp; 11. 14. &amp; 14. 11. For there is a ſin unto death, namely
the ſin of Apoſtaſy, and rebellion againſt the light, not to be
prayed for, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe acts of Government before named, we read of
three others.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, Ordination of Miniſters, which properly belongs
to the preaching Presbyters, who are to examine them, try their
gifts, and inquire into their lives firſt, and after proof made of
their abilities, and godly converſation, to ordain them with
praier and impoſition of hands: of this we read, <hi>Act. 13. 2, 3.
1 Tim. 3. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. &amp; 5. 22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:113677:15"/>
The ſecond is, Chooſing and appointing of Church Officers, this
is the common act of the whole Elderſhip, together with the
people, as appears, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 3, 5. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
            <p>The third is, Setting of things in good order, and appointing
that all things be done decently and in order in the Church: this
<hi>Paul</hi> injoined the Elders of <hi>Corinth</hi> to do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 40. and
he promiſed to aſſiſt them therein, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 34. and laid this
charge on <hi>Titus, Tit.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>From this diſcourſe framed out of the infallible Word of God,
and expreſſe teſtimonies of holy Scriptures, divers Corollaries
and neceſſary concluſions do iſſue, which remove the doubts, and
anſwer the queſtions, which doubting ſcrupulous perſons ſhall
propound concerning Church-Government, whether it be in
whole, or part <hi>Jure divino,</hi> and by the will and appointment
of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Concluſ.</hi> That there is one uniform Government in the
whole univerſall Church, and in every part thereof <hi>Jure divino,</hi>
and by the will and appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, which ought
to be obſerved in all National, Provinciall, Claſſicall and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall
Churches, as they are parts and members of the Church
univerſall, which is the myſticall body of Chriſt. Proved, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
3. and 5. and 6. and 8.</p>
            <p>2. As there is but one law to all Chriſtians, even the Word of
God, which is the perfect rule of Government in all Orthodox,
and well conſtituted Churches: So ought the Government to be
one, and the ſame in them all among themſelves, and in every
particular Congregation. Proved <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>3. The ſupream Magiſtracy in every Nation, Countrey, and
State, being Chriſtians, is in duty bound to be as a nurſing father
to the Church of Chriſt, to ſet up and maintain Preachers, who
may by preaching the Goſpel, gather their people and ſubjects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Congregations, and ſet up Elders in every one according to
the Word of God; And parochiall, or particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſo gathered, and Elderſhips ſet up in them by the dictate
and direction of Chriſt are <hi>Iure divino:</hi> The appointment of the
Civill Magiſtrate is onely a civill ſanction, it doth not make
them to be <hi>Iure divino.</hi> Proved <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. and 4.</p>
            <p>4. Though all Nationall Churches rightly conſtituted, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113677:15"/>
formed according to the Scriptures, are of equall authority, not
any one ſuperiour to another; and likewiſe all Provinciall, Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall
and Parochiall Churches alike well formed, are equall:
No Provinciall ſuperiour to another Provinciall: Nor any Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall
Elderſhip to another Claſſicall; Yet the deciding of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
in point of Doctrine, or any ſentence, or cenſure iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, and publiſhed from a greater Aſſembly or Elderſhip, as
from a Nationall, Provinciall, or Claſſicall, is generally of
more authority, and more to be reſpected in all Churches, then
the ſame ſentence and determination proceeding from the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of a leſſer or particular Congregation, as we ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.
Where the decree of the Apoſtles and Elders in a Nationall, or
rather Oecumenicall Synod at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> was of more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in all Chriſtian Churches, then if it had proceeded from the
Elderſhip of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in which were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the
two great Apoſtles of the Gentiles, who were able to decree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
the ſame things, and appealed to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> not to learn,
but to make their doctrine of more authority, as appears, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.
2. 6. Proved <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
            <p>5. All Elderſhips conſiſting of preaching Presbyters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Elders who do rule well, and all the members of ſuch El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhips
are <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and by the will and appointment of
Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. and the acts of Government done
by aſſiſting Elders, together with preaching Presbyters, who by
their office and calling have authority and ability to expound
the word and law, the infallible rule of Government, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
according to the will and appointment of Chriſt,
and being conformed to the rule, are ratified in heaven.
<hi>Math.</hi> 18. 18.</p>
            <p>6. All ſuperiour Elderſhips and greater Aſſemblies, whether
Nationall, Provinciall or Claſſicall, conſiſting of preaching
Presbyters, ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and of
other aſſiſting Church Elders, who are choſen members of the
univerſall Church, unto the common Paſtours, whereof the
Apoſtles, Chriſt immediatly committed the Government of the
whole Church, and by them to the Presbyters, who do ſucceed
them in ſeverall Nations, Provinces, Cities and circuits, are by
the ſuperiour Aſſemblies and Synods held by the Apoſtles and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113677:16"/>
Elders gathered together at Jeruſalem about matter of greater
concernment <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 2. and 15. 6. and 21. 18. warranted, and
declared to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and by the will and appointment
of Jeſus Chriſt. Proved Sect. 8.</p>
            <p>7. The Appeals from Congregationall Elderſhips to Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall,
and from Claſſicall to Provinciall and Nationall, are by
the Appeal of the Church Presbyters, and the two great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> to the high Synod at
<hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> warranted and demonſtrated to be <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> and
by the will and appointment of Jeſus Chriſt; and their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
alſo.</p>
            <p>8. Occumenicall or univerſall Aſſemblies, conſiſting of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
and Elders choſen out of all true Orthodox Chriſtian
Churches, and ſent as delegates from every Nationall Church,
are warranted by that Synod at <hi>Ieruſalem, Act.</hi> 15. In which
the Apoſtles there reſiding together with the two great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
of all the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles, Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
and the Elders in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and delegates from <hi>Antiochia,
Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> were aſſembled to decide a Controverſie,
which concerned the univerſall Church of Chriſt; And cannot
with any good reaſon be denyed to be <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> and by the
will and appointment of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>9. Though notorious ſcandalous offences, for which perſons
thereof guilty, are to be kept from the Sacrament of the Lords
ſupper, untill they profeſſe repentance, and promiſe amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are eaſie to be diſcerned, and noted by the generall mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
who may privatly judge them to be ſuch: Yet the Lord
Chriſt in his word, gives power and authority to none, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of their office and calling, to judge, and declare by publike
ſentence, what ſcandalous offences are worthy of ſuch a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and to keepe perſons guilty of them from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
But onely Elderſhips Congregationall, Claſſicall or
others meerely Eccleſiaſticall, in which there are preaching
Presbyters, who are able, and have a publike calling from
Chriſt, to expound the word of God, which is the law and rule
by which ſcandalous ſinnes muſt be judged, and cenſures given
and executed. For on their perſons, and conſciences, the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,
and guilt will lye heavy, if they profane the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113677:16"/>
by giving it wittingly to ſuch as will eat and drinke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,
and be guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
11. 17. Proved ſect. 3. and 5.</p>
            <p>10. There are certain particular rules (as the Scriptures ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this foregoing diſcourſe, and divers others do ſhew)
ſome openly expreſſed in the word of God; others by neceſſary
conſequence from thence diducted, which ſufficiently direct
all Elderſhips, and all perſons, who are Elders in them, in the
exerciſe of the power Eccleſiaſticall before mentioned, and in
performing all neceſſary acts of Church Government, as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
accuſations, publike admonition, reproofe, rebuke, refuſing
to communicate with, or to admit to the holy Communion ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
convicted of ſcandalous ſins, and perſiſting therein without
repentance, Excommunication, and caſting out of the Church
them who refuſe to be aſhamed and reclaimed by the former
meanes uſed; and continue in contumacie, diſobedience, ſcorne
and contempt of the Churches iudgement, and proceeding
with them in the Name, and by the Power of the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt. Proved Sect. 9.</p>
            <p>11. Although the Scriptures give great power to Chriſtian
Kings, and Supreme Magiſtrates over the Church of God in
their dominions, and the civill Government thereof is in their
hands. And all Chriſtians, and Eccleſiaſticall perſons of all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and degrees are bound in Civill matters to be ſubject to
them, <hi>and to obey and honour them. Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. and <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 13. <hi>And as nurſing fathers to the Church, Iſai.</hi> 49. 23. they
have the power which <hi>David, Solomon, Aſa, Iehoſhaphat, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi>
and <hi>Ioſiah</hi> exerciſed in purging and reforming the
Church, in commanding Miniſters of the word, and Church
officers to execute their offices faithfully; in puniſhing with
Civill cenſures, and depoſing ſuch as are ſcandalous and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible;
in providing maintenance and ſetting up able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to teach, and inſtruct their ſubjects, and allotting Gods
portion to maintain his worſhip, and ſervice in his Church; in
granting liberty to all to profeſſe true Chriſtian religion, and
to make lawes for the puniſhing and reſtraining of wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
perſons from diſturbing their people in the holy ſervice of
God: Yet ſeeing the exerciſe of Government meerly Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113677:17"/>
and the adminiſtration of holy ordinances is by Chriſt
committed to the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſours, Paſtours,
Teachers, and Church officers, with promiſe to be with them
to the end of the world: And the office and authority of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the word, which is the law and rule of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Government, is left in their hands, without mention of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
magiſtracie, which neither then was Chriſtian, nor for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ages after, and yet the Church was well Governed, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
mightily and flouriſhed in all piety, religion and godlineſſe.
Therefore the ſupreme Magiſtracie is not allowed, nor war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by Scripture, but excluded from intruding into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of holy Church ordinances, and muſt leave the
power of judging and determining of all things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the publike worſhip and ſervice of God to the infallible
word of Chriſt, the holy Scriptures, and to thoſe who are by
God ſet apart, and furniſhed with gifts, and abilities, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
according to Chriſts inſtitution unto the office of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the word and miniſtring in all holy things in the
Church the houſe of God, of which they are ſtewards, officers
and Miniſters, Proved Sect. 3. and 5.</p>
            <p>12. Church Diſcipline without ſound Doctrine is a body
without a ſoule. The key of Doctrine is the ſoul, life, guid, and
direction of Diſcipline, and thoſe two keys of the Kingdome of
Heaven are inſeparably tyed together, and committed by
Chriſt to the ſame hands. Diſcipline hath no power, nor au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over the conſcience, but from the word rightly applyed.
They who are bound and looſed on earth, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
word, are alſo bound and looſed in heaven: And Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
erring from the word are void in heaven. Sect. 9.</p>
            <p>13. Civill Magiſtrates, &amp; other grave, godly, wiſe and diſcreet
men, are not excluded, but may be choſen aſſiſting Church Elders,
and together with preaching Presbyters may rule and Govern
in thoſe Elderſhips, whereof they are Elders, and have power
and authority by the word of God to judge and determine in
the Presbytery together with the Paſtours (and not otherwiſe)
who are ſcandalous offenders, unworthy for the preſent to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Lords table. For the word expounded by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
thereunto lawfully called, is the law and perfect
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113677:17"/>
rule of all acts of Church Government and Cenſures.</p>
            <p>14. Proviſion of Commiſſioners who are no Church Elders,
and who are authoriſed onely by the Civill Magiſtracy to judge
who are ſcandalous offenders, not fit to receive the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is in the judgement of the beſt Divines of the reformed
Churches, and appeares by Scriptures before alledged, to be a
meere invention of humane policie, which hath no example
or warrant in Gods word, and a manifeſt uſurpation, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of that power to others, which Chriſt hath appropriated
to the Apoſtles and Presbyters of his Church, and ſo is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the will and appointment of Jeſus Chriſt. Godly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
generally are of this judgement, that their approving and
yeelding to the practice thereof, is a breach of the Nationall
league and Covenant. King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> was plagued by God with
an incurable leproſie, for medling in the adminiſtration of holy
ordinances, and in ſo doing his heart was lifted up to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and he tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord his God 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
26. 16. In many men, who highly applaud, extoll and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
urge this new device and practice, it favours too much
of ſcorne, contempt, envy and a moſt uncharitable opinion
conceived againſt the godly, learned, faithfull Miniſters of
Chriſt, and watchfull Paſtours of his Church, and brands both
them and all thoſe who are to be ſet up hereafter in all places
of the land, (if the godly reformation deſired, be really inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and ſincerely proſecuted) with inſufficiency, and want
of grace to do the worke unto which God hath called them.
It ſeemes to call in queſtion the faithfullneſſe of Chriſt, who
hath promiſed to be with them allwayes even unto the end of
the world, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 20. Many wiſe and godly people hold it
a perverſe imagination, and a thing unreaſonable to thinke, that
wiſe, diſcreet and godly men, being choſen Elders of the
Church, and joyned in Elderſhips with learned and faithfull
Miniſters, who can expound the word, and give them the
true ſenſe of the law of Chriſt, ſhall or will not be more able to
judge of ſcandalls, and what perſons are fit or unfit to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Lords Supper, then the ſame perſons being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
by themſelves. As if Chriſt were not able, ready,
and willing to give grace and aſſiſtance to them which are his
choſen ſervants, and miniſters of his Church in things ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113677:18"/>
all, as the ſupreme magiſtracy is to give to his new formed
Creatures, who are never owned by Chriſt in all the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.
Surely no rationall man will ſo much as dreame, That
Miniſters of Chriſt, who are able to teach the ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
his duty, how to be juſt, and to rule over men in the feare
of God, are not able to rule their owne flock, over which the
holy Ghoſt made them overſeers; or that Church Government
in their hands to whom Chriſt hath committed it, will prove
more arbitrary, irregular, unlimited, and tyrannicall then the
Government both of Commonwealth and Church in the hands
of Civill Magiſtrates, ſeeing Miniſters and Church Elders have
a certaine and infallible rule, the word of God, to which alone
they are limited, and by which the ſpirit of God is promiſed
to direct them in all Cenſures, and Church Government. But
civill Magiſtrates have no ſuch ſpeciall promiſe of aſſiſtance
from Chriſt, and they rule by the uncertain lawes of men, and
have an arbitrary power to make lawes which are ſometimes
found contrary to the word of God, and therefore unjuſt and
tyrannicall over the Conſciences of Chriſtians, till they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
and declared to be void.</p>
            <p>And there can be no juſt ſuſpition or feare of tyranny in the
Government of the Church left in the hands of Church Elders,
where Chriſt hath placed it; ſeeing the ſupreme Magiſtracy,
(as keeper of both tables, in all Chriſtian Kingdomes and
ſtates) hath as much Civill power to curb, and puniſh them
for male-adminiſtration of Church Government, abuſe of their
power, and manifeſt corruption of Chriſts ordinances, and to
depoſe and caſt them out of their office, when they are ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallous
and incorrigible; as they have to reprove him by Gods
word, for any notorious ſcandallous ſinnes, to admoniſh
him of his duty, to threaten him from God, and to lay his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
cloſe to him, when he goeth on in his ſins of injuſtice,
profanenes, licentiouſnes and the like.</p>
            <p>And now I will conclude all with ſome breif anſwers to
the grievous accuſations; and loud clamours raiſed againſt the
Miniſtery in generall, as if the ſtaine, and guilt of all thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and ſcandallous vices of pride, covetouſnes, ambition
and ignorance, envy and cruelty, which were found heretofore
in the corrupt Popiſh and Prelaticall Clergy, did ſtill cleave to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113677:18"/>
all Presbyters and Paſtours of Chriſts Church, and were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
to them.</p>
            <p>We meet with this accuſation and calumnie now adayes all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in every company, and at every rich mans table, and in
every libellous Printed pamphlet, ſet forth weekly by Newes
Mongers: That Presbyterians are as proud as Prelates; and if
Miniſtes get into their hands Church Diſcipline, they will ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize,
and Lord is over their flocks, and the ſame ſpirit of
pride, envy, covetouſnes, errour and cruelty, will worke in
them, which ruled in the Prelates, and in popiſh Biſhops
formerly.</p>
            <p>To theſe I anſwer, firſt, That if we ſearch all hiſtories of the
Church in all ages, we ſhall never finde in any Church or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
ſo many godly, learned, faithfull, and ſincere Miniſters,
holding ſo faſt their integrity of life, and purity of doctrine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſo great corruption of Government, both in Church and
State, and after ſo great tyranny raging in both; together with
ſo many temptations, hatred, and perſecution of godly and zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preachers, and ſo open countenancing of prophanenes, errour,
and hereſie, as we have had of late years, and have at this day;
whom neither perſecution, loſſe of goods and eſtates, nor bonds,
nor impriſonment; no nor hopes and offers of preferment, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or riches could move from their ſtedfaſtnes. And yet all this
cannot ſtop the mouths of the ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> whoſe hearts are
hardened, and their tongues ſet on fire of hell, to revile the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe blameleſſe lives convince them
of malicious ſlander, lying and impudency.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is manifeſt to all equall and judicious men, that
the ſupreme Magiſtracy hath been the cheif cauſe of ſuch an
ungodly and ſcandallous Miniſtery, peſtring this Kingdome of
late yeares. For who, like <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> did preferre the baſeſt of the
people to be Prieſts of the high places, namely Court flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
ambitious bribers, importunate beggers, Simoniacks, and
ſlaves to great mens luſts, but the ſuprem Magiſtracy, licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Nobility, profane gentry, and covetous patrons of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
Who, but the ſupreme Magiſtracy hindred the lawfull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of Miniſters by Presbyteries, after ſtrict examination,
and tryall had of their learning and gifts, and upon teſtimony
and experience of their honeſt life and converſation; and gave
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113677:19"/>
the ſole power thereof into the hands of thoſe who commonly
hated true godlines, and either careleſſely, or corruptly, and of
purpoſe admitted vile unworthy perſons into the holy calling
of the Miniſtry, who were either unlearned and not gifted; or
if learned, and men of parts, were vicious, men of corrupt minde,
prone and ſtrong to do miſcheif?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ſupreme Magiſtracy by robbing the greateſt
part of pariſh Churches, and ſelling away all impropriat Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to the Nobility and Gentrie, and they covetouſly retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in their poſſeſſion, have made the Churches and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
baſe, contemptible, and beggerly. And</p>
            <p>Laſtly it ſeemes to reflect upon the ſupreme Magiſtracy in
theſe dayes, That there is ſuch a ſcarcity of profitable pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>chers,
and that many Congregations are wholly unprovided, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are out of neceſſity forced to content themſelves with
ſoule-ſtarving ſhepherds, and many young men, of learning, and
of hopefull gifts, finding no lawfull way of entering into the
Miniſtery, and terrified with the intolerable taxes, and other
great grievances, and diſcouragments under which many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of great worth do lye groaning, are moved to withdraw
their mindes from the ſtudy of Divinity, and betake themſelves
to other callings. This certainly is not the fault of the learned
Presbyters of this time, who earneſtly deſire, and have petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
for liberty by the civill ſanction, to joyne together in
Claſſicall Presbyteries, and to ordaine Miniſters, according to
the advice of the Reverend Aſſembly, and the rules by them ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
out of Gods holy word. It remaines therefore, that they
and all the godly in the land, do cry mightily unto God in day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prayer, that he would pour out his ſpirit upon the high
Court of Parliament, and incline the heart of the ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy
to yeeld to the petitions and importunity of the City,
of the Aſſembly, and of the Miniſters of the Countrey; and to be
intreated in ſo neceſſary, pious, profitable and religious a requeſt,
ſo eaſily granted, to ſatisfie the longing deſires, and hungring,
and thirſting ſoules of all godly people, that they and we may
rejoyce together in the Lord, and may bleſſe his holy name, for
the abundance of peace extended to us like a river, and the
Lord Chriſt may be our King, and his Name one in all the three
Kingdomes.</p>
