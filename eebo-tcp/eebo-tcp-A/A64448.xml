            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TESTIMONY Againſt JOHN PENNYMAN's Lyes, Slanders, and Falſe Accuſation of Blaſphemy, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>If nothing more had been ſaid or done, touching that Wicked Action, attempted by <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> of the City of <hi>London, Draper;</hi> concerning the publick Sacrificing of the Holy Scriptures, and other good Books and Writings of the Faithful Prophets and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, at the <hi>Exchange,</hi> to his own deluded diſtracted Imaginations (which was no better then <hi>Cain</hi>'s Sacrifice) who Slew his Brothers, it cannot yet be buried in Oblivion: But what hath the frequent giving out of many Papers by him against us, the People of God, call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> but reviv'd the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof? Against which ſaid Action, this Teſtimony was by us given forth, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p>WHereas <hi>John Pennyman</hi> of late did bring, or cauſe to be brought unto the Exchange, in <hi>London,</hi> ſeveral Books and Writings, and amongſt others the holy SCRIPTURES of Truth, which teſtifie of Chriſt, with other Writings and Teſtimonies recorded of the holy Servants of God, and Martyrs of Jeſus; with intention to deſtroy and burn the ſame (as by his outward Actions and Expreſſions might juſtly be judged and ſuſpected.) Now we the People of the Lord (called <hi>Quakers</hi>) do declare unto all People, That we do utterly diſown and teſtifie againſt that Action, of the ſaid <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> touching the ſaid Books and Writings (ſo far as he had any Intention, or did give juſt Cauſe of Jealouſie or Suſpition of ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to deſtroy and burn the ſame) and that he therein was inſtigated by the Devil (what ever otherwiſe his pretences are, or might be) even by that ſpirit that ruled in thoſe, who in the dayes paſt crucified Chriſt, and perſecuted and ſhed the Blood of his Holy Servants, Prophets, and Martyrs; and in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to Burn and Deſtroy their Writings, manifeſts, that it would do the ſame things now, if it had the ſame Power. And we do further declare and teſtifie, That we dearly and truely own the holy Scriptures, before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, given by inſpiration, as a true and infallible Teſtimony of Chriſt, ſpoken forth by his own Spirit, (which is our Guide and Leader) and that they are written for our learning; and the Writings and Teſtimonies of, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord's faithful Servants, and Martyrs are a good ſavour to us, and their memorial i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bleſſed forever. And we further declare and teſtifie, That we have no union nor fellowſhip with the ſaid <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> nor that ſpirit that now rules in him, he being departed from that pure, meek, Holy Spirit, which ſometimes he had ſome knowledge of: And that he hath given juſt cauſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid Action, and ſince alſo) of jealouſie and fear, that he is in meaſure broken and diſcompoſed in his Mind and Underſtanding; nor can he have any union or fellowſhip with us, until he ſhall publickly condemn this Action of Folly and Wickedneſs committed by him, and give a full Teſtimony of his unſeigned Repentance for the ſame. And we alſo teſtifie, That if any Perſon whatſoever ſhall Act or Speak any thing that is evil, under pretence of a Motion from the Spirit of God, we utterly deny that Motion to be of God; for the Holy Spirit of God never did, nor never will move to that which is evil; and all evil is of the Devil. And this we have though fit thus publickly to declare, for the vindication of Truth, and the Lord's People, who profeſs and enjoy it, that the Innocency of the Upright may be cleared and manifeſted, and all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Unrighteouſneſs judged and condemned, and God, and his pure, holy Truth exalted, over all Unclean, Dark, Deluded, Arrogant, and Imaginary ſpirits whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Given forth the 10th day of the Moneth called</hi> Auguſt, 1670. <hi>By us, Who are in ſcorn called</hi> Quakers.</p>
            <p>ANd our Deſign and End in giving forth this Teſtimony, was, that if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the ſaid <hi>J. P.</hi> might have been awaken'd to a ſenſe of his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and come to Repent of his Wickedneſs; or otherwiſe, to clear God, his Truth, and People of ſuch Works and Workers of Darkneſs. But the ſaid <hi>J. P.</hi> inſtead of anſwering our deſire, in his return to a Senſe of his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath manifeſted himſelf to be one of thoſe in Reſtleſs Torment, that repent not, neither give Glory to God, pouring out his Floods of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt us, that teſtifie againſt him, if poſſible to deſtroy our Teſtimony; or otherwiſe, to deſtroy us, by his Lyes, Slanders, and falſe Accuſations of Blaſphemy, and raking up, and publiſhing what Evil he can againſt us; as by his ſeveral Papers, given out againſt us, appears; thereby (rather then to anſwer our good Deſires for him) to work his utmoſt Revenge upon us, which, if his Power could reach but as far as his Envy and Malice, would it reach ſhort of our Deſtruction, Body and Soul? in all which he hath made full Proof of our ſaid Teſtimony againſt him. And now, on the conſideration of the whole matter, the many Papers, given out againſt us; the Envy, Malice, Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Madneſs, Folly, and Wickedneſs therein manifeſted, and the Ground thereof for our Teſtimony againſt his Wickedneſs; and all being weighed in the Righteous Ballance, we may ſafely conclude, that in the Eye of Moderate Unprejudiced Perſons, it more and more demonſtrates himſelf, and needs no Anſwer of ours thereunto, but may ſufficiently ſerve for his own Confutation and our Vindication. But yet, for the ſake of the Simple, and as far as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly lies on our parts, that all Stumbling-Blocks may be remov'd, it ſeems good unto us, to give a few words in anſwer to that Paper of his, in which he ſo En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly charges Blaſphemy againſt <hi>Solomon Eccles, G. F.</hi> and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> from <hi>S. E</hi>'s. words, in that Paper, call'd. <hi>The</hi> Quaker's <hi>Challenge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt, we ſay in general, All Blaſphemies and Blaſphemers are denied by us; neither do we judge ſuch a man as <hi>J. P.</hi> (who through the ſtrength of his Malice and Envy, or Crazineſs of his Brain, is not fit for things of leſs concernment) to be a fit Judge of Blaſphemy, which is a ſpeaking againſt God, and reproaching of him knowingly and maliciouſly: But to believe and worſhip that for a God, which is no God, is Idolatry, but both are judged by the Spirit of Truth, and us that walk therein. Now as to the words mention'd in <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi>'s Paper, No man in his Wits will believe, that <hi>S.E.</hi> doth believe that <hi>G.F.</hi> made the World, who is not yet Sixty Years of Age; and is known to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and us all, to be a man ſubject to the like Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Cold, Sickneſs, and Age, as others; ſo that, except any be ſo Mad, to think that <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> doth believe that <hi>G.F.</hi> made the World; they cannot believe him to be a Blaſphemer in that Particuler; for the miſ-placing of words cannot be found to be Blaſphemy, where the Mind and Judgment is not corrupt. And [mark] it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He was in the World, the World was made by him, and the World knew him not;</hi> So <hi>ſaith S. E.</hi> it may be ſaid of this Prophet, not leaving out, or excepting thoſe words <hi>(The World was made by him)</hi> which ſhould have been done; but if that were done, the Serpent would ſeek ſomething elſe: this is the ſpirit, that makes a man an Offender for a word, yea leſs then a word, for the miſ-placing of a word; but this Spiders nature will at laſt be caught in his own Web, to his own Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And as to thoſe words, whom <hi>John</hi> ſaid he was not, <hi>John</hi> ſaid not that he was not <hi>G. F.</hi> but that he was not Chriſt; and both being mentioned before theſe words, What reaſon hath <hi>J. Pennyman,</hi> to think that <hi>S. E.</hi> ſhould mean <hi>G. F.</hi> who is not mentioned in the Scripture, and not Chriſt who is mention'd; but only to ſhew his Envy which is ſufficiently ſeen, both againſt Chriſt and againſt this Prophet <hi>G. F.</hi> as well as againſt <hi>S. E.</hi> but it will return upon his own Pate in due time.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſpeaks of <hi>G. F.</hi> owning <hi>S. E</hi>'s Blaſphemy in being gone to Sea with him; the more ſhame to <hi>J. P.</hi> that he ſhould imagine to have a Charge againſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and let them go to Sea before he charged them with it, and now <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a peeviſh manner to cry out againſt them, when their Backs are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are not here to anſwer for themſelves, which is far from either Chriſtian or Manly civil Dealings; but things of this kind have been ordinary with <hi>J. P.</hi> ſince he fell into this Folly and Madneſs, and turned from the Way of God: But this We can ſafely ſay concerning <hi>G. F.</hi> who is not here; We ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had long acquaintance with him, that he hath never ſought any Titles, nor own'd any, but what became a Servant and Child of God; and when any ſuch Titles were given by ſome unto <hi>J. N.</hi> he bore his Teſtimony faithfully againſt it, as is known to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who took his Letters, and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt the ſame from the ſaid <hi>J. N.</hi> and Company : And ſo, not judging the ſaid <hi>J. P</hi>'s Reproaches worth much anſwer; but a few words in plainneſs and ſimplicity being (we hope) ſufficient to ſatisfie all that deſire ſatisfaction; We need ſay no more but this, We do own <hi>G.F.</hi> to be a Servant of the Living God, who is Redeem'd by Jeſus Chriſt from the World's Converſation, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſanctified by the holy Spirit, to bear a Teſtimony in this his Generation unto the Power of God; and in and by it, to turn many to Righteouſneſs: and whoever he be, that ſhall judge or ſay, more of him, or any other Man, then what tends to Gods Glory and Honour that we do deny; for it is his Honour we ſeek, and the wel-fare of all Mens Souls, and profeſs our ſelves Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for the Truth ſake: Which ſhall out-live the Race of <hi>Cain, Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> with all their Malicious, Bloody and Treacherous Deſigns.</p>
            <p>And thus we have given our anſwer in the ſimplicity of Truth; but let not this buſie mind, expect to be purſued in his reſtleſs imaginations, to obtain Anſwers to all his confuſion, leſt we might be thought like himſelf; but to all moderate unprejudiced Perſons, this may be ſufficient ſatisfaction,</p>
