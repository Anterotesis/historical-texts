         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So that the Poems of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> being, by the conſent of all ages, the moſt perfect modells that ever appear'd in that kind of writing; to judge which of them ought to be preferr'd before the other, is, in my opinion, to decide the moſt important queſtion that can be advanc'd in matter of literature, and peremptorily to define upon the point of their higheſt grandeur and perfection.

            <head>OBSERV. II. How theſe two Poems are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in order to a Right judgement of them.</head>
            <p>Among the Learned of the latter ages, who have pretended to give their opinions of the Poems of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and to make a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel between them, the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are <hi>Macrobius, Julius Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Fulvius Vrſinus.</hi> But as they have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd thoſe works meerly as Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, ſo have they not judg'd rightly of them, having only apply'd their reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the externall and ſuperficial part thereof, and ſparing themſelves the trouble of penetrating to the bottome. This defect hath hindred in a manner all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34038:8"/>
the Learned from judging rightly of them; and the prepoſſeſſion they had for <hi>Homer</hi> hath dazled all thoſe who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the glory of being thought learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For it is known, that they who affect the repute of being thought learned men imagine themſelves the more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, I account it an honour to declare their judgment in favour of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and to give him the advantage over <hi>Virgil.</hi> And they are of opinion, that it argues a certain diſcovery of greater ſufficiency, to declare in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of merit, which requires more capacity and attentive application to be known. And indeed as there is a greater depth of Learning requiſite to judge of <hi>Homer</hi> then of <hi>Virgil</hi>; ſo men think themſelves much diſtinguiſh'd from the common ſort, in preferring the former before the latter, and, by that means, that they acquire a reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuperiority in point of abilities, which highly ſatisfies the ſlight vanity of thoſe who make oſtentation of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>

For one is many times more capable of judging when he thinks himſelfe not to be ſo; nay ſometimes it is a certain aſſumption of authority for a man not to take it upon him, in as much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption ordinarily deprives the mind of the liberty of judging with abſolute indifference, which is requiſite for the well doing of it. This is the party it is my deſign to take, that ſo I may not expoſe my ſelfe to prepoſſeſſion, if while I am deſirous to examine things, I took the liberty to judge of them: but I declare that I only intend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my Obſervations and Scruples, upon the works of theſe two Authors, yet ſo as to leave it to thoſe who are more excellently qualify'd than I am, to make what deciſion they pleaſe upon my Remarks.</p>

has a much larger Ground-work to build upon, than <hi>Virgil</hi>; that he hath a greater extent of characters, that he deciphers things much better; that his repreſentations are more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; that his reflections are more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſententious; that his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more pregnant; that he hath a more univerſal fancy; that he is of all profeſſions, Poet, Orator, Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician, Philoſopher, Aſtronomer, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan, when he pleaſes; that he has more variety in the diſpoſition of his Fable; that he diſcovers more of that impetuoſity, which makes the elevation of the Genius; that his expreſſion is more pathetical; that he is more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as to his natural inclination; that he is a Poet upon the account of his temperament; that his Verſes are fuller of pomp and magnificence; that they more delightfully fill the ear by their number and cadence, to ſuch as know the beauty of verſifying.

            <p>LEt us begin with <hi>Fable,</hi> which is the firſt of the parts of the <hi>Epick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em,</hi> and conſider that of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and that of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> as they both ly naked without the Epiſodes or Digreſſions thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:34038:11"/>The Fable of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is, that one of the Chieftains of the Grecian Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malecontent and diſguſted by the General, retires from the Camp, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearkning to his Duty, Reaſon, or Friends; deſerts the publick intereſt and that of the State, to comply with the impetuoſity of his reſentment; he abandons himſelf to grief in a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary retirement. His Enemies make their advantage of his abſence, and grow too powerful for his Party; they kill his beſt Friend; he takes up Arms again to revenge his Death; and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion makes him do what Reaſon had not been able to get from him; and in fine, he kills the Head of the adverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This is the Fable of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Epiſodes, and deſpoil'd of all its Ornaments.</p>
            <p>That of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is this. A Prince forc'd to fly by reaſon of the Ruine of his Country, comes to ſeek up and down the World for another eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; He makes his Gods and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Companions of his flight. The

Gods, moved with that Piety of his, concern themſelves to eſtabliſh him in the nobleſt Country in the world; and he becomes the Founder of the moſt flouriſhing Empire that ever was.</p>
            <p>Let us make a compariſon between theſe two Fables, and compute the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the two Heroes by that of their actions. The action of <hi>Achilles</hi> is <note n="‖" place="bottom">

ſelf a character of ferocity, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is the vice oppoſite to Heroiſme, if we may uſe that term. For as Heroiſme is above Man, ſo its contrary is below him.</p>
            <p>The action of <hi>Aeneas</hi> has a more perfect end than that of <hi>Achilles</hi>; it puts a period to affairs by the death of <hi>Turnus</hi>; that of <hi>Achilles</hi> puts no period to them. The Siege of <hi>Troy</hi> laſts a whole year after <hi>Hectors</hi> death; which occaſioned <hi>Quintus Calaber,</hi> and an Egyptian named <hi>Tryphiodorus,</hi> Authors of no mean note, to obſerve, that the <hi>Iliad</hi> is imperfect, becauſe they are not terminated by <hi>Hector's</hi> death, but his death made an obſtacle to that termination; and conſequently, which way ſoever we look on the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> we find, that its end is much more fortunate and fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat than that of the <hi>Iliad.</hi>

                  <hi>Leg.</hi> l. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Plato</hi> teaches that imitation is not to be made, but from the things that are moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd. Beſides as the image, in a juſt and regular imitation, ought to be like the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34038:15"/>
ſo ought not this original to be any one man or Prince in particular, but the idea of a Prince or accompliſh'd Perſon in general. According to this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del hath <hi>Plato</hi> deſcrib'd the perfect idea of a juſt man; <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that of a Prince; and <hi>Cicero,</hi> that of an Orator; by attributing to each what was moſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent and accompliſh'd in the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea which he fram'd to himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>And hence it is apparent, not only that Homer followed not that maxime in framing his Hero, ſince he has made him ſubject to great weakneſſes and notorious imperfections, inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting into the idea, which he pretends to give of him, the conſummation of all the Vertues, according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement of <hi>Paul Beni</hi> in his <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Diſcourſes: Nel poema Heroico conviene eſprimer l'idea di perfettiſſimo Capitano: ò vero formar Heroe in cui ſia il colmo di tutte le vertù militari e ciuili. In an Heroick Poem, tis requiſite to expreſſe the idea of a moſt perfect Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,

or to forme ſuch an Hero in whom ſhould be the height of all vertues mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary &amp; civil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is a very conſiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that <hi>Virgil</hi> had over <hi>Homer.</hi> For whereas the latter had not, for the making up of his Hero, any other idea then that of the Vertue of <hi>Hercules, Theſeus,</hi> or ſome other perſon of the primitive times, who were celebrated only for their ſtrength and vigour, it is no wonder if there be ſuch a defect of Morality in the Hero he hath given us, conſidering the time wherein he fram'd him: there being not then either in Hiſtory or Books any idea of moral Vertue. And whereas men knew not of any greater enemies to oppoſe, than Monſters and Wild-Beaſts, there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only bodies and armes to pretend to the title of Hero. They knew not then that there were ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and terrible enemies, to wit, their paſſions and their own deſires, and moderation and juſtice were not as yet vertues much known in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:34038:16"/>Thus <hi>Virgil,</hi> beſides the advantage he had of framing his Heros out of the two Heroes of <hi>Homer,</hi> that is, the valour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and the prudence of <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> had alſo the opportunity to adde thereto the Gallantry of <hi>Ajax,</hi> the wiſedome of <hi>Nestor,</hi> the indefatigable patience of <hi>Diomedes,</hi> and the other vertues, whereof <hi>Homer</hi> ſets down the characters in his two Poems: to all which reuniting yet further the other vertues which he had obſerved in all other illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious men, as <hi>Themiſtocles, Epaminondas, Alexander, Hannibal, Ingurth,</hi> and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other forreigners, as alſo in <hi>Horatius Camillus, Scipio, Sertorius, Pompey, Caeſar,</hi> and a great number of others of his own Country. Had he not a ground-work infinitely greater to fancy to himſelf an accompliſh'd Hero than <hi>Homer</hi> had? Thus did the Painter <hi>Zeuxis</hi> finiſh that famous Picture of <hi>Helena,</hi> which he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and was the admiration of his age, much more happily, and after a more compleat manner, than <hi>Apelles</hi> did that of <hi>Venus</hi>; inasmuch as <hi>Zeuxis</hi> fram'd his idea from all the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34038:16"/>
he had found in the rareſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his time, whereas <hi>Apelles</hi> would frame his only from his own pure ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which he found to fall ſhort in the execution; ſo that he was forc'd to leave his piece imperfect, as being of opinion, that he was not able to finiſh it as he had begun it.</p>
            <p>This inequality in the ſubject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I treat will appear yet much more evident, if we but take the pains to compare the pourtraicture which <hi>Horace</hi> hath left us of <hi>Achilles,</hi> with that which <hi>Virgil</hi> makes of <hi>Aeneas. Achilles</hi> is a Bravo, but withal a haſty, impetuous, furious, paſſionate, violent, unjuſt, inexorable one, a contemner of Lawes, and one that places all his reaſon in the ſword he wears by his ſide;</p>

In fine, this Hero of <hi>Homer,</hi> whoſe repute is ſo great, and ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrated through all ages, is but an epitome of imperfections and vices.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, <hi>Virgil</hi> makes a conjunction, of all the vertues to frame his: he gives him Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Gods; piety, towards his Country; tenderneſſe and friendſhip for his Relations and equity and juſtice, towards all. He is undaunted in danger,

The danger ſtartles him not, though he were alone at his going forth arm'd out of his houſe. Without conſulting his own people he runs to the place where the tumult was, the confuſion of a ſurpriz'd City, and the moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing exigency, that could be, call him away;

purſuing things any further; it had been an impiety, and not a mark of valour to ſtand out longer againſt ſo many Gods combin'd together. Yet being come to his houſe, which he did only in order to the defence of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life, though with the loſs of his own, and perceiving he would not ſurvive the deſtruction of his Country, he arms once more at leaſt, to go and court a glorious death;

Tis not to Men, but to the Gods only that he yeilds; I am in doubt, whether Gallantry can be advanc'd any higher; and yet this is but the beginning, and the firſt eſſay of that of <hi>Aeneas</hi>: all the courageous actions he performs in the ſequel of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> bear the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his valour: which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear miraculous even in theſe times, wherein that excellent name is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſtinction beſtowed on the moſt temerarious ſallies and eruptions of fury and brutality.</p>

            <p>THe diſpoſition or diſtribution of the Fable conſiſts in three things, to wit, the natural deduction or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the principal action, and all the matters which compoſe it; an exact intermixture of what is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and what miraculous; and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalling and correſpondence of the Epiſodes or Digreſſions, with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal action. Theſe three qualities, which comprehend the diſtribution of the Fable, by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> called the <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the things</hi> are ſo eſſential to the Poem, that it cannot be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely compleat without them.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the Action, which ought to be entire, and perfect, according to the advice of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>: that is to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34038:23"/>
ſay, as he explains it, ſuch as hath a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, a middle, and an end. <hi>Horace</hi> would have theſe parts to have a certain proportion and connexion among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<q>Primo nè nedium, medio ne diſcrepet imum</q>
And theſe are the obſervations which may be made upon our Poems as to this point. If the action and principal ſubject of the Iliad be the war of <hi>Troy,</hi> according to the ſentiment of <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ad Loll. l.</hi> I. <hi>Ep.</hi> II.</note> 
               <hi>Horace,</hi> a great Maſter in that Art, who calls <hi>Homer Trojani belli Scriptorem,</hi> and that of many others; that action is defective and imperfect, for that war has not, in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end; and it would be as it were a Statue which ſhould have neither head nor foot. So that we might apply to that work this verſe of <hi>Horace</hi>;
<q>
                  <l>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Ad Piſon.</note>Infelix operis ſummâ, qui ponere totum</l>

               </q>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:34038:23"/>
But if it be the anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> as it is more likely, and as <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf acknowledges by his propoſition; that anger has indeed a beginning; but it has neither end, nor middle: for it is thruſt out of doors by another animoſity of the ſame perſon againſt <hi>Hector</hi> for the death of <hi>Patroclus.</hi> So that there are two angers, one upon the loſſe of his Friend, the other upon their taking away of his Miſtreſſe. But the greateſt defect is, that the reſt of the Poem has no connection with that anger; and <hi>Homer,</hi> during the ſpace of eighteen books, thinks no more of it, as if he had clearly forgot his propoſition and deſigne, which like a ſtarre ſhould regulate the courſe of it, or be as it were a Compaſſe which a man cannot have out of his ſight but he muſt deviate. During that long intervall he ſpeaks only of ſieges, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells, ſurpriſes, conſultations of the Gods, and all relates to the ſiege of <hi>Troy.</hi> Which occaſion'd <hi>Horace's</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of opinion, that the ſubject of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is the war of <hi>Troy,</hi> according
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34038:24"/>
to the very name it goes under. And ſo which way ſoever we look on that Poem, it will appeare defective in that part</p>
            <p>Nor is the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> an action, any way more perfect than that of the <hi>Iliad.</hi> It begins with the voyages of <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> and ends with thoſe of <hi>Vlyſſes.</hi> All is made for <hi>Telemachus</hi> in the four firſt books; <hi>Menelaus, Neſtor</hi> and the other <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes relate to him the adventures of <hi>Troy</hi>; all relate to that, there's no thought at all of <hi>Vlyſſes</hi>; which made <hi>Paul Beni</hi> affirme in his <hi>Academical Diſcourſes</hi> upon <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> that the Fable of the <hi>Odyſſes</hi> is clearly double; <hi>E chiara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente provato che l'Odiſſe a contenga due peregrinationi, e in ſomma ſia di doppia favola.</hi> Not that I abſolutely allow it to be ſo; yet I ſtick not to pretend, that it is hard to find therein the principal action very regularly carried on, and according to the proportions requir'd by <hi>Horace,</hi> in the forementioned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for the natural connection of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34038:24"/>
parts. Nay this very voyage of <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> bears not any proportion to that of <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> which is the principal action. It contributes nothing at all, nay not ſo much as to miniſter any occaſion for his returne, which is brought about by the diſpoſition of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians.</hi> Which made <hi>Beni</hi> ſay, that the four firſt books of the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> are neither Epiſode nor part of action, nor have any connection with the reſt of the work. Take them as they are, one knows not what to make of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aeneid,</hi> methinks, is not charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eable with that defect. <hi>Aeneas</hi> leaves <hi>Phrygia,</hi> makes his voyages, and ſettles himſelf in <hi>Italy</hi>; all is conſequent in that deſigne, and all relates to the eſtabliſhment of a new Empire, which is the true ſubject of the Poem. And <hi>Virgil</hi> proſecutes it to the deſign'd mark without digreſſing to what hath no relation thereto.</p>

better obſerv'd in the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> than the <hi>Iliad</hi>; for there, every thing is introduc'd in its order and place, and no man ever better follow'd that diſtribution of matters, and that ſeries of events then <hi>Virgil</hi> has done. Thence <hi>Horace</hi> recommends it above all things to the poet,
<q>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ad Pison.</note>Vt jam nunc dicat, jam nunc debe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia dici.</q>

in regard the grace and divertive ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in a work cannot proceed from any thing but that diſtribution.</p>
            <p>And not to dilate here, upon what may be particularly and minutely obſerv'd therein, I ſhall only make a tranſient compariſon between the games or divertiſements, which <hi>Achilles</hi> makes in the 23. book of the <hi>Iliads</hi> upon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34038:26"/>
the death of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and thoſe which <hi>Aeneas</hi> makes for the Apotheoſis of <hi>Anchiſes</hi> in the 5. of the <hi>Aeneids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Games may be numbred among thoſe actions which may occurre in the lives of Heroes, and be ſo introduc'd into the matters of the <hi>Heroick</hi> Poem, in regard they are occaſions of magnificence, which is one of the qualities that make up the Hero. <hi>Virgil</hi> makes his in the V. of his <hi>Aeneids,</hi> firſt to divert the imagination of his Reader from the mournfull object of <hi>Dido's</hi> death, which he had repreſented in the fourth book, and which had ſomething of ſavageneſſe in it; ſecondly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert himſelf by the diverting of his Hero; and theſe are of thoſe ſorts of pleaſures, which, to be receiv'd well ought to come in, in their place.</p>

If <hi>Virgil</hi> had not plac'd his Games well in the ſecond or third book; it had
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34038:26"/>
been to take breath too ſoon, as <hi>Homer</hi> does it too late in the 23. of the Iliad. The time is elaps'd; 'tis unſeaſonable; people are quite tir'd out; he ſhould not have amus'd himſelf being ſo neer the cloze of it. 'Twere much at one, as if a Traveller earneſtly deſirous to returne from the <hi>Indies</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> after he had ſpent two years in his voyage, ſhould trifle away a whole month at <hi>Dieppe,</hi> in playing at tick-tack, or ſeeing playes. This would argue a ſtrange want of judgment. And this we muſt ſeriouſly ſay of <hi>Homer,</hi> that he might have been more ſerious towards the end of his work, and in all likelihood he ought to have been a little weary, and not have diverted from making up to his final stage, being got ſo neer it. There are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of things utterly incredible in the repreſentation of thoſe Games. The Surveyors or Judges make diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in them, which tire out and exhauſt the patience of the Readers.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of the Diſpoſition
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34038:27"/>
which is the juſt intermixture and attemperation of what is miraculous with what is probable, is alſo eſſentiall to the Epick Poem, which ought to have ſomewhat admirable in it, to move the hearts of Grandees for whom it is writ, that they may be animated to great things: but with this caution, that it ought alſo to be probable, ſo to avoid giving an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute check to their emulation, and in fine running them into deſpair. Truth it ſelf which the Hiſtorian ought ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enquire into, being ſometimes too ſtrong to be imitated, is not alwayes ſo convenient to be the matter of the Epick Poem, as Probability, which has a greater proportion to things than men are wont to make. For example the action of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who defeated the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> with the jaw bone of an aſſe, is an Heroick action; yet can it not be the ſubject of an Epick Poem. For though it bee true, yet is it not likely to be ſo; and conſequently it is too miraculous to be propos'd for imitation; we are therefore to avoid
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34038:27"/>
that exceſſe by a juſt attemperation of probability, without which all becomes fabulous and incredible, and makes no impreſſion on mens hearts, which cannot endure to be mov'd at any thing but what ſeems poſſible to them.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee whether <hi>Homer</hi> hath been more fortunate in the obſervance of this Rule, than of that I ſpoke of laſt. He inſiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo little on the probable part, and ſo far expatiates in the miraculous, out of an exceſſive earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be alwayes thought admirable and to hurry mens minds along with him, that he does not leave any thing to be done by reaſon, or paſſion, nor indeed by nature; all is done by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines and engines. If <hi>Priamus</hi> hath loſt Hector, there is a neceſſity of <hi>Jupiter's</hi> ſending the Goddeſſe <hi>Iris,</hi> his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to give him an advertiſement that he ſhould take a care of his Sons body, and redeem it from <hi>Achilles.</hi> Could not his Father, who had ſo great a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his Son, and was ſo ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to obſerve the ceremonies perform'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34038:28"/>
at funeralls, and was ſo loath that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>depoſitum</hi> ſhould be left to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the birds, think of it himſelf? There muſt be a machine to put him in mind that he is a Father.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Telemachus</hi> in the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> go to find out <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> in the Courtes of <hi>Greece</hi> he cannot ſtir a foot forwards without the aſſiſtance of <hi>Minerva,</hi> ſhe is his guide wherever he goes, his remembrancer of all things; he does not do or think of any thing himſelf, he is a great child, whom a Governeſſe leads up and down, by the ſleeves. Should not honour, duty, nature have mov'd his heart, and have rais'd a litle diſquiet in him for an abſent Father, and that near the ſpace of eighteen years, but there muſt be a neceſſity of another's help and a recourſe to the machine? Nay this very machine hath not any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of probability, in as much as <hi>Minerva</hi> conducts <hi>Telemachus</hi> to ſeek for <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> all over <hi>Greece,</hi> ſave only to the place where he is, which ſhe ought not to have been ignorant of,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34038:28"/>
upon the ſcore of her Divinity, from which nothing ſhould be conceald.</p>
            <p>And yet this is <hi>Homer</hi>'s method, who to be alwayes vaulting and jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he might be every where the more wondred at, would do all things by extraordinary waies. It may be ſaid, that he makes his Gods ſuch as are to be daily Employ'd, and orders them, as thoſe among the Comedians who are to act any part. <hi>Mercury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Coachman to <hi>Priamus,</hi> to carry him to <hi>Achilles,</hi> to demand the body of his Son; and leaſt he ſhould be expoſ'd to the Scouts in his way to the <hi>Grecian</hi> campe, <hi>Iupiter</hi> makes uſe of the ſame <hi>Mercury,</hi> and his Miniſtery, to ſet them aſleep: and to prepare <hi>Achilles's</hi> heart by ſome ſentiment of compaſſion, <hi>Thetis,</hi> his mother, muſt go and prevent him, and diſpoſe him thereto by <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s order.

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:34038:29"/>
be ſome ſuperiour power to deliver him out of ſo ſtrange a trouble. There is a neceſſity that a God ſhould ſpeak to ſurmount his difficulty and break that engagement. <hi>Mercury</hi> does it</p>
            <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of <hi>Aeneas</hi> in the firſt of the <hi>Aeneids.</hi> 'Tis not a ſhepherd or a huntſman that ſerves him for a guide, in the wandring condition he was in, which was naturall enough; but <hi>Venus</hi> appears to him, acquaints him what Country he is in, and with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of his companions, whom he thought loſt, and ſhews him the wayes. For ſuch was the conjuncture of things then, that it was neceſſary it ſhould be a Divinity to raiſe up <hi>Aeneas's</hi> courage who had ſuffer'd extreamly in a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tempeſt, who had ſeen ſome ſhips of his Fleet caſt away, and had been forc'd by the ſtorm upon a deſert ſhore, deſtitute of all humane relief and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd almoſt to deſpair. It was fit the Poet ſhould not leave him in that extremity: nay it was likely the Gods
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34038:30"/>
ought in ſome meaſure to concerne themſelves for him, ſince his piety made him ſo careful of their intereſt, and ſince they were the companions of his exile and flight; and decorum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd that it ſhould be his Mother who appear'd in it, and ſhould make it her buſineſſe to encourage him, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially after ſhe had been inform'd by <hi>Iupiter</hi> of his deſtiny.</p>
            <p>Moreover, beſides that all theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines and contrivances of <hi>Virgil</hi> are more grounded in reaſon and likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood than thoſe of <hi>Homer</hi>; you will find them leſſe frequent, and leſſe forc'd, if you take the leaſure to examine them one after another.

It ought not to be forc'd, violently brought in, nor drawn from far, and ſo betray its diſaffinity to the ſubject; in fine it ought not to be too frequent, that it may not occaſion a confuſion of matters. <hi>Homer</hi> begins his Odyſſey, which is his more perfect Poem, by an Epiſode of four Books; he recedes from his ſubject e're he was well gotten into it, and to make a regular ſtructure he begins with a piece not ſuitable to the workes, according to the obſervation I have already made of it.</p>
            <p>Has <hi>Virgil</hi> any ſuch thing in his Epiſodes, which are ſo admirably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the ſubject, as is that of <hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>Evander,</hi> that of <hi>Niſus</hi> and <hi>Euryalus,</hi> that of <hi>Camilla</hi> and others? Nay that of <hi>Dido</hi> which is the greateſt and largeſt of them all, never excludes the perſon of the <hi>Hero</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:34038:31"/>
but it is he that ſpakes, and relates his own adventures: if he recedes ought from his ſubject, he ſtill makes frequent returns upon himſelf; a thing not to be found in the <hi>Illiad</hi> or <hi>Odyſſey. Achilles</hi> and <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> who are the Heroes cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in them, are quite out of ſight for the ſpace of ſeveral books, and a man may travel a great way ere he can meet with them.</p>
            <p>I leave it to thoſe who can better ſpare leiſure, to examine, whether the Epiſodes of <hi>Homer</hi> are not more forc'd and leſſe natural than thoſe of <hi>Virgil.</hi> What reference has the wound which <hi>Mars</hi> received from <hi>Diomedes</hi> to the anger of <hi>Achilles? Homer</hi> expatiates upon that adventure in the fifth of the <hi>IliMars</hi> crying like a child and makes his complaint to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who unkindly entertains him with bitter railleries. However, to try all wayes, they think fit to ſend for <hi>Paeon,</hi> the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of the Gods to cure him: The God, deſs <hi>Hebe</hi> concernes her ſelfe for him. The poet, who thinks the paſſage

Pleaſant, proſecutes it with might and maine. He deſcends to obſcenity, and would bee pittied, were it not for the reſpect wherewith men are poſſeſſ'd for the grandeur of his Genius.</p>
            <p>But to forbeare being too particular, which would be an endleſſework we may ſay <hi>Virgil</hi> never recedes from his ſubject, Homer is for the moſt part at a diſtance from his; and by the multiplicity and great traine of his Epiſodes, he is continually hurried away with the impetuoſity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance of his imaginations, which he followes without any diſcretion or choice. He may be compar'd to thoſe Travellors, who have a great journey to go, yet every thing ſtops and amuſes them. There is not a good blow given with a ſword in the heat of an engagement., but he muſt take occaſion thence to tell ſtories and derive genealogies.</p>

               <hi>Achilles,</hi> in the nineteenth of the <hi>Iliads</hi> goes to his Mother <hi>Thetis,</hi> to make her ſenſible of the fear he was in, that the flies might injure the body of his friend <hi>Patroclus,</hi> then newly kill'd, and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his wounds, which might breed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, ſuch as might render the body moſt deformed.

for which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> blame that Poet. But what extravagance was it in that accompliſh'd Sage, ſo ſoon to forget his wife, a women ſo vertuous as ſhe was, and his Son who was ſo dear to him, to ſquander away ſo long a time in the dalliances of his Proſtitute <hi>Calypſo,</hi> and to run after the famous Sorceres <hi>Circe,</hi> and being a King, as he was, to abaſe himſelfe ſo far as to go to fifty-cuffes with a pitiful raſkally beggar named <hi>Irus?

not himſelf ſmother his ſentiment as to the injuſtice of the civil war; though it had occaſion'd the eſtabliſhment of the Empire, and that of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. He could not approve it, and as if his heart had been republicane even in Monarchy, he condemnes it, but with the greateſt caution and tenderneſſe imaginable, by cajolling even <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe, who was the Author thereof;

            <head>OBSERV. VIII. Of Sentiments.</head>
            <p>THe Sentiments, which are the fourth qualification of the Poem, have ſo great a reference to Manners that the principles of the one are thoſe alſo of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34038:35"/>
the other. Nay it may be ſaid, that the ſentiments are in effect, but only the expreſſions of the Manners. It is not therfore to be admir'd, if <hi>Virgil</hi> have that advantage over <hi>Homer,</hi> ſince he had, after ſo ſingular a manner, that of the Manners. He has that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to the age wherein he writ, the ſpirit and humour whereof was much more juſt and polite than that of <hi>Homer,</hi> who made it not ſo much his buſineſſe to think well, as to ſpeak well: for his ſentiments are never ſo excellent as his diſcourſes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not ſtand to make a long parallel between them, but only a particular obſervation of ſome of the ſentiments which <hi>Homer</hi> attributes to his Heroes, whence a judgement may be fram'd of the reſt. <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> in the firſt of the Iliads, ſaies, that the reaſon obliging him to retaine <hi>Chryſeis,</hi> is, that he has a greater affection and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem for her than for <hi>Clytemneſtra.</hi> A very kind Huſband! to preferre a ſtranger before a Princeſſe, who was his Wife, and a well deſerving perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:34038:36"/>
               <hi>Neſtor,</hi> in the 9 of the Iliads, tells <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> who deſires his advice upon the diſtraction of affaires, by reaſon of the abſence of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that he will give him an incomparable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and that never any perſon ſince the beginning of the world, hath given any that was more prudent and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. The good man reads a lecture full of oſtentation upon the chapter of Prudence; and indeed conſidering his reputation of being ſo wiſe a man, he might have been more modeſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. Yet is not the counſell he gives him of ſo great account, ſince it amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only to this, that <hi>Achilles</hi> ſhould be appeas'd, ſatiſfy'd, and by plauſible inſinuations, oblig'd to return to the <hi>Army.</hi> This argu'd not any great reach of policy; a perſon of ordinary endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might have given that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antilochus,</hi> his Son, in the 23. of the Iliads, ſpeaks to his Horſes, enters into a formal diſcourſe with them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures them to do their utmoſt to get the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34038:36"/>
better of <hi>Menclaus</hi> and <hi>Diomedes,</hi> in the courſe which was to be run at the Games, celebrated upon occaſion of the death of <hi>Patroclus.</hi> He excites them with the moſt preſſing earneſtneſſe of diſcourſe imaginable; yet with very childiſh reaſons, telling them that his Father, <hi>Neſtor,</hi> will turne them out of his ſervice, or get their throats cut, if they do not as they ſhould do: in fine, he becomes a pathetick Orator to brute beaſts.</p>
            <p>True it is, that <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the diſcourſe he made upon <hi>Homer,</hi> excuſes him for the liberty he took to make <hi>Antilochus,</hi> in that paſſage, as alſo <hi>Hector</hi> in another, ſpeak to their horſes, upon the ſcore of his opinion of the tranſmigration of ſoules, which he had taken from <hi>Phythagoras</hi>; But I referre my ſelf to that philoſophy, whether it renders beaſts leſſe beaſts than they were, and more capable of hearkening to reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jupiter</hi> tells <hi>Mars,</hi> in the fifth of the

               <hi>Iliads,</hi> after <hi>Diomedes</hi> had wounded him, that he could not endure him, that he deſerv'd the miſfortune which had happen'd to him, for haveing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd too far with the counſells of his Mother <hi>Iuno,</hi> whoſe humour was intractable. What kindneſſes were theſe in the Prince of the Gods, towards his wife? What conſolation to his Son <hi>Mars</hi> who was then newly wounded? We ſhould never come to an end, if we minutely remark'd all. Beſides that, <hi>Virgil</hi> is not ſubject to thoſe weakneſſes, he is alwayes ſerious, alwayes great, alwayes ſoaring on high, to keep up the Heroick Character: He does not abaſe himſelf to act the pleaſant droll, nor fall down to a childiſh familiarity, contrary to the decorum of his rank, from which <hi>Homer</hi> many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grades himſelf. This latter puts off that air of Majeſty, which ought to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to his character; he ever and anon falls into fooliſh freaks, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating to the familiar way of talking, and turning things to an aire of divertisment: as when, in the 8. of

But to do Homer all the right he deſerves, we may juſtly affirm, that that weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not ſo much to be attributed to him, as to the age he liv'd in, which was not capable of any greater polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Tranſitions,</hi> which, upon the account of their character, ought to be very much varied, for the greater divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reader, are much alike, in the greateſt part of his work. We cannot reckon up above twenty or thirty ſorts in the whole extent of neere thirty thouſand verſes: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently one and the ſame connection, preſenting it ſelfe ordinarily, is very apt to give diſguſt, by ſo frequent a repetition: which gave <hi>Martial</hi> occaſion to make a little ſport at the <gap reason="foreign">

Muſes are not ſo light and ſuch libertines us the Grecian;
<q>Qui Muſas colimus ſeveriores.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The compariſons, in the ſame work, are flat, forc'd, not very natural in ſome paſſages, never very excellent, though, in ſo great a number as there are of them, it is impoſſible but there ſhould be ſome pertinent and ſuitable enough. I ſhall ſay nothing of that which is grown ſo famous for its bluntneſſe, its undecency, and its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is generally known to all, of the Aſſe feeding in a wheat field, and which the children would drive out thence with poles and ſtaves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to <hi>Ajax</hi> in the midſt of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement orewhelm'd with a haile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhower of blowes by the enemies. I leave it to be imagin'd what a noble effect that ſhould have in a production ſo grave and ſerious as that of the <hi>Iliad</hi>; and whether the draught and colours of this Compariſon afford a proſpect any thing pleaſant, whatever
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34038:41"/>
light it be turn'd to. For these are ſome Grammarians, who ſet their wits on the rack to find ſome delicacy in it. Yet ſhall not ſtick to acknowledge, that there are in this Poet, ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable compariſons, but very ſeldome to be met withall, wherein he expoſes all that is imaginable of graces and beauty in the diſcourſe and expreſſion, and whereof <hi>Virgil</hi> hath ſo admirably made his advantage, and which he hath ſo well plac'd in his Work by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning them his own air and light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deſcriptions,</hi> which are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what is moſt childiſh and of leaſt force in Eloquence, are over-frequent in <hi>Homers</hi> Works, and ſpun out too much; and they carry with them a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain air of affectation. The deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Alcinous</hi>'s Garden in the ſeventh, and that of the Port of <hi>Ithaca</hi> in the thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>teenth of the <hi>Odyſſyes,</hi> are of that ſort. The deſcription of the Port, and that of the Grot inhabited by the Nymphs, takes up eighteen verſes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>Porphyrius</hi> hath certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34038:41"/>
That of <hi>Virgil,</hi> where he deſcribes Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> in the third, conſiſts only of three verſes, though it might have given him ſo fair an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of dilating. True it is, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Port of <hi>Lybia</hi> amounts to ten verſes, and that of <hi>Fame,</hi> in the fourth, to much more: but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is pardonable, in regard it was requiſite to give the Readers mind ſome breathing-time, after that of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; and it is the greateſt deſcription of any place in the whole <hi>Aeneid.</hi> And the ſecond, which is the deſcription of <hi>Fame,</hi> is not the nobleſt part in that Author.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. There is no ſuch thing, he is impoſ'd upon; I have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above twenty ſorts of other Epithets in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> for <hi>Achilles</hi> alone. <hi>Virgil,</hi> in compariſon, is poore as to thoſe kind of ornamants, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the rich and fruitfull trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, which the <hi>Latine</hi> has not. Yet may it be ſaid of this exteriour dreſs, what a certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaid, ſometime ſince of a great Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, who was a very handſome perſon, that, if his ranting ſleeves and Periwig, were taken off, he would be but as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man. For if we ſtrip <hi>Homer</hi> of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs and Epithets, he would come into the rank of ordinary Poets. And that doubtleſs is the moſt ornamental part of him, and what makes up one of his greateſt beauties.</p>
            <p>But it were not amiſs, after all, to obſerve, that theſe Epithets, which ſo much adorn him, are very ſimple, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, and ordinary. For without any more ado, he calls ſnow <hi>white</hi>; milk
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34038:43"/>
               <hi>ſweet</hi>; fire <hi>burning.</hi> He does ſeek ſo much delicacy therein as our young Authors, who do not allow any epithets ſupportable, if they have not a kind of contrary or counter-ſignification to the words join'd with them, to give a more extraordinary aire to the diſcourſe, and to make it glitter and ſparkle by that oppoſition, of which the depraved taſte makes a delicacy. For there are ſome who think it the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt thing in the world to ſee thoſe words join'd together, which cannot endure one the other. <hi>Ovid,</hi> in his <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> and <hi>Heroick Epiſtles,</hi> and <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> were the firſt that gave that falſe guſto to their age, which was ſo much a lover of ſimplicity. <hi>Seneca</hi> would needs imitate them, with all the writers of <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,</hi> the fragments of whom we read in his Controverſies; but they did it without that diſtinctive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, which is obſervable in <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Paterculus,</hi> who knew how to be thrifty in the diſpoſal of thoſe counterfeit pearles, <hi>Lucan</hi> and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34038:43"/>
               <hi>Tacitus</hi> made that character their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtudy, and made an art of clinching or quibbling, which for the moſt part is only a game conſiſting of words oppoſite among themſelves, ſuch as ſuperficial witts are ſo much enamour'd of. And in fine, 'twas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to the propagation of this univerſal debauche, that the Epigrams of <hi>Martial,</hi> and the Panegyricks of <hi>Pliny, Pacatus,</hi> and <hi>Mamertinus</hi> came into play. Not but that this kind of writing has its beauties, but they are like thoſe of women who paint, and are forc'd to ſeek out exteriour and artificial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, becauſe they have not any naturall or reall ones.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be argu'd hence, but that an Epithet which is ſmart, briſk, and well plac'd, is a marvailous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament in a diſcourſe, as that uſ'd by <hi>Dido</hi> in her Epiſtle to <hi>Aeneas,</hi>

            <head>OBSERVATION XI. How the character of <hi>Homer</hi> is to be diſtinguiſh'd from that of <hi>Virgil.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHoever is deſirous to judge with any kind of certainty of theſe two incomparable Authors, muſt be very exact in diſcerning between their ſeveral characters, which are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite. For if <hi>Homer</hi> be obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the inclination he has to ſpeak much, <hi>Virgil</hi> is remarkable for his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be ſilent: and it is from this difference, that we may make an exact computation of the ſingularity of their <hi>Genius</hi>'s, and of the eſſential mark of their character. There are many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons guilty of a great affectation to be thought Criticks, and make it their buſineſs to judge of <hi>Virgil</hi> by profound reflections, without having ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in what the eminent quality of the fancy and judgement of that Poet, whereby he is diſtinguiſh'd from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34038:45"/>
all the reſt, does conſiſt. For my own part, who admire nothing ſo much in his way of writing, as the admirable reſervedneſſe and moderation he is maſter of in expreſſing things, and in not expreſſing any more then what is requiſite, I have ever been of opinion, that he might be diſtinguiſh'd by them. A man muſt be very attentive in the peruſall of him; to find out that his reſervedneſſe and ſilence in certain paſſages, ſpeakes much, and argues an exquiſite diſcretion; and when he has diſcover'd the ſecret of being well aſſur'd of his meaning, he finds him ſometimes as admirable in what he ſaies not, as in what he ſayes.</p>
            <p>And for my part, I do not know any Author but <hi>Virgil</hi> that has a talent of prudence great enough to keep in the whole ſtock of his moderation and ſtayedneſſe of iudgement, amidſt the ardour and excitations of an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination enflam'd by the genius of Poeſy, and that the moſt inſpire'd of any that ever was, <hi>Lucan,</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34038:46"/>
of him, is an inconſiderate writer; and <hi>Statius,</hi> a furious one. Nor could <hi>Ovid</hi> ever arrive to that excellency, till towards his latter dayes, when he writ his <hi>Faſti,</hi> which is the only part of his works, wherein he is moderate and diſcreet: in all the reſt he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his youthfullneſſe. Nor do his inductions of examples and compariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his books <hi>De Triſtibus,</hi> and his other Elegies, come neer that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; and his <hi>Heroick Epiſtles,</hi> which I call the flower of the Roman wit, have not any thing of that matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of judgement, which is the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent perfection of <hi>Virgil.</hi> As to which perticular I compare him to thoſe Generalls of Armies, who carry along with them into the midſt of a fight all the flegme and tranquillity of there Cloſet Counſells, and who in the greateſt heat of action, amidſt the noiſe of Canons, Drums, and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and the general diſtraction and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of an Engagement, are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to any thing but what their own prudence and moderation dictates
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34038:46"/>
to them, inducing them to conſult only thier own reaſon. And this is a character not to be imagin'd in any but great Soules, and ſuch as dare pretend to a conſummate wiſdome, as was that o <hi>Virgil,</hi> who in the heat of his poetica fury, ſaies no more then is requiſite to be ſaid, and alwayes leaves more to be thought of, then he ſaies of a thing.</p>
            <p>This is a commendation much like that which <hi>Pliny</hi> gives the admirable Painter named <hi>Timantes,</hi> whoſe elogy he makes in the 10. chap. of the 35. book of his Hiſtory: <hi>Timanti plurimum adfuit ingenii, in omnibus operibus ejus intelligitur plus ſemper quam pingitur.</hi> And a litle lower he addes, the better to expreſſe his reflection; <hi>Rarum in ſucceſſu artis, ut oſtendat etiam quae occultat</hi>: And which was that miraculous elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks to his Friend: <note n="‖" place="bottom">Epiſt. ad. Att. lib. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Sumpſi aliquid hoc loco de tuâ eloquentiâ, nam tacui.</hi> And it is my judgement, that in this exact circumſpection, and this admirable
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34038:47"/>
parſimony of diſcourſe, we are to find the true character of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who ſlightly paſſes over things, as a Traveller that is in great haſte, without inſiſting too long upon them: he generouſly prunes &amp; cuts off all the ſuperfluities, that he may retaine but what is purely neceſſary. And indeed in that anatomy of things conſiſts the excellency of a work, which is never more perfect, than when there cannot be any thing cut off from it.</p>
            <p>It was alſo in this perfection that that exquiſiteneſſe of ſound ſence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, which reign'd at <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and which was the character of all the excellent witts that writ then, and whom we look on as the only modells of the purity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſobriety of expreſſions, and that admirable aire of writing which is in vogue at this day.</p>
            <p>Of this we have a proofe in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> gave <hi>Tacca</hi> and <hi>Varius,</hi> to review the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> which the Author would have ſuppreſſ'd, as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34038:47"/>
not thinking is compleat. He permitted them to cut off thoſe parts of it, which might be taken away without injury to the work; but he forbad them to doe any thing thereto, nay not ſo much as to compleat the Verſes which were imperfect. Twas the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and guſto of that happy time to cut off what they could in diſcourſe, to be ſober and frugal therein, and to ſpeak little. <hi>Lucretius,</hi> who is ſo pure and ſo polite had not yet attai'd that perfection. And <hi>Catullus,</hi> who was the firſt among the Romanes, that began to improve and heighten the Language wtih the advantages of elegance, had not as yet learnt that great precept which Horace has ſince ſo much inculcated to the <hi>Piſone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi>;
<q>— Prudens verſus reprehendet inertes Ambitioſa recidet ornamenta; Luxuriantia compeſcat:</q>
He does not repeat any thing elſe, in his Satyr upon <hi>Lucilius:</hi>

And a litle lower, ſpeaking of the ſame <hi>Lucilius,</hi> hee ſaies, that if he had flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in his time, he would have known how to have contracted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and no doubt would have daſh'd out many things out of his verſes;
<q>Detereret ſibi multa, recideret omne quod ultra Perfectum traheretur —</q>
This was their courſe in that time, which they had learnt from the dictates of ſound ſence, then in its Empire, which <hi>Virgil</hi> hath ſo well practis'd, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he makes his eſſentiall character.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, that of <hi>Homer</hi> is obſervable for his tediouſneſſe in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and relating things. He is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt talker of all. Antiquity, inſomuch that the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves, though chargeable with exceſſive discourſing above all others, have reprehended <hi>Homer</hi> for that intemperance of words,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34038:48"/>
as a conſiderable miſcarriage in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which they call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He is ever in his rehearſalls, not only as to the ſame words, but alſo to the ſame things; and ſo he is in a perpetual circulation of repetitions. That flux of the tongue, and that ebullition of fancy make him carry things much beyond the mark they ought to have been levell'd at; and thence it comes, that the draughts he makes of things are for the moſt part too accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and by that means he leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done by the imagination of the Reader, who, in order to his particular ſatifaction, ought regularly to be as much taken up with what he thinks of, as what he reads.</p>
            <p>Vpon this account is it that <hi>Virgil</hi> never burthens his thoughts with the whole matter lying before him, that ſo he may leave ſome part of it expos'd to the reflections of thoſe who read him. Young Authors, who are all apt to be impertinently zealous in what they do, and to run into
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34038:49"/>
the character that has a ſmock of puerility; and all thoſe who are leſſe fortify'd with judgment, then fancy, are not able to comprehend this max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime: for, out of a defect of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they follow their natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and as by an exceſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and verboſity they carry things beyond their proper limits, ſo they ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily give <hi>ideas</hi> for true objects, by making too too accurate repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all the matter they handle. This is an imperfection which <hi>Apelles</hi> reprehended in the Painters of his time, as <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerves, <hi>Pictores eos errare dicebat, qui non ſentirent, quid eſſet ſatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet are we further to obſerve, that this defect relates only to the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and the words. For it is a very great perfection for any one to give the moſt compleat images he can of things, and alwaies to raiſe his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures upon the ground-work of the greateſt <hi>ideas.</hi>

            <head>OBSERV. XII. Of the unity of the Subject and Time of the two Poems.</head>
            <p>YEt is it to be acknowledg'd, that there cannot be any thing more advantageouſly ſaid of <hi>Homer,</hi> than what <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the wiſeſt and moſt judicious of all the Criticks, hath ſaid of him. He propoſes him in his Books of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy for the model of the <hi>Epick</hi> Poem, and he derives all his precepts from the <hi>Iliad</hi> and the <hi>Odyſſey.</hi> But it may alſo be urg'd on the other ſide, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> having not met with, in his time, but only two inconſiderable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, one upon <hi>Hercules.</hi> and the other upon <hi>Theſeus,</hi> whereof he ſpeaks in his Poeticks, which might come into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conteſt with the <hi>Iliad</hi> and the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſſey,</hi> it is not to be wondred at, that he takes theſe for a model, ſince the two others are rather the Lives
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34038:50"/>
of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Theſius,</hi> than the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of an Epick action.</p>
            <p>And that was it made <hi>Horace</hi> ſpeak ſo earneſtly againſt thoſe Poets, whom he calls <hi>Cyclick</hi> Authors, by reaſon of the pure natural and hiſtorical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation they gave of things, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying matters clearly againſt the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and the unity of action, which is eſſential to the <hi>Epopaea:</hi> upon which ſcore we are yet further to examine <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> that ſo we may not omit any thing requir'd in an exact compariſon.</p>
            <p>I grant, that as to the unity of the time, the <hi>Iliad</hi> and the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> have the preheminence over the <hi>Aeneid:</hi> for the action of the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> from <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſes's</hi> leaving <hi>Calypſo</hi> to his being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, laſts but forty five days; and the action of the <hi>Iliad</hi> takes up but eight or nine months at moſt: and the <hi>Aeneid</hi> takes up a whole year and ſomewhat more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:34038:50"/>Nay ſome pretend that the unity of action is more perfect in the two Poems of <hi>Homer,</hi> than it is in that of <hi>Virgil</hi>; inaſmuch as not only the action of both of them is one and the ſame, but alſo of one ſingle perſon. For <hi>Achilles</hi> does all things himſelf; the ſame thing is to be ſaid of <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms) who reeſtabliſhes himſelf without the aſſiſtance of any other: and that ſeems to argue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hint of grandeur. <hi>Aeneas</hi> does not any thing but with the aſſiſtance of his people; which is not ſo much to be wondred at. And <hi>Paul Beni</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in the ſecond of his <hi>Academical Diſcourſes,</hi> that the Apologiſt of <hi>Dante</hi> pretends that his Poem is more perfect in regard it is the action of one ſingle perſon: <hi>Coſtui Poema, oltre eſſer He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roico e fatto anco di attione, di uno aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutamente ſolo. E ciò ad eſſempio, non gia de l Aeneide, ove con aſſercito opra Enea: ma <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34038:51"/>
This Poem, beſides that it is Heroick, is alſo compos'd of action, and that of one perſon only: And this according to the example, not only of the Aeneid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Aeneas acts with an Army; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Iliad and Odyſſey, where in fine both</hi> Achilles <hi>and</hi> Ulyſſes <hi>perform alone all the heroick actions: whence he concludes, that</hi> Dante's <hi>Poem is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently marvellous and illuſtrious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this it may be anſwer'd, that the unity of the perſon is ſufficiently preſerv'd by that of his Character and condition; That the Epick Poem ought to preſent the perfect Idea of a great Captain and General of an Army, and and not of a Knight-Errant, who moſt commonly is but a phantaſm and a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Palladine: and it frames a greater character of a Hero, and it attributes to him a much more noble aire of dignity, to make him a Soveraign and the head of a people, as <hi>Beni</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in the ſame place: <hi>L' attione Heroica debbe eſſe una d'un ſolo, ma pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rò Prencipe &amp; capo di molti:</hi> in regard
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34038:51"/>
that, as he ſaies, great enterpriſes, ſuch as the conqueſt of Countries and Kingdoms, the ſieges of Cities, and Battels, ought to be carry'd on by Armies, managed by the conduct and deſignes of one perſon, which is as much as is requiſite for the unity of the action. Beſides, there is always a defectiveneſs as to matter of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in thoſe actions of Knight-Errants and ſolitary Worthies, ſuch as <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> was, and however they are dreſs'd up, they ſtill ſmell ſtrong of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance and Fable.</p>
            <p>Nay we may further add, that the unity of action, ſo it be rightly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is more perfectly ſerv'd in the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> than in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Hector,</hi> which ought to have clos'd the action, there are ſtill two Books to come; the 23. which comprehends the Exerciſes celebrated for the death of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and which contribute nothing to the principal action; and the 24. which contains the Lamentations of the Trojans, and the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34038:52"/>
ranſoming of <hi>Hector's</hi> body, which have no connection to the principal action, that being compleat without it.</p>
            <p>There is yet this further fault to be noted, that a Poem, which had no other deſign then to celebrate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Greeks, ſhould be cloſ'd with that which is done to <hi>Hector,</hi> the chiefeſt of their Enemies, where the Poet employes a whole Book, to give the deſcription of his funeral ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities; which procedure ſeems to be in ſome manner defective; and it is of ſuch a work we may cite that paſſage of <hi>Horace,</hi> which few under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand as it ought to be underſtood;</p>

            <p>In a word, <hi>Virgil</hi> is much more ſolid, his expreſſions have ſomewhat in them that is more real; He does not ſpeak ſo much at randome, nay his very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of greateſt tenderneſſe and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which in any other would diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a certain character of lightneſs, have not in his work any thing that is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and chimericall; there is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

his defect in point of valour. The death of <hi>Dido,</hi> touch'd over with an aire ſo pathetick, which begins with this Verſe
<q>At trepida et caeptis immanibus;—</q>
The abbridgement of the <hi>Romane</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grav'd upon the Buckler in the eight, the explication of the deſtinies of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in the firſt, the Conqueſts of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> to whom he dedicates his work in the ſixt which make an admirable elogy of that Emperour,
<q>Hic vir hic eſt &amp;c.</q>
and all thoſe admirable inſinuations, whereof he does with ſo much artifice make his advantage, to force his way into mens apprehenſions, and to inſpire them with his inclinations and affections, which every where beare the expreſſion of his genius, which are are ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of art, and cannot be perceiv'd but only by ſuch as are intimately acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, and accordingly able to judge of him. For there is a greater
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34038:55"/>
penetration and perſpicacity of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion requiſite, to diſcover what is good and excellent in a work, than to find in it what is defective: inaſmuch as the defects are more remarkable than the true beauties, which eaſily elude the reflections of perſons of an ordinary rate of underſtanding, and diſcover themſelves only to the more intelligent.</p>
            <p>But whereas the nobleſt paſſage of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and his reall Maſter-piece, is the paſſion of <hi>Dido,</hi> I cannot let it paſs without allowing it a ſtricter reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than any of the reſt. True it is, that Eloquence never employ'd all its advantages of artifice and ornaments in any Work with ſo great ſucceſs as in that. All the degrees of that paſſion, all the renovations of that growing affection, and that well known frailty of the ſexe, are there diſcover'd in ſuch a manner as raiſes admiration in the beſt able to judge of them; and the greater their abilities are, the more will they be diſpoſ'd to diſcover the excellency of that paſſage, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34038:55"/>
all the parts of it. All is neat, delicate and highly paſſionate in the deſcription of that adventure, and the world is not likely ever to ſee any thing that ſhall ſurpaſſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Taſſo</hi> indeed may haply afford us ſome paſſages which ſeem to have a greater eye of luſtre, as that of the adventure of <hi>Tancrede</hi> and <hi>Clorinda:</hi> but if we look on him of all ſides, we ſhall find, that all the proportions and correſpondencies with the principal action, do not ſeem to be ſo exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd there, as they are in that of <hi>Dido.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet is there one great reproach made to <hi>Virgil,</hi> to wit, that he has put a filthy ſlur on that Lady, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing ſo great a paſſion to her, contrary to her true character. For Hiſtory makes her a woman of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. But this is an artifice, and that the moſt delicate and ſubtle of any obſervable in <hi>Virgil,</hi> who to excite a certain contempt for a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was afterwards to be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34038:56"/>
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> conceiv'd himſelf oblig'd, not to celebrate any vertue in her, who ſhould be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of it, imagining he might, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſparagement to himſelf, ſacrifice her, the better to flatter his own Country, which no doubt, would have boggled at the reputation Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gave that Princeſs. And whereas this artifice was advanc'd only to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that the Poet himſelf look'd on them as Maſters of the world, with whoſe ſentiments all other Nations ought to comply, or at leaſt to conform thereto, yet he thought himſelf concern'd to uſe all precautions, to prepoſſeſs their minds, upon that diſguiſing of the truth. To that purpoſe he cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brings the Gods into the plot, to put a better gloſs upon the ſacrificing of her. <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> make it their buſineſs. Nay he makes them uſe all their art to ſmother the good repute which common fame gave that Queen. This is the ſubject of <hi>Juno's</hi> complaint to <hi>Venus,</hi> which ſerves only to make a

            <p>Yet muſt it be acknowledg'd that <hi>Homer</hi> has a better ſtor'd and more ſumptuous ſtock of invention, and greater varieties; a more delicate and and divertive caſt of verſification; a

            <p>This indeed <hi>Homer</hi> has much beyond <hi>Virgil,</hi> and the eare is much more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with the currency, the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the whole air of his verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue has all thoſe advantages over the <hi>Latine,</hi> which is more modeſt, more grave, and more ſerious. True it is alſo, that he has a greater extent of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and affords his Readers a larger proſpect; but his fancy ever and anon hurries him from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he is not ſo much maſter of it, as <hi>Virgil</hi> is of his.<note place="bottom">In Bruto.</note> Twas this defect
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34038:57"/>
that made him commit that ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial an overſight of adding the two books of the <hi>Iliad</hi> after the cloſe of the action; one, of the death of <hi>Hector</hi> the other, of the Games for that of <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus</hi>; and one other after that of the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> which is the mutual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, of one to the other, of <hi>Vlyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Penelope.</hi> For as every Poem, as well <hi>Epick</hi> as <hi>Dramatick,</hi> ought to take its period with the cloſe of the principal action, ſo after the ſaid cloſe, which ought to put an end to things, a man cannot make any addition thereto, without committing an extravagance.</p>
            <p>I find few paſſages in <hi>Homer,</hi> ſuch as may be oppos'd to thoſe of <hi>Virgil.</hi> Yet can I not forbear having a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for that of the ſixt book of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> where <hi>Andromache,</hi> who was ſo honeſt and vertuous a woman, bids adieu to her Husband <hi>Hector,</hi> then going to his laſt combat with <hi>Achilles.</hi> In a word, tis impoſſible to imagine any thing of greater tenderneſs than that a???dieu, wherein that Princeſs, by

Of this rank is the numbring of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Fleet in the ſecond of the <hi>Iliad</hi>: all there is at the ſame rate, and the ſquadrons are all for the moſt part terminated by one and the ſame Verſe:

            <p>Nay <hi>Vlyſſes's</hi> being known by his wife <hi>Penelope,</hi> in the 23. of the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> which was the moſt favourable paſſage in the world to ſet all the ſubtleties of art on work, has nothing but flat and ſimple ſurpriſes, cold and heavy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhments, and very litle delicacy of ſentiment and real tenderneſſe. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope</hi> is too long obſtinate, in oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſons they alledge to perſuade her, that he is her husband, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes nothing himſelf to his own diſcovery; He ſuffers his wife to hearken too long to her diſtruſt and circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the formalities ſhe obſerves to be aſſur'd of all things, are there ſet down by tale and meaſure, leaſt there might be any miſtake, which methinks has ſomewhat that is mournfull and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, in a place which requir'd ſo much fire and vivacity.

            <head>OBSERV. XIII. That there is in <hi>Homer</hi> a greater air of Morality and ſententiouſneſs, than in Virgil.</head>
            <p>WE muſt not alſo diſpute this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage with <hi>Homer</hi>; for this is ſo true, that <hi>Macrobius</hi> lib. 5. c. 6. of his Queſtions, ſaies that <hi>Homer</hi> has ſtuff'd his Poems with ſentences, and that his pleaſant ſayings were quoted

by the People as Proverbs. <hi>Homerus omnem Poeſim ſuam ita ſententiis farſit, ut ſingula ejus apophthegmata vicem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbiorumin civium ore fungantur.</hi> And an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author hath lately given us a conſiderable volume of ſentences collected out of <hi>Homer,</hi> upon all the matters of Morality, which he has reduc'd into common places.</p>
            <p>But I pretend with <hi>Heinſius.</hi> in his Poetical tract upon <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that thoſe ſententious reflections of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are rather deſign'd for the <hi>Theatre,</hi> and of the <hi>Dramatick</hi> kind, than of the <hi>Heroick,</hi> the eſſential character whereof is <hi>Narration,</hi> which ought to be of a continued thread, and ſimple, without affectation of figures, and without all that tackle of reflections, which deſpoil a diſcourſe of its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral colour and force: a fault where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that excellent Author of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyricon</hi> does ſo earneſtly reproach the declamators of his time, <hi>Inanibus ſonis ludibria quaedam excitando effeciſtis, ut corpus Orationis enervaretur, &amp; cade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.

            </p>
            <p>In a word, that force which ſome pretend ordinarlily to ſumme up in a ſmall compaſle of words to make up a ſentence, is wont to exhauſt, and extreamly weaken the reſt of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, by depriving it of its natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſimplicity, and giving it a forc'd aire. For this reaſon is <hi>Livy</hi> a much more accompliſh'd Hiſtorian than <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> in regard he has leſſe reflections, which are more proper for the <hi>Theatre,</hi> than for <hi>History,</hi> and <hi>Narration.</hi>

            <p>As to this we may ſafely imitate <hi>Livy</hi> who in the body of his Hiſtory puts in very litle of that kind, but reſerves it to be ſaid by thoſe whom he makes to ſpeak. So that the Poet is to let them ſlip by, without affecting to be the utterer of them, much leſs to ſcatter and ſtrew them up and down as <hi>Homer</hi> does: and it is a miſtake for any to think to eſteem him upon that account, inaſmuch as that affectation is certainly an imperfection, which <hi>Virgil</hi> found out a way to avoid; reflecting that there was not any thing more oppoſite to that ſimple and continu'd air, which he profeſſed to obſerve, than thoſe glittering words and fancies, which ſeem Independent from the diſcourſe, and jutting out of the ſtructure, in regard they are not well proportion'd thereto, and ſerve only to magnify

               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:34038:63"/>But we are to make a great abatement of the eſteem which all Antiquity hath had for <hi>Homer,</hi> if we credit what <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaies in his <note n="‖" place="bottom">lib. 13. c. 14.</note> Hiſtory. He pretends, that the opinion of the Learned of his time was, that <hi>Homer</hi> had not compos'd the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> but only by fragments, not propoſing to himſelf any continu'd deſign; and that he had not given any other title to thoſe diverſe parts, which he had compos'd in the heat of his fancy &amp; the impetuoſity of his Genius, without any order, ſave only that of the ſubject and matter whereof he treated, as <hi>The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and proweſs of Agamemnon. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes inſtituted for the funeral ſolemnity of Patroclus; The engagement neer the Ships, their Number</hi>; and ſo of the reſt; That he had done the like for the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> That <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was the firſt that brought from <hi>Jonia</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> thoſe ſeveral parts, diſtinct one from the other, and without any connection; And that <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> was the perſon who diſpos'd them into ſome order, and, of them, made up the two Poems of the <hi>Iliad</hi> and the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:34038:63"/>
which we now have: And from thence, as ſome pretend, is derived the name of <hi>Rarpſodies,</hi> which hath ſince been given to thoſe two Poems.</p>
            <p>But I find in my ſelf a backwardneſs to aſſent to this ſtory; for it were to deprive <hi>Homer</hi> of his greateſt glory, to take away from him the diſpoſition of his Poems: That were a weakneſs, which I cannot allow that great man to be chargeable withal, eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath authoriſed the belief eſtabliſh'd ſince in all ages, to wit, that he is the true Author of thoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, though <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his firſt book againſt <hi>Apion,</hi> ſeems to be of the ſame opinion with <hi>Aelian,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the life of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> in his third book <hi>de Oratore,</hi> give ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to believe it. But this opinion would ſo highly contribute to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute deſtruction of <hi>Homers</hi> merit, that it were better to give <hi>Aelian</hi> the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a collector of trivial ſtories. As for the other three, who countenance his ſentiment, as they do not ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34038:64"/>
ſtand upon the affirmative, ſo we may well adhere to the common opinion, and be favourable to the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Homer,</hi> which, as to this point, is too ſtrongly eſtabliſh'd, to admit of any conteſt.</p>

               <hi>That wrath,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>made a bloody ſlaughter of the bodies of the Heroes.</hi> Thus <hi>Didimus,</hi> one of <hi>Homers</hi> moſt exact Interpreters expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates him.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34038:65"/>
He might have ſaid things more in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, in a propoſition which ought to be ſimple; there was no neceſſity of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it over again, 'twas enough that he had call'd that paſſion <hi>pernicious</hi>; there is a certain affectation in the repetition of it ſo often; and he takes a pleaſure in amplifying what he ought to have conceal'd, or at leaſt alleviated.

'Twas the will of <hi>Jupiter it ſhould be ſo.</hi> He forgets that he is ſpeaking to his Muſe, which is a Divinity, that knows all things and ought not to have forgotten any thing of what it knowes: He takes occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to inform it, that it was the will of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that things ſhould happen ſo. It was the part of <hi>Homers</hi> Muſe to acquaint him with the ſecrets of the divine will, and what paſſes in the order of its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and not <hi>Homers</hi> to tell that to his Muſe, the Daughter of <hi>Mnemoſyne</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that is to ſay, of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and memory. It is yet much more ſtrange in him to add thoſe words to amplify the exceſs of the deſtruction, which that wrath had cauſed the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſince it had oblig'd the Gods to concern themſelves in the reſentment of that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that it was their pleaſure, it ſhould occaſion that deſtruction of all the people of good repute in that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

            </p>
            <p>It would be a hard matter to tell where this invocation ends: the two ſubſequent verſes are part of it, and it is confounded with the Narration, if we look narrowly upon it: beſides, to ſay the truth, what conſtruction ſoever be made of thoſe words, we ſhall find a certain affectation in them: he has a mind to fall a moralizing too ſoon, when he does it at the very entrance of a work, which is not moral, and that at the fourth verſe of it. The Readers mind is not yet prepar'd for reflections: it ought to have been inſtructed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd, and a little inflam'd before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>
            <p>The Exordium of the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> is this, I know not whether it appear any thing

               </gap>, to excuſe <hi>Homer.</hi> Put I do not ſee what allay can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd it; beſides that in the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the ſtory, the conduct of <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> bears no other quality in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular then that of craft, which is many times manag'd by impoſtures and lies, which is in no wiſe Heroick; and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> her ſelf, however ſhe may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to him, cannot forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him therewith.</p>
            <p>And if it be urged that that craft is a dexterity and readineſs of wit, why does he not make uſe of it for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of his Companions, but imploy all his ſubtlety to preſerve himſelf? <hi>But they all periſhed through their own fault.</hi> Ought not this Heroe, a perſon ſo wiſe, and of ſuch extraordinary prudence, to have had conduct enough to ſecure them from that misfortune?

Is there any thing in the world leſs Heroick, more weak and more deſpicable than this? <hi>Taſſo,</hi> in

            <p>I Leave it to the deciſion of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what judgement ought to be made of both theſe admirable Poets, when they ſhall have taken the pains to inform themſelves of the truth of theſe Obſervations, and have perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly reflected, that all the <hi>Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who are the true Criticks of State having not been able to endure the luſtre of <hi>Homers</hi> manner of expreſſion, and the magnificence of his way of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying, which doubtleſs, is more brisk and glittering than that of <hi>Virgil,</hi> have ſuffer'd themſelves to be dazled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and without penetrating to the ground of both their works, have for the moſt part attributed the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to <hi>Homer.</hi> But they all judge of of them as <hi>Grammarians,</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the obſervations I have made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:34038:68"/>Nay <hi>Plutarch</hi> himſelf, in a diſcourſe expreſsly writ by him upon <hi>Homer,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiates much upon his great Learning, and the univerſal knowledge he had of all the ſciences; and he ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the vaſt extent of that great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius by the Idea he gives of his chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, without inſiſting upon what is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the Poem. Accordingly, all the learned, who fix their reflections upon the expreſſion of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the exteriour part of his works, are not competent judges. To judge aright of them, they muſt take in the knowledg of what is eſſential, compute all the proportions thereof, conſider whether the beauties are well plac'd therein, whether the intertexture of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable part with the miraculous, be therein judiciouſly obſerv'd, whether the licences, which poeſy permits, be not over confident, or violent, whether all the decorums, as to manners and ſentiments be therein exactly proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether the expreſſions be ſmart &amp; paſſionate, whether every thing keeps its proper rank, and bears its true
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34038:69"/>
character, whether ſoundneſs of ſence and reaſon ſpread through the whole production, and whether things are all as they ought to be: for nothing can pleaſe, if it be not ſo, according to the great precept of <hi>Quintilian; Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil poteſt placere quod non decet.</hi> In a word, they are to judge of theſe great works, as they would do of a Palace or ſumptuous ſtructure, whoſe chief beauty conſiſts in the proportion there is between the deſign in general and its parts, and their mutual rapport: this is that which ſuch as are well skill'd conſider in them, without fixing their thoughts on the exteriour ornaments, which take up the ſurvey of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>To conclude there is among the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of the ancient Poets, the fragment of an Epigram of an uncertain Authors, which may contribute ſomewhat to the judgment, which ought tobe made of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil's</hi> Poems.
