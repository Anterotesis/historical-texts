            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

beginne at the words that ſignifie man and woman,

               </note> is <hi>Iſch,</hi> in the which word are three

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:3493:3"/>
ſignifieth <hi>learning, knowledge,</hi> and <hi>a conductor.</hi> The
ſecond, <hi>Iod,</hi> ſignifieth God, becauſe by the ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes
he is called <hi>Macom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

The third, <hi>Schin,</hi> doth ſignifie <hi>ſecond.</hi> Which
three letters vnited in the word <hi>Iſch,</hi> which is <hi>man,</hi>
doth ſet before our eyes a wholſome doctrine for the
inſtruction of all men that will follow the ſame; to wit,

                  </gap>
               </note> which is made by the
growing or augmenting of the letter <hi>He,</hi> to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd
word <hi>Iſch,</hi> that ſignifieth man. This letter <hi>He,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
reſpiration of life, which doth ſerue to be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall,
that the woman tooke life from God, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her out of man. This letter alſo ſignifieth her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
towards man; for this letter affixed to the
word <hi>Iſch,</hi> that ſignifieth man, doth denote <hi>motum ad
aliquid,</hi> a motion from one thing to another, as from
God to man, the woman being created by God to
adhere to man. This bleſſed coniunction of man and
woman in the holie bond of marriage doth make a
houſe.</p>
            <p>The Hebrew word <hi>Beth</hi> that ſignifieth houſe doth
conſiſt of three letters.<note place="margin">The mysticall ſignification of the word houſe. <gap reason="foreign">

forme of the materiall and earthly houſe, in the which
man and woman doe dwell: the ſecond <hi>Iod,</hi> ſignifieth
God (as ſaid is) the third <hi>Tau</hi> ſignifieth a mark or ſigne.
For in the 9. of the propheſie of Ezechiel it is called the
marke of ſaluation and preſeruation of the people from
death and deſtruction:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zechiel. cap. 9.</note> as the blood of the paſchall
Lambe was ſprinkled on the houſe poſts of the Iſraelits
to be a ſigne that when God ſent his deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
to kill all the firſt borne of the reſt of the people,
their firſt borne ſhould be ſaued, and preſerued; which
marke was a figure of Chriſt his blood that ſaueth all
true beleeuers, from the deſtroying Angell and death
eternall. Of this myſticall ſignification of theſe three
letters vnited in one word, we are taught that God his
true knowledge and worſhip ſignified by the letter <hi>Iod,</hi>
being in the middle of the houſe ioyned with the mark
of the letter <hi>Tau,</hi> which is a ſigne of ſaluation contrary
and againſt the deſtroying Angell, that that houſe is
preſerued &amp; kept ſafe againſt ſinne, and Satans machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
This much for the myſticall interpretation of
the Hebrew letters in the word <hi>Beth</hi> that ſignifieth
houſe. Note alſo that this word <hi>Houſe</hi> is here figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely
taken for man and woman, dwelling within one
<hi>a houſe.</hi> Which is <hi>continens pro contento,</hi> that is, when
the container is taken for the thing contained.</p>

               </note> ſhewing vs by what meanes
all cities are to be conſerued from this diuiſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Chriſt ſpeaketh in this Text. The firſt Hebrew let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3493:4"/>
is <hi>Gnain</hi> which ſignifieth the eye: the ſecond is <hi>Iod,</hi>
which as we heard before ſignifieth God: the third is
<hi>Reſch,</hi> which ſignifieth the head: whereby we collect
the ſignification of the whole word to be this. That
God being in the eyes and heads of the Citizens, ſhall
be the onely meanes to preſerue and defend that Citie
from diuiſion, which doth bring foorth, as our Text
ſaith, a miſerable deſolation.</p>
            <p>The third Hebrew word whereby is ſignified the
moſt high and generall degree or eſtate of the ſocietie
of mankind,<note place="margin">The myſticall ſignification of the Hebrew word Melech a King.</note> is the word <hi>Kingdome,</hi> which doth come

becauſe that there are ſuperior and inferior waters,
which in their myſticall ſignification doe denote and
ſignifie ſpirituall and temporall Life. As Chriſt in the
Goſpell of Iohn calleth himſelfe and his doctrine the
water of life:<note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 10.</note> the ſecond is <hi>Lamed,</hi> which ſignifieth
knowledge and doctrine: the third is <hi>Caph</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
the hand, and is figuratiuely taken for ſtrength
and force of armes, and for the hand of Iuſtice: the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or coniunction of theſe three letters in the Hebrew
word <hi>Melech,</hi> which by interpretation is called <hi>King,</hi>
doth teach vs what is required in this moſt excellent
office of a King, to wit, that he be a fountaine or water

            <p>In this little kingdome of the outward man,<note place="margin">The Image of a kingdome in the outward man.</note> the head
is the King, and ſoueraigne gouernour of the whole
body, becauſe by the head, there doth come nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and foode to the body: And as in a kingdome
there be many, members, that is, ſubiects, vnder one
King: euen ſo in this kingdome of the <hi>outward man</hi>
there be many members, as the armes, hands, legges,

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3493:6"/>
to the head their King. By whoſe adminiſtration the
head diſtributeth equallie to all his members food and
nouriſhment. Let vs apply this ſimilitude of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in the outward man to our ſelues: ſeing the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this Iland is alreadie Vnited vnder one head, and
ſeeing the armes, hands, legges, and feete are tyed to
the obedience of this their head. And that the head and
the members are <hi>ipſo iure, &amp; ipſo facto,</hi> by law and by
the deede it ſelfe Vnited. Let no man be ſo vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſeparate them, for in ſo doing they do but throwe
ſtones againſt the heauen. For how can the armes,
hands, legges, and feete ſerue the head in the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the whole body, if they were onely vnited in the
head and diuided amongſt themſelues? If the hands and
armes were diuided one from another, and ſeparated
from the whole body, it were then impoſſible &amp; againſt
nature that this body could be nouriſhed, by the worke
and induſtrie of the hands: and againe, if the feet were
diuided from the head, and the reſt of the body, and the
one from the other, the head muſt needes fall to the
ground. Therefore let not the hands deny the ſeruice
due to their head, which conſiſteth in preparing and
adminiſtrating foode to vphold and nouriſh the head,
and the whole body. The force of both the armes, and
hands doth come from the head to the body, and from
the head to the armes. Let not the feete, and legges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
their ſeruice in carying of their body, becauſe from
thence commeth their nouriſhment and foode. But let
vs apply this doctrine more particularly to our ſelues.
The head of this Iland, the <hi>Kings Maiestie,</hi> hath vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his Royall perſon the armes, hands and legs of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3493:7"/>
this body, which is this kingdome of Great Brittannie,
to wit, the South and the North in one obedience, and
ſeruice, whoſe ſtrength and nouriſhment doth flow
from this head as from a fountaine: So hauing this
conſideration before you, iudge and ponder with your
ſelues what a miſerable and dangerous eſtate it were,
that one of the armes, hands, or feete ſhould draw to it
ſelfe, the whole foode which commeth from the head,
and not to ſuffer his fellow to be participant thereof.
Therefore let not the armes of the South, I meane the
Officers, and great Gouernors in the South, attribute to
themſelues onely, the whole ſuſtenance and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that doth come from the head, that is to ſay, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
offices, and dignities as well Eccleſiaſticall as
Temporall, excluding from thence the fellow arme of
the North, which is the other arme of this body: and
on the other part let not the arme of the North, which
is the other arme of this body, withdraw from his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the offices, preferments, and dignities that proceed
from the head, which equally ſhould pertaine to them
both. But according to the diſpoſition of nature in this

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or little kingdome. Let both the armes be

            <p>We come now to the Image of a kingdome,<note place="margin">The Image of a kingdome in the inward man.</note> which

That is the maker of man, did place the ſubiects of
this King of the <hi>inward man,</hi> in theſe parts of the body
which are vnder the head and necke, as in a fit ſtation,

<hi>Ira,</hi> anger, hath his ſeate in the hart which is full

which great worke is now in hand, for euen as <hi>Mens</hi>

that not being ruled, and ouerruled by their King, they
fall into a lamentable diuiſion, whereupon will follow
according to Chriſts words in this text, a moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deſolation (from the which I pray the Lord deliuer
vs) So that I conclude if we be vnited vnder one head

the members of one body ſhall agree in a harmonie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

his fellowes benefits, in ſo much that the heate of the
hart, wherein wrath and anger dwelleth muſt partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of the moiſt and cold of the lights, that is, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of wrath and anger muſt be ruled, and brideled by
the feare of god, and of the king his Lieutenant heere
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3493:8"/>
on earth, which otherwiſe getting looſe bridle raines,
would cut the whole kingdome by diuiſion in pieces:
Alſo the reſpiration and breathing of the lights muſt
temperate, and moderate the ardent heat of deſire
and couetouſneſſe that is in the liuer. So that ye may
ſee the three inward parts of man, which are ſubiect to
their <hi>king reaſon,</hi> muſt communicate one with another
all their offices and commodities, otherwiſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of the kingdome of the <hi>inward man</hi> could not
keepe themſelues in the obedience of <hi>Reaſon</hi> their
<hi>king.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this we learne, that by the figure and type of this
kingdome of the <hi>inward man</hi> the whole people and
ſubiects of this Iland ſhould conſider, that if they will
follow the law of their <hi>king reaſon</hi> (which they muſt
needes doe, or els they cannot remaine vnited with
their ſoueraigne king, whoſe kingdome is ruled by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
it behoueth them all to make euery one partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
of an others helpe, and aide, in communicating
mutually one to his neighbour, and fellow the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and preferments on both the ſides. For when
the heat of the hart is withdrawen from the cold moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the lungs and humiditie of the liuer: or when
the lights, and the liuer doe withdraw their refreſhing
from the heart, then the kingdome of the <hi>inward man</hi>
is brought to confuſion, and deſolation, by the diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſubiects in withdrawing the commodities
one from another which ſhould be common to both.
Ye ſee now what I meane; that if the people of the

the <hi>North;</hi> and on the other part, if theſe of the North
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3493:9"/>
withdraw the refreſhing of the heat of the <hi>South:</hi>
There is no doubt, I ſay, but if ſuch diuiſion were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by <hi>Reaſon</hi> our king, it would bring forth ere it
were long ſuch a diſtemperature amongſt his ſubiects,
that in the end in place of vnion, there ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

and endleſſe deſolation vpon him and all the reſt of the
Angels of iniquitie, according as it is here ſaid in our
Text: <hi>Euery kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> Although Satan will admit
no diuiſion, in his owne kingdome, as we are taught in
this Chapter; yet he is the very fountaine, &amp; welſpring
of all diuiſions, both in the kingdome of God and man,
from the beginning of the world to the end thereof.</p>

For the better vnderſtanding of this word <hi>Diuiſion</hi>
which is in my Text,<note place="margin">Three kinds of Diuiſion.</note> you muſt know there be three
kinds of <hi>Diuiſion, viz.</hi> a <hi>diuiſion</hi> betwixt God and
man: a <hi>diuiſion</hi> betwixt man and man, and a <hi>diuiſion</hi>
betwixt countrey and countrey. The <hi>diuiſion</hi> betwixt
God and man doth come by Idolatrie, and ſinne: the
<hi>diuiſion</hi> betwixt man and man, is partly by diuerſitie
in Religion, and partly by ambition, in hunting after
dignities, honours, and preferments, of which alſo doth
come the <hi>diuiſion</hi> of countries and lands.</p>
            <p>As we haue ſhewed you how many kindes of <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
there be,<note place="margin">Sundry ſorts of Deſolation.</note> now it followeth to ſhew how many
kindes there be of <hi>Deſolation.</hi> There is a <hi>deſolation</hi> of
mens goods, which doth fall out by robbing, ſtealing,
forraing, ſpoyling, burning ſhip wrake, and all other
meanes that may be to the preiudice of mens goods.
There is a ſecond <hi>deſolation</hi> of mans body, which doth
fall out, by plagues, peſtilence, or by the ſword in ciuill
or forraine warres: There is a third <hi>deſolation</hi> of mans
ſoule, which doth fall out by Idolatrie, apoſtaſie and
blaſphemie; of the which all other ſinnes doe proceede.</p>
            <p>Hauing ſhewed you what <hi>Diuiſion</hi> and <hi>deſolation</hi> is,
and their kinds, I purpoſe (by God his grace) for the
better expoſition of my Text, to ſet ſummarily before
your eyes, as in a painted table, the moſt notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Diviſion of Kingdoms, Cities, and houſes
in all ages: together with their deſolation which doe
follow on the other, as the effect the cauſe: Moreouer
we ſhall ſee, that diuiſion is a puniſhment and a curſe
of God laid on mankind: as by the contrarie Vnion
is a great bleſſing of God amongſt all eſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3493:10"/>
of men, which we ſhall doe to this end, that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and calamities that doe flow from diuiſion of
kingdomes, countries, and houſes, that all theſe things
may ſerue, for your inſtructions who haue now in hand
the conſideration of the bleſſed Vnion of this Iland of
Great Britannie into one kingdome, which is alreadie
vnited in our head our dread Soueraigne the King his
Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>The firſt diuiſion that euer we read of after the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world,<note place="margin">The first Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion inuented by Sathan.</note> was inuented by Satan that old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
by the which there came a miſerable deſolation
vpon all mankind. For ſoone after the creation of Man
and woman, who was created in an angelicall nature,
Vnited with God, and hauing the viſible communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods preſence, was placed in a habitation of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
ioy and felicitie: But Satan vpon hatred and
enuie did ſeduce and deceiue the womans mind by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and falſe perſwaſions, and by the woman the man,
with a conceite of vaine glory, that they thought to be
like God in knowledge: ſo being thus waies ſeduced by
Satan, they brake and violated Gods commandement;
of the which came the firſt diuiſion betwixt God and
man, and after the diuiſion followed a miſerable and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
deſolation vpon the whole race of mankind
which dayly in our owne perſons by dolefull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
we find to be true. For being created immortall
they became ſubiect both to the death of the ſoule, and
the death of the body, and were caſt out of that place
of vnſpeakable ioy and felicitie, which in the originall
language is called <hi>Gan-heden</hi> a <hi>Garden of pleaſure</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3493:11"/>
to a moſt barren and infertile ſoile, wherein he ſhould
labour hardly and purchaſe his bread by the ſwet of his
face, till he returne againe to the earth. Vpon the other
part, God who is the fountaine of charitie, loue, and
Vnion, yea charitie it ſelfe, did begin his kingdome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
amongſt men, whereby at the time preordinate in
his incomprehenſible prouidence, he ſhould ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the kingdome of Satan. God, I ſay, did begin this
his kingdome in the very fall of man, in that bleſſed
promiſe, which he made to Man, when he ſaid, that the
ſeede of the woman ſhould bruſe and deſtroy the head
of the Serpent.<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt example of the beginning of the kingdome
of Satan in this earth by diuiſion,<note place="margin">Deſolation came by Diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Adams houſe, and in his poſteritie.</note> is in his practizing
of the diuiſion of the houſe of Adam. Who hauing
two ſonnes, Satan eſtabliſhed his kingdome amongſt
men in the perſon of <hi>Cain.</hi> For <hi>Cains</hi> hart being puffed
vp with arrogancie and pride, by reaſon of his birth-right
(whereby he pretended preeminence aboue his
brother <hi>Abell,</hi> both in the fauour of God, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of religion) he offred vp a Sacrifice to God, which
was reiected, becauſe he offered the ſame with an euill
mind. But <hi>Abell</hi> the ſecond brother, hauing his hart
filled with loue, and humilitie, did offer a Sacrifice to
God which was willingly accepted, becauſe he did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it with faith, as Saint Paul doth teach vs in the 11.
Cap. to the Hebrewes. Of this Satan taketh occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to ingender in the hart of the elder brother an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
inanimitie, and hatred againſt the yonger, ſo
that by theſe meanes, Satan ſeduced <hi>Cain</hi> to murder his
brother traiterouſly (as he himſelfe was a murtherer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3493:11"/>
from the beginning.) This murther made a diuiſion in
the houſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was the cauſe of a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and pitifull deſolation that came to paſſe by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of time, in the drowning of the whole world by
the deluge.</p>
            <p>But God on the other part, hauing a care of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of the bleſſed ſeede, did renue his kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men, in the perſon of <hi>Seth, Enos, Enoch,</hi> and
ſundry others, who were the true and faithfull worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of God, that bleſſed ſeede that was promiſed, in
whom the ruine of man with God, did conſiſt. Yet
notwithſtanding Satan continuing in his practiſes of
diuiſion againſt mankind, being deſirous to bring them
all to lamentable deſolation and confuſion, did ſeduce
the progenie of godly <hi>Seth,</hi> and <hi>Enos,</hi> whom the Text
calleth the ſonnes of God, by the bewitching beautie
of the daughters of men, to wit, the daughters of the
Cainites, who were an Idolatrous &amp; wicked people: of
this vngodly mixtion, the generations of wicked Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
and blood thirſtie men, did ſo multiply, that we
reade in Geneſis the whole race of mankinde was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 6. 11.</note>
by falling away from God; which diuiſion
brought in by Satan betwixt God and man, was the
cauſe of miſerable deſolation. For God for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch wickedneſſe did deſtroy the whole world
except <hi>Noe,</hi> his wife, their three Sonnes, and their
wiues, being eight perſons onely that did find fauour in
the ſight of God. We ſee by this example, that it is
moſt true which is here ſpoken by Chriſt, that <hi>Euery
kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> For here we ſee how Satan in this firſt
age, did practiſe a generall deſolation in the whole race
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3493:12"/>
of mankind, by the diuiſion which he brought into the
houſe of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of this doctrine there may be collected a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
inſtruction, and warning to all the ſubiects of this
Iland of Great Britannie. But more ſpecially this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
doth appertain, for the inſtruction of theſe, whom
God and his Lieutenant hath aſſembled at this time, to
treate of the performance of this godly worke, of the
Vnion of this Iland in one kingdome. For euen as the
firſt age which was before the deluge, did deſcend of
one Father, and was diuided by diſcord amongſt bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren,
and afterward by this diuiſion brought to ſmall
deſolation and deſtruction: So the firſt Inhabitants of
this little world, of great Britannie, (who are called by
<hi>Virgill, diuiſi toto orbe Britanni,)</hi> were in the beginning
borne of one Father, but amongſt themſelues by bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren
diuided, who could not liue together in loue
and amitie: of this diuiſion, which hath beene for
many yeers, many deſolations did fall out, in the whole
Iſland by ſundry cruell, &amp; bloody wars: yet in our daies
God hath ſhewed his mercy wonderfully towards vs
in vniting vs al vnder one head. Wherby we are taught
alſo, that as the diuerſitie of heads, and Kings in this
Iſland made the diuerſitie of kingdomes: Euen ſo the
ſingularitie of one King, and one head, maketh the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie
of one kingdome: ſo that this whole Iſland is
vnited <hi>ipſo iure, &amp; ipſo facto</hi> in that ſame vnited eſtate,
in the which it was before the firſt diuiſion thereof, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
diuers kingdomes. Therefore let euery man thinke,
that it is, both agreeable with law, and reaſon, that
we be no more two kingdomes, but one, ſeeing we all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3493:12"/>
confeſſe to haue onely one head, and one King.</p>

and Iaphet did diuide the whole habitable world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
their poſteritie. After the confuſion of langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which did fall out a hundred yeares after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.
The auncient Greeke authors, whom Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us

hold, that the whole Orient, which commonly is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

to his poſteritie: the whole South called Africa to

we haue the teſtimonie of this alſo in thoſe
auncient Greeke hiſtories, and poeſies, which Horace
did follow, in the which he calleth the poſteritie of
Iaphet, Audax Iapeti genus.</p>
            <p>In this generall diuiſion of the whole world we may
obſerue, that the gouernours and captaines of theſe
people, which firſt did inhabite any land, gaue the firſt
names to that land or kingdome that they did inhabite.
Of the which names there remaine as yet to our daies
ſome ſignes, markes, and remembrances of their firſt
impoſition; as for example, the countrey of Thracia,
gat the name from Thyras one of Iaphets ſonnes; the
country of the Grecians, was called Ionia from Iauan,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3493:13"/>
one of Iaphets children, who by the Grecians was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Ion, et inde Iones: The countrey of Moſchouia,
whoſe people to our age are called Muſchouits, did
take the name from Meſchet, another of Iaphets ſons.
In the 10. cap. of Geneſ. after that Moſes hath named
Iaphets poſteritie, he ſaith, that the Iſles of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
were deuided likewiſe by Iaphets ſonnes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their families, and languages, and although the
names of the gouernours, and people, who firſt did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite
the ilands of the Gentiles, are not expreſſed in
the Bible: yet we find them expreſſed by that moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Doctor Epiphanius in his <hi>Anchorato,</hi> who
after he had named and ſpoken of Iaphets poſteritie

<hi>Britanni, Scoti, Hiſpani:</hi> Inſulae verò ipſorum,
<hi>Brittannia, Sicilia, Rhodus, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that we ſee heere

before receaued in Ieruſalem, in Aſia, in Rome, France,
&amp; Spaine: but it was not ſo publikely embraced, in any
place, by Kings and ſuperior Magiſtrates: as it was
then receaued by <hi>Lucius,</hi> King of Britannie, and by all

            <p>Alſo this propheſie that is contained myſticallie in

of Chriſts Apoſtles, and their Diſciples: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the time of Conſtantinus Magnus by the vnion
of the kingdome of the whole world with Chriſts
kingdome: Thirdly, this propheſie is accompliſhed in
our daies (as we ſhall heare more amply hereafter) in
vs and our poſteritie. For before our daies the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God hath beene broken, and violated in this
Iland, by the operation of Satan, who transforming
himſelfe into an Angell of light, in taking vpon him
the pretext of Chriſts true religion, did change the
worſhip of Chriſt, into the worſhip of Chriſts images,
made by the handes of man, of gold and ſiluer, which
he made to be worſhipped, as Chriſt himſelfe. As
<hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and the reſt of that ſort, do teach.
<hi>Quòd Chriſtus, &amp; imago Chriſti eadem adoratione ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari

worſhipped with one and the ſelfe ſame adoration.</p>
            <p>Moreouer that old enemie of mankind, Satan, did
make our predeceſſors to breake Gods couenant by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing

the ſubſtance of the humane nature of Chriſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Chriſt, God, and man, reallie to be contained
vnder the outward forme thereof, which they called
by the name of God, Creator, and adored him as the
true God, both contrary to the Scriptures, and the
auncient doctrine of the Trinitie, by the which no

the worſhipping of a ſtrange, and new God, who was
not incarnate or borne of the bleſſed Virgin Marie,
not vnited with the deitie in the Virgins wombe.</p>
            <p>Of all theſe we note,<note place="margin">The reſtitution of the auncient name of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie, is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the Vnion of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> that God hauing reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine

God, excluding from this true worſhip all falſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
of viſible, and created things, and reſtoring
againe in this Iland the true couenant of God; of this
we note, that ſeeing the couenant of God is reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in this Iland, the name alſo of great Britannie,
which doth ſignifie the couenant of God, both by the
law of God, and the law of man, ſhould be reſtored in
the ſame, as it was before. Therefore I take the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this auncient name of great Britannie, by the
Kings moſt excellent Maieſtie to haue come, by the
very motion, and inſtigation of Gods holy ſpirit, to
this end; that it may be a perpetuall memoriall, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie,
that God hath reſtored his true couenant of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3493:16"/>
eternall life, which he hath promiſed to all thoſe that do
worſhip him faithfully and truely. Let euerie one of vs
bleſſe, and praiſe God, for the reſtoring of the ſame.
Let all the ſubiects of this Iland thinke, that it is a great
glory to them to be called Britannes, that is to ſay, the
people of Gods couenant, which after the name of
Chriſtian is the moſt glorious and honorable name,
that any man in the world may enioy.</p>
            <p>I thinke I ſhould not diſcharge my duety, if in this
place, I did forget to ſhew you the King his Maieſties
great and laudable modeſtie, which he hath obſerued
in reſtoring of this auncient name, in ſo much that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſide all priuiledges, and prerogatiues due to other
Kings, in ſuch like caſes. For when the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the Orient were vnited to the Aſſyrians, they
tooke their names from their ſoueraigne King: And
when the Monarchie was tranſlated to the Perſians,
that ſecond Monarchie receaued the name of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians:
and likewiſe in the third, and fourth Monarchie,
the people embraced the name and title of thoſe that
were their Kings and Princes. So that by the Kings
M. prerogatiue and priuiledge, ſeeing that the South
part is fallen to his royall perſon, both by the lawe of
God, and nature; the name of the former kingdome
might haue beene impoſed to this kingdome, which is
laſt fallen in his power: We ſee alſo that the name of
<hi>Scoti</hi> is inſert, by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the Catologue of thoſe
countries, that were diſtributed to the poſteritie of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:</hi>
whereof we may note the antiquitie thereof. So
that all men may ſee, that looke with an indifferent
eye, the great modeſtie, the good conſideration, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3493:17"/>
louing kindnes that hath accompanied his Maieſtie in
this great worke, inſomuch that he hath not vſed his
owne prerogatiue in bringing in a new name in this
kingdome of the South: But he hath onely reſtored
the ancient name of great Britannie, both to the South
and the North. To the end that he might extirpat the
very ſeede of diuiſion, which hath beene theſe many
yeeres deeply rooted amongſt vs: But now (God be
praiſed) by the embracing of this godly Vnion, both in
the head, in the members, and in name, all matters of
diuiſion, and contention, are to be buried in the graue
of obliuion. For by this name of Britannie, which is
as much as Gods couenant we are vnited both in the
corporall, and ſpirituall kingdom.</p>
            <p>But let vs returne backe to the diuiſion of Countries.<note place="margin">The first diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of countries, and languages.</note>
And firſt let vs make our profit of the diuiſion of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and lands amongſt <hi>Noahs</hi> poſteritie. The cauſe of
this diuiſion was, for that the ſpace of a hundred yeers,
or thereabout after <hi>Noah,</hi> the whole race of mankinde,
did dwell together, as in one countrey without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion.
But Satan who watcheth day and night to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
his kingdome by diuiſion of countries amongſt
men, did ingender a deſire of vaine glory in their harts,
that they were about to build a tower which ſhould
reach to heauen; all this was attempted by them, <hi>vt
acquirerent ſibi nomen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 11. 4.</note> That thereby they might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
themſelues a name. But God did puniſh this their
vaine glory, by the diuiſion and confuſion of their
tongues, being all before <hi>vnius labij</hi> of one lippe, and
of one language. This diuiſion of tongues, was the
cauſe that the heads and gouernors of families, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3493:17"/>
were of one language, did ſeparate and diuide the
whole earth amongſt them, as we ſaid before; where
by the way we haue to obſerue that diuiſion of langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
was ſent vpon mankind as one of Gods curſes; for
there is nothing more forceable to maintaine Vnion
and peace amongſt men, then conformitie in language:
as on the other part we ſee diuerſitie of tongues doth
ingender hatred and enuy amongſt the nations of the
whole world.</p>
            <p>This being conſidered,<note place="margin">Diuiſion of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages a curſe of God.</note> it followeth that diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of lands, in ſundry countries, is a rod and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, which being conioyned with the diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of tongues hath begotten ſundry fearefull and cruell
warres betwixt countrey and countrey, nation and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore ſeeing diuiſion of languages is a curſe
of God, it followeth neceſſarily that the Vnion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Kingdomes, in one language, and one Kingdome,
is a ſpeciall bleſſing of God. Wherefore briefly we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to bring in for all your inſtructions ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
out of the foure Monarchies, where we ſhall ſee,
as in a glaſſe, how theſe two doe follow, the one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the other.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Monarchie of the Aſſyrians,<note place="margin">Examples ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vnion to be a bleſſing of God.</note> the Aſſyrian
language was then a common language vſed in the
whole Monarchie, and from thence came to the Iewes
by the captiuitie of Babylon, and to this day all the
Chriſtians of Aſia doe vſe it in their diuine ſeruice:
And it is euidently knowen that the Monarchie of the
Greekes did ſpread the Greeke tongue throughout
all Aſia, and Egypt, yea and it did remaine in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Romane Monarchie, when all men ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3493:18"/>
to the vnderſtanding of the Greeke language, and
the Romanes hauing obtained the vniuerſall Empire,
did eſtabliſh therein their owne language: Euen ſo,
when Chriſt came into the world, to eſtabliſh his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by the preaching of the Goſpell, he ſent downe
vpon his Diſciples, the knowledge of all tongues,
which was a ſpirituall Vnion of them. And therefore
God conuerted the curſe, that came by the diuerſitie of
language, into a great bleſſing, by giuing his Apoſtles
the gift of the vnderſtanding of all tongues: So God
did begin the Vnion of this Iland, by the Vnion of one
language in both theſe nations, which came to paſſe by
a conqueſt. Yet God would not performe this Vnion
of theſe two kingdomes by conqueſt, which is a kind
of violent Vnion; but in the time appointed by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
wiſdome hath vnited vs not by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
but a free and voluntary Vnion. So that long
after the Vnion of the language of the South and
the North, he did vnite vs in the couenant of God,
which is ſignified by our generall name <hi>Brit-an-iah:</hi>
and afterward vnited vs vnder one ſoueraigne head
and King. The which Vnion of one language, one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and one King, maketh the Vnion of the two
countries, <hi>ipſo iure naturali.</hi> For as we haue prooued,
that the firſt diuiſion of lands, did come from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie
of languages, as alſo the diuerſitie of chuſing
Kings to gouerne ſundry people according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie
of their languages: Euen ſo, by the generall
rule, <hi>deficiente cauſa, deficit effectus;</hi> the cauſe of the
diuiſion of kingdomes being taken away, the effect
and diuiſion of them ſhould be taken away, <hi>ipſo iure,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3493:18"/>
&amp; ipſo facto.</hi> For ſo they returne to be one nation, one
people, and one land, as they were before the diuiſion.</p>
            <p>By this it is moſt euidently ſhewed to vs, that our
great Britaine being in our daies vnited in one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
in one religion, and vnder one head, one King
and ſupreame gouernour, we cannot by any law, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more two nations, or two kingdomes, but only one.</p>
            <p>The ſecond example of the Vnion of ſundry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,<note place="margin">Vnion of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes a bleſſing of God.</note>
Kingdomes, and Lands, being before diuided, is
manifeſt in the poſteritie of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For the Land
that was promiſed by God to the Iſraelites, which
ſince was called <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> was diuided into diuers Kings,
and Kingdomes (as the hiſtorie of the Bible doth teach
vs:) all theſe diuided Kings and kingdomes were vnited
by God in one kingdome of the Iſraelites in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the time of which Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was the moſt happy eſtate of any kingdome we
read of before that age: So that we may gather, ſeeing
the cauſe of this Vnion of many kingdomes was the
vnitie, and ſingularitie of the head; euen ſo the like Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſingularitie of the head in our great Britaine,
doth vnite <hi>ipſo iure, &amp; ipſo facto,</hi> the kingdomes that
were ſeuerall and ſeparated before.</p>
            <p>Therefore let no man imagine that we are two
kingdomes, or two nations, but <hi>vnus grex, vnum ouile,

In this bleſſed Vnion of many kingdomes in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and of his ſonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> was eſtabliſhed
the kingdome of God in earth, which was ioyned with

For the temple of Ieruſalem was builded for the

in his accuſtomed malicious practiſes, did caſt
in the ſeede of diuiſion: firſt by diuiſion of Religion,
and of the ſpirituall kingdome, and then by the diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of earthly, and temporall kingdomes; by the which
diuiſions in the ſpace of 300. yeeres, or thereabout, the
whole kingdome of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was brought to a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
deſolation, according to the doctrine of
Chriſt Ieſus in our Text.<note place="margin">An example that diuiſion of kingdomes, is a curſe of God, and that for Idolatrie.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Satan to eſtabliſh his kingdome in the middle of the
people of God, did deceaue the wiſe <hi>Salomon,</hi> by the
filthie loue, and deſire of forraine women: afterward
he ſeduced him to erect Idols, and falſe Gods in the
high places of that holy Land, retaining neuertheleſſe
the temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp; the true Sacrifice, worſhip,
and adoration of God: by the which maintenance of
true Religion on the one part, and falſe Religion on the
other, there did proceede a diuiſion ſo odious vnto
God, that for this cauſe, he did poure foorth his curſes
and maledictions vpon the poſteritie of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and
rent away the ten Tribes, and parts of the kingdome of
the holy land from <hi>Roboam</hi> his ſonne, which he gaue
to <hi>Ieroboam</hi> his ſeruant: leauing onely to <hi>Roboam</hi> the
two Tribes which did remaine. By this we learne, how
diſpleaſant this diuiſion of Religion made by <hi>Salomon</hi>
was to God, and what a miſerable deſolation it did
bring, by ſucceſſion of time vpon his poſteritie.</p>

do pertaine to men of high places in the <hi>Countreies and

the age following, by the diuiſion of <hi>languages, lands,
Countreies, and kingdomes,</hi> as yee haue heard before.
And for this effect <hi>Satan</hi> did ſeduce <hi>Ieroboams</hi> heart,
that he might ſhew himſelfe ingrate to God, who had
beene ſo beneficiall vnto him, in making him <hi>King</hi> of
the greateſt part of his <hi>Maiſters kingdome;</hi> and to moue
him to ſuch a falling away from God, did caſt in his
heart this worldly conſideration, to witte, that if he

Tribes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> which did appertaine
to <hi>Roboam,</hi> and ſo to continue in the exerciſe of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3493:20"/>
to reunite them, as they were before in one Kingdome.</p>
            <p>This wicked minde of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did diſtract him
from God,<note place="margin">The example of Ieroboam.</note> and tooke away that true confidence which
he ſhould haue had in him, which was this. That as
God did foretell by his Prophets that he was to giue
him theſe ten Tribes, euen ſo he was to conſerue them,
to him and his poſteritie vpon this condition, that he
would remaine conſtant in God his true worſhip, and
Religion: out of this all <hi>Monarches</hi> &amp; <hi>Kings</hi> haue their
leſſon, who haue receaued from God this their high
preferment, that they ſhould take heede, leaſt ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly

            <p>Satan in drawing men from the true Religion in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding,<note place="margin">Worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities cauſe of Diuiſion in Religion.</note>
and ſeparating them from the kingdome of
God vnto the kingdome of darkneſſe, doth proceede
and worke by degrees. For firſt he drew away <hi>Ieroboam</hi>
the King from God, by his deceitfull counſell; next he
ſeduced the people of the ten Tribes by worldly and
earthly commodities, to ioyne with their King in this
apoſtaſie and falling away from God: perſwading them
that it was a great vexation of body, and chargeable
expences, and conſumption of their goods, to goe ſo
farre as vp to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to offer their ſacrifices, and ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3493:21"/>
to auoide ſuch a tedious trauell to their perſons, and
ſuch a great waſt and ſpending of their goods, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
them, that it was better to build Temples and
Altars, and inſtitute ſacrifices at home in their owne
countries neere their owne Cities and houſes. In this
reſpect and regard of worldly commodities, there came
a lamentable diuiſion in Religion amongſt the Elect
people of God, which made the greateſt part of them,
to be <hi>Idolaters,</hi> by worſhipping of two golden calues,
which were erected by their new <hi>King,</hi> the one being
ſet vp in <hi>Bethel,</hi> &amp; the other in <hi>Dan;</hi> in the which places
they did build temples, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> doth write; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence
we learne, that the diuiſion of the earthly kingdome
was the meane by the which <hi>Satan</hi> did practiſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
of the kingdome of God, by ſeparating the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

hath vnited vs vnder one head and King, taking away

that the pretext of worldly commodities doe not

of all men, that are ſubiect to diuiſion, in the diuiſion
of the <hi>Monarchies</hi> in ſundry kingdomes, as it did fall
out, whereby the true worſhip of God and Religion
was troubled and oppreſſed, and the falſe worſhip of

of <hi>kingdomes</hi> before vnited.</p>
            <p>After that the <hi>kingdome</hi> of <hi>Iudah</hi> was ouerthrowen
by <hi>Nabuchadnetzar</hi> King of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> of

was a figure and a type of the eternall kingdome of
God, that he was to eſtabliſh by his eternall ſonne, ouer
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3493:22"/>
all the nations, and people of the world. Of which
kingdome <hi>Daniel</hi> did ſpeake in the interpretation of
the Viſion of that <hi>great Image,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> which did appeare to

according to the order of their eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>We reade in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 31.</note> how <hi>Nabuchadnetzar</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

               <note place="margin">The Vnion of Kingdomes in the 2. Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, was a meane to call the Gentils.</note>
by the miracles which were wrought by <hi>Daniel;</hi>

For it was tranſlated from him to the Medes and

and <hi>Syrus</hi> were conuerted to the true Religion,
and adoration of the only increated God, how they did
reſtore the people of God to their owne countrey, and
how they gaue great wealth and riches to build the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Temple, which was a figure of the eſtabliſhing
of Chriſt his kingdom.</p>
            <p>In like manner when God did tranſlate the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie

we doe learne by the hiſtorie of <hi>Flauius Ioſephus,</hi> that
<hi>Alexander</hi> himſelfe did maintaine the Prieſthoode,
and Temple of Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">Ioſeph. antiq. lib. 11. cap. vlt.</note> being in his voyage to war
againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> &amp; by the way beſieging Tyrus, he gaue
a command to the high Prieſt, &amp; Senate of Ieruſalem,
that they ſhould furniſh his army with all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for their ſiege. But being refuſed by them, after the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3493:23"/>
winning of Tyrus, he went to Ieruſalem with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to deſtroy the ſame; but when he did ſee the high
Prieſt, and his brethren clothed with their clothes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to the Sacrifice of the true God, who came to
receaue him in a peaceable manner, he did humble
himſelfe in all reuerence before the Prieſt, &amp; gaue him
all the externall adoration, which was ordinarie due to
Kings, Prieſts, &amp; Prophets, &amp; being asked of his chiefe
Captaines why he did ſo: he anſwered, that before his
expedition in warre, there was a God that did appeare
to him, clothed after the faſhion of this high Prieſt,
who did call him to the kingdome of all Aſia, and did
promiſe the ſame to him.</p>
            <p>This was the cauſe that mooued <hi>Alexander</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Temple of Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> and Sacrifice to the
true God of Iſrael, which was a preparatiue of the
eſtabliſhing the Vniuerſall kingdome of Chriſt, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all nations in the world to the true Religion, and
worſhip of the onely true God, from gentiliſme, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and worſhip of a multitude of falſe Gods. After his
death the Monarchy was diuided into foure parts, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the which diuiſion of kingdomes before vnited,
the Church of God did ſuffer great troubles: Yet God
did maintaine hir for a time, by <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> one of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
ſucceſſors, who did much good to the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
and was the Author of tranſlating the Bible into
the Greeke language, which was a meane to inſtruct
the Gentiles in the true knowledge of God, and of his
religion; which as I haue ſaid already, was a preparatiue
to the eſtabliſhing of Chriſt his kingdom amongſt all
the nations of the world. The diuiſion of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3493:23"/>
and kingdome of the Greekes brought by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of time, a miſerable deſolation, according to the
doctrine of our Text, which was a preparing before
hand of the tranſlation of the Grecian Monarchie, to
the Romanes.</p>
            <p>The Romane Monarchie did grow to her perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Chriſt himſelfe made choiſe of the vnited ſtate of the 4. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, to ioyne his vniuerſall kingdome with the kingdome of men vpon earth</note>
in the perſon of <hi>Augustus Caeſar,</hi> and did indure
partly in perfection, partly in her decaying age, for the
ſpace of ſeauen hundreth yeeres or there about: But in
her declining age, great diuiſions did fall out by ciuill
warres, which did bring foorth a great deſolation, and
diſſolution; of the which there did riſe a multitude of
other Kings and kingdomes, according to the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of <hi>Daniel:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 7.</note> during the perfection of this Monarchie
Chriſt did eſtabliſh his eternall kingdome, which was
the calling of all the nations of the Gentiles from
their Idolatrie foretold by the Prophet.</p>
            <p>Chriſt amongſt all eſtates of the world, did make
choiſe of this vnited eſtate of all kingdomes vnder one
King, &amp; Monarche to begin his ſpirituall kingdom here
amongſt men. Whereby we are taught that the onely
ſon of God did loue the condition of the Vnion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
kings in one, as being an Image of his heauenly
kingdome, aboue all other eſtates. For the choiſe of
Chriſts birth &amp; Incarnation vnder the eſtate of Vnion,
was a propheſie of the Vnion of Chriſts vniuerſal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which was to be ioyned with the earthly Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.
The beginning of the foundation of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was in the age of a generall peace eſtabliſhed by
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who as we learne by the Romane hiſtories,
<hi>Toto arbe pacato Ianum cluſit.</hi> did cloſe the Temple of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3493:24"/>
               <hi>Ianus,</hi> the whole world being at peace.</p>
            <p>We will lay before your eyes briefly,<note place="margin">The wonderfull bleſſing of God ſhewed on great Britannie, in the Vnion of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all the kingdoms there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chie, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Britain Emperour.</note> the eſtate, and
progreſſe of this bleſſed vnion of the worldly Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
with the ſpirituall kingdome of God, and ſhew
you alſo what a great benefit God hath powred foorth
vpon this Iland of great Brittannie, in chooſing it to be
the holy place, wherein this admirable vnion of God
and man is conioined in the perſon of a Britaine King,
vniting the temporall and ſpirituall Monarchie in one.
We are taught by Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories and others,
that Chriſt Ieſus the eternall ſon of his eternall father,
after his crucifying, and aſcenſion by ſending of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
through the world, did propagate the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and adoration of the increated God in the whole
Romane Monarchie for the ſpace of fiftie yeares: But
<hi>Satan</hi> who was, and as yet is, a vigilant watchman, a
carefull ſearcher, and a buſie Biſhop did not forget his
diuelliſh attempts. For knowing that the preaching of
the Euangell would deſtroy his Temple, which was
full of Gentilique Idolatrie,<note place="margin">Euſeb. in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. hiſt.</note> he did raiſe vp <hi>Nero,</hi> &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his ſucceſſors,<note place="margin">Sulp. Seuer. &amp; alij.</note> to excerciſe many bloody and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
perſecutions againſt Chriſts owne Apoſtles and
Diſciples, for the ſpace of three hundred yeares or ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about.
Hoping by ſuch cruell murdering of Gods holy
Saints to aboliſh the true adoration and religion of
Chriſt, and to maintaine the temples of his Idols and
falſe Gods. But that is true, which antiquitie doth
ſay, <hi>Sanguis Martyrum eſt ſemen Euangelij.</hi> The blood
of the Martyrs is the ſeed of the Goſpell. So that in
this caſe <hi>Satan</hi> was fruſtrated of his wicked expectation
that he had to deſtroy the true religion by the ſhedding
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3493:24"/>
of the pretious blood, euen as he was deceiued when
he ſeduced the people of the Iewes to crucify the Lord
of glory. For if <hi>Satan</hi> had knowen, that the crucifying
of Chriſt Ieſus, and the ſhedding of the bloud of that
immaculat Lambe ſhould tend to the ſaluation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and of his revnion with God, he would not then
haue inſtigated the Iewes to crucifie the Lord of glory;
and if he had knowen that the bloudſhed of ſo manie
holie Martyrs which were killed, for the ſpace of three
hundred yeeres after Chriſt, by the Romane Emperors,
and their lieutenants; if he had imagined, that all theſe
things did more eſtabliſh, and confirme Chriſts Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
then they did hinder the paſſage thereof, he would
haue left of to haue procured ſo many perſecutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>All theſe perſecutions being ended,<note place="margin">God did vnite great Britaine in one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and one true religion by the mariage of Conſtantius Chlorus, and Helena.</note> God did conciliat

where he did eſtabliſh the true Chriſtian religion
and the true worſhip of the onely vncreated God.
From thence he did take his iourney by Fraunce, to

            <p>We doe learne by this hiſtorie, how the propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

we collect, that the reſtoring of this auncient and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

that ſame good God, who is euer like himſelfe, did
bring foorth three moſt happy Vnions within theſe

which was brought in vnder the pretence of
Chriſtian Religion; the third vnion was the vniting of
England, and Scotland together in the perſon of our

gratious Soueraigne, who is deſcended Lineally from
King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeauenth. For it is notoriouſly knowen
that by that happie mariage of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth,
heire of Lancaſter, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> heire of Yorke, the
cruell wars which were for many yeeres, betwixt theſe
two houſes, were extinguiſhed; and the Vnion in their

Magnus</hi> a Britaine Emperour, in whoſe raigne
God did vnite the earthly kingdome with the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
The third bleſſing is this laſt admirable Vnion of
the <hi>South</hi> and the <hi>North</hi> in one kingdome, vnder one
King and gouernour, in the true Religion and worſhip
of God, by the which Vnion this Iland is in the moſt
happy eſtate of all the kingdomes of the world. God
giue vs all thankefull harts to acknowledge the ſame.</p>
            <p>I will entreate all the ſubiects of Great Britaine, to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3493:26"/>
lay before their eyes, the bleſſed eſtate of the Vnion of
this Iland, in one language, one true Religion, and in
one temporall kingdome: And on the other part, looke
what was the miſerable and lamentable eſtate of this
Iland, during the ſpace that it was diuided into many
earthly kingdomes, and holding vnder the ſpirituall
captiuitie of the Idolatrie of ſpirituall Babylon. And
for this cauſe remember the hiſtory of the diuiſion, and
ciuill warres of the Romane Monarchie, how they did
draw their ſouldiers and warriours out of this Iland,
and marke, at that ſame time, what a deſolate and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
eſtate both the ſpirituall and temporall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
did fall into. For the <hi>North</hi> Britaines did riſe
vp in warre againſt the <hi>South</hi> Britaines, who for their
aide and helpe had refuge to the Saxons, who did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
Gentiliſme and Paganiſme.</p>
            <p>But the Saxons hauing deliuered the <hi>South</hi> Britaines
from the oppreſſion of the <hi>North,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The miſeries and calamities that did fall out in Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie by the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſundry king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</note> did thruſt out the
Southerne people out of their poſſeſſions, lands, houſes,
and Countrey: ſo that a great number of them, did flie
into little Britannie in France, and the remnant went to
the Weſterne part called Wales. I might ſhew you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
how that the <hi>South</hi> was deuided into ſeauen King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,<note place="margin">Bed. Hiſt. Ang. lib. 1. cap. 15.</note>
at what time there were moſt cruell warres ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
amongſt themſelues: how that afterward they
were afflicted by the Danes, and how during the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
of kingdomes in all theſe ages, all learning, all
true Religion, and all pietie was baniſhed, yea almoſt
extinguiſhed: and by the contrary, all barbaritie by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and bloodſhed, all Gentiliſme, and Idolatrie did
abound; I might ſhew you, how all theſe things did
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3493:26"/>
raigne in this Iland during the deuided eſtate of this
kingdome, but time will not ſuffer me.</p>
            <p>Let the conſideration of felicitie,<note place="margin">An exhortation to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this happy Vnion.</note> (which doth flow
from Vnion) on the one ſide; of miſery and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
(which doth come by diuiſion,) on the other ſide,
worke mightily in the harts of all theſe, whom God and
his Lieutenant hath choſen at this time, out of the
<hi>South</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> to entreate of this Vnion whereof I
haue now ſpoken. And that they may learne what a
dangerous thing it is, to leaue any little ſeede of any
former diuiſion; we are to take heede of <hi>Satans</hi> lying
deceptions, who is a buſie watchman ſeeking by all
meanes to throw in ſome ſeede of diuiſion amongſt
men, to hinder &amp; ſtay the good worke of God; as mens
particular commodities, &amp; preferments, which are not
of ſuch waight or importance in reſpect of this happie
Vnion: Therefore, <hi>Tollantur à nobis nomina diuiſionis,</hi>
Let all the names of diuiſion or diſcord be taken from
amongſt vs. Let vs alſo learne by theſe hiſtories of the
Vnion, and diuiſion of kingdomes, a very ſure rule (as
I ſhewed you a little before) that the diuiſion of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in diuerſe kingdomes doth come from the head
<hi>Gouernours,</hi> who by deuiding of one kingdome made
many kingdomes, as we ſee in the firſt diuiſion of the
world, and ſpecially in the diuiſion of the kingdome
of the Iſraelites; In the <hi>third Monarchie</hi> of the Greekes
amongſt the foure ſucceſſours of <hi>Alexander;</hi> In the
diſſolution of the <hi>Romane Empire</hi> into the <hi>Orient</hi> and
the <hi>Occident:</hi> In the ſubdiuiſion of the kingdome of
<hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> in the <hi>Occident;</hi> In the ſubdiuiſion of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> into many kingdomes. In the diuiſion of this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3493:27"/>
               <hi>Iland,</hi> into many kingdomes. So that the cauſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
ceaſing by the Vnion of kingdomes, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was vnited <hi>ipſo iure &amp; ipſo facto,</hi> as Fraunce was
(during the firſt race of <hi>Kings</hi> called <hi>Meroninges)</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
amongſt foure brethren into foure <hi>Kingdomes:</hi>
but ſo ſoone as all thoſe foure fell in one Kings hands,
they were all vnited <hi>ipso facto,</hi> in one, <hi>ratione capitis,</hi>
by reaſon of their head. Likewiſe, we haue an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in <hi>South Britannie,</hi> when the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
kingdomes did fall in one <hi>Princes</hi> gouernment,
they were all ſeauen vnited <hi>ipſo facto, ratione capitis,</hi>
by reaſon of the head: Euen ſo, <hi>pari iure</hi> the <hi>South</hi>
and <hi>North,</hi> being vnited vnder one <hi>King,</hi> it followeth
neceſſarily that the <hi>Kingdomes</hi> are vnited amongſt
themſelues: ſo that by the Law of God and man our
Great <hi>Britannie</hi> is no more two kingdomes, but one
onely; He that oppoſeth himſelfe againſt this holy
Vnion, doth offend his God, make little regard of his
<hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> and hurteth the welfare and happy
ſtate of this whole Iland.</p>
            <p>Let all men remember by the foreſaid examples,
that the Vnion of kingdomes hath beene alwaies the
furtherance and ſtanding of true Religion; but diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of kingdomes hath beene the ouerthrow of true
Religion, and aduancing of <hi>Idolatrie;</hi> let all thoſe that
loue God, perſeuerance in true Religion, proſperitie
of their naturall <hi>King,</hi> and ſtanding of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of this Iland, (which is the common mother of
vs all) be carefull of the performance of Gods worke,
and put to their helping hand for the furtherance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And let all reaſonable and godly men conſider, how
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3493:27"/>
God on his part hath taken away from vs, all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of diuiſion, as diuerſitie of <hi>Language, Religion, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours,</hi>
and <hi>Kings,</hi> and hath vnited vs in one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
in one Religion, and vnder one head and King.
If we then caſt in any lets or impediments on our ſide;
or if we inuent any new ſubiect of diuiſion betwixt the
<hi>South</hi> and the <hi>North,</hi> we ſhall be like vnto thoſe that
doe diuide, teare, and cut in peeces their owne bowels,
deuoure their owne children, and put fire in their owne
houſes.</p>
            <p>Let all men therefore examine their owne harts and
minds,<note place="margin">The Concluſion.</note> whether they feele any inward motion within
them to further and aduance this good woorke. If they
doe, let them beleeue certainly, that ſuch a motion doth
come from God; and by the contrary, if any man find
any euill motion in his hart that tendeth to the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of this good worke, let him beleeue that this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
commeth by the <hi>Diuels</hi> ſuggeſtion. Let vs all pray
to God as well in our priuate houſes, as in our publike
aſſemblies, that God would performe this his owne
worke, wherein doth conſiſt the eſtabliſhing of his true
worſhip and Religion in this <hi>Iland,</hi> and the extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all falſe <hi>Idolatrie;</hi> Let vs auoyde all euill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
inuentions of men, impediments or hinderance
whatſoeuer that Satan may caſt in mens minds to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
this his holy worke, to ſtay the building of Gods

this worke, and will ſend his curſe and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on all them and their poſteritie that ſhall let or
