            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE are ſufficiently ſenſible of the Miſchiefs of Jeſuitical Villains; ſixty ſix we hope is not yet, nor ever will be forgot, nor the grand Contrivances or petty Inſtruments of that Curſed Conflagration; Nor have we wanted ſeveral inſtances ſince of their malice. The ſame men that firſt Burnt our Houſes, would quickly Burn our Bodies; and had they power would no doubt repeat all the Butcheries of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95757:3"/>
               <hi>Marian</hi> days. We ſhall not mention <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, Wapping,</hi> &amp;c. Though the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Miſchiefs there are not unknown: However ſince the Burning of this Priſon which is juſt now happened, is ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Town, it will not be inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to give the World a perfect Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thereof, to pevent falſe reports and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations. On <hi>Friday</hi> the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> Mr. <hi>Green</hi> the Keeper of the ſaid <hi>New-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of <hi>Clerkenwell</hi> (a very Civil and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon) being abroad upon his Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, came home about Eleven of the Clock at Night; and (according to his uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) did by himſelf take a Pipe of Tobacco, and then lookt very diligently, (as he always uſed to do,) about the Houſe; and found every thing ſafe, and no Candle or Light that he could perceive, beſides what he had with him: It being juſt after the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had Diſcharged moſt of the Malefactors, there were but few in Cuſtody, but amongſt the reſt one Mr. <hi>Woodgar a</hi> Notorious Papiſt, ſome ſay a Prieſt, but that is uncertain: He
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95757:3"/>
was Lodged by himſelf up one pair of Stairs; and 'tis not ſaid there were any Suſpitious perſons in the Houſe, but only common Offenders which by the manner of the thing would no ways be ſuppoſed to to be concerned in contriving the Fire. Mr. <hi>Green</hi> went to his Bed much about Twelve of the Clock at Night, or ſome ſmall time before, but had not lain above half an hour, before a Fellow that was a Turn-key to the Houſe, came to the door of his Chamber, and cry'd out <hi>Lord! Maſter the Priſon is on Fire.</hi> This much ſurprizing and affrighting him, he ſtarted out of his Bed and run to the door, but did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently open it; but called the man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to run with all ſpeed to call the Watch, and get help as well to quench it, as to ſecure the Priſoners: The man went away, but what became of him is not known, for he hath not ſince been ſeen or heard of thereabouts.</p>
            <p>Nor is the ſaid Mr. <hi>Woodgar</hi> the Papiſt to be found, though Mr. <hi>Green</hi> does affirm
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95757:4"/>
that according to the beſt of his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he does believe the Fire was begun in his Chamber; and there is a violent ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it might be by Confederacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him and the ſaid Turnkey, and that they may be gone away together; or otherwiſe that they muſt be both Conſumed in the Flames, which is not very probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Turnkey being up and ſenſible of the Fire, it is not reaſonable to think he would expoſe himſelf to danger; nor did he go as he was ordered to call the Watch.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Green</hi> having haſtily got on his Cloaths went down, and found the Houſe on Fire to that degree as not to be Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht till moſt of it was deſtroyed. In that hurry and confuſion the reſt of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were let out to preſerve their Lives from the Fire, and ſo got away, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no aſſiſtance ready to ſecure them; but were all ſeen except the Papiſt, who 'tis ſuppoſed was gone before.</p>
            <p>The Priſon is generally Burnt down, but the Corporation, or houſe uſually called
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95757:4"/>
               <hi>New-Bridewel</hi> adjoyning thereunto was preſerved ſafe and without damage.</p>
            <p>This what account we can get or obtain of this matter, and what Judgment is to be made of the ſame, is left to the Disquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Authority, and Diſcretion of the Reader.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are profeſt <hi>Incendiaries of Kingdoms,</hi> 'tis not to be doubted but will be apt enough to Fire Houſes, eſpecially when tempted by the advantage of gaining Liberty, and avoiding Juſtice by ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid practices; and it will be the duty of all perſons that have ſuch kind of people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Cuſtody, to take more eſpecial care from this example to ſecure themſelves, and diſable their Priſoners of that ſtamp, from all opportunities of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch miſchiefs.</p>
