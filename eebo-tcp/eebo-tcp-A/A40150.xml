            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Concerning the Upright and Good Converſation of the Saints in Chriſt and in Heaven.</head>
            <p>DAVID ſaith, <hi>The Wicked have drawn out the Sword, and have bent their Bow, to caſt down the Poor and Needy, and to ſlay ſuch as be of an Upright Converſation: their Sword ſhall enter into their own Heart, and their Bow ſhall be broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is <hi>David</hi>'s Judgment upon ſuch, that caſt down the Poor and Needy, and do ſlay ſuch as be of an Upright Converſation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But whoſo offereth Praiſe, glorifieth me,</hi> ſaith the Lord; <hi>and to him that orders his Converſation aright, will I ſhew the Salvation of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So all that will ſee the Salvation of God, firſt to ſee your Converſations to be ordered aright with the Light, Power and Spirit of God; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By the Grace of God we have had our Converſation in the World, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So now are all by the Grace of God to have their Converſation preſerved from the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the World, which Grace brings their Salvation.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> how that <hi>We all had our Converſation in times past in the Luſts of our Fleſh, fulfilling the Deſires of our Fleſh, and of our mind; and were by Nature the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath, even as well as others:</hi> and therefore he exhorts them, <hi>To put off concerning the former Converſation the old man, which is corrupt, according to the deceiptful luſts, and be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind, and only let your Converſation be as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, &amp;c. that ye ſtand faſt in one spirit, with one mind, ſtriving together for the Faith of the Goſpel; for our Converſati- is in Heaven, from whence we look for the</hi> Saviour, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who ſhall change our Vile Body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his</hi> Glorious Body.</p>
            <p>So here the Apoſtles and the Saints had put off their former Converſation according to the World, whoſe Converſation was in Heaven, where are all the true Saints or Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle exhorted <hi>Timothy,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Be thou an</hi> Example <hi>of the</hi> Believers <hi>in</hi> Word, <hi>in</hi> Converſation, <hi>in</hi> Charity, <hi>in</hi> Spirit, <hi>in</hi> Faith, <hi>in</hi> Purity: which is a Good Corverſation to be followed.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith to the Hebrews, <hi>Let your</hi> Converſation <hi>be without</hi> Covetouſneſs; <hi>&amp; be content with ſuch things as ye have: for the</hi> Lord <hi>hath ſaid,</hi> He will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</p>
            <p>And <hi>James</hi> ſaith in his General Epiſtle, <hi>Who is a Wiſe Man, and endew'd with Knowledge among you? let bim ſhew out of a</hi> good Converſation his Works with Meekneſs of Wiſdom, <hi>for</hi> where Envying and Strife is, there is Confuſion, and every Evil Work.</p>
            <p>Now this Good Converſation muſt be ſhewed forth in Practice.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> in his General Epiſtle admoniſhes the Church to be as Obedient Children, not faſhioning your ſelves according to the former Luſts in your Ignorance, but as he which hath called you is Holy, ſo be ye Holy in all manner of Converſation [Mark, all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation] foraſmuch as ye know, that ye were not redeemed with Corruptible Things, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Silver and Gold, from your Vain Converſation, received by Tradition from your Fathers, but with the Precious Blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without Blemiſh and without Spot, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe ye Wives be ſubject to your own Husbands, that if any obey not the Word they alſo may without the Word be won by the Converſation of the Wives, while they be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hold your Chaſte Converſation, coupled with Fear, &amp;c. having a good Conſcience, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> whereas they ſpeak Evil of you, as of Evil Doers, they may be aſhamed that falſly accuſe your Good Converſation in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Here you ſee the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Converſations were in Chriſt, which all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ought to be; and they whoſe Converſations are in Chriſt Jeſus, are grieved and vexed with the Filthy Converſations of the Wicked, as Juſt <hi>Lot</hi> was.</p>
