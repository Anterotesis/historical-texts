            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Doe not believe (good Reader) that any judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man is perswaded, that our Confession of Faith, solemnely sworne and subscribed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of all rankes throughout the whole Kingdome, is worne out of date, for any thing hee hath seene in <hi>M. I. F.</hi> of <hi>Corse</hi> his late Pamphlet: Yet lest any of weake judgment give credite to his allegations, I have undertaken to cleare the Trueth for thy farther information and their confirmation, Hee hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled it, <hi>A peaceable Warning,</hi> whereas it tendeth to division, &amp; to annihilate the authoritie of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Confession sworne and subscribed universally now the third time. <hi>Ieremie</hi> complaineth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>for they have healed the hurt of my daughter slightly, saying, peace, peace, when there is no peace.</hi> So now many pretend a care for the peace of the Kirk, when they intend no peace farther than their opinions shal bee followed, and the course they have layed down to themselves. It is true, hee hath disclamed what hee hath written amisse, or to the offence of any in his former copies spread abroad in writ. But is that a sufficient satisfaction for these vile imputations of rebellion, sedition, disobedience, refractarinesse, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritie, unduetifulnesse to Ministers, and reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as blind guides. Howsoever hee now seemeth more modest, yet you may take up of what spirit hee is. But I wil not, nor need not make A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie, but proceed to my answere to this Copie, directing the same to the Author himselfe.</p>

                  </gap>ession of Faith. which you call, <hi>The short negative Confession,</hi> is unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. For it was not only approved by the generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes holden in the yeare 1581; and then subscribed uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versallie, but also in the yeere 1590. by a charge from the secreet Counsell procured by the generall Assemblie. There was an Act made in the Assemblie holden in Iune 1587. that Students in Vnivrsities subscribe the Religion then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished and professed by the mercie of God within this Realme, before they bee promoved to Degries. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, all such as have beene laureat in the Colledge of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh</hi> since that time to this present yeere to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 1500 or therabout have subscribed that Confession.</p>
               <p>In the Assemblie holden in March 1589 some were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to seeke from the Clerk of Register a copie of the act made lately before concerning the new subscription of the Band, and the same Confession of Faith. Some were sent to petition the Counsell, that Commissions might bee given to such persons, as were agried upon before the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Assembly, to receive <hi>de novo</hi> subscriptions to the Band of maintenance of Religion subscribed by his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jestie,</hi> and the same Confession of Faith, which was put in execution, and the Band was printed with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. Whereby you may perceive, what is meant by Religion in the Band of maintainance.</p>
               <p>As you have your selfe cited sundrie acts of Parliament for the first Confession, you might have added an act of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of this Confession also. In the 12 <hi>Parliament</hi> holden in Iune <hi>anno</hi> 1592. and act 123 it is declared, that no Subject shall injoy the benefite of the act of Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation made in Februar 1572. of aboltion made in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1585. or of both ratified in Iulie 1587. unlesse they professe the true Religon, as the same was then professed within this Realme, and acknowledge his <hi>Highnesse Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</hi> But the heads contained in that Confession were the points of Religion then professed within this Realme;

                  </gap>eceeding a signe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, Was any subscription accepted but to that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession since it was first subscribed. The title of the <hi>Act</hi> sheweth, that by profession, is meant giving confession of their Faith. The conjoyning of the acknowledegment of the Kings authoritie with professing the true Religion, as it was then professed, leadeth <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to that Confession: For in the end of that act, there <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a clause binding the subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to acknowledge K. <hi>Iames</hi> to bee their Soveraigne Lord, which agrieth not with any other Confession. No other Confession of Faith can bee meant in the acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament following.</p>
               <p>Whereas you saye, it was called <hi>The Kings Confession,</hi> because it was set out in the <hi>Kings Name,</hi> Wee saye, it might have beene as well so called, because it was first sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the King and Court. But there is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, upon what ground it was so called by any. This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, that it was the Confession of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> that it was so taken by forraine Kirks, and therefore insert in the harmonie of the Confessions of the reformed Kirks, and there called in the superscription <hi>The Confession of the Faith of Scotland,</hi> which is a larger title, than to call it <hi>The Kings Confession.</hi> If that Confession which was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally subscribed by direction from <hi>Authoritie,</hi> and of the nationall assembly, may not justly bee called, <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Kirk,</hi> let any man judge.</p>
               <p>You say, because it insisteth most in rejecting of errours, it is also called <hi>The negative Confession.</hi> It is so called by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and such as look back to <hi>Poperie,</hi> but not justly. For it consisteth of an affirmative part, comprehending the first Confession as these words doe expressely beare. <hi>Wee believe with our hearts, confesse with our mouths, subscribe with our hands, and constantly affirme before God, and the World &amp;c.</hi> and of rejection of errours, for which you call it often <hi>The negative Confession,</hi> taking the denomination from a part, from the lesser part, and from the negative


<pb facs="tcp:2611:3"/>
part, rather than from the affirmative. Nay rather from the qualitie of the appendix to the old Confession, than of the Confession it selfe. For the rejection of errours is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended to the old Confession. This course to <hi>joyne</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of errours with positiue points of doctrine was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed at the Counsell at <hi>Dort.</hi> Your selfe confesse that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny masked <hi>Papists</hi> subscribed the old Confession deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and therefore that this forme of consenting to the old, with a rejection of all contrarie Religion, and sundry popish errours particularly expressed, was drawne up to discover them. Was not that needfull, and the course lawfull? Whereas you say, a certaine reverend Brother, meaning Master <hi>Craig</hi> did it. Will any man thinke, that none did perceive the deceit of masked <hi>Papists,</hi> but hee alone? Or that hee presumed to draw up that forme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of other reverend Brethren. finding this course to bee necessarie, or that it could passe without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the generall <hi>Assembly. M. Alexander An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson</hi> Principall, <hi>M. Andrew Galloway</hi> Sub-principall. <hi>M. Andrew Anderson, M. Duncan Norie,</hi> Regents of the Colledge of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> were called before the Earle of <hi>Murrey</hi> Regent, and the Lords of privie Counsel, who were present with him in <hi>Aberdene</hi> in Iulie 1569. and were requyred to approve by subscription the old <hi>Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith,</hi> with all other Acts made concerning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion in the Parliamenrs holden at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in August 1560. and December 1567. They were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for their refusall of all honours, dignities, functions, preheminences, faculties, and priviledges within the said Colledge, and of libertie to instruct the youth in any part within this Realme. The <hi>Commissioner</hi> of the Kirk to the shirefdomes of <hi>Aberdene, &amp; Bamfe,</hi> pronounced the like sentence, by the advice, counsell, and consent of the Ministers and Elders in these bounds. But so it is, that su<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

or a rejection of popish errours, either in generall or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as the denyall of the Popes authoritie and jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the annulling of all Acts made since K. <hi>Iames</hi> the first his time, not agrieing with the word of God, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the confession of Faith, then published, the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tions, canons, civill, or municipall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the said true Religion. So you see, that even then they thought it not enough to require subscription to the <hi>Confession,</hi> but also to abrenunce contrarie errours, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially popish. This <hi>Confession,</hi> which you call <hi>the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> explaineth more particularly these acts. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the title before it was called, <hi>A generall Confession of the true Christian faith &amp; Religion, according to GODS Word, and Acts of Parliaments.</hi> It were good that the like course were taken with you, and your fellowes in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdene</hi> to that which was taken with these before you, that is, to remove you, if you subscribe not that <hi>Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which you seeme to despyte so much. In the meane time, I would have you content to call it not the <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Confession,</hi> but the <hi>generall Confession</hi>; as the title beareth.</p>

If the testimonie of learned men agreable with the Scriptures might bee called divine absolutely and simply, then there should be no difference betweene the holy Scripture &amp; the same wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the learned. The <hi>Manicheans</hi> saide, that what <hi>Orpheus Sybilla,</hi> and the Philosophers of the Gentiles fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of <hi>Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Contra Faust. l. 13 c. 15.</note> were of as great authoritie as the wordes of the Prophets. <hi>Augustine</hi> answereth, that if any trueth bee found in them, it availeth to their conviction, but not to bee holden in estimation or authoritie as the words of the Prophets. For the Devills, said hee, spake true things of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet were not of as great authoritie as the Angels.

               <p>Where you saye, if wee find in the writings of men any thing repugnant to the holy Scriptures wee ought to reject it, correct it, or amend it; as our progenitours wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly professed in their epistle prefixed to their nationall <hi>Confession.</hi> That epistle or preface seemeth to have beene written in name of the Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, &amp; other Subjects professing the true Religion, who after that they had in their Supplication to the Estates offered to prove the doctrine of the Roman Kirk to bee repugnant to the word of God, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to draw up the summe of that doctrine, which they would maintaine. and desire the <hi>Parliament</hi> to ratifie. Within foure dayes after, it was presented and read, first before the Lords of the Articles, and after. before the whole Estates. Some of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie were present standing readie to answere, what might bee alleadged against it. The Bishops and others of a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarie mind were charged in the name of GOD to object against it, if they could. Everie Article was read by it selfe. None would, nor could object in the contrare. The Eerle of <hi>Marshall</hi> protested, that no Ecelesiasticall person should afterward have place to oppone, considering, that time was granted them to advise, and none opponed in so free and peaceable a <hi>Parliament.</hi> After that none opponed by argument. The <hi>Confession</hi> it selfe (without their epistle prefixed, when it was exhibited by the Protestants, as the title beareth before the <hi>Confession</hi>) was authorized, as a doctrine grounded upon the infallible Word of God, as you may see, where it is insert in the acts of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Apparently you would have no <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and authorized, or to stand firme and stable, but that everie man may have libertie to impugne it. This were to unsettle a Kirk or Estate. After a <hi>Confession</hi> is ratified, none should bee suffered to be members, let bee office-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in that Kirk, who refuse to subscribe or impugneth it private or publick, in schooles or pulpits, unlesse it be first

               <p>You say, that <hi>short Confession</hi> hath humane privat autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and is respected for the Penner, and many well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted christians subscribers. But that in this regard wee are no more tyed to this Confession then any part of <hi>Augustin Ambrose, Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvins</hi> workes approved by manie good Chistians, nor that the obligation of the subscribers can be extended beyond their owne persons and lifetimes. But wee have told you already, that it is the Confession of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> approved by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and subscribed universally by direction of authoritie at two sundrie times, which is more than to bee penned by M. <hi>Craig,</hi> and subscribed by many good Christians, or hath beene done to any part of <hi>Aagustine, Ambrose, Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvins</hi> workes</p>

But so is not the generall confession of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The orthodox confession of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed kirk deserveth greater respect than the treatises or works of <hi>Ambrose, Luther</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sunt enim hae Confessiones orthodoxae, tanquam tabulae authentica, privatorum Docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum scriptis anteponendae.</hi> as is said in the Latine preface to the <hi>Confessions of faith.</hi> There is good reason for it: for humane authoritie admitteth degrees.

To conclude this point, Wee are aswell tyed to

the generall Confession as to that which you call the natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, for the generall is nationall aswell as the first. In the meane time, you have showne litle respect either to the penner or subscribers, for you call it the <hi>negative Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>short negative Confession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The supreme authoritie civill you distinguish in royall or legall, and the legall you make also royall. So then the royall power is royall or legall. Or you meane, the royall power is either conjunct with the Estates, as in making Lawes, because <hi>ne civiles quidem leges ex fua solius autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate ferre potest,</hi> as saith <hi>Burthillus contra Becani contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. pag.</hi> 66. or without their concurrence, as in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving remissions &amp;c.

                  </gap>. for the power of execution, or administration of justice shuld bee also legall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ruled by the lawes. This <hi>short Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> you say, had never authoritie legall, for it was never ratified by act of Parliament, but all the civill authoritie it had, was only royall by the Kings mandat. You would say imposed by vertue of his royall prerogative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I believe that his <hi>Majestie</hi> professing lately in his Declaration, that hee would not urge the <hi>Service booke</hi> farther but in a legall manner, would not impose upon us subseription to the <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> by his royall mandat, but in a legall manner. I am sure there is as great reason for the one as for the other. But wee have shewed already, that it hath beene ratified by act of Parliament universally recived &amp; subscribed, which is equivalent to a Parliament. But more of this anone.</p>
               <p>You saye, Authoritie ecclesiasticall was given to this Confession by two nationall Synods. But I have cited moe, which you have omitted, whether of set purpose, or otherwise, I referre to your owne conscience.</p>
               <p>You saye, the Authoritie synodicall immediat, was that approbation, whereby these Synods declared this Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion


<pb facs="tcp:2611:6"/>
to bee a true, Christian, faithfull, and godly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and that such as truely professe <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> ought to agree thereto. That by this reason it tendeth to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest a divine authoritie of the confession of the doctrine thereof, and in respect of the matter so approved doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallie oblish all Christians. Wee have already cleared that point of divine authoritie wherein you have fumbled. As for the other point, wee doe think that all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should embrace our <hi>Confession,</hi> Wee beeing persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when wee subscribe, that it is the undoubted trueth grounded upon the written Word. But our intention was not to set downe a <hi>Confession of faith,</hi> whereunto all Christians in the world should bee tyed, but only such as will bee members of this Kirk, and to make knowne to the world what wee professe. For as it is well observed in the preface to the harmonie of <hi>Confessions.</hi> If every man bee commanded to make <hi>Confession of his Faith, so often as Gods glorie &amp; the edification of the Kirk shall require, what a wonderfull and strange thing ought it to seeme, if Cities, if Provinces, if whole Kingdomes have made profession of their Faith, When they were falselie charged by the Popish sort, that they had gone from the doctrine of the true Kirke.</hi> You acknowledge you are obliged to reverence the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a nationall Synod of our Kirk in matters substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Why not in matters also rituall and disciplinarie? for these I suppose you oppose to matters substantiall. Yet in matters substantiall, you professe you are no more oblid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to hearken to those two Synods, than to the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or following, or to the Synods in forraigne Kirks, or to the ancient Councells, that is, only by restriction.

I will tell you more, the Proclamation had taken small or no effect, if it had not beene seconded with the authoritie of the generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Yea it had beene a dangerous preparative to command Ministers to crave subscriptions to a Confession of Faith not approved by the Kirk. The worke was good, but the order preposterous. In the yeere 1589. the assembly began, and desired Commissions to be given to that effect and gave in a roll of such, as they had nominat to bee Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, which was performed by the secret Counsell. You must knowe also that there have beene acts of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies made for subscribing that <hi>Confession</hi> without relation to the Kings commandment, as for that students in schools and Vniversities made <hi>anno</hi> 1587 and this following <hi>Sess.</hi> 3. <hi>quarto Martij</hi> 1589. <hi>Anent subscriptions to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith with protestation, that the Subscribers doe the same only to obey the King &amp; his Lawes, the Assembly esteemeth of no such subscriptions, but ordaineth such persons to bee proceeded against, as against simple refusers.</hi> Suppose the two acts cited by your self make mention of the Kings mandat, yet they injoyne Ministers to doe the same thing that the mandat requyres, not beeing urged by the King or Counsell, but of their owne accord for furtherance of the work it selfe. The first Act requyred Ministers to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the tenor of the Proclamation. But the second Act differeth in some points from the tenor of it. Where the King with advice of the Counsell injoyned Ministers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Names of the refusers, and the processe led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them to the Ministers of his House, under the pai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

of fourtie pounds, the Assembly enjoyned them to report their diligence to the next Synods, that the same might bee reported to the generall Assembly, and that under the paine of deprivation.</p>
               <p>They intended perpetuitie in these Acts: for they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it to bee a true Christian conf<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

To approve a Confession, and to urge subscription, import an intent, that such as shall bee members of the Kirke, shall professe conforme to that Confession, and subscribe when they are requyred. When they ordained Students in time to come to subscribe, before they past their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gries, did they not intend perpetuitie. Did not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall practise afterward, when any suspect of Papistrie were requyred to subscribe, prove a perpetuitie was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at the first. If the first Confession standeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is nationall; This other, or the former with this appendicle continueth for the same reason. For a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession subscribed universally through the whole Nation by direction of Authorititie both civill and ecclesiasticall may and should bee called nationall, and with as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as a Confession authorized by Parliament without subscription of the Subjects, the one beeing the collective, the other but the representative bodie. And yet it was also approved by Parliament, as I shewed before. Doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nation receive a Confession, but of purpose to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the same? If everie generation should change their Confession, what a reproach should it be to a Kirk? Heare the reproach of Papists. <hi>Quoties non mut arunt suam quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>You call the Kings charge his royall mandat, and make no mention of the Counsells advice and consent. You see the second act of the assembly cited by your selfe beareth, that the Kings Majestie, with advice of his Counsell hath set foorth and proclaimed &amp;c. The Commissions given in March 1509 were given likewise by authoritie of the King and counsell. Which is more than you doe insinuate, and yet had not beene sufficient without approbation and concurrence of the Assembly.</p>
               <p>You say, the vigour of the act of assembly remained no longer than the Kings mandat stoode, which expyring it did expyre also. I have shewed alredie, that these acts of assemblyes were not made by direction or injunction of any royall mandat, and have cited some acts which make no mention of any act of Counsell, or royall mandate, but respect the stablished course.</p>
               <p>You subsume, and saye the mandat royall hath expyred long agoe, because it was no perpetuall law, but a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie mandat given out in his <hi>Majesties</hi> minor age. First, I answere that mandat was not onely given in his minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but againe also in his Majoritie. Next, it was not only his Majesties mandat, but it was an act of Counsell. Doth not an act of counsell stand in force till it bee altered, or annulled. Thirdly, the mandat or act of Counsell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the worke not to continue for a time, but so long as the Kirk continued, Fourthly, it could not bee recalled, nor yet can bee either by act of counsell, or act of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> because <hi>res non est integra.</hi> When they laboured to draw the whole Nation to subscription, intended they not the perpetuitie of a Confession. After the People were


<pb facs="tcp:2611:8"/>
brought on to sweare by the great name of the Lord to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the obedience of the doctrine and discipline of this Kirk, how could the mandat or charge bee recalled?</p>
               <p>Your sentence therefore cited out of the glosse upon <hi>Gratians</hi> Decree, <hi>Causa sublata tollitur constitutio ex cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa illa orta,</hi> maketh nothing for the expyring of the force of the acts of the Assembly. For both the acts of Counsell and assemblyes tended to establish a perpetuall <hi>Confession</hi> in this Kirke and Kingdome. So the vigour of these acts yet remaineth and continueth. Next, this sentence is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained <hi>causa</hi> 19 <hi>quaest.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. Duae sunt. Glossa, propter criminosos.

But heere the impulsive cause of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Confession was, as your selfe confesse, the deceit of Papists subscribing to the first Confession, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to subvert the true Religion, and the end of drawing up that Confession was to discover them. The same causes both impulsive and finall yet remaine. And suppose both should faile, there is another principall end wherefore Churches set foorth the Confessions of their Faith, to wit, to make knowne to the World, what they professe, as I have observed before out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the harmonie of the Confession.</p>
               <p>You prove the royall mandat to bee expyred first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee dissallowed this confession in a certaine speach uttered in conference at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> There have beene sundrie copies of that conference spread abroad, and wee have no reason to believe Bishop <hi>Barloes</hi> report. Suppose the report were true, we allow the speach in a part. For it would have made the Book of the English articles to swel to a great volumne to insert everie negative position. But


<pb facs="tcp:2611:9"/>
thinke you that well applyed to this Confession: for it doth not containe everie negative position, but is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a rejection of sundrie popish errours particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, with generall clauses for rejection of the rest, as your selfe confesse in the 9 <hi>page.</hi> Neither is it a great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne. How often doe your selfe call it a <hi>short Confession.</hi> You saye, it may bee gathered by that speach that hee did utterly disallow and annull that <hi>Confession.</hi> Hee allowed it before both in his none age, and majoritie. Next, it was necessarie for the discoverie of masked Papists, and still is for masked Papists and Ministers to use such formes of speach <hi>I detest, I abhorre &amp;c.</hi> It is strange, that that should bee dislyked now, which was thought necessarie then. But suppose the forme of the <hi>Confession</hi> was disallow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by that speach, yet could it not annull the former mandat</p>
               <p>A speach uttered in a conference holden out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie could not repeale the acts of Counsell made at home, and his owne publick Proclamation. Next, that speach was uttered. if uttered, in a free discourse to such as were there present, and was not delivered by way of precept, charge or declaration to us. <hi>M. Patrick Galloway</hi> in a letter dated the tenth of Februar, 1604. and directed to the Ptesbyterie of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> hath these words, <hi>Sundrie, as they favoured, gave out copies of things heere concluded. Where-upon I my selfe tooke occasion, as I was an eye and eare witnes, to set them downe, and presented them to his Majestie, who with his owne hand mended some things, and eeked other things which I had omitted. Which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected copie with his owne hand I have, and have sent you heerewith the just transsumpt of it word by word,</hi> But in that transsumpt there is no mention of such a speach, nor the least inkling against the <hi>Confession of our faith,</hi> which had beene verie pertinent and requisite, if hee had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either a recalling of his mandat, or a declaration of his disallowance of that <hi>Confession.</hi> But suppose hee had, yet


<pb facs="tcp:2611:9"/>

You prove next, that the royall mandat was made voyde by his death, and expy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the royall breath, and to this effect you cite the sentence following out of the glosse upon the 19 chapter of the first Booke of the Decretalls, <hi>Morte mandantis, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirat mandatum,</hi> which as you have cited: is false. But these words of the glosse are received, <hi>Mortuo manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore, re existente integra, expirat mandatum.</hi> The scope of the text is to determine that the jurisdiction of him that is delegate expyreth not by the death of him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated, if there bee litiscontestation before his death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then the matter is not whole and untouched. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Iustinian</hi> sayeth of that <hi>mandatum</hi> that is contracted betwixt him that giveth, and him that undertaketh the charge of anye businesse, the <hi>Mandator</hi> and <hi>Mandata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> that the contract is loosed, if the death of any of them interveene before entrie to execution. <hi>Si adhuc integro mandato mors alterius interveniat.</hi> Such like in authora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mandats, if hee to whom commission was given to put it to execution depart before hee put it in execution, there can bee no farther proceeding, till another bee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his rowme.

               <p>It is true, wee ought to bee busie instructing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the positive groundes of trueth, but that hindereth us not to explaine to them points of heresie, which were set downe for masked Papists, and now Ministers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are leavened with Poperie &amp; <hi>Arminianisme.</hi> Should not the true shepheard bee carefull to warne the sheep, if they bee in danger of the Wolfe.</p>
               <p>If any of us have given any other interpretation then the <hi>Confession of faith</hi> it selfe will beare, wee shall bee ready to passe from it, when wee shall be convinced. You are sorie that some of us in printed workes condemne Episcopacie, and the five <hi>Perth</hi> articles. What any have writtten I trust they will bee ready to defend. For the present, I maintaine that by this <hi>Confession,</hi> which you call the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi> wee abjure Episcopacie. For in this <hi>Confession,</hi> wee protest that wee detest the Romane Antichrist, his worldlie Monarchie, and wicked Hierarchie. The Popish hierarchie doth consist of Bishops, Presbyters, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, that is, baptising and preaching Deacons. For it is so determined by the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> in the 4. chap. <hi>de Sacramento ordinis, Can. 6.

                  </gap>ons, whom hee calls Ministers, sayeth, that that <hi>Dionysius</hi> did not set downe the number of the Orders, but of the hierarchies. For sayth hee, there are three hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies in the militant Kirke, the first of Bishops, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of priests; the third of Deacons, and that the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons are also princes if they bee compared with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but for inferiour orders, subdeacons, acolythes, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, exorcists, and ostiaries or doore keepers, they beare


<pb facs="tcp:2611:11"/>
no rule or charge over the people, but onely serve the Deacons or the priests, For hierarchie properly is <hi>sacer principatus,</hi> a sacred preheminence or rule. The fore-na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med counterfeit writer <hi>Dionysius,</hi> calleth the <hi>Bishop,</hi> the <hi>Hierarch,</hi> because hee is the chiefe Hierarch. The <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe is not within the hierarchie, primats, Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans, or Arch-bishops, but as they are Bishops. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as some alledge, that in our <hi>Confession</hi> wee detest and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre his hierarchie, that is to bee interpret, as the rest are to be interpreted to be his, as canonization of Saints. dedicating of Kirkes, dayes, altars. &amp;c. are called his, not that there is another lawfull canonization, or dedicating of Kirkes, dayes, altars, &amp;c. Whereas some alledgde, that this hierarchie was before there was a <hi>Pope.</hi> Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that it is called his, notwithstanding, as dedicating of Kirks, dayes, altars, oyle, salt, &amp;c. are called his. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause what ever corruption was in the Kirk, either in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, worship, or government of the Kirk, since the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of iniquitie began to work. that is, Poperie began, so much as hee retained and maintained, and obtruded by his authoritie upon the Kirke are his. Next we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>Pope</hi> or Roman Antichrist not only in his growth and perfite age, but from his conception, and first birth.</p>
               <p>Farther this hierarchie is distinguished in the confession from the <hi>Popes</hi> Monarchie. Neither can it bee interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the manifold orders in the Kirke of <hi>Rome.</hi> For that is mentioned before in the <hi>Confession of faith</hi>; where, <hi>we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure his manifold orders.</hi> Next in the <hi>Confession of faith,</hi> we professe that we <hi>abhorre and detest all kinde of Papistrie in generall and particulare heads, even as they were then dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and confuted by the Word of GOD. and Kirke of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But so it is, that the office of a Bishop was condemned by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and confuted in the pulpits, by <hi>M, Lowson, M. Arburthnot. M. Pont,</hi> and many other godly and learned men. From the yeere 1575 to 1579,


<pb facs="tcp:2611:11"/>
when the heads of constant policie and plat-forme of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline were agitate in Assemblyes, it was declared, that such as had the Bishoprickes, and were called Bishops, should bee tyed to particulare flocks, that they should be called by their owne names, or the name of brethren, that they should bee content with reasonable rent, and not lift up for the maintenance of their ryotousnesse, the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Kirk, which may sustaine many Pastors, the Schooles and the poore: that they should not claime the titles of temporall Lords, that they should not usurpe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall jurisdiction, that they should not exerce temporall jurisdiction. that they must not empire above particulare elderships, nor usurpe the power of presbyteries- In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the corruptions of that estate, they abolished E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacie, after they had agreed on all the heades of the constant policie, in Aprile <hi>anno</hi> 1578 which are extant in the booke of policie, or 2 booke of discipline. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, there was a speciall act made in Iulie 1580 at <hi>Dundie</hi> with full consent of the whole Assembly against the office, as followeth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For às much as the office of a Bishop, as it is now used, and commonly taken within this Realme, hath no warrant, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor ground in the word of God, but is brought in by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of mans invention, to the great overthrow of the Kirke of God, The whole Assembly of the Kirke in one voice, after libertie given to all men to reason in the matter, non<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Pastors, till they receive</hi> de novo <hi>admission from the general Assembly, under the paine of excommunication, wherein if they bee found disobedient, or to contraveene this Act in any point, the sentence of excommunication after due admonition is to bee executed against them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Confession of faith</hi> was not authorized and subscrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till March, and the yeere following. It is cleare then, that that office is abjured in the <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was consuted by the word of God and Kirk of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> In the Assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow</hi> in April 1581 we have this Declaration in the sixth Session, Anent the act made in the assembly holden at <hi>Dundie</hi> against Bishops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some difficultie appeared to some Brethren to arise out of the word Office, contained in the said act, what should bee meant thereby, the Assembly consisting for the most part of such as voted, and were present in the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>Dundie,</hi> to take away the said difficultie. resolving u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the true meaning and understanding of the said act, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that they meant wholly to condemce the whole state of Bishops, as they are now in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the same was the determination and conclusion of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at this time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in that <hi>Confession</hi> we professe, that we joyne our selves, willingly to this true reformed Kirke, in <hi>doctrine, faith, Religion, discipline, &amp; use of the Sacraments, as livelie membere of the same in Christ our head, promising &amp; swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the great name of</hi> the LORD our GOD, <hi>that we shall continue in the obedience of the doctrine and discipline of this Kirke, &amp; shall continue in the same according to our vocation and power all the dayes of our life, under the paines contained in the Law, and danger both of body and soule in the Daye of Gods fearefull Iudgment.</hi> But so it is, that the Episcopall governement was damned and the presbyteriall rested u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon as most consonant to the word of God, &amp; to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all time comming, before the <hi>Confession of faith</hi> was


<pb facs="tcp:2611:12"/>
subscribed. And while the generall assemblies wtre about the constitution of presbyteries, the King sent with the Laird of <hi>Capringtoun</hi> to the assemblie holden at <hi>Glasgow</hi> in Aprile 1581 a plot drawne up for that purpose, together with a letter which was to bee sent to the Noble-men and Gentlemen in the bounds for furtherance of the worke, which being considered and made more perfite, some were appointed by the assembly to see presbyteries erected eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where. The <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> was subscribed by the King and his houshold in Ianuar preceeding, and injoyned in March to be subscribed by the subjects, which <hi>Confession</hi> was approved by this assembly holden in Aprile, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections were given for erection of Presbyteries. The subscription to the Confession and erection of presbyteries went forward together the same yeare. So the discipline by presbyteries was sworne to, and not by diocesian Bishops, or yet Superintendnets, which ceased in the yeere 1575. In the generall assembly holden in August 1590, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained as followeth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For as much, as it is certaine, that the word of God cannot bee kept in sinceritie, vnlesse the holy discipline bee observed, it is therefore by common consent of the whole brethren &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners present concluded, that whosoever hath borne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the ministrie within the Kirk of this realme, or present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beareth, or hereafter shall beare office therein shall be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by every particular Presbyterie where they are resident, to subscribe the heads of the discipline of the Kirk in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, at length set down &amp; allowed by act of the whole assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the botk of policie, which is registred in the register of the Kirk, &amp; namely the heads controverted by the adversaries to discipline of the reformed Kirke within this realme, betwixt and the next synodall assemblies of the Provinces under the paine of Excommunication to bee executed against the none subscribers. &amp; that the presbyteries which shall bee found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse or negligtnt heerein shall bee rebuked publickely by the


<pb facs="tcp:2611:13"/>
whole assembly, and to the end the said discipline be knowne as it ought to bee, by the whole brethren, it is ordained, that the Moderator of each Presbyterie shall receive fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the clerk of the assembly a copie of the said book under his subscription upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the expensses of the presbyterie, betwixt and the first daye of September next to come, under the paine to be accused openly in face of the whole Assembly.</hi> The same yeere 1590 the <hi>Confession of faith</hi> was again subscribed universally throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole realme. It is cleare then what policie or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline was then allowed &amp; meant in the <hi>Confession of faith.</hi> In the Parliament holden <hi>anno</hi> 1592 it was ordained, that <hi>all presentations to benefices bee directed to particular pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries in time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming with full power to give collation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, &amp; to put order to all matters and causes ecclesiasticall within their bounds, according to the discipline of the Kirke.</hi> Whensoever their was any meaning to erect that estate of Bishops, the <hi>Confession of faith</hi> was alledged in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare, as first in a dialogue writen <hi>anno</hi> 1585 by some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reverend Minister, and more at length <hi>anno</hi> 1606, when their estate was restored by Parliament; <hi>M.

               <p>In this Protestation the reverend brethren have these words following, <hi>Above all things, my Lords, beware to strive against God with an open &amp; displayed banner, by buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up againe the walls of</hi> Iericho, <hi>which the Lord hath not only cast downe, but also hath layd them under a terrible int<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Because it is of veritie, that they subscrived and swore the said Confession, containing not only the maintenance of the true doctrine, but also of the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline professed within the realme of Scotland.</hi> In the verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the points offered to bee proved in the Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they have these words in the 4. cap. <hi>But so it is, that the Bishoprie is one of the greatest errours and corruptions thereof,</hi> (that is, of the adulterous Kirke of Rome) <hi>and hath no arguments of Scripture, Fathers, Councells, nor reason, but the selfesame, that the Papists use.</hi> and in the 5 cap. we have these words. <hi>If so bee, that the setting up of Bishops will throw downe the discipline of our Kirke, or if that office hath any thing to doe with these corruptions of Papistrie and Antichristian hierarchie, the King our Soveraigne his most excellent Christian Majestie, and his Highnesse most ancient religious and noble estates of Parliament, if there were none other reaeson but this one; would not for all the world fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the danger of so horrible a perjurie against God to set up Bishops againe &amp;c. But so it is, as all men knowe, the discipline and governement of the Kirk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exercised by presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Bishops, are so farre opposed one to another, that when the one is set up, the other must downe of force. There fore the subscribers and swearers of the former Confession, if they should (as God forbid) goe about to set up Bishops and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall governement, they could not eshew the cryme of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible perjurie, execrable apostasie, and most cursed reparing of</hi> Iericho.

In the assembly holden <hi>anno</hi> 1575. complaints were made against Ministers and readers because they assembled the people to prayer and preaching upon certaine festivall dayes. An article was formed to be presented to the <hi>Regent</hi> craving, that all dayes heeretofore keeped holy in time of Papistrie, beside the Lords day, bee abolished, and a civill punishment bee inflicted upon the observers. In the assembly holden in Aprile <hi>anno</hi> 1577 it was ordained, that the visitor with the advice of the synod shall admonish Ministers and readers, that read, preach, or minister the communion at <hi>Christmasse or Easter,</hi> or such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious times to desist under the paine of deprivation. King <hi>Iames</hi> in the assembly holden <hi>anno</hi> 1590 praised God that our Kirke was sincerer that <hi>Geneva</hi> it selfe, because they observed <hi>Christmasse and Easter</hi> without warrant, which our Kirk did not. In the booke of common order before the Psalmes it is said, <hi>that the Sacramenes are no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ordaind of God to be used in private orners, as charmers and sorcerers use to doe, but left to the Congregation, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarly annexed to Gods Word, and seales of the same.</hi> In the Assembly holden at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in October, 1581 it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, <hi>that the Sacraments be not ministred in private hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but solemnely, according to the good order hitherto obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, under the paine of deposition from the function of the Ministerie.</hi> It is cleare then, that the five articles are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare to the doctrine and practise of the Kirke of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore abjured in the <hi>Confession of faith,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It followeth then, that wee have made two breaches u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the <hi>Confession.</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> for maintaining the same, for which the LORD hath threatned us with moe novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and alteration of the whole frame of our Religion. Had we not need then to renew our <hi>Covenant</hi> and promise to repare our breaches so farre as lyeth in us.</p>
               <p>As for antiquite, and other reformed Kirkes, their judgement corcerning the five articles, the writer of these late printed bookes whom you taxe, either alledge their authoritie against the same articles, or cleare their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or answere with respect. No well reformed Kirk hath received kneeling or bishoping. Some observe holy dayes, but would be ridde of them. We may safely have fellowship with such Churches, if wee communicate not with their corruptions.</p>
               <p>As for the agreement betwixt the oath and <hi>Covenant</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these things, with the 21 article in the Confessien extant in the acts of Parliament, wee can find no disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The first booke of discipline in the head of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of the Kirk, distinguisheth betwixt thinges necessarie to bee observed in everie Kirk, and things variable to bee ordered by everie particulare Congregation. There eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie particular Kirk is allowed to have a particular policie of their owne, without prejudice of the common and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and many like, there can bee no generall order set downe. That booke of discipline was penned by the same persons, who drew up the <hi>Confession.</hi> They meant never that the five articles, or the like superstitious rites and ceremonies were variable as appeareth by that which I have alreadie alledged. <hi>M. Knox</hi> who had a chiefe hand in that <hi>Confession</hi> maintained, after his first Sermon in publicke, in a convention of gray and black Friers at <hi>S. Andrewes,</hi> that the Kirke had no power to devise significant ceremonies. But these are properly called ceremonies, not politick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions for order and decencie. And the other <hi>Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which you call the <hi>negative,</hi> condemnes signes brought into the Kirk without or against the the word of God. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant ceremonies beeing condemned, the crosse and the surplice or other superstitious apparell cannot bee receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You taxe the royall Mandat, if you alledge opposition betwixt the old <hi>Confession</hi> and the other, which you call the <hi>negative,</hi> but wee call the generall with a rejection of Popish errours as an appendicle. Before I come this length, I perceive your reasons for not authorizing or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing this <hi>Confession</hi> at this time have not beene applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto by his <hi>Majestie,</hi> and the Lords of secreet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>To fill vp this last sheet, I have heere subjoyned some Acts and constitutions of our Kirke, for the sitting of ruling Elders in the generall Assemblyes, Provineiall synods, and Presbyeeries, or as they are called in the book of Policie, the Common Elderships.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN the first booke of Discipline the office and power of Elders are described, where wee have these words,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2611:16"/>
               <hi>If hee,</hi> that is, <hi>the Minister, bee worthie of admonition, they,</hi> that is, the Elders, <hi>must admonish him, or correcti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, they must correct him, and if hee bee worthie of depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they with consent of the Kirk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Superintendent, maye depose him, so that his cryme deserve so.</hi> If they might do so with the Superintendent, they may doe as much with Ministers in a Presbyterie, which is come in the rowme of Superintendents.</p>
            <p>In the assembly holden in December <hi>anno</hi> 1562 it was ordained. that the Superintendent, give sufficient advertisement to the particular Kirks of the time and place appointed for the synodall convention, that the Minister with an Elder may repare to the place appointed. Power was granted to Superintendents in their synodall conventions, to translate Ministers from one Kirk to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with consent of the most part of the Elders and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
            <p>In the assembly holden in Iune <hi>anno</hi> 1563 it was ordaind that everie Superintendent cause warne the Shyres, towns and parish Kirks within his jurisdiction to send their com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>missioners to the generall Assembly.</p>
            <p>In the assembly holden <hi>anno</hi> 1568 in Iulie, when order was set downe to bee followed in choosing Commissioners with power to vote in the generall Assembly, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainde <hi>that Ministers, and Commissioners of shyres shalbe chosen at the Synodall convention of the diocie, with consent of the rest of the Ministers and Gentlemen, that shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veene at the said synodall convention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the generall assembly holden in Februar 1609 we find registrated, that the Superintendent of <hi>Angus &amp; Merns</hi> Coomm<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ssioner at that time for the shiresdomes of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deene &amp; Bamse,</hi> had deprived the Principall. Subprinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, and some Regents in <hi>Aberdeene,</hi> with advice and consent of the Ministers, Elders and Commissioners pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, which is, alledged before in the first Chapter.</p>
            <p>In the book of policie, or second booke of discipline agre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>anno</hi> 1578 we have these conclusions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2611:17"/>In the end of the sixth chapter. <hi>There,</hi> that is, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, principall office is to hold assemblies with the Pastors and Doctors, <hi>who are also of their number for establishing of good order, and execution of discipline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 7 chapter. <hi>It is meete that some of the Elders bee chosen out of everie particular Congregation to concurre with the rest of their Brethren in the common Assembly,</hi> that is, the Presbyterie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>and to take up the delations of offences within their owne Kirks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bring them to this assembly. This wee gather out of the practise of the primitive Kirk where Elders or colledges of Seniors were constitute in Cities, and famous places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Power of election of these who beare ecclesiasticall charges pertaineth to this kinde of assembly within their owne bounds, beeing well erected and constitute of many Pastours and Elders of sufficient abilitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By the like reason, their deposition also pertaineth to this kind of Assembly, as of them that teach erronious and corrupt doctrine. that bee of slanderous life, and after admonition desist not, that bee given to schisme or rebellion against the Kirk, manifest blasphemie, symonie &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Provinciall assemblyes wee call lawfull conventions of the Pastors, Doctors and other Elders of a province, gathered for the common affaires of the Kirkes thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Nationall assembly, which is generall to us, is a lawful convention of the whole Kirkes of the realme, or nation wher it is used, or gathered for the common affaires of the Kirke &amp; maye bee called the generall Eldership of the whole Kirkes within the Realme,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the leter sent by King <hi>Iames</hi> to Noblemen and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen <hi>anno</hi> 1581 for furtherance of the erection of pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries wee have these words. <hi>It is thought impossible to attaine to any formall order likely to have continuance to the posteritie over our whole realme, while the ancient bounds of the diocies bee dissolved, where the Parishes are thick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and small be united, and where they be ever great, and of


<pb facs="tcp:2611:17"/>
larger boundes be divided, and thereafter presbyteries or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derships constitute for a dozen of parishes or thereabouts, some more, some fewer, as the commoditie of the countrie lyeth, wher the ministrie and Elders in these boundes conveening maye commodiously exerce discipline, and take order in the affaires of the Kirke, so far as shall be appointed, before the cognition bee brought to the synodall assembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the assembly holden at <hi>Sainct Andrewes</hi> in Aprile, 1582 in answere to some, concerning Elders wee have this answere. <hi>Concerning such Elders as verse not in the word their resort to the Presbyterie shall bee no farther urged stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, than the weightinesse &amp; occasion upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> intimation and adver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisement made by the Pastors and Doctors shall require, at which time they shall give their concurrence, yet such as may commodiously resort are to bee exhorted to bee present at all times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Presbyterie or eldership of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was erected upon the penult of May 1581. consisting of fifteen or sixtene Ministers of the Kirks adjacent within foure or five myles, and some Barons and Gentlemen elders out of everie Kirk for that effect. So the right of ruling Elders in presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es was put in practice at the first erection and constitution of Presbyteries, and none were constitute without them.</p>
            <p>This forme and order was a great eye-fore to <hi>M. Patrick Adamsone</hi> pretended Bishop of <hi>Saint Andrewes,</hi> as the Reader maye see in his Declaration set foorth under the Kings name, but falsely in these turbulent times <hi>anno</hi> 1584 and 1585.

<pb facs="tcp:2611:18"/>
in the Scriptures by Christ himself the Kirk and by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Paull, presbyterie or eldership, Elders that labour not in the word, but censuring manners, are called rulers and gover<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nours, to which office Gentlemen, and other qualified persons, who are not Ministers maye bee ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>led, This presbyterie conveened in the name and authoritie of the Lord Iesus, hath a spirituall power proceeding immediatly of God, and neither of Angell or man, to rule his Kirk, to reason, de liberate and conclude in matters ecclesiasticall, whose conclusions, resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deliberations, are of such sort, that what they bind or loose on earth according to Gods word, is bound or loosed likewise in the heavens, and whosoever contemneth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie thereof, should bee esteemed among the children of God, as an Ethnick or publican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The author of a learned Dialogue written likewise in these times reporteth, that the same usurping Prelate had approved this order by his owne hand writt. He protested himselfe before God afterward, when hee made his recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that hee was commanded by the Chancelour and Secretar for the time to set foorth the Declaration and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, if God spared his life to write in defence of the forme and order of the Presbyteries established.</p>
            <p>In the Assembly holden in May 1586, we have these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, 1. <hi>It is found that all such as the scripture appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth governours of the Kirke, to Wit, pastors, doctors &amp; elders may conveene to the generall assembly and vote in ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call matters, &amp; all others that have any sute, or other things to propone to the assembly maye bee there present, to give in their sutes, propone things profitable for the Kirke, vnd heare reasoning, but shall not vote. 2. There are foure ordinarie office, bearers set downe to us by the scriptures, to wit Postors Doctors, Eiders and deacons, and that the name of Bishop ought not to bee taken, as it hath beene in time of Papistrie, but is common to all Pastours and Ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the assembly holden in August 1590 it was ordained that all that did then beare, or were hereafter to beare office


<pb facs="tcp:2611:18"/>
in the ministerie subscribe the heads of discipline set down in the booke of policie, under the paine of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, speciallie to the heads controverted 2nd opposed by the adversaries to our discipline, and consequently to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of presbyteries consisting of Ministers, and ruling Elders.</p>
            <p>I wonder that any should doubt of the meaning and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of our Kirk, seeing they are not ignorant that Elders have place in sessions. or elderships of particular Kirks, &amp; in generall assemblyes, the lowest and the highest judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but that that they should likewise have place in presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and provinciall Synods, seing presbyteries are made up by the particular elderships, and provinciall Synods by presbyteries. One minister maye governe like a Pope his parish without Elders, if fifteene or sixteene ministers may governe fifteene or sixteene parishes without them.</p>
            <p>The affaires of the Kirke, and matters of Religion are a common cause, which Ministers ought not to engrosse to themselves.</p>
            <p>Our Elders have not sit in prebyteries these many yeeres, not by law annulling or abrogating the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, but partly through their owne negligence, partly through the pride, or ill conscience of some ministers in some part, so that is fared with us, as with the Kirke of old, of which <hi>Ambrose</hi> complaineth writing on. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</p>
