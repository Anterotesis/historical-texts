         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ACcording to your Deſire, I have here ſent you that full <hi>Narrative</hi> of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Affairs, which may be of ſome little Satisfaction to your Self and your Friends: The Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Kingdom being (I doubt not) the preſent Subject of all Mens Inquiry amongſt you: What has happened in <hi>Munſter,</hi> is not conſiderable enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the trouble of recounting; they never having an opportunity to make any conſiderable Body: But the <hi>North</hi> has preſented many a fair opportunity to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> to have made themſelves Famous, and their Country Happy; if either Degeneracy of Spirit in the Commonalty (occaſion'd by long Eaſe, Plenty, and Luxury) or the baſe Villany of ſome of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders (who preferr'd the <hi>French Gold</hi> before heroick Virtue) had not render'd them unwilling, or incapable of acquitting themſelves according to Honour and Duty. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces, a little before the late King Landed, had advanced <hi>Northwards,</hi> as far as <hi>Monaghan</hi> without any reſiſtadce, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thinking (and diſcreetly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) it would be ſufficient to defend their own <hi>Pale</hi> from the Encroachments of the Enemy. About the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>March</hi> they began to look farther, and ſent out ſome Detachments of Horſe and Foot into the County of <hi>Ardmagh;</hi> and hearing that the Lady <hi>Blany</hi> was arrived at <hi>Glaſcough,</hi> a handſome Town about 7 Miles from <hi>Monaghan,</hi> they reſolved to ſtop her Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <hi>Northwards,</hi> and accordingly ſend a party of Seven Hundred Horſe and Foot to <hi>Glaſcough,</hi> to ſecure her The <hi>Protestants</hi> had together in the Town near One Hundred and Fifty, and notwithſtanding the number of the Enemy, reſolved to defend the Lady and the Town; and being bravely led on by one Mr. <hi>Matthew Ankthill,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Richardſon</hi>'s Eldeſt Son, they made a Gallant Sally upon the Enemy; who not being able to endure the firſt Shock, preſently Diſperſe and Fly; a good number of Horſe and Foot getting up to a ſmall Fort, near a Mile from the Town, thought there to Intrench and Secure themſelves; but Capt. <hi>Ankthill</hi> and <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſo well purſued them, that notwithſtanding the diſadvantage of riding up a ſteep Hill, they ſoon made them quit their Hold, killing about Fourſcore, taking as many, or more Priſoners, and chaſing the reſt. In this Encounter we loſt only One, which was that worthy Gentleman, Capt. <hi>Ankthill;</hi> who, after the Rout, coming ſoftly down the Hill, a Villain lurking behind a Buſh ſaw him, and taking aim, Shot him down with a Musket. Of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were Slain, <hi>John Macken<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>

            <p>For now inſtead of Uniting the Forces, which amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to near Ten Thouſand Strong; <hi>Lundy,</hi> upon ſeveral ſrivolous Pretences, diſperſes them at ſuch diſtance from one another, that we ſeldom had 150 in a Body; or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body of the like Number, within 8 or 10 Miles; ſo that the Enemy, with very little Moleſtation, had Free Paſſage up as high as <hi>Clawdy-ford,</hi> within 15 Miles of <hi>Derry;</hi> and now by this time, the Country crying Shame on theſe ſtrange Dealings of <hi>Lundy,</hi> and others, with much ado, Muſter about 7 Thouſand Men together, with all the ſeeming Vigour imaginable, to Guard that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and difficult Paſs. Collonel <hi>Shelton</hi> commanded the Enemies Party in Perſon, and traverſing with his Men near the other ſide of the River, which was deep and ſtrong, he ſuddenly, with his Horſe, upon a ſign (as is credibly reported) from <hi>Lundy,</hi> incouraging his Men, leaps boldly into the River, and <hi>Lundy</hi> and another Great Officer, as haſtily drawing off our Men, not in the leaſt deſigning (as it ſeems) to make any Oppoſition; the Enemy without one ſtronke, gained that important Paſs, and purſuing our Foot deſtroy them for many Miles, and march directly to the very Gates, as it were, of <hi>Lonnon-derry.</hi> And now the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were too late ſenſible of the Juſt Suſpitions they had entertain'd of <hi>Lundy</hi> and Others, and accordingly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to take him to Account; but he knowing what he had deſerved, privately got off, and we hear ſince, is taken in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ Nevertheleſs, this Unfortunate Miſcarriage has ſince been repaired; for ſince their choice of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> for their Governour, they have behaved themſelves with that Courage and Conduct, as has ſignaliz'd a Reſolution in them as Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as their Cauſe: Their Sallies upon the Enemy, and their Succeſs thereupon, having ſufficiently animated them to that Vigorous Reſiſtance; that when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Succours ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, and enable them to take the Field, I hope to be able to give you that Account of their Valiant Performanc, as may with God's Providence, give new Life to the preſent drooping Face of the Proteſtant Affairs in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Admiral <hi>Herbert,</hi> in the mean time was cruiſing about our Coaſt, to prevent Succours and Aſſiſtance from <hi>France,</hi> and coming near <hi>Cork,</hi> he lights on a <hi>French</hi> Caper, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Ammunition into the Harbour, which he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reſiſtance ſeizes; and going in, the Marriners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery another lying at Anchor, and not being able to make up ſo high with his Ships, he Mans a couple of Long-Boats, in the dusk of the Evening, and being arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with good Firelocks, and Curt-laces; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe had 3 Guns on each ſide, they bravely Attacque, Board her, and bring her off; and we have ſince an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a deſperate Engagement with the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, which not doubting, with all particulars, is come to your Ear, by the more Expeditious Conveyance of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes on that Account to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> I ſhall omit the preſent needleſs Relation of; which being all at preſent, 'till farther News Occurs, <hi>Farewel.</hi>
