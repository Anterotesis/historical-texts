            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Reformed Catholique: OR, The True Protestant.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Paper should have come into the World under the form of a Letter (as most Pamphlets of quality do of late) if the Author had not made a Conscience of covering the Simplicity of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose under any sort of Disguise; so that without so much as a single <hi>How do ye</hi> to usher it in, he comes point blank to the Business in the very Title. It may be look'd upon, I know, as a thing of <hi>Ill Omen,</hi> to begin with an <hi>Alias</hi>: But there's neither <hi>Priest</hi> nor <hi>Highway-man</hi> in our Case; and yet there may be cause enough perhaps for a kind of <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> too; for 'tis a matter of great moment that every man should both <hi>go,</hi> and be <hi>known</hi> by his right Name; and (peradventure) never more necessary than in this juncture, and in this particular: And so to my Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Reformed Catholique</hi> (properly so called) <hi>is an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Christian,</hi> or <hi>a Son of the Church of</hi> England: <hi>A true


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64331:3"/>
Protestant may</hi> be so too; nay, and many times he <hi>is</hi> so; and many a <hi>Loyal, Orthodox, Reformed Catholique calls</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so; and (according to the stile of the Age) he may be well enough <hi>said</hi> and <hi>accounted</hi> so to <hi>be.</hi> But all this is only by <hi>Adoption,</hi> and without any colour for it in the Original of his <hi>Denomination.</hi> Now a <hi>Protestant,</hi> in strictness of speaking, is a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> which this Church does not in all points pretend to be, and then the <hi>Characteristical Note</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> is <hi>Catholique</hi>; so that the <hi>Appellation</hi> is too narrow for the <hi>Principle,</hi> and draws on the very same Implication in a <hi>Protestant-Catholique,</hi> which we make sport with in a <hi>Roman-Catholique,</hi> that is to say, the Soloecism of a <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Vniversality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is enough already (I suppose) to furnish an Extract of as much Popery out of it, as may recommend some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Informer to a Mornings-draught; for we have a sort of people now a days, that will read a mans Heart through his Ribs, though they can hardly see his Nose on's Face; and that give more Credit to their Ears than to their Eyes. Now to ease the Reader in two or three peevish Points, if he should chance to be <hi>Over-critical</hi> and <hi>Imperious,</hi> I will tell him before-hand, in a few words, what he is to trust to.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>first Question</hi> or <hi>Objection</hi> fairly supposed; the Author is no <hi>Disguised</hi> or <hi>Concealed Papist,</hi> but of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> train'd up in the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way of it, and standing firm to it against all sorts of Provocation, Discouragement, Temptation, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and without warping to the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> either on the <hi>right hand</hi> or on the <hi>left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Second:</hi> He is not set on to write this Discourse, either directly or indirectly, by any Hint, Desire, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment whatsoever; nor by any other Motive than the sense of what he owes to the Publique, and to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the Consideration of some small Present from


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64331:3"/>
the Book-seller, if there be any thing got by't. (A piece of <hi>Good Husbandry</hi> that he has learnt of his <hi>Superiors</hi>) He has no design upon any <hi>Place at Court</hi> in't, nor upon any <hi>Church-Lease</hi>; no not so much as a Reversion: And all this is True, by the Faith of a Poor Gentleman, that has worn his Doublet out at the Elbows in his Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. It might be added, that he's grown Old and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and that even Malice it self were lost upon him. Now under these Circumstances, I hope he may securely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to tell you a little more of his mind.</p>
            <p>So far as <hi>Catholique</hi> and <hi>Protestant</hi> serve only as two <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Names,</hi> intending the <hi>self-same thing,</hi> (though the one by <hi>Propriety,</hi> and the other but by <hi>Translation</hi>) is is all one to me whether of the two any man calls me; all the danger is, the countenancing of an Ill Thing under a Good Name.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Protestancy</hi> falls under a <hi>double acceptation</hi>; the <hi>one,</hi> as it denotes the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi>; the <hi>other,</hi> as it is taken for <hi>the Genus Generalissimum of all Dissenters from the Church of Rome.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> I do heartily embrace, as transmitted to us from our Fore-fathers, and Signed by the Blood of Martyrs; Authoriz'd by the Holy Gospel, and by the Law of the Land; the common Bond of our Civil Peace, and (by Gods Blessing) the Hopes and Means of our Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>Now to the <hi>latter Acceptation,</hi> I am not at all satisfi'd with it, and I have both <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> to warrant me in that dislike. As to my <hi>Reason</hi>; First, It is an <hi>Agreement</hi> upon an <hi>Opposition</hi>; and next, it is an <hi>Agreement of several Parties disagreeing among themselves,</hi> which carries the face rather of a <hi>Confederacy,</hi> than a <hi>Religion</hi>: For it is not the <hi>Opposing</hi> of <hi>Error,</hi> but the asserting of a <hi>Truth,</hi> that must do the work. <hi>One Error</hi> may be <hi>opposed</hi> by <hi>another,</hi> even in a Single Person; as one man Robs his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and a third Robs <hi>him.</hi> Here's <hi>one Injustice opposed by another</hi>: So


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64331:4"/>
that as it is an <hi>Agreement</hi> in <hi>Opposition,</hi> 'tis a hundred to one there will be <hi>Error</hi> in't: But the <hi>Opposers</hi> themselves being <hi>subdivided,</hi> 'tis impossible it should be <hi>Right</hi>; for the very <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> are here wanting; that is to say, <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Vnity.</hi> And for the Proof of this, beyond all Contradiction; let but any man look back into the late Troubles, and see, when the Factions had destroy'd the King and the <hi>Church</hi> (which they call'd the <hi>Common Enemy</hi>) how they fell presently to the Worrying of one another; when the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptists, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Seekers, Ranters, Antinomians,</hi> and twenty other wild sorts of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> under the title of <hi>Protestants,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of opposing <hi>Popery,</hi> destroy'd the very Cause they <hi>Covenanted</hi> to assert; a <hi>Protestant-Church,</hi> a <hi>Protestant-Prince,</hi> and a <hi>Protestant-People,</hi> fill'd the Land with <hi>Confusion, Sacrilege,</hi> and <hi>Heresie</hi>; made the <hi>English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> a Reproach and a Scandal to the <hi>Christian World:</hi> And so soon as they had possess'd themselves of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Revenue</hi> of the Kingdom, every mans hand was against his Brother for the <hi>Booty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed now to the matter of <hi>Experience</hi>: I would fain see any one Instance from the very <hi>Reformation it self,</hi> to <hi>this day,</hi> when ever there was a Clamour advanc'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Point, of a <hi>Conjunct Opposition</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was not struck at in the <hi>Confederacy</hi>; and that too, not by blind <hi>Inferences</hi> and tacit <hi>Presumption,</hi> but by <hi>Ouvert acts,</hi> and a Notoriety of <hi>Practice:</hi> That is to say, the Men that stickled under this Notion, did posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively declare the <hi>Government</hi> by <hi>Bishops,</hi> to be <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>; and the <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Common Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to be <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi>; yes, and the <hi>Civil Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration it self</hi> also to be down-right <hi>Tyranny.</hi> They did just like the Fellows in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> that Stole <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Plate,</hi> under the pretence of Searching for <hi>Priests</hi>; and for the Credit of the Exploit, they Rob'd in <hi>Red


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64331:4"/>
Coats</hi> too, that they might the better pass for some of his <hi>Majesties Guards.</hi> The Similitude runs upon All Four, for it was the very case of our <hi>pretended Protestants</hi>; under colour of hunting for <hi>Priests,</hi> they seized <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Plate,</hi> and committed <hi>Robberies</hi> in the very <hi>Livery</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This they did in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the <hi>Queen Regent,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>; and in <hi>England,</hi> under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; and twice in <hi>Scotland</hi> again, under the <hi>late King</hi>; and after that, in <hi>England</hi>: Two actual Rebellions more in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under <hi>this present King,</hi> and now God Bless us from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>at Home</hi>; and all this from that sort of People that stil'd themselves <hi>Protestants.</hi> The <hi>Principles,</hi> the <hi>Methods,</hi> and the <hi>Pretences</hi> the very same, from one end to the other.</p>
            <p>The Story of these <hi>Phanatical Conspiracies</hi> is almost as Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous as the thing it self is Detestable; only this last in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> methinks seems to Crown the Infamy of all the rest: For a <hi>Party</hi> that calls it self <hi>Protestant</hi>; a <hi>Party in full Cry</hi> upon the <hi>scent</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi>; a <hi>Popish Plot</hi> upon <hi>Oath</hi> too, at the same time upon the Life of the <hi>King,</hi> upon our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and <hi>Government</hi>; and that <hi>Plot,</hi> at that instant, under a strict Examination; <hi>the same Party</hi> at the <hi>same time</hi> also pressing for Justice upon the Conspirators, nay, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the remissness of the Prosecution, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the most exemplary Rigor in the Case that ever was known in this Nation: For <hi>this Party,</hi> (I say) under these Circumstances, to flie in the face of the Government, let the World judge if ever there was a more Consummated piece of Wickedness. They raise a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and make <hi>Religion</hi> the <hi>Ground</hi> of it; they declare a <hi>War</hi> against the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> and yet write themselves <hi>Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> and <hi>Protestants.</hi> They cry out of the Danger of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and yet in the same breath, <hi>draw their Swords upon their Prince, in the very attempt of Crushing it</hi>; and all these


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64331:5"/>
Aggravations complicated in one act. Is it not high time then, after an Imposture that has cost this Nation so dear, to learn at last to distinguish betwixt a <hi>Religion</hi> and a <hi>Faction?</hi> Betwixt what men <hi>are,</hi> and what they <hi>call</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? Is a <hi>Renegado</hi> ever the less a <hi>Turk</hi> for putting out <hi>English Colours?</hi> Are the <hi>Blessed Spirits</hi> ever the less <hi>Pure,</hi> for the <hi>Devils</hi> transforming himself into an <hi>Angel of Light?</hi> Is the <hi>Kings Broad Seal</hi> one jot the less Valuable for being <hi>Counterfeited?</hi> So neither is our <hi>Profession.</hi> And he that dishonours <hi>Religion,</hi> or invades <hi>Authority</hi> under the Name of a <hi>Protestant,</hi> is no more to any sober man, than a <hi>Goth</hi> or a <hi>Vandal. Judas</hi> his <hi>Betraying</hi> of his Master was a most ungrateful and abominable Sin, but the doing of it with a <hi>Kiss,</hi> made it by many degrees the more execrable: And it was the height of the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi> Affliction, the Circumstance of a <hi>Familiar Friend.</hi> Where's the harm now of saying, <hi>Have a care of False Protestants?</hi> The <hi>Author and the Finisher of our Faith,</hi> is (I hope) of Authority suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to justifie that Caution. Does not our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself tell us that <hi>there shall arise False Christs and</hi> False Prophets? and why not <hi>False Protestants?</hi> And does he not bid us <hi>take heed that no man deceive us; for many</hi> (says he) <hi>shall come in my Name, saying I am</hi> Christ, <hi>and shall deceive many?</hi> Does he not bid us <hi>beware of</hi> Woolves <hi>in</hi> Sheeps Cloathing?

            <p>We have it upon the Credit of Dr. <hi>Tong</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> that the Sedition of 1641. was totally contriv'd and carry'd on by <hi>Popish Counsels</hi>; and that not only the <hi>Conventicles</hi> in that Bloody Revolution, but all our <hi>Separate Meetings</hi> to this day, and particularly the <hi>Scottish Commotions</hi> were and are Influenc'd by <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuites,</hi> under the Masque of Professors of those several Persuasions. Have we not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then to use all possible Circumspection, that we may not be impos'd upon by such as these for <hi>Protestants?</hi> No

man has a greater Veneration for the memory of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants that suffer'd Martyrdom for their <hi>Faith</hi>; no man a greater <hi>Horrour</hi> for the <hi>Irish,</hi> the <hi>Parisian,</hi> and several other <hi>Massacres</hi>; no man a higher Esteem, or a more Ardent affection for <hi>Protestancy</hi> it self, (so far as the Profession of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is intended by it) than I have. But for those Turbulent Spirits that lay about them as if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were to be taken by <hi>actual Violence,</hi> whose Zeal out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strips Christianity it self, imposing upon the World their own corrupt and impetuous passions, instead of the Healing and Pacifique Motions of the Holy Ghost: These are a dangerous sort of People, and their ways are not only a Contradiction to the undeniable Principles of our <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but to the common Interests of <hi>Mankind,</hi> as well <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals</hi> as <hi>Communities:</hi> For if it be true, that <hi>Charity</hi> is the great Lesson of the Gospel: If it be true, that <hi>Vnity</hi> in <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Vnanimity</hi> in the things of <hi>Civil Government,</hi> would make up the most perfected Blessing that reasonable Nature is capable of in this Tabernacle of Flesh; then must it necessarily follow, that the nearer we approach to <hi>that Agreement,</hi> the <hi>better Christians</hi> we are, and the <hi>happier Men</hi>; and the further we depart <hi>from it,</hi> the more <hi>Wicked</hi> and the more <hi>Miserable</hi> we are. This is either true or false: If the former, there's no Treason in't; if the latter, we may burn our Bibles.</p>
            <p>Before I wade any further into this Controversie, it may do well, I think, to give some Reason, why upon <hi>this Subject,</hi> and at <hi>this Time</hi>; that the World may not take that for the Leaven of an Unquiet Humour, which in great truth, is only an act of Conscience in the discharge of a sober and a seasonable duty to my Prince and Country.</p>
            <p>To the undertaking of this Office, I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by the Audacious Liberties of the Press, in


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64331:6"/>
the matter of Religion and Government, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to possess the Multitude with False and Pernicious Principles and Opinions, and by Artificial Hints and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals to dispose them (now toward the meeting of this next Parliament) to a Partial and a Factious Choice: So that my Business is only to encounter and lay open the Vanity and Weakness of those Libels, and without confining my self to any one in particular, to sum up the Malice of them all, for so much as concerns our present purpose, and to submit my self to the Reader in a fair and short Reply.</p>
            <p>It is a Note worthy of Consideration, that all the Papers here in question, (even to a single Sheet) are the Work of Men exceedingly Byass'd against the <hi>Establish'd Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as <hi>Republicans, Anabaptists,</hi> and other sorts of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi>; for the Publishers of these Papers are known every one of them, and most of the Authors. Now what advice toward the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of the Government, these People are likely to give, who are United in common Principles of <hi>Defaming, Discomposing,</hi> and even of <hi>Dissolving</hi> it, let Heaven and Earth be the Judges: And what work such a House of Commons would make, as these forward Undertakers would have, if they were to direct and influence the Election.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>these</hi> be the <hi>Counsellors,</hi> let us see next if the <hi>Matter</hi> of their <hi>Writings</hi> be not answerable to the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Men</hi>; and if it be not most evident that it is their very scope and design (so far from endeavouring the Peace and Settlement of the Nation) to poison the People with <hi>Seditious Maxims</hi>; to create <hi>Jealousies</hi> betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and to Undermine the very Foundation of the Government.</p>
            <p>They support themselves with the Multitude, upon two <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Popular pretensions, Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty: What Religion,</hi> or <hi>what Liberty,</hi> they do not say; but only fill the Peoples heads with a confused Notion of things,


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64331:6"/>
and wild apprehensions of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi>: And then their next work is under colour of stating the <hi>Privileges</hi> of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> to Erect <hi>Seditious Positions</hi>; and after all, to prescribe Remedies infinitely worse than the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease: We shall now make it appear that the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> they talk of, leads to all sorts of <hi>Impiety</hi>; and that their pretended <hi>Liberty</hi> is the ready way to <hi>Slavery. First,</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what concerns <hi>Religion,</hi> they do all of them sing the same Song in their <hi>Quaeries</hi> and <hi>Proposals</hi> to the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders</hi> and <hi>Electors</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and unanimously agree in the same method of Advice to the People, how they are to govern themselves in their next Choice.</p>
            <p>Their first Caution is, <hi>To pursue the Discovery and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the</hi> Plot, (<hi>the</hi> Trojan Horse <hi>with an Army in the Belly of it.) To secure us from</hi> Popery; <hi>and that no</hi> Papist <hi>may be allowed to dwell in the Land; Nor any man chosen into the</hi> House, <hi>that shall dare to open his mouth for a</hi> Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor: And all this attended with a Dreadful Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Massacres, Fires, Treasons,</hi> and <hi>Devastations</hi> that have been wrought by the <hi>Popish Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this first Point, the <hi>Replicant</hi> most willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes, so far as stand<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with <hi>Christian Charity,</hi> and <hi>the Law of the Land:</hi> But then he cannot forget on the other hand, that the <hi>Counterfeit Protestant Horse</hi> of 1641. <hi>had an Army in the Belly of him,</hi> as well as the <hi>Trojan</hi>; and he that would be safe, must look both ways at once.</p>
            <p>Another Caution is, not to choose any man that is <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly affected</hi>; or (as another hath it) <hi>Ill affected.</hi> But a third proceeds a little more warily, and recommends the chusing only of <hi>Sincere Protestants,</hi> and not <hi>Disguised Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who are ready to pull off their Masque, when time serves, and may be known by their</hi> Laughing at the <hi>Plot,</hi> Disgracing the Evidence, Admiring the Traytors Constancy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64331:7"/>This same <hi>Popishly</hi> and <hi>Ill affected,</hi> lies open to several Exc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ptions; for one Man is made Judge of the Thoughts of another, which is only the Prerogative of Almighty God. I have heard of a man that was Indicted for <hi>Whistling</hi>; but never, till now, of any Man that was Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated to serve in the House of Commons, for <hi>Thinking.</hi> Beside the Unreasonable Latitude, and the Horrible Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Judgment; for if this be admitted, no man living can be secure: It involves the Innocent with the Guilty, and puts a man out of all possibility to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And then forward; It is but turning the <hi>Tables,</hi> and the <hi>Blot</hi> is hit on the <hi>other side:</hi> For why should not I be as well allow'd to pronounce <hi>another man a Disguised Protestant,</hi> as he to judge <hi>me a Disguised Papist,</hi> and the same Liberty of Marking him too? You shall know him by his <hi>Shiboleth</hi>; for the <hi>Old Covenaent</hi> sticks in his Teeth still, and the whole mystery of his Profession is wrapt up in that <hi>Oracle</hi> of the <hi>Privileges of Parliament; the Kings Just Power and Greatness; the Protestant Religion against Popery, and Popish Innovations</hi>; the first point being wholly <hi>Incomprehensible,</hi> and the other two, like <hi>Jugglers Knots,</hi> fast or loose at pleasure.</p>
            <p>This equal Freedom being granted on all sides, takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all Faith, Confidence, and Correspondence in Humane Society. I know no difference in the World betwixt <hi>one mans Infallibility</hi> and <hi>anothers</hi>; nor any (but in <hi>Terms</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a <hi>Private mans Infallible Light,</hi> and the <hi>Popes Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sentence:</hi> Nor is there any one Usurpation in <hi>Popery,</hi> that is either <hi>Grievous</hi> to the <hi>Conscience,</hi> or <hi>Dangerous</hi> to the <hi>Government</hi>; but a man may shew very near an <hi>Equivalent</hi> of it in <hi>Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Marks of distinction betwixt a <hi>Sincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> and a <hi>Disguised Papist</hi>; the Immorality of <hi>Laughing at the Plot,</hi> savours more in my opinion, of an <hi>Vnmannerly Fool,</hi> then of a <hi>Disguised Papist</hi>; though for my own part, I


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64331:7"/>
am so far from <hi>Laughing at it,</hi> that it wounds my soul, the very thought on't. <hi>Disgracing of the Evidence</hi> were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indeed; but to make a man a <hi>Papist</hi> for <hi>admiring the Traytors Constancy,</hi> that, methinks is very hard, and not answerable to what one would expect from an Advocate for Liberty of Conscience. It is much easier to relinquish an <hi>Opinion,</hi> then for a man to devest himself of <hi>Natural Affections</hi>; and more unreasonable to <hi>claim</hi> a freedom in the <hi>one,</hi> than to <hi>refuse</hi> it in the <hi>other.</hi> I must confess, <hi>I do admire that Constancy,</hi> and if I were to dye for so doing, I could not but <hi>admire</hi> it still: And these Impressions are Humane, and not to be resisted.</p>
            <p>We fall now into the Old Track of the whole Party: They call for <hi>Toleration</hi>; complain of <hi>Persecution</hi>; cast all their Sufferings upon their <hi>Worshipping according to their Consciences</hi>; and then this Lamentable Condition of theirs must be <hi>Remonstrated to the whole Nation.</hi> Of these four Points in order.</p>
            <p>In the handling of their <hi>Plea</hi> for <hi>Protestant Dissenters,</hi> there are many things to be taken into Consideration. <hi>First,</hi> Is it in matters of <hi>Conscience,</hi> or only of <hi>Phansie,</hi> wherein they desire to be <hi>Indulg'd?</hi> If the <hi>latter,</hi> the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of a <hi>Law</hi> is certainly of much greater concern, than the gratifying of a <hi>Caprice.</hi> Now on the <hi>other</hi> side, if they demand it upon an Exigent of <hi>Conscience: First,</hi> why <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> for <hi>Dissenters?</hi> When <hi>one</hi> man cannot honestly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for <hi>another mans Conscience:</hi> Besides that (<hi>Secondly</hi>) They ask an <hi>Indulgence</hi> for <hi>several Parties,</hi> of <hi>divided Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> and <hi>Opinions:</hi> And in short, <hi>they</hi> would have the Magistrate favour <hi>all the Consciences,</hi> that will not endure <hi>one anothers. Again</hi>; They should do well to explain what they mean by <hi>Protestant Dissenters,</hi> upon points of <hi>Conscience</hi>; whether <hi>all</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> or only <hi>such and such Parties:</hi> If <hi>all</hi> in <hi>general, Heathens</hi> must be Tolerated as well as <hi>Christians,</hi> for <hi>they</hi> have <hi>Consciences</hi> as well as <hi>we</hi>:


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64331:8"/>
Or if it be restrain'd to <hi>Christianity,</hi> it opens a door to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,</hi> more detestable then <hi>Paganism it self.</hi> So that <hi>an Vniversal Toleration</hi> is utterly <hi>Vnlawful</hi>; and a <hi>Partial Toleration</hi> on the other hand, is as <hi>Ineffectual</hi>; for upon a Plea of <hi>Conscience</hi> they may <hi>all claim alike:</hi> So that it is an <hi>Act of Vniformity</hi> still, to those that are <hi>Excluded</hi>; and it is not fair, in the Government, to <hi>favour one half,</hi> and <hi>exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate another,</hi> where <hi>all</hi> may as well be taken in, as <hi>any.</hi> Beside, upon the supposal of a <hi>Limited Toleration,</hi> who shall judge which are fit to be admitted, and which not? If the <hi>People,</hi> every man justifies himself, and then we are upon an <hi>Vniversal Toleration</hi> again. They tell us stories of <hi>sound Faith, good Life,</hi> and of distinguishing betwixt <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi> and <hi>not Fundamentals</hi>; which is only treading of the same Ring still; for it may be <hi>every bodies Plea</hi> as well as <hi>any mans:</hi> That which the <hi>Magistrate</hi> judges <hi>one way,</hi> the People shall determine another; <hi>and one mans Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truth</hi> shall be <hi>anothers Fundamental Error,</hi> which will introduce as many <hi>Religions</hi> as <hi>Phansies</hi>; bring <hi>Factions</hi> into <hi>Families</hi> as well as into <hi>Governments,</hi> and make the People both <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Judges:</hi> And it is not to say that the <hi>Word of God shall be the judge,</hi> for that's only a <hi>Rule</hi> by which we are to judge; and by <hi>Erroneous judgments</hi> it is made the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>Heresies; For when every man may make his</hi> own Creed, <hi>there's nothing so Impious, but he'l shew you a</hi> Text <hi>for't.</hi> Moreover, the very <hi>Pretence</hi> of <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> is <hi>frivolous</hi>; for <hi>Conscience</hi> is out of the reach of <hi>Humane Power</hi>; and the <hi>freedom</hi> of <hi>Thought, no Law</hi> can either <hi>punish</hi> or <hi>take away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Acting,</hi> as well as of <hi>Thinking,</hi> that they insist upon, which upon the whole matter, is neither more nor less than a <hi>Licence to do what they please.</hi> The <hi>League</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> under <hi>Maximilian</hi>; the <hi>Holy League</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. of <hi>France; Muncer</hi>'s <hi>Outrages</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>; the <hi>Murtherers</hi> of <hi>Henry the</hi> 4th. and the <hi>P. of Orange</hi>; and

all the Villanies of the late times here at home, were acted under the <hi>Masque</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> It is not for the restraining of <hi>Opinions</hi> that <hi>Laws</hi> are provided; but for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Ouvert Deeds</hi> of <hi>Violence,</hi> and they are any punish'd for <hi>Action,</hi> not for <hi>Conscience.</hi> Neither have we any means of distinguishing betwixt <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> if every mans word shall be taken for <hi>his own Conscience</hi>; and then it is a dangerous way of dividing a Kingdom against it self.</p>
            <p>Take notice all this while, that they urge a <hi>Toleration,</hi> no body knows for <hi>whom,</hi> or for <hi>what.</hi> Where are their <hi>Articles?</hi> where is the <hi>Model</hi> of their <hi>Accommodation</hi>? or how is it <hi>possible</hi> to contrive any <hi>Common Expedient</hi> to <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie</hi> them? For nothing less than a <hi>total Liberty of doing what they list,</hi> will please them, which must inevitably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the <hi>Government.</hi> If they would have the <hi>wilder</hi> and more <hi>extravagant Sects excluded,</hi> why do they plead for <hi>All</hi> in general, and not rather <hi>particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise</hi> the <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Parties</hi> that they would have <hi>Indulg'd?</hi> But they dare not do <hi>this,</hi> for fear of disobliging the <hi>rest,</hi> their business being to <hi>Vnite all Factions</hi> in the <hi>Quarrel</hi>; when yet you may as soon bring <hi>Heaven and Hell together,</hi> as reconcile them in <hi>Religion</hi>; so that either they ask an <hi>Impious thing,</hi> in the <hi>allowance</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> or an <hi>Impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing</hi> in propounding any <hi>Limitation,</hi> upon a <hi>Plea</hi> of <hi>Conscience.</hi> But the truth is no more than this: They ask a thing which can neither be <hi>granted,</hi> nor so much as <hi>understood</hi>; and the People are transported with the sound of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> to the desire of things wholly <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent</hi> with either <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We should do well to take notice, that against <hi>this Plea,</hi> for <hi>Liberty,</hi> there is on the <hi>one side,</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of a <hi>Law,</hi> and the solemn <hi>judgment</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for the <hi>Equity</hi> of it; and on the <hi>other,</hi> the Kings <hi>Personal</hi> and <hi>Political Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> for the <hi>Execution</hi> of it.

an <hi>Invasion</hi> of <hi>this Law,</hi> may as well <hi>Invalidate all the rest.</hi> Now the <hi>Counterpoize</hi> to all this weight, is (at best) only the <hi>naked Conscience</hi> of some <hi>private Persons.</hi> The <hi>Peoples Consciences</hi> call for <hi>Liberty</hi>; and the <hi>Governors Conscience</hi> requires <hi>Order: Their Consciences</hi> will not down with <hi>this Law,</hi> nor <hi>this Law</hi> with <hi>such Consciences: Which</hi> of the <hi>two</hi> now shall <hi>yield</hi> to the <hi>other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what <hi>benefit</hi> might we now expect from this <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> here, if it were <hi>granted?</hi> Or rather, in the <hi>first</hi> place, what colour of <hi>Conscience,</hi> or of <hi>Reason</hi> is there in the very <hi>demand it self</hi> (all the aforesaid Exceptions over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove).

               <hi>It is much (says the</hi> London Ministers <hi>Letter to the</hi> Assembly,) <hi>Jan.</hi> 1.45. <hi>that our Brethren should</hi> separate <hi>from the Church, but that they should endeavour to get a</hi> Warrant <hi>to</hi> Authorize <hi>their</hi> Separation <hi>from it; and to have Liberty (by drawing Members out of it) to weaken and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it, till (so far as lies in them) they have brought it to nothing. This we think to be plainly Unlawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then the</hi> Harmony <hi>of the</hi> Lancashire Ministers, <hi>p.</hi> 12. Toleration <hi>would be the putting the Sword in a Mad mans hand; a Proclaiming</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <hi>to the</hi> Wolves, <hi>to come into</hi> Christs Flock <hi>to prey upon his</hi> Lambs.</p>
            <p>Toleration <hi>makes the Scripture a</hi> Nose <hi>of Wax; a Rule of</hi> Faith <hi>to</hi> all Religions. And this is the <hi>great Rabby</hi> of the <hi>Party.</hi> Rutherfords free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Disp. <hi>p.</hi> 360.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64331:10"/>Liberty <hi>of</hi> Conscience, <hi>and</hi> Toleration <hi>of</hi> all, <hi>or</hi> any Religion, <hi>is so Prodigious an</hi> Impiety, <hi>that this Religious Parliament cannot but abhor the very</hi> naming <hi>of it.</hi> Bailey's Disswasive Epist. Ded. 1645.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is unreasonable (says the Defender of the</hi> London Ministers <hi>Letter to the</hi> Assembly, Anti-toleration, <hi>p.</hi> 16.) <hi>that</hi> Independents <hi>should</hi> desire that Toleration <hi>of</hi> Presbyters, <hi>which they would not</hi> give <hi>to</hi> Presbyters.</p>
            <p>Let it be observed from hence, that these people do first <hi>demand of the Government that Liberty</hi> which they <hi>deny</hi> to <hi>one another.</hi> And <hi>Secondly:</hi> That they pretend to do it upon <hi>Conscience,</hi> and yet hold the thing it self to be <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Vnlawful</hi>; so that they <hi>justifie</hi> the <hi>Conscience</hi> of <hi>our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> by the <hi>Conscience</hi> of <hi>their refusing</hi> it to <hi>others.</hi> And the only way to evade this, is to discover all; by confessing, that though they now beg a <hi>Toleration</hi> from the <hi>Government,</hi> yet if they get power in their hands, they'l make a <hi>Conscience</hi> again (as they did before) of <hi>allowing</hi> any <hi>freedom</hi> to the <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a clear case, that their <hi>demands</hi> are <hi>Vnwarrantable, Impracticable, Vnreasonable,</hi> and not grounded upon <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> but directly in <hi>Opposition</hi> to it; as we have it under their own hands.</p>
            <p>Let us try now if we can discover what the design <hi>is,</hi> since it appears manifestly what it is <hi>not</hi>; and that, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the <hi>Reason</hi> of the thing, but from their <hi>own deeds</hi> and <hi>writings</hi>; and those <hi>matters</hi> also, and <hi>Positions,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing remarkable is this; That they have been still <hi>Fishing in Troubled Waters,</hi> and taking advantage of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, and necessities of the Government. Did not <hi>Cartwright, Coppinger, Arthington,</hi> and <hi>Hacket,</hi> take their time for that <hi>Execrable Conspiracy</hi> against Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when she was just upon the very point of securing the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion</hi> against the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> Did not the <hi>Sectaries</hi> in 1641. take the same advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>late King,</hi> when his thoughts were wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64331:10"/>
up about suppressing the <hi>Irish Rebellion?</hi> And did not the latter <hi>Scotch Tumults</hi> take the same advantage of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties being under many troublesome Circumstances about the <hi>Plot</hi>; and when the Peoples minds were prepar'd to take Ill Impressions in the matter of Government? So that the very <hi>Timing</hi> of this Revived <hi>Clamour</hi> for <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> looks suspiciously; and the more, because their Meetings here have of late been very little interrupted.</p>
            <p>To run thorough those pestilent <hi>Principles,</hi> which the Heads of the <hi>Sectaries</hi> have Publish'd in their own Names, were endless. Wherefore I shall content my self with some of their <hi>General Positions,</hi> and refer the Reader to <hi>Husbands Collections,</hi> or the <hi>Authors themselves</hi> for the rest; as <hi>Milton, Goodwin, Rutherford,</hi> and a hundred more.</p>
            <p>They make the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> the <hi>Supream Power</hi>; nay, the <hi>People themselves,</hi> in some cases; <hi>Princes,</hi> they say, may be <hi>depos'd</hi> and put to <hi>death:</hi> They distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Kings <hi>Person</hi> and his <hi>Authority,</hi> the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Equity</hi> of it; and appeal from the <hi>Written Law</hi> to the <hi>Law of Nature</hi>; and according to <hi>these Maxims</hi> they govern their <hi>Proceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But will you see now the price of all our <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Confusion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon their Petition to his Majesty for a <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> the King most graciously issu'd out a <hi>Commission</hi> for a <hi>Review</hi> of the Book of <hi>Common Prayer:</hi> An equal number of Learned Divines, both <hi>Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> were appointed to meet about it, and <hi>to agree upon such Alterations as should be thought most Necessary.</hi> His Majesty earnestly desiring that the Ministers would not <hi>totally lay aside the Book of the Common Prayer, but read those parts against which there could be no Exception.</hi> Now instead of <hi>most necessary Alterations,</hi> and those to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by <hi>Both Parties,</hi> they Publish'd a <hi>new Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> under the Title of <hi>the Reformation


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64331:11"/>
of the Liturgy,</hi> (which was indeed the <hi>Abolition</hi> of it.) I'le give ye only a tast of some of their <hi>Important scruples</hi> that are cast into the Ballance, against the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom:</hi> They turn <hi>Wedded Wife</hi> into <hi>Marryed: Dost thou Believe</hi> into <hi>do you Believe</hi>; and <hi>all this I Stedfastly Believe,</hi> into <hi>this I do Unfeignedly Believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now suppose these People had their <hi>Askings:</hi> Let any man but shew me from the <hi>Minority</hi> of King <hi>James,</hi> to this hour, where they were not the more violent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune upon yielding (even to the hazard of a downright Rebellion) and the Author shall give any man his Head, for the President: Did not the <hi>Assembly</hi> in 1578. impose upon the <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> fall foul upon the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and the <hi>whole Order</hi>? pass a <hi>Decree</hi> against their <hi>Votes in Parliament</hi>; command them to renounce their <hi>Temporal Titles,</hi> and <hi>Civil Jurisdiction,</hi> and set their <hi>Quarriers</hi> at work for the demolishing of <hi>Glasgow Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral?</hi> (which had been done too, if the <hi>Trades-men</hi> had not by force prevented it.) And did they not grow bolder and bolder upon the Kings Lenity; and Command the <hi>Bishops,</hi> upon pain of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> not to Officiate as <hi>Pastors,</hi> without <hi>Licence</hi> from the <hi>General Assembly</hi>; and likewise order the Patrimony of the <hi>Church</hi> to be dispos'd of as they should see meet? And did they not after that, make a Violent and Treasonous Seizure of the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Ruthven,</hi> and justifie it when they had done? And so on by degrees, till his Majesty was forc'd, by a Tumult at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi> in 1596. and <hi>the Ministers Bond of Confederacy</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon it, to a Resolution of <hi>Rigour</hi> and <hi>Severity</hi>; which (as <hi>Spottswood</hi> observes) gave him more quiet and security for the future.</p>
            <p>His Majesty was no sooner enter'd upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> but he was Assaulted in 1604. with the same sort of People; and at a Conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi>


               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64331:11"/>
this Question was put, <hi>How far an</hi> Ordinance of <hi>the</hi> Church <hi>was</hi> Binding, without offence to <hi>Christian Liberty</hi>? Whereupon the King gave this short Answer, <hi>Let's have no more of these Questions, but</hi> Conform, <hi>at your Peril.</hi> So that they gave him no further trouble upon that subject. And this was Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Case too, to the hazard both of her Life and Government; till by that severe <hi>Act</hi> against them, of the Thirty-fifth of her Reign, she gave her self ease for the remainder of her Life.</p>
            <p>What did the <hi>Late King</hi> gain by his <hi>Indulgence</hi> to the <hi>Scots</hi> in 1637. but farther <hi>Indignities</hi> and <hi>Contempt? First,</hi> the <hi>Service-Book</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> were their Grievance; <hi>then</hi> the <hi>Five Articles</hi> of <hi>Perth,</hi> though establish'd both by the <hi>General Assembly</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi>; The <hi>High-Commission next,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> the <hi>Bishops Session</hi> in <hi>Civil Judicatories.</hi> His Majesty gratifies them in every point: Insomuch, that they had nothing further to complain of, but that the King would not <hi>Abolish Episcopacy,</hi> and <hi>admit</hi> the Authority of their <hi>Lay-Elders</hi>; upon which point they brake out into an <hi>Open Rebellion.</hi> After this, upon the Interview of the two Armies at <hi>Berwick</hi> (when the King had them absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his Mercy) upon their Supplication for a Treaty, he Trusted them again, and concluded upon a <hi>Pacification</hi>; of which, the <hi>Covenanters</hi> did not keep so much as <hi>one Article.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon his Majesties Return to <hi>London,</hi> he passes the <hi>Triennial Bill</hi>; Abolishes the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> and <hi>High-Commission-Court</hi>; Passes an <hi>Act</hi> for the <hi>Continuance</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi>; and in fine, denys them nothing but his <hi>Crown</hi> and his <hi>Blood</hi>; and then by Virtue of what he had given them already, they took away the rest, and stript him of his <hi>Friends,</hi> his <hi>Authority,</hi> his <hi>Revenue,</hi> and his <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They minister great cause of suspicion in their very <hi>stile</hi> and <hi>scruples:</hi> Why do they run so much upon <hi>Ambiguities?</hi>


               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64331:12"/>
As the settling of Religion in its <hi>due Latitude</hi>; a <hi>due</hi> and <hi>necessary Reformation; sound Belief; Principles Congruous to a National Settlement</hi>; the Kings <hi>Just</hi> Rights; <hi>Importance of Interests; Stated Order in the Church,</hi> &amp;c. What is all this, but a jumbling together of so many Amusements, to pass a Colourable Pretence upon the People? And it signifies just nothing, but what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction they shall think fit to allow it. If they would offer any <hi>Pertinent, Intelligible,</hi> and <hi>Practicable Proposition</hi>; and say, what <hi>Injunctions</hi> they would have abated; what <hi>Parties</hi> they would recommend for these qualifications; <hi>where</hi> to <hi>find</hi> them, and <hi>who</hi> shall <hi>judge</hi> of them. If they would <hi>State</hi> their <hi>Demands,</hi> and say, <hi>This is all we ask</hi>; and then rest there: If, as they plead for <hi>all Dissenters,</hi> they would produce some <hi>Common Instrument,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> to shew that they are <hi>Authoriz'd</hi> by <hi>all</hi> to Solicite in <hi>their Names,</hi> and to treat upon <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such Points</hi>; and to <hi>go no further,</hi> the business might be brought yet to some rational Issue.</p>
            <p>As their <hi>Stile</hi> is exceeding <hi>Dark</hi> and <hi>Mysterious,</hi> so are their <hi>Scruples</hi> of an <hi>Extraordinary Quality</hi> too. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>kneel</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but they can <hi>hold up their hands</hi> at the <hi>Covenant</hi>; they can <hi>dispense</hi> with the Oath of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,</hi> and yet make a <hi>scruple</hi> of disclaiming the <hi>Solemn League:</hi> They can <hi>swallow</hi> a <hi>Schism</hi> (or worse) and yet a <hi>Ceremony</hi> choaks them. Add to all this; many of those very persons that promoted our <hi>former Troubles, this very way,</hi> are now at work again upon the <hi>same Pretension</hi>; and may, without breach of Charity, be suspected to have the same design, and to remain in a state of <hi>Impenitency,</hi> if they have not manifested their <hi>Repentance</hi> by some <hi>Open Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> For (according to the <hi>Casuists) Publique sins require Publique Confessions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an Ill sign too, for a man to leap upon the sudden, from matter of <hi>Conscience</hi> to <hi>Reason of State</hi>; and in the


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64331:12"/>
same breath, of a <hi>Petitioner,</hi> to become a <hi>Reformer.</hi> It would seem a strange thing, for a man to request a special favour from the Master of a Family, and at the same time to put affronts upon his Domesticks, and to tell him that his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were all of them a pack of Rascals; which is not much from the point now in hand.</p>
            <p>We have had abundance of <hi>Advice</hi> to the <hi>Free-holders</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> toward the Choice of this next Parliament; as <hi>Sober and Seasonable Quaeres</hi>; Englands <hi>great Interest; the Free holders Choice,</hi> and <hi>twenty more</hi>; and all of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in the <hi>general Heads</hi> one with another: They tell us who are <hi>fit</hi> to be chosen, and who <hi>not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> former, <hi>such as will</hi> remove <hi>and bring to</hi> Justice evil Counsellors; Corrupt <hi>and</hi> Arbitrary Ministers of State; <hi>Detect</hi> and <hi>Punish the</hi> Pensioners <hi>of the</hi> former Parliament <hi>in the face of the Kingdom, and they must chuse such as will secure us from</hi> Slavery.</p>
            <p>The People are directed on the <hi>other side,</hi> not <hi>to chuse a man that has been</hi> reputed a Pentioner, <hi>no</hi> Court-Officer, <hi>or whose Employment is</hi> durante bene placito; <hi>no</hi> Ambitious men, <hi>or</hi> Non-residents, <hi>that live here in Town, and seek Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Preferments</hi> above.</p>
            <p>This is the Counsel of <hi>Englands Grand Interest</hi>: And methinks, in these Qualifications, there is both too <hi>much,</hi> and too <hi>little.</hi> As to the point of <hi>Evil Counsellors, Corrupt Ministers</hi> and <hi>Pensioners,</hi> he should have done well to have advis'd them all manner of <hi>Caution</hi> and <hi>Circumspection,</hi> for fear of mistaking their Men. This was the way that brought the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> to their <hi>Ends,</hi> under the Notion of <hi>evil Counsellors</hi> too, though perhaps, <hi>the most necessary Instruments that ever this Nation enjoy'd, for the</hi> Common good <hi>both of</hi> King <hi>and</hi> People. So that as it is a great Service to bring <hi>Corrupt Ministers</hi> to <hi>Publick Justice,</hi> it is yet a lewd Method to make the <hi>Rabble</hi> the <hi>Executioners,</hi> and to punish <hi>Male-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration</hi>


               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64331:13"/>
by <hi>Sedition</hi>: For in this Case the Good and the Bad fall indifferently without distinction; and instead of drawing here and there a piece of <hi>Rotten Timber</hi> toward a <hi>Reparation,</hi> they fall foul upon the main <hi>Pillars</hi> and <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters</hi> of the House; so that all falls into Ruins. And then the mark of a <hi>Reputed Pensioner</hi> goes a little too far; for it lies in the power of two or three Malevolent Tongues to make any man so. They that made the <hi>last King</hi> a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Papist,</hi> shall much more easily make any of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Subjects pass for <hi>Reputed Pensioners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The total Exclusion of all <hi>Court Officers,</hi> or <hi>Bene-placito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> is yet <hi>worse:</hi> For this sets up a direct Opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and his People; as who should say, <hi>Trust no body that wears any Token of the Kings favour.</hi> And the same reason disables him as well to any <hi>other Trust what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:</hi> So that the <hi>Kings Countenance</hi> is a kind of <hi>Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi> And it is the same thing with those he calls <hi>Ambitious Men</hi>; as if any Application to his Majesty, made a Man unfit for the Service of his Country. He should have done well to have warn'd them against the <hi>Known Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> rather then the <hi>Suspected Servants</hi> of the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Free-holders Choice</hi> is a very <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate.</hi> His Language against the Clergy is too coarse for an Honest man to repeat after him, but he has rang'd them in good Company; for he says that <hi>they lay out themselves, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate their Masters with the veriest</hi> Villains <hi>that can be pick'd up in all the Country; that so we may fall into the hands again of as Treacherous</hi> and <hi>Lewd</hi> a <hi>Parliament as the</hi> Wisdom <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>and</hi> Folly <hi>of</hi> Man <hi>has most miraculously freed us from.</hi> Methinks some of the Members of that Parliament should concern themselves to call for Justice upon so foul a Scandal.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Seasonable Quaeres</hi> does not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the same Cautions with the rest, but calls his


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64331:13"/>
Majesty himself to Shrift, and puts the <hi>Question, whether</hi> Prorogation and Dissolution <hi>of</hi> Parliaments, <hi>at such a time as this, does not fill the hearts of</hi> Protestant Subjects <hi>with evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fears of destruction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Secondly</hi> (says he) <hi>Whether it be not high time for all the</hi> Protestants <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>to</hi> Resolve <hi>as</hi> one man, <hi>that they will stand by, and maintain the</hi> Power <hi>and</hi> Privileges <hi>of</hi> Parliament, together with the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Just Rights of the</hi> King, <hi>according to the Laws of the Kingdom, so as the One may not intrench upon the Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former <hi>Expostulation</hi> upon the Reason of the Kings Proceedings, would have been more taken notice of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if it had not been follow'd with one of the most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious Challenges that this Licentious season has produc'd; for the meaning of it is, to incourage a direct <hi>Rising,</hi> as if the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> were <hi>going together by the Ears,</hi> (forgive the Expression) and the <hi>People</hi> to interpose, to see <hi>fair Play.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the very Trace of the Old <hi>Covenant:</hi> They must resolve to maintain <hi>no body knows what</hi> on the one side; (for the <hi>Privileges of Parliament</hi> are past finding out:) But then they are to stand by the <hi>King,</hi> on the other side, with a <hi>Limitation</hi>; only in his <hi>Just Rights,</hi> and of those Bounds, they themselves are to be the Judges. This <hi>Epithete</hi> was apply'd to the Late Kings Case, by those very men that cut off his Head.</p>
            <p>The Author of <hi>Englands great Interest,</hi> having directed the Good People what persons to choose for the ensuing Parliament, and whatnot. His next work is to instruct them in the Knowledge of their <hi>Powers,</hi> which he divides into <hi>three Rights</hi> or <hi>Fundamentals. The</hi> First is <hi>Property, that is, a</hi> Right <hi>and</hi> Title <hi>to their own</hi> Lives, Liberties, <hi>and</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states. <hi>For the</hi> Law <hi>(he says) is Umpire between</hi> King, Lords, <hi>and</hi> Commons; <hi>and the</hi> Right <hi>and</hi> Property <hi>is</hi> one <hi>in kind, through all</hi> Degrees <hi>and</hi> Qualities <hi>in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Mark that.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:64331:14"/>Why does he not say that the <hi>King</hi> is <hi>Vmpire</hi> betwixt <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> as well as that the <hi>Law</hi> is so? For the <hi>Law</hi> is only the <hi>Kings Pleasure</hi> made <hi>known</hi>; and the whole Force and Authority of it, is but an Emanation from <hi>Soveraign Power.</hi> And then for his <hi>Three Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals:</hi> As I am a <hi>Commoner</hi> of <hi>England</hi> my self, I should be loth to lose any Right of an <hi>English man</hi>; and yet as I am a <hi>Loyal Subject</hi> also, I should be as unwilling to encroach upon the <hi>Privileges</hi> of the <hi>Crown.</hi> I do not know what he means by his <hi>one in Kind</hi>; with the <hi>Emphasis</hi> of <hi>Mark that</hi> upon it. If it be, that the <hi>People</hi> have as much <hi>Right</hi> to their <hi>Lives, Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Estates,</hi> as the <hi>King himself</hi> has; though it be <hi>true</hi> in <hi>some sense,</hi> it will not hold yet, as he would have it <hi>understood.</hi> For the <hi>People</hi> may <hi>forfeit</hi> their <hi>Lives, Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Estates,</hi> but <hi>the King cannot forfeit His:</hi> Wherefore <hi>Mark That too.</hi>

            <p>It is not Candidly done, to call that the very <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is only <hi>Consultive</hi> and <hi>Preparative towards</hi> it. <hi>The making of Laws,</hi> is a <hi>Peculiar</hi> and <hi>Incommunicable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> of <hi>Soveraignty</hi>; so that to place the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> in the <hi>Commons,</hi> is to make <hi>them Supream</hi>; and to set a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> once more at the <hi>Commons Bar.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side that, his <hi>Inference</hi> is as <hi>Inconsequent,</hi> as his <hi>Assertion</hi> is <hi>Dangerous.</hi> As if a Law must necessarily be made <hi>By</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>His</hi> Third Fundamental <hi>is</hi> Executive, <hi>and holds Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the other two, in order to compleat both their</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>and</hi> Security; <hi>and that is their share (as he says) in the</hi> Judicatory Power; <hi>in the</hi> Execution <hi>and</hi> Application <hi>of</hi> those Laws <hi>that they Agree to be made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Judicatory Power</hi> without Authority to Minister an <hi>Oath,</hi> is to me, I must confess, a new thing: And now for the word <hi>Agree</hi>; though it may be pertinent enough to his purpose (for there needs no more to the Undoing of the most Regular Government upon the face of the Earth, then <hi>First</hi> to turn the Peoples hearts against it, and then to possess them that they have a <hi>Legal Remedy</hi> in their <hi>Own hands.</hi>) Yet <hi>that word</hi> (I say) in this place, is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; for it is but a <hi>Request</hi> presented to his Majesty for his <hi>Approbation.</hi> The <hi>Request</hi> or <hi>Bill,</hi> is no doubt, <hi>agreed</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it were an Uncouth kind of expression for a <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner</hi> to say that he does <hi>Agree</hi> that his Petition shall be <hi>Granted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Business it fairly push'd already: But the Publisher of a <hi>Pretended Speech</hi> lately Printed, carries it a step further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If a</hi> Prince <hi>(says he) be Born to a</hi> Kingdom, <hi>who is either</hi> Lunatique, <hi>or otherwise disabled to do the Kingdom any good, shall not the Subjects, in this Case, proceed to chuse another, who may preserve the Kingdom, when otherwise it must of necessity Perish? As lately in the Case of</hi> Portugal, <hi>they chose</hi> another <hi>to Succeed, because of the</hi> Disability <hi>of the</hi> former.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:64331:15"/>This is, in plain terms, a <hi>Deposing Principle:</hi> For if a <hi>King</hi> may be <hi>Remov'd,</hi> in such Case of <hi>Disability,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> being made <hi>Judges</hi> of the Case, <hi>it is but their saying that he is not sit to Govern, and the work is done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Sheet Printed under the Title of <hi>A Plea,</hi> &amp;c. that has more Brains and Art in it then ordinary. <hi>He says that a</hi> King <hi>is not for his</hi> Own, <hi>but his</hi> Subjects sakes <hi>only; and that</hi> we <hi>have, in truth, rather Title,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to</hi> Him, <hi>then</hi> He <hi>to</hi> Us: <hi>Adding, that when</hi> Kings themselves <hi>be Ill Ones,</hi> God <hi>not only</hi> approves <hi>of their</hi> Removal, <hi>but even</hi> himself does it: This he supports upon Texts extreamly misapply'd.</p>
            <p>Let it be agreed now that a <hi>Prince</hi> is rather Constituted for the good of the <hi>People,</hi> then the <hi>People</hi> for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Prince.</hi> But let it be granted also on the other side, that Providence has made <hi>Order</hi> so <hi>necessary</hi> to the well-being of <hi>Mankind,</hi> that <hi>Tyranny</hi> it self is yet more Tolerable then either <hi>Anarchy,</hi> or <hi>Sedition:</hi> So that in the matter of <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Superiors,</hi> we find our <hi>Convenience,</hi> even in our <hi>Duty.</hi> He seems to infer, that because <hi>God himself</hi> does many times <hi>remove Ill Kings,</hi> that therefore he approves of <hi>our doing</hi> so too. But <hi>First,</hi> we are not to draw <hi>Gods Extraordinary ways</hi> into <hi>Precedent.</hi> By the same Rule, <hi>Plunder</hi> was formerly justifi'd upon a <hi>Scriptural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> for the <hi>spoyling</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptians. Secondly:</hi> The very admittance, that an <hi>Ill King</hi> may be <hi>Remov'd,</hi> makes way to the <hi>destruction</hi> of a <hi>Good one</hi>; for 'tis but <hi>saying</hi> he <hi>is</hi> so, to <hi>make</hi> him so, and it leaves him barely at the mercy of the People: And this is not all neither, for it turns up the very <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> and casts Humane Affairs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Circulation of Confusion.</hi> The <hi>Two Houses</hi> Depos'd the <hi>King</hi>; the <hi>Commons,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi>; the <hi>Multitude</hi> they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the <hi>Commons</hi>; and <hi>all</hi> upon the <hi>same Charge</hi> of <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor.</hi> So that the <hi>Trustee</hi> being still accomptable to those that <hi>Entrusted</hi> him, the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> and the <hi>last Appeal</hi> lodg'd in the Rabble.</p>

Several of our Divines were Choak'd up, and Poison'd in <hi>Peter-House,</hi> and other Goals, either <hi>for Worshipping according to their Consciences, or Refusing to act against them.</hi> No Man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Compound, or so much as Live in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Quarters, without <hi>Swearing.</hi> Men were <hi>Sequester'd</hi> for not joyning in the <hi>Rebellion</hi>; for assisting the <hi>King</hi> according to the <hi>Law,</hi> and for <hi>not Covenanting,</hi> though in express Contradiction to the Oath of <hi>Allegeance.</hi> Upon


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64331:18"/>
the Abolition of the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> severe Penalties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon any man that should use it; and their own <hi>Directory</hi> impos'd upon a Forfeiture too; nay, they would not allow the King himself, in his Distresses, the Comfort of any of his own <hi>Chaplains,</hi> nor so much as the benefit of a <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi>: And at <hi>Fife</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there was an <hi>Oath</hi> given at the <hi>Communion, not</hi> to take the <hi>Kings Oath,</hi> nor any other then their <hi>Own.</hi>—Was all this an Invasion of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> or not?</p>
            <p>Touching a <hi>Persecution</hi> now, upon the point of <hi>Good Name</hi>: Though the whole course of the History is full of Virulent and Unchristian Reflections, I will only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my self to that <hi>Diabolical Libel</hi> of <hi>Whites Centuries of Scandalous Ministers</hi>; wherein, without any regard to <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Modesty,</hi> they have expos'd so many <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Names</hi> to <hi>Infamy</hi> and <hi>Dishonour.</hi> In one word; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had represented the <hi>King himself</hi> for a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and an <hi>Idolater,</hi> it was but Consonant that they should cast Reproaches upon his Party.</p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>Freedom</hi> of our <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Estates,</hi> the whole course of the late War, was but one continu'd Usurpation upon our Rights to both: Noble mens Houses turn'd to Prisons, and People Committed, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either their Accusers, or their Offence: Some clap'd on Shipboard to be Transported, no body knew whither; and others sold into Plantations for Slaves. To say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of those that fell by the Sword, in the Defence of their Country; or otherwise past the hand of the Executioner, in Justification of their Religion and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance. There was <hi>no taking of</hi> Threescore pounds <hi>for</hi> Twelve, <hi>in those days; nor of</hi> Two hundred <hi>for</hi> Sixty. But they took <hi>All</hi> for <hi>nothing</hi>; and there was no Living among them for any Honest man, that would not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute his Conscience. And who are they now, but


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64331:19"/>
either the very persons, or men however of these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Principles, that acted these Out-rages upon <hi>Vs,</hi> and yet now complain of being Persecuted <hi>themselves</hi>? When they startle the Common People with the Notions of Cruelty and Slavery, as a matter now in Prospect; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks they should Blush at the Memory, and upon the Guilt of those Real Calamities which we have both seen and felt, wherein our Blessed Soveraign had yet a greater share then any of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They Abolish'd</hi> Kingly Goverment; <hi>Sold the</hi> Crown-Lands; Imprison'd <hi>and</hi> Murther'd <hi>the</hi> King; <hi>made it</hi> Treason <hi>to deny the</hi> Supremacy <hi>of the</hi> Commons; <hi>turn'd our</hi> Churches <hi>into</hi> Stables; <hi>Burnt our</hi> Communion-Tables, <hi>and profan'd the very Ashes of the Dead.</hi> Let but any man read <hi>Scobels Acts,</hi> and say, if the <hi>English</hi> were not in those times, and under these <hi>Protestant Dissenters,</hi> the most Despicable <hi>Slaves</hi> in Nature. See their <hi>Tax</hi> upon the <hi>Fifth</hi> and <hi>Twentieth</hi> part, their <hi>Excises</hi> upon <hi>Excise</hi>; their <hi>Assessments</hi> for the Maintenance of the <hi>Army,</hi> and their <hi>Monthly Taxes</hi> for the same end. <hi>Ninety thousand pounds; Sixscore thousand pounds, Sixty thousand pounds, Sequestrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Seizing of Peoples <hi>Rents</hi> and <hi>Debts,</hi> Appropriating to themselves the profits of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions for <hi>Wards.</hi> Authorizing the <hi>breaking</hi> open of <hi>Locks,</hi> and <hi>Examining</hi> upon <hi>Oath</hi> for discovery of <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents Money</hi> and <hi>Estates.</hi> All this is as well known, as the very fact of the War it self; and if we have a mind to lie down under the same Bondage again, let us believe the Stories of <hi>Arbitrary Government</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> that these People tell us of, and they shall just so help us out of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as they did before.</p>
            <p>There should be something further said to their pretence of being <hi>Persecuted</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi>; but I find little to be added to what is already deliver'd. <hi>The Law stands still:</hi> They press upon the <hi>Law,</hi> and yet cry out, that the <hi>Law</hi>


               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:64331:19"/>
persecutes <hi>them.</hi> We may lay down this, I think, for a Maxim; That <hi>whosoever tells us that he makes a Conscience of Complying with the Discipline of the Church, and yet manifestly makes none at all, of undermining, nay and of blowing up the whole frame of the Government, that man is most undoubtedly an</hi> Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>To Conclude: What's the meaning of this <hi>Remonstrating</hi> to the People? They are no <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Controversie</hi>: But they do well however, in a Cause, where <hi>Force</hi> does a great deal more then <hi>Argument,</hi> to make their Application to the Multitude, with whom <hi>Clamour</hi> and <hi>Pretence</hi> are of more Value then <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> It is a most Ridiculous Contradiction to common sense, to believe these men to be in earnest; for if they were, they would never <hi>Defame</hi> the Government, at the same time that they beg a <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> from it.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Demand</hi> is <hi>Vnreasonable,</hi> the <hi>thing</hi> it self only <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> and <hi>Impracticable.</hi> By <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> they mean <hi>a Freedom of doing what they please,</hi> which necessarily implies <hi>a total Dissolution of the Laws.</hi> They offer it only as a <hi>Decoy</hi> to the <hi>People</hi>; and when they have gain'd <hi>Compassion</hi> to <hi>themselves</hi> (like Beggers that move Pity by shewing Ulcers of their own making) their next business is to draw <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts</hi> upon the <hi>Government,</hi> and after that, to enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe, upon the Great Work of <hi>Reformation. Let me do this Right however to the</hi> Independents: <hi>I do not find that Party to have given the Government any trouble since his Majesties Return; but that they have kept themselves clear of all these late Broils: And if</hi> Authority <hi>had the same sense of them, with the Author of this Pamphlet, they would be found both in their</hi> Principles <hi>and in their</hi> Manners, <hi>to have the most reasonable Claim of all sorts of Dissenters, to a favourable allowance from the Government.</hi> God in his Mercy open our Eyes, that we may know our <hi>Friends</hi> from our <hi>Enemies.</hi>
