         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAving often conſidered, that there are ſeveral
Diſeaſes ſo ſurprizing, and withal ſo very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that the Patient is often dead, or paſt all hopes
of recovery, before a skilful Phyſitian in many places
can be called, or adviſed with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I thought a plain
Engliſh Treatiſe of ſuch kind of Diſeaſes might be
of general uſe, and that it may ſuit all conditions of
Men, all by the frailty of Nature lying open to one
or other of theſe ſuddain Incurſions, I have reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to a ſmall compaſs, that it may be the eaſier
read over, and that each Diſeaſe may be the ſoon,
er turned to upon any ſuddain occaſion. Ordinary
Readers being as often at a loſs in a large Book
as Travellers in a Wood; and it is compoſed in a
ſmall Character, that as every one may need it, ſo
every one may be able to buy it, and I have Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it in a plain Stile that every one alſo may be
able to underſtand it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This little Book may be an aſſiſtant to Charitable
Ladies and Gentlewomen in the Country, who like
the good Samaritan, have never an Hand but what
is ready to help their diſtreſſed Neighbours, here
they may find plain directions, and the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Medicines, ſuch as the London<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Phyſitians
<pb facs="tcp:59968:3"/>
moſt frequently make uſe of in theſe Diſeaſes. The
Traveller and Sea-faring Man when they are far
diſtant from Phyſitians, and deſtitute of all other
help, may here alſo find releif.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Medicines prepared by my ſelf that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mention'd in this Treatiſe, are of great Vertue,
and Efficacy, and have bin found Succeſsful to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
in cureing ſeveral of theſe Diſeaſes. And
they keep good many Years, and will endure the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of Heat and Cold in various Climates. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
very proper for thoſe that live in the country,
and in the Plantations abroad, or go to Sea. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
every one that has been once ſeized with any
one of theſe Diſeaſes, will undoubtedly whereſoever
he dwells, think it no ſmall comfort and Security
to have an approved Remedy ready at hand, in time
of need.</p>

            <head>Chap. X. Of hard Labour.</head>
            <p>THat is ſaid to be hard Labour, which does not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the due and ordinary courſe of Nature, and
longer time is ſpent in it, and the pains are more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than uſual, and the Symptoms that accompany it are
more grievous.</p>
            <p>Many cauſes may be aſſigned for it, both external, and
internal, the internal depend on the Mother, the Womb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or the Child.</p>
            <p>As to the Mother, the natural Weakneſs of the whole
Body may make the Labour difficult, or her Age, ſhe
being too Young or too Old, or it may be occaſion'd by
Diſeaſes, which ſhe had with her Big-belly, Leanneſs on
two much dryneſs of the Body, or Fat compreſſing the
paſſages of the Womb, or the ill-conformation of the Bones
encompaſſing the Womb, as in thoſe that are Lame, may
alſo occaſion it, Wind ſwelling the Bowels, a ſtone on
preternatural tumour in the Bladder that preſſes the
Womb, may be the cauſe. So may the ill Conſtitution
of the Lungs, or the parts ſerving reſpiration, for the
holding of the Breath is very neceſſary to help the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Child.</p>
            <p>As to the Womb, various Diſeaſes of it, may render
the Delivery difficult, as Tumours, Ulcers, Obſtructions,
and the like. As to the Child, hard Labour is occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when by reaſon it is Dead, or Putrified, or any way
Diſeaſed, it cannot confer any thing to it's own excluſion.
Alſo when the Body or Head of it is large, or when there
are many, ſo Twins moſt commonly cauſe hard Labour;
or when it is ill ſituated, as when the Hands or the Feet
offer firſt, or when one Hand or Foot comes out, or when
it is doubled, or when the Membranes break too ſoon,
ſo that the Water flows out, and leaves the Orifice of the
Womb dry at the time of excluſion. Or when the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59968:12"/>
are too thick, ſo that they cannot be eaſily brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
by the Child.</p>
            <p>The external cauſes depend on things neceſſary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent;
things neceſſary are thoſe which are commonly
call'd non-natural, ſo Cold and Dry air, and a North
wind are very injurious to Women in Labour, becauſe
they bind the Body, and drive the Blood and Spirits to
the inner parts, and they are very injurious to the Child
coming from ſo warm a place. Hot weather alſo diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates
the Spirits and weakens the Child. Crude meats
and ſuch as are difficulty Concocted, and thoſe that bind,
taken in a great quantity before Labour, render it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
the Stomach being weakened, and the common
paſſages contracted, which ought to be very open in this
Caſe.</p>
            <p>Drowſineſs hinders the Action of the Mother and Child,
and ſhews that nature is Weak. The unſeaſonable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Woman much retards the Delivery; as when
ſhe refuſes upon occaſion to Stand, Walk, Lye, or Sit,
or flings her ſelf about unadviſedly, ſo that the Child can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Born the right way, being turned prepoſterouſly
by the Reſtleſneſs of the Mother.</p>
            <p>The retention of ſuch things as ſhould be evacuated
at the time of Labour, as of Urine, that ſwells the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or excrements in the right Gut, the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es alſo
much ſwelled, narrow the Neck of the Womb, and ſo
hinder natures endeavours. Laſtly violent Paſſions of the
mind, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear, Sorrow and Anger, make the Labour diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
            <p>To things Contingent ought to be referred, a Blow,
a Fall, or a Wound, which may much obſtruct Labour,
alſo the want of By-ſtanders, which ought to aſſiſt the
Woman, namely ſtrong Women or Maids which may
lift her up juſt at the time of her Delivery. An unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Mid-wife, that orders the Women to endeavour an
expulſion, and to ſtop her Breath, when the Ligaments
ſtick faſt to the VVomb, ſo that the VVoman is tired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time of her Delivery.</p>
            <p>Difficult Labour is known by the VVoman, the By-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and the Midwife. And firſt if the VVoman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59968:13"/>
a long time in Labour, namely two, three; four or more
Days, whereas a natural Birth is finiſhed in twenty four
Hours. Languid pains returning at long diſtances are
a ſign of difficult Labour; alſo the Pains tending back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
rather than forward. But the cauſes of difficult
Labour may be known by the Womans Relation, and
moſt commonly upon ſight, So the Weakneſs of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or Leanneſs, or over Fatneſs may be ſeen by the
Habit of the Body. The diſeaſes of the Womb may be
known by their proper ſigns. The weakneſs of the Child
by the weak and ſlow motion of it. The bigneſs of the
Child may be Judged of by the Stature of the Parents,
eſpecially if a Gigantick man be Married to a Dwarfiſh
Woman, but when there are none of theſe Cauſes, and
the Womans and Child's endeavours are ſtrong, and yet
the Labour is difficult, they ſignifie that the Secundine
is ſo ſtrong that it cannot be eaſily broken, and this will
be confirmed, if no Water, or Moiſture flows out in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
The propoſterous Figure of the Child may be
perceived by the Midwife.</p>
            <p>As to the Cure of hard Labour. Firſt all thoſe things
that retard it muſt be removed, as much as may be. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Medicines that further Labour muſt be given:
And firſt it is common with Women to give a ſpoonful
or two of <hi>Cinnamon water,</hi> or <hi>Cinnamon powdered with a
little Saffron,</hi> or half a dram of <hi>Confection of Alkermes</hi>
in Broath, or half a ſcruple of <hi>Saffron</hi> alone in ſome

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath, or every Hour a little Wine.</p>
            <p>If theſe things are not ſufficient, the following may be
uſed, which have been frequently very effectual
Give five grains of <hi>extract of Saffron,</hi> or five drops of
<hi>Oyl of Cinnamon,</hi> or thirty drops of <hi>my Cephalick Tincture,</hi>
in a Glaſs of Wine; for it powerfully haſtens Delivery.
Sneezing is alſo very Beneficial: It may be provoked by
the following Powder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take of white Hellebore, half a dram, of long Pepper, one

quantity of a Peaſe be blown up the Noſtrils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But difficult Labour muſt be helpt alſo by outward
Remedies. Let the Midwife frequently anoint the Womb
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59968:13"/>
with Oyl of Sweet almonds, and let the Belly be ſoment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an emollient Decoction made of the Roots of

Linſeeds, Fenugreek Seeds, and the Flowers of Camomile
and Melilot. And ſharp Gliſters muſt be injected: Anoint
the Navel with the Oyl of Amber.</p>
            <p>If the Child begins to come forth prepoſterouſly, as with

may be done by placing the Woman in a Bed upon her
Back, with her Head low and her Feet high, and then

            <head>Chap. XI. Of Miſcarriage.</head>
            <p>MIſcarriage is the excluſion of an imperfect, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe
Child. The cauſes of Miſcarriage are ſome
inward, ſome outward. The inward may be reduced to
four Heads, Namely to the humours, to the Child, to the
Womb, and to the Diſeaſe of the Mother. The humours
may occaſion Miſcarriage when they offend in quantity or
quality. They offend in quantity either by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
or defect. The quantity is exceſſive when there is
more Blood than is requiſite to nouriſh the Child; for
then it flows into the Veins of the Womb, and is exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like the Monthly Courſes, and ſo the Child comes
away with it. There is too ſmall a quantity of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious
humour when the Child's nouriſhment is by any
means leſſened, as by faſting, and when the Woman with
Child nauſeats all ſorts of of Food, or Vomits it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
or the like.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of the Child Miſcarriage may happen, if it

in the Womb. And for this reaſon little Women
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59968:14"/>
often Miſcarry, eſpecially if they are Married to men
bigger than ordinary. Plurality of Children may alſo
occaſion Miſcarriage, as when one, or two, or three are
contained in the Womb at one time.</p>
            <p>The womb it ſelf occaſions Miſcarriage, if it be not
large enough, or if it be inflamed, or impoſtumated, or
moiſt and ſlack, ſo that it cannot contain the Child ſo well
as it ought to do.</p>
            <p>Miſcarriage comes two ways from the Diſeaſe of the

do ſome of them Kill the Child, others draw away
the nouriſhment, and others diſſolve the bands wherewith
it is faſtened to the VVomb.</p>
            <p>The Child is Killed by great commotions of the mind,
by Anger, Sadneſs, Frights and the like; by meats
earneſtly Longed for and not obtained, by ſtrong Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
medicines, by things that provoke the Courſes, and
by ill ſmells, eſpecially the ſtink of a Candle ill put out:
violent exerciſe, as Dancing, Running, Riding, Jolting
in a Coach or Cart, Carrying or Lifting from the Ground
an heavy Weight, a violent Fall, a blow on the Belly,
vehement motion of the Belly, Coughing, Vomiting,
Looſneſs, Sneezing, Convulſions, Crying out, immoder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
or over wanton embraces, Vehement motion of the
Arms, and the like occaſion Miſcarriage</p>
            <p>The ſigns of preſent Miſcarriage are manifeſt of
themſelves: but ſuch as go before and ſhew the ſame are
theſe, an unuſual heavineſs of the Loyns and Hips, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs
to ſtir, appetite gone, Shivering and Shaking
coming by Fits, Pain of the Head, eſpecially about the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59968:14"/>
Roots of the Eyes, a ſtraightening of the Sides and Belly
above the Navel; the Flaging or Falling, and Extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Dugs. But if frequent and almoſt continual
Pains torment the Reins and Loyns, with endeavours to
Evacuate the Womb, the Woman will certainly Miſcarry
in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>If from violent external Cauſes, as a <hi>Blow, Fall,</hi> and
the like, vehememt Pain and Diſturbance ariſe in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with Child, ſhe ought to Bleed preſently, and to keep
her Bed three or four Days, or longer.</p>
            <p>The Cure of <hi>Miſcarriage</hi> conſiſts in Preſervation; for
that which is paſt cannot be helpt: But all the <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms</hi>
which follow Miſcarriage are the ſame which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
Women duly brought to Bed.</p>
            <p>The Preſervation from <hi>Miſcarriage</hi> conſiſts principally
in theſe two things; the one concerns the Woman before
ſhe is with Child, and the other when ſhe is with Child:
Before the Woman is with with Child, all Indiſpoſitions of
the Body, which are wont to cauſe <hi>Miſcarriage,</hi> muſt be
removed, as fullneſs of Blood, ill Humours, and peculiar
Diſeaſes of the Womb.</p>
            <p>If the Woman be too full of Blood, when ſhe is with
Child, ſhe muſt be Blooded in the firſt Months twice or
thrice if need be; but much Blood muſt not be taken away
at a time; and if ſhe be troubled with abundance of ill
Humours, gentle Purging muſt be repeated, eſpecially in
the middle Months; in the mean while aſtringent and
ſtrengthening Medicines muſt be uſed all the time the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is with Child.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take of Conſerve of Roſes, two Ounces, of Citron Peel
Candied, ſix Drams, of Myrobalans Candied, and of the

with Syrup of Quinces make an Electuaery, of which let the
Woman take the quantity of a Nutmeg every other Night at
Bed time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that the ſucceſs of this Medicine may be good, the
Woman muſt keep her ſelf as quiet, both in Body and
Mind, as poſſibly ſhe can, and abſtain from Coition. But
if by reaſon of the vehemency of the Cauſe, whither Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

or External, the Woman is ready to Miſcarry, you muſt
do the beſt you can with the following Remedies. And in
the firſt place, ſo ſoon as the Pain ſhall be perceived in the
lower parts of the Belly, we muſt endeavour to allay them
both by Medicines taken inwardly, and outwardly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for if Miſcarriage be cauſed by Crudities and Wind,
which is moſt uſual, when it begins from an inward Cauſe,

            <p>If the pain be very violent, you muſt take away ten
ounces of Blood again on the firſt day, or elſe the day
following, and ſo the third day; and after this manner
four times one day after another, when the pain rages
violently. But if the diſeaſe be more moderate and leſs
dangerous, and if the Patient being weak, cannot well
bear Bleeding ſo often, it muſt not be repeated again

            <p>You'l ſeldom find that a confirmed Pleuriſie can be
