            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Vnderwritten declare to whom it shall concerne that
upon a motion of peace made by some worthy friends, to
really acte what is desired, doe sincerely professe that I hold
it necessary, that all Catholikes should, in hart &amp; in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
&amp; obedience, submitte their Divinity writings to the
holy Church &amp; See Apostolick. And, as this hath ever beene
my opinion, so being now required by the said friends, I doe
humbly &amp; sincerely professe it to all it shall concerne, by this
my present writing or instrument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this to reach to all my
books either passed or to come. Protesting never to recede
from this resolution, as far as God shall give mee grace; And
this not only before men, but also before God, as I hope &amp;
expect good from him. May 18. 1657. THOMAS WHITE.</p>
            <p>Whereas I vnderwritten have heretofore given a submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of my writings to the holy Church &amp; See Apostolik, to
satisfye such as might doubt of my obedience to the Pope;
And that not withstanding I gave it as full &amp; ample as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
I could, according as my true intention then was, now is,
ever hath beene, &amp; ever shall bee, God willing, I heare that
some have misunderstood it, &amp; have conceived that I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
only by those words, <hi>Holy Church &amp; See Apostolik,</hi> the
Catholick Church &amp; Pope conjointly; but not to the See of
Rome, &amp; S. Peter's successour the Pope, separat from a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Council: As also that I only declared my opinion, but
professed no actuall submission of my writings, I therefore
doe now ingenuosly &amp; freely declare &amp; professe that it is my
opinion &amp; judgement, all Catholikes ought in hart &amp; in all
humility &amp; obedience submitte their Divinity writings; not
only to the Holy Church in common &amp; in a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
where the Pope may bee in person or by his Deputys, but
also to the particular See of Rome &amp; S. Peter's successour the
Pope, even out of a Generall Council, which as I have always
done in my hart, so doe I now likewise actually &amp; willingly
