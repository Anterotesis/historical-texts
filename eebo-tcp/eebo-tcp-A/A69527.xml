            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will briefly let you underſtand how the
Papiſts lie in waite to deceive you: and that
it may bee ſeene that I am not partiall, (I
ſpeake to all the three Kingdomes) minding
to ſhew you all that Papiſts lie in waite to
deceive you by two meanes, Seminaries and Penſions;
yet it is firſt to be remarked, that the ground of both is the
councell in Rome, called, <hi>Congregatio de propaganda</hi> (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<hi>extirpanda fide,</hi> a congregation of propagating (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
extirpating of faith.</p>
            <p>This Congregation hath a moſt ſumptuous Pallace in
Rome, and extreame rich; the members of it, are the
Pope as head of the Church, his nephew Cardinall <hi>Francis
Barbarine</hi> as his Lieutenant, divers other Cardinals, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls
of ſeverall orders, the great Maſter of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſome Doctors, all as Iudges, they convene every
Friday, or ofter as they pleaſe; the end of their meeting,
is to finde out meanes to bring all people and Nations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Popes dominion, for this end they have ſundry
meanes, ſuch as the Seminaries of divers Nations and
penſions: The Seminaries are furniſhed with youths out
of their ſeverall Countries, by Ieſuits, who have the care of
them: Theſe youths are of two ſorts, the one called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victors,
becauſe they pay for their entertainment, and theſe
are noble Barons and Gentlemens ſonnes, ſent thither by
their Popiſh parents, to be brought up for divers ends:
The other are called Seminariſts, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d theſe have their
foode, raiment, ſtudies, bookes, &amp;c. all the time of their
<pb facs="tcp:95013:2"/>
ſtudies out of the Colledges, with condition that after
they have ſtaied three months in one of the Colledges, they
muſt make a vow to take Prieſthood upon them, and to returne
to their ſeverall Countries, when they ſhall be found fit by the
Ieſuits their Maſters, to the end they may ſeduce others, as they
were ſeduced themſelves; and therefore after their ſtudies, they
are ſent into their own Country, furniſhed with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
as apparrell, monies, maſſe-graith, and the like, as
they are thought of, and have mony at Court of their Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
there be five of our Nation out of the Country; at Rome,
Paris, Madrid, Doway and Brounsberg, and one promiſed
by the Emperour in Oſnabruck, which the Sweds keept for
them, of Iriſh ſome, and many and great of Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Theſe Seminaries, Ieſuits and other Prieſts, ſend their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
every yeare, of all what paſſe in the Country, ſpirituall or
temporall, to the foreſaid congregation, wherein all treaſons,
maſſacres and other bloudy miſchiefes are hatched.</p>
            <p>This preſuppoſed as an aſſured truth, I ſpeake firſt to thee
my deare Country, thou that wroughteſt thy ſelfe mightily to
ſuffer ſchiſmes and diviſions in thee, which are now with great
pitty to be ſeene and ſhame to be heard; one ſaith I am a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanter,
another I am not, what meaneſt thou, not covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
wilt thou not ſubſcribe the contract which thy parents,
Godfathers and Godmothers, as thy ſpirituall tutors, ſeeing
it is for God and truth onely? God is partly contracted, the
Angells were witneſſes, and hell fire the penalty, take heed,
and fight not againſt God, for as he is Alſeeing, ſo he is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
and as mercifull to have ſpared thee ſo long, ſo is hee
juſt, to puniſh thy inexcuſable wilfulneſſe. But ſome will
ſay, that there begreat Doctors not Covenanters, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may not wee likewiſe ſtand out as well as theſe learned
men? I anſwer firſt, that they are but few, and to my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(for I have diſcourſed with ſome of them) not the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt
<pb facs="tcp:95013:3"/>
of the Kingdome, brought up in a Towne which was
never yet clenſed from Popery, and where I have ſeene an
hundred at maſſe at one time within theſe few yeares: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
theſe Doctors, ſuppoſe they were learned (as I know ſome
of them are) they ſhall not anſwer for thee in that great day,
wherein there ſhall bee had no reſpect of perſons. Thirdly,
what if theſe Doctors would maintaine Popery and hinder a
reformation, as their predeceſſors have done, wouldſt thou
follow? God forbid.</p>
            <p>My counſell now to you that are Covenanters is, that <hi>qui
ſtat, videat ne cadit,</hi> let him that thinkes he ſtands take heed leſt
he fall, for the Crowne of glory is onely for him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth,
<hi>Qui perſeveraverit uſque in finem hic ſalvus erit,</hi> hee
that ſhall indure to the end the ſame ſhall be ſaved: yeeld not
a word, a ſyll<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble, a jot, leſt thou ſcandalize thy weake brother,
and give occaſion to Rome, to ſtand and expect thy returne,
ſhe not ſo much as beginning a motion towards thee: for they
ſeeing your novations of Biſhops, Deanes, Doctors, kneeling
at Sacrament, croſſe in Baptiſme, and the reſt of theſe articles,
were in aſſured confidence, that ye were turning to them again,
and uſed commonly to ſay, (ſee ſo faine as they are to creepe
into us againe) which did confirme all our people, and made
ſundry of yours to follow us: If theſe points which ſometime
by the moſt part were thought allowable, did ſo much harme
to Gods Church, what their Engliſh maſſe, canonicall inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the reſt of that almoſt baniſhed traſh had done, if they
had not beene prevented by the alſeeing God, judge yee. And
finally, grant thou nothing that Rome deſireth of thee, for it
hath no warrant from God, and thou knoweſt no conformity
to be admitted betweene God and Dagon, hold faſt that which
thou haſt, loſt another take thy Crowne from thee.</p>
            <p>And to you not Covenanters, I ſay, that of your Biſhops I
never ſaw any but one, neither would I mourne, albeit I never
<pb facs="tcp:95013:3"/>
ſaw more of them in this land, and I am their friend or enemy,
as they are Chriſts; yea, more I ſay, if ye knew as well as they
and I know, even the draughts that are drawne againſt you,
the ſtrength and policy of your enemies without, and within,
againſt this poore Church of God, I am certainely perſwaded
that you would all ſubſcribe that worthy covenant, before
that yee went out of this Church, or elſe I would hould you as
internall Papiſts; I perceive you all curious to demand me a
queſtion, if modeſty would permit you to ſpeake it; to wit,
what is that I know more then other men? let us (ſay ye) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it, and we will yeld to reaſon.</p>
            <p>To this lawfull queſtion, I anſwer, that I know more then any
Proteſtant in this land, of this buſineſſe; for I was imployed in
it in the yeare of God, 1632. and gave in (amongſt other points
of my commiſſion) a petition to the foreſaid congregation at
Rome, and elſewhere, deſiring them to adviſe upon the meanes,
for the reducing of this Kingdome to Rome; divers were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
by theſe politicke heads, who ſtudy onely to deſtroy
Kings, and pervert Kingdomes, of many, theſe few were moſt
conſiderable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that they ſhould all employ their wits for the pervertion
of his Majeſty, our ſoveraigne Lord, and contribute for the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
of an Army, under pretext of giving aſſiſtance to ſome
confederate Prince, and therewith to force liberty of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
this opinion was rejected as dangerous, till all things
were ſurer, and their faction ſtronger.</p>
            <p>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>condly, that if they could not attaine to their purpoſe with
his Majeſty, they ſhould endeavour to get two Ieſuits in our
Princes ſervice, for his Graces inſtruction, and education, in
Popery.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that penſions ſhould be given by mediate waies,
through the univerſities, and other parts where they might
worke their ends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95013:4"/>
Fourthly, yet this was all thought little of by ſome of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
men, who adviſed them to ſet their whole minds for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion
of England, which being nearer to them in points of
doctrine then Scotland, as alſo in forme of Service, worſhips,
and Eccleſiaſticall government, they might worke ſurer and
with greater hope of prevailing, then with Scotland, whom he
aſſured to be of a ſtubborne nature, dangerous to be dealt with,
and great Puritans, directly oppoſite to the Church of Rome,
and therefore nothing more ſhould be deſired of Scotland, but
conformity in matters of religion with England, which the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Church would gladly wiſh, as if ſhe were a Mother Church,
wherof others did flow; neither could his country men deny it
in reſpect of his Majeſties ſupremacy, and of the union of the
two Crownes, and Kingdomes; that they both might have but
one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme, &amp; one King. For the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his councell, he proponed mutuall intellegence to be
procured betwixt England, and Rome, which ſhortly after was
begun by an Italian Prieſt, a great polititian, well verſed in the
french tongue <hi>Il ſignior Gregorie,</hi> who ſtayed above a yeare
and a halfe in London for that effect, and with whom I confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his own lodging, in the Covent-garden at London, and
with two great men of our owne nation, and now continueth
there himſelf, with great grudge to both the Kingdomes, ſeeing
this mutuall intelligence was never heard of betwixt Rome,
and us, ſince the Cardinalls <hi>Woolſy</hi> and <hi>Polus</hi> daies, neither is
it neceſſary, as ſtates men may ſee.</p>
            <p>Now non-covenanter, is thy curioſity ſatisfied: This I know,
and more, looke then to it in time, and bee not one of thoſe,
who for vanity or other ends, will be thought ſingular againſt
Gods cauſe, and thy owne promiſe in baptiſme. I will end
this diſcourſe, that my enemies ſay not that I minde to put diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention
betwixt Proteſtants and Conformiſts, letting theſe
three Kingdomes ſee ſome of the dangers wherein they ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:95013:4"/>
of the Roman Antichriſt, and his Congregation <hi>de extirpanda
fide:</hi> firſt ye ſtand in theſe dangers, eſpecially that mutuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
between Rome and England: ſecondly, of your
Countrimens affection to Rome, if they be Papiſts, for alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
rights of the Popes upon each of you, <hi>viz. Peters</hi> penny
and <hi>Peters</hi> patrimony: thirdly your extreme great number of
Ieſuits, and Prieſts, extending in England to five or ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
ſo that they are ſtriving among themſelves, and writing
books againſt others for Biſhopricks in your Church; as for
Ireland it hath 15. Papiſts Biſhops alone, this is great danger:
fourthly, your populous multitudes of Papiſts in you extending
many thouſands, ſo that I am of that mind, that in England the
people (if not already) may ſhortly deſire a generall aſſembly
for liberty of conſcience: Fiftly, the education of your Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in forraine Countries, who having drunke in the doctrine
of iniquity from their tenderage, are both more perverſe in
themſelves, and more dangerous bringing in their friends and

ſparke of true Chriſtianity? truly, who doth it not, I muſt of
neceſſity thinke him an internall Papiſt.</p>
            <p>The laſt danger of all the 3. Kingdomes is Penſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:95013:5"/>
we may conſider foure things: Firſt, the giver: Secondly,
the perſons to whom they are given: Thirdly, the quantity of
the ſummes: Fourthly, the end wherefore they are given.
There is certaine penſions given in the Country, for Prieſts
and intelligencers, and out of the Country for Seminaries and
correſpondents of theſe intelligencers, but to come to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
Firſt, the givers are the houſe of Auſtria, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
congregation, <hi>de extirpando fide.</hi> Secondly, the perſons to
whom it is given, to my knowledge, are the Prieſts, the
man that goeth for it and the keeper, whereof I was one, and
know the names, and reſidence of the reſt, which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by writ already: and if there be given penſions to any
others as to theſe, the ſuperiour with his councellors, and the
treaſurer know it, for me I know not, but this I am ſure of,
that there was more ſent into the Country then was beſtowed
on them. Thirdly, the quantity, <hi>in cumulo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> is beſt knowne to
them, I being none of the ſuperiors councellors, in reſpect of
my travells for the miſſion; the quantity that wee who were
Prieſts got, was a 100. Crownes in the yeare from Rome, and
eighteene pence every day from Spaine, beſides our purchaſe
by our maſſe, confeſſions and pardons, which was more or
leſſe, conforme to our imploiment, and the perſons with
whom we dealt. Fourthly and laſtly, in a word, the end of
theſe gifts is pretended zeale and pitty, but which may appear
by the depoſition of Maſter <hi>George Ker,</hi> and the Ieſuits <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crumby,
Chrighton</hi> and <hi>Gordon,</hi> with three Noblemens letters
intercepted with him, and regiſtrate by his penſions given to
us, and his pretended rights were our native Countries, truly
intended Hierarchy of Rome, and Monarchy of Spaine; If
this then be not an evident danger to ſuffer ſo many forraigne
Princes penſioners in your boſome, God ſee to it in his owne
time, and give me grace that I may follow my Chriſt in feare
and hearty reſolution.</p>
