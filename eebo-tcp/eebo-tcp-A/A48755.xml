         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WORD
TO THE
DISSENTING BRETHREN.</head>
            <p>THere is none of you, that knows any thing of the
Proteſtants abroad, but hath heard of the fame
of <hi>M.</hi> JOHN DAILLE. Whoſe praiſe is ſo great
not only in the Reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> but in
this and other parts of the World, that I have ſome
hopes you may ſuffer your ſelves to be diſabuſed, by
a Man of ſuch Credit and Authority for learning and
piercing obſervation; for goodneſs and humility; for
modeſty, humanity, and all ſort of Vertues: and no
longer give any belief to what <hi>LEWIS du MOU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIN</hi>
hath written, or ſhall hereafter write againſt
this Church, or any member of it; when you ſee,
by the help of ſuch a glorious light as <hi>M.</hi> DAILLE
was, what kind of man this <hi>L. du MOULIN</hi> is;
of how ſmall judgment, fidelity, or care about what
he ſays; and of how great vanity, raſhneſs and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb facs="tcp:48661:3"/>
or rather rage and fury. Which render him ſo
unfit to be a Writer, that they quite blind his Eyes;
and will not let him underſtand any thing truly,
though never ſo clear in it ſelf, if it be contrary to
his humour.</p>
            <p>You will find this Character abundantly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made good
in what follows; which I have taken out of M. DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ILLE'S
Preface to his <hi>Vindication of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>
for two National Synods of <hi>France,</hi> Printed
at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> 1657. Read it I beſeech you pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
and conſider it impartially till you come to the
end; where you will find Mr. <hi>BAXTER</hi> agreeing
with him in his Cenſure of LEWIS du MOULIN.
Who is not ſo conſiderable, that any of thoſe learned
Divines whom he abuſes ſhould trouble themſelves to
give him an Anſwer: but leave the World to judge
of him by this Impartial Character of M. <hi>DAILLE;</hi>
who ſets him forth in his proper Colours.</p>

            <head>M. DAILLE his CHARACTER
OF
LEWIS du MO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LIN.</head>
            <p>WHen I think, as <hi>M. DAILLE begins
his Preface,</hi> of the calamitous state of
the Church at preſent, it calls to mind
that miſerable face of things, which that moſt eloquent
Writer S. <hi>Baſil</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">De Sp. Sancto Cap. 30.</note> expreſſes, in a no leſs ſad, than elegant
deſcription of his times. For as we ſuffer the reſt of tho<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
moſt grievous evils which he there mentions; ſo more
eſpecially, and above all the rest, that outragious diſcord
among fellow-citizens, and members of the ſame body;
which that excellent Father deſervedly deplores. <q>A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
ſo mad, that, as He ſays of his Countrymen, while
we fall furiouſly upon one another, we fall and are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
by one another; And if the enemy do not firſt
ſmite us,<note place="margin">☞</note> we receive a wound from our Auxiliary; And
if he be ſlain, our fellow-ſouldier riſes up againſt us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This hath hap'ned to many excellent Men in our
memory;</hi> and now we ſee thoſe who have had many
conflicts with our enemies, and still are in arms against
them <hi>(even that great Champion of the Proteſtant
cauſe among us, Dr.</hi> STILLINGFLEET) aſſaulted by
thoſe, who in all reaſon, ſhould have helpt to defend
them.</p>
            <p>A moſt deplorable thing this is, and never to be
enough lamented, that men ſhould have ſo little ſenſe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48661:4"/>
as after all the confuſions and calamities they have
brought upon themſelves and us, they ſhould again
put us in the ſame dangers; by joyning at this time,
in their fierce oppoſitions and calumnies, with thoſe
who endeavour to pull down this truly Reformed
Church. And that, when it is viſible they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſet up in its ſtead, nor can poſſibly come to
ſettle and be linkt together in any order: but are ſo
divided, that they muſt remain a great many little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
bodies, which will be apt perpetually to
claſh one with another, till they indanger the loſs even
of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>I know indeed, there are many honeſt men among
thoſe that diſſent from us, who have no ſuch intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and for their ſakes it is that I write what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
that they may help to convince their erring
neighbours of the evil deſign of ſuch men as would
perſwade them, the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath been
long looking toward Popery. Among whom <hi>LEWIS
du MOULIN</hi> is a notorious Ringleader: who hath
come forth (as that famous Writer <hi>M. Daillé</hi> complains
in his caſe) more than once or twice, with great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
againſt it: In his <hi>Patronus bonae fidei,</hi> in his late
<hi>Celeuſma,</hi> and now again in his <hi>true Account,</hi> as he
calls it (that is moſt falſe and ſcandalous report, for
ſo you ſhall ſee his words are to be expounded) <hi>of the
ſeveral Advances the Church of England hath made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Rome;</hi> Printed this Year 1680. In which he
hath the <hi>impudence</hi> (Be not angry with that Word,
you ſhall hear <hi>M. Daillé</hi> charge him with the utmoſt
height of impudence) to ſay; <hi>that this deſign of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Romiſh intereſt, hath been strenuouſly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and advanced ever ſince the happy Reſtauration of
his Sacred Majeſty, by the Prelatical party, is a thing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48661:4"/>
both ſo viſible and deplorable, that it ſtands not in ſo much
need of proofs, as of our tears. p.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>Which black Calumny ought to fill the heart of
every dutiful Child of this Church, with a juſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and hath moved me as ſoon as I meet with it
(which was not till the middle of the Chriſtmas holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days)
to beſtow a few ſpare hours, in ſhewing how
bad an ACCOUNTANT he is, and how little his
<hi>Bawlings</hi> ſignifie (it is <hi>M. Daillé</hi> his word, if I rightly
tranſlate <hi>Vociferationes)</hi> to which the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion
or ſurmiſe will ſo furiouſly provoke him, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to ſtop his mouth.</p>
            <p>This is none of my cenſure, but what that Great
Man ſays of him, as I ſhall ſhow preſently; when I
have only deſired (as he doth) it may be remembred,
<hi>that I am not the Aggreſſor; but only beat back the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
that are made upon our Church: and that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not</hi> (God forbid I ſhould) <hi>to drive Brethren out of
our Borders; but that they may not cast us out of theirs.</hi>
As this <hi>Lewis du Moulin</hi> endeavours to do; by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the World in hand, that our greateſt Divines are
marching towards Popery. In which lewd calumny
he fully juſtifies this character which <hi>M. Daillé</hi> gave
of him above XX. Years ago: and I have too much
reaſon to believe he is not grown better, but much
worſe, ſince that time.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he is <hi>tam puſilli animi,</hi> of ſo impotent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
a mind, that a very ſmall matter did not only put him
into a commotion, but into a rage: and made him go
out of his way to be revenged, with ſuch an animoſity;
that he <hi>exceeded the bounds not only of a Preface</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he declamed againſt that famous Divine) <hi>but of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
honeſty, reaſon and humanity.</hi> This is bad enough;
and yet, there is far worſe, which follows; For he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48661:5"/>
found him of ſo implacable a ſpirit; that,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He was not able to mitigate him by the
moſt courteous uſage and the civileſt ways he could
think of to appeaſe his fury. Which wrought nothing
upon a man, who had an ungrounded fancy working
in his head, and a great deal of choler boiling in his
breaſt; which made much ſtronger impreſſions upon
him, than all the reaſon and all the kindneſs in the
World. The buſineſs, in ſhort, was this, He had a
conceit that his Father was injured by <hi>M. Daillé.</hi>
Who thereupon ſent him a meſſage to aſſure him, that
there was no ſuch thing intended, as that which he
called a diſreſpect to his Father: and that He would
e're long ſatisfie the World in Print about it. <hi>But
this civility</hi> (they are his own words) <hi>produced nothing
but his ſcorn and mockery:</hi> and <hi>inſtead of anſwering, he
fell a raving; returning a reply to M. DAILLE his
Apologie, more like a mad man, than one that diſputed
either of Divine, or of Humane things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Which frency, wherewith he is ſtill poſſeſſed, and
I doubt is now incurable, muſt be his excuſe for the
reſt of his faults, which <hi>M. Daillé</hi> hath occaſion there
to mention. Among which I muſt not forget his
<hi>high preſumption;</hi> in writing a Book about the power
of the Eccleſiaſtical Presbytery, <hi>againſt the common
opinion of Proteſtants:</hi> and yet at the ſame time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning
thoſe that take the liberty to differ, as he
imagines, from Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi> What doth this man
think of himſelf, who is ſo bold, as to pretend to the
height of <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> though he diſſent from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
received Doctrine among Proteſtants; and yet
to charge thoſe with advancing towards <hi>Popery,</hi> who
diſſent only from him, or, at the moſt, only from
ſome Proteſtants: (as ſhall appear before we have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48661:5"/>
done) and that not ſo much in their opinions, as in
the explication of them?</p>
            <p>He would bluſh at theſe things, if it were not for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
another ill quality; noted there by <hi>M. Daillé:</hi> which
is, that he hath ſuch a forehead, <hi>as made him impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
deny that to have been written, which all men
read in Print.</hi> Give me leave to relate the ſtory as
<hi>M. DAILLE</hi> tells it, and in his own words: For it
will be of great uſe, to demonſtrate (1<hi>st)</hi> that he
writes meerly as his affections and paſſions dictate to
him, and therefore (2<hi>dly)</hi> there is as much reaſon to
believe he may as impudently affirm what is not true,
as he denyed what is: but above all (3<hi>dly)</hi> it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the very root of his malignity, and lay bare the
bottom of the quarrel he hath with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You muſt know then that</hi> M. Daillé <hi>had written,
that Dr.</hi> Twiſſe <hi>accuſed</hi> Peter du Moulin, <hi>(this</hi> Lewis
<hi>his Father) who deſerved very highly of the reformed
Church,</hi> of prevarication; in his hypotheſis concerning
the object of reprobation: whereby he had too much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
the Arminian cauſe, and pulled up by the roots the
Orthodox Doctrine of Election: <hi>Nay, that</hi> Twiſs <hi>feared
not to affirm the aforeſaid</hi> Peter du M. was filthily
miſtaken, and brought back again plain downright Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme
to the reformed Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unto theſe words of</hi> Daillé<hi>'s, this</hi> Lewis du Moulin
<hi>(pretending to vindicate the honour of his Father)
anſwers in ſo ſtrange a manner, that it is hard to ſay
(I write ſtill in</hi> M. D.<hi>'s words) whether his arrogance
and frowardneſs to</hi> M. Daillé, <hi>or his impiety to his
Father be moſt wonderful:</hi> For M. Daillé who most
highly praiſes his Father, he condemns; but Dr. Twiſs
his Fathers falſe Accuſer, he abſolves: The former he
inveighs againſt, in ſavage words, reproaches and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48661:6"/>
the later he adorns with great elogiums and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations:
M. Daillé he pronounces to be guilty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring
his Father; but Dr. Twiſs to have always treated
him honourably; and that he never hurt him in word or
in writing: or if there were any contention between
them, that it was handled friendly, and without any
aſperity.</p>
            <p>Thus this great <hi>Vindex</hi> or <hi>Defender</hi> of his Fathers
glory adventures to write againſt the common ſenſe
of all the World. For is there any body ſo ſtupid
(ſays <hi>M. D.)</hi> ſo void of ſenſe, that will think the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
of a Cauſe is not at all hurt by him, who ſays,
that <hi>he prevaricates?</hi> Is that Divine honourably trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by another, who accuſes him of the moſt <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Heterodoxy?</hi> and affirms he doth <hi>turpiter halluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari,</hi>
filthily miſtake; and promotes the cauſe of the
adverſaries, and deſtroys his own? Call you this
honourable and friendly uſage, when a man is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
traduced; and not only oppoſed by many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but ſaid to bring back again (and that coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
and without tergiverſation) that very here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
into his Church, which he had confuted? And
all this is not only ſaid, but pertinaciouſly contended
to be true, by Dr. <hi>Twiſs;</hi> to the great grief of all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Perſons, except this Son of <hi>P. du Moulin</hi>'s. Who
is ſo far from complaining of Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> that he is
highly pleaſed with him and huggs him. He cannot
indure Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> ſhould be reprehended, and denies
he injured his Father at all. <hi>O bonum &amp; pium filium!</hi>
(ſays <hi>M. D.</hi> upon this occaſion) O good and dutiful
Child! O how dear (may I ſay) are ſome opinions
to him? In which, whoſoever diſſents from him,
he will tear them in pieces: but let thoſe who agree
with them, ſay what they pleaſe of his beſt Friends,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48661:6"/>
nay of his own Father, they ſhall not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ail to have his
good word. <hi>Hence, hence are the tears,</hi> that he now
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>peaks of. This raiſed his Spleen, and put him into
a new fit of raving at our Divines; who jump not
with him in ſome opinions, which are falſly called
<hi>Arminianiſme.</hi> If <hi>they</hi> were but as rigid as he, in
ſome beloved Doctrines, for which he doted upon
Dr. <hi>Twiſs;</hi> we ſhould not have heard a word of their
inclination to Popery: But he would have found ſome
excuſe or other for all their faults; nay, been ſo kind
as to magnifie and praiſe them, whom he now abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates.
For in favour of Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> his Fathers
Sycophant (as <hi>M. Daillé</hi> calls him) he doth little leſs
than ſay, his Father was a <hi>prevaricator,</hi> a heretick &amp;c.
For he ſays his Father was not injured by Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi>
though he hath accuſed him of theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is his egregious piety to his Father, which
he ſo much boaſted of; and his ardent zeal for truth
and ſincerity; that is, his monſtrous fondneſs of his
own opinions.</hi> Which made him defend his Father in
ſuch a faſhion, that he betrayed him; ſo to vindicate
his honour, that he not only abſolved his fierce Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
from all blame, but beſtowed upon him very great
praiſes.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>this most vain man,</hi> ſays <hi>M. Daillé,</hi> doth not
underſtand that he hath this reward from Heaven for
his calumnies againſt me; <hi>(God ſo whirling about with
ſecret furies, his mind diſordered by a most unjuſt hatred)</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note>
that while he accuſes me of a falſe crime, he falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a true one himſelf: and violates his Fathers fame,
by a baſe prevarication; which he pretended was by
me abuſed.</p>
            <p>Take another inſtance of his extream great vanity,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
and proneneſs to rail at the greateſt men without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48661:7"/>
judging of them meerly by their according
with him in all things. There was a little difference
between his Father and <hi>Amyraldus;</hi> which was ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compoſed, as ſoon as they came to talk together:
and to the joy of all good men, they were not only
perfectly reconciled; but the common Friends of both
(and of the kindred of this <hi>Lewis)</hi> publiſhed the very
kind Letters which paſſed between them. Now
what doth this vain man and great admirer of ſuch
a Father? He preſently falls upon <hi>Amyraldus</hi> (as <hi>M.
D.</hi> tells us) and ſingles him out from all others, to
pour forth upon him <hi>omne virus,</hi> &amp;c. all the venom
and bitterneſs of his ſlander and evil ſpeaking. He
rakes up again all that they, like good men, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
ſhould be buried and forgotten: and is very
angry alſo, (as if it were an intolerable crime) that
he could ſee no body in all <hi>France,</hi> that would raiſe a
tumult and ſtorm together with him againſt thoſe that
were of <hi>Amyraldus opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How could a man more clearly and petulantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the judgment even of his own Father, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his will, and reſcind his Acts, as much as lay in
him? And if you would briefly know how he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Amyraldus</hi> (and ſo the leſs wonder at his virulent
declamations againſt our Divines) <hi>M. D.</hi> tells us, he
calls his doctrine, <hi>Fanatical, Heretical, Arminian,</hi>
(and that is as bad with him, if not worſe than <hi>Popery)
worthy to be interdicted and anathematiz'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is another demonſtration, that railing is his
peculiar gift, wherewith his ill nature and rancor
hath abundantly endowed him, and that when he is
in the fit of his fury, he cares not what words he
uſes; but pours forth, as was ſaid before, <hi>omne virus,</hi>
the whole venome that is in his heart, upon the leaſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48661:7"/>
occaſion. For he hath nothing worſe to ſay of a man,
than that he is an <hi>Arminian:</hi> (unleſs he add the word
<hi>Socinian)</hi> whom (it appears by a paſſage in his <hi>late
Account of the Church of Englands advances towards
Rome)</hi> he abominates more than he doth a <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
For ſpeaking there <hi>(Pag.</hi> 9.) of the bad Inſtruments
that have filled <hi>England</hi> with their Books, for theſe
Fifty Years laſt paſt, he ſays, <hi>they might have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
if they had only reliſhed of Popery, and had not
been infected with the venome of Arminianiſme, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianiſme,
Socinianiſme, and the Maximes of Mr. Hobbes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold here now a new inſtance (which I cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
omit) of the partiality and ungoverned paſſion of this
moſt vain man. Who inſtances there in the Books
of Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> Archb.
<hi>Bramhall,</hi> &amp;c. and would perſwade us they are of that
peſtilent nature; (though they abhorred <hi>Pelagianiſme</hi>
and <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi> &amp;c. more than himſelf: and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their doctrine to be that of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
not of <hi>Arminius)</hi> But lets Mr. <hi>Andrew Marvell</hi>
paſs quietly for an innocent Writer, nay extols and
admires him ſo much, as to call him (pag. 88.) <hi>that
Great man;</hi> though he hath in a moſt ſcurrilous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
abuſed the Venerable <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
therein the very dregs of <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi> or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe no leſs Heretical. For this great man of
his, has told the World that the <hi>Nicene Council im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
a NEW ARTICLE or Creed upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World:</hi> and called that explication which they
made of the Ancient Belief, concerning the Son of
God, (this being the very thing they inſiſted on, that
they made nothing New, but only declared what had
been always received from the beginning) <hi>a Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beriſh,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48661:8"/>
of their own impoſing; a Cant, wherein they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
others to follow them:</hi> and in plain terms repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
thoſe Fathers who were there aſſembled, as a
company of pitiful Dunces; who gave ſentence as
their Chaplains directed them.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>that Mr. Marvell,</hi> whom he and others ſo
much praiſe; but had he been of our ſide, ſhould have
been condemned to the Pit of Hell. Conſider I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you; what dreadful out-cries ſhould we have
heard; had any perſon among us ſaid any thing like
to this blaſphemy? This very <hi>Lewis</hi> would have
called him, <hi>that great Villain!</hi> or <hi>that great Devil,</hi>
or ſuch names as I cannot invent. But out of ſweet
Mr. <hi>Marvell</hi>'s mouth, it is received without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.
He may be a <hi>Socinian,</hi> or at leaſt an <hi>Arian,</hi>
or perhaps believe Nothing; and he has not a ſyllable
to ſay to him. Nay, he praiſes him; and, as if he
were ſome Heroe, ſets a mark of his very high eſteem
upon him. Mr. <hi>Marvell</hi> is not only <hi>a Great man;</hi> but
<hi>that Great man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what I pray? what is the cauſe of this ſtrange
difference, that he can ſee no fault in him, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but faults in others? But only this, that Mr.
<hi>Marvell</hi> is one of his own gang; a man for his tooth;
a great giber and biter; whoſe work it was to rail at
the Church of <hi>England.</hi> In ſuch a great man as this,
how ſhould he ſee any thing amiſs? This one new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Vertue dazled his eyes, and made him overlook
all his Vices.</p>
            <p>Which is a further demonſtration that the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which this <hi>Lewis du Moulin</hi> paſſes upon any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
is not worth a ſtraw; nor deſerves the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.
For he judges of men, as he loves or hates:
and he loves and hates, according as they agree with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48661:8"/>
him, or differ from him, in ſome opinions. Of which
he is ſo fond, that he will magnifie the very worſt of
men, if they be of his mind; but vilifie the beſt (as
we ſaw juſt now in the caſe of <hi>Amyraldus)</hi> if they be
of another.</p>
            <p>And what a faculty he hath in this, and how large <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
a Conſcience, to take the liberty to ſay any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe, with whom he is diſpleaſed; will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more fully in the remaining part of the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
which we find of him, in <hi>M. Daillé.</hi> Who,
leaving the conſideration of the reſpect this <hi>Lewis</hi> had
to his Father, and looking into the Diſputation it ſelf,
(wherein he pretended to give a ſtab to <hi>M. D.</hi>'s cauſe)
could find nothing in his Invective, though he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
examined it, but <hi>a great heap of lies, impostures,
calumnies, and railings; together with a little ſprinkling
of hiſtories and fables.</hi> Which cenſure of <hi>M. Daillé</hi>'s,
is the perfect and moſt exact Character, of his late
Invective againſt the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And the
fountain alſo from whence ſuch filthy ſtreams flow,
is the very ſame now that it was then; <hi>viz.</hi> His <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
cauſae,</hi> (to uſe <hi>M. D.</hi>'s words, which I may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
his <hi>zeal for the cauſe, in conjunction with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
degree of raſhneſs; which ſuggeſted to him ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of lies and impoſtures, that to the title of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
of Hiſtories</hi> (which then he had) <hi>might well be
added; and of Fables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the firſt of theſe, <hi>his lying, M. D.</hi> gives many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>
inſtances; and this among the reſt; that he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
affirms <hi>M. D.</hi> had changed his opinion, of
which he was X. Years before (as if he knew his
mind better than himſelf) and had rather be liſted
among the <hi>Arminians</hi> than keep his place among the
<hi>Contra-Remonſtrants:</hi> and that <hi>Amyraldus</hi> was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48661:9"/>
of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> With ſuch like ſtuff. Which is
juſt like to what he ſays now of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi>
that <hi>He believes the Government without Biſhops, to
be moſt conformable to the practice of the Apoſtles (p. 54.)
but ſince the Church has heaped upon him plurality of
Great Benefices, he would have us believe the Holy
Ghoſt has inſpired into him other thoughts concerning
the Engliſh Hierarchy, p.</hi> 60. Which is as true (and
no truer) as that <hi>Amyraldus</hi> was become a Patron
of the <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> and is in part confuted by himſelf
in the very next words; where he quotes his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
before his Apology for <hi>Archbiſhop Laud,</hi> for a
proof of his change; which was written (every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
knows) when the Church had honoured him
with none of her Preferments.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Of the <hi>ſecond</hi> alſo, his <hi>Impoſtures,</hi> there is no leſs
number than of his <hi>lies:</hi> As when <hi>M. Daillé</hi> ſays
that a <hi>few</hi> are of ſuch or ſuch an opinion; he makes
him to ſay there are <hi>None,</hi> &amp;c. But I ſhall not
trouble the Reader with that matter; nor give a
large account of the <hi>third, his Calumnies,</hi> though
he abound in them as much as any of the reſt, and
they grow up even to the height of <hi>impudence,
malignity</hi> and <hi>petulancy.</hi> It will be ſufficient to tell
you, that you may know the man (as <hi>M. D.</hi> ſpeaks)
that <hi>he branded, inſigni calumni<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, with a remarkable
and notorious calumny, all the Divines of their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
who had lived in France for Twenty Years paſt, or
that then were alive; both them that were of Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus
his opinion, and them that were not. The one
he condemned of Tyranny, the other of idleneſs and ſloth;
for ſuffering the Method of Amyraldus to reign among
them.</hi> Which clearly ſhows that this <hi>Lewis du
Moulin</hi> is as great an Enemy to the Divines of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48661:9"/>
the <hi>French</hi> Church, if they differ from him in the
leaſt Punctilio; as he is to thoſe of ours: and that
he cannot ſpeak with moderation, of any thing he
doth not like; but preſently it is <hi>Tyranny</hi> or <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
or ſome ſuch dreadful Monſter. He hath no
mercy upon the dead neither (as <hi>M. D.</hi> there ſhows)
but rails upon <hi>Blondell,</hi> as a favourer of <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme;</hi>
and upon that great Divine <hi>John Camero;</hi>
and ſpares not his own Uncle <hi>Andrew Rivet;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in that Synod (which this <hi>Lewis</hi> ſtomachs,
becauſe it did not throw <hi>Camero</hi> out of the Church)
he was the Author of a gentler opinion, than ſome
would have followed. For he hates any thing that
is gentle and ſoft; and nothing leſs will ſerve him
than <hi>proſcriptions, anathematiſmes,</hi> and the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
ſentences upon all that is not agreeable to his
Sentiments.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>fourth</hi> thing, his <hi>evil ſpeakings and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/>
               <hi>M. D.</hi> tells us his whole Diſputation abounds
with them. To omit what he ſays againſt him, I
will only inſtance in what he ſays of <hi>Amyraldus.</hi>
Whom he hath the impudence to call <hi>Ardelionem;</hi>
that is, <hi>a buſie fellow; a man of an unquiet mind,
that can fix no where.</hi> Never reflecting (ſo fiery is
his brain) that this reproach, as <hi>M. D.</hi> obſerves,
agrees far better to his own dear ſelf, who was <hi>a
Divine,</hi> forſooth, <hi>a Phyſician, an Historian, and a
Philoſopher:</hi> whereas <hi>Amyraldus</hi> never medled with
any thing but Divinity; which was his profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It would be endleſs to mention all that I have</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/>
               <hi>obſerved, to juſtifie that part of the Character which</hi>
M. D. <hi>before gave of him; that</hi> he being a man
whoſe mind is diſturbed with cauſleſs hatred, God is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48661:10"/>
pleaſed in a ſecret manner to make him thus vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
or giddy-headed: <hi>And it would be too tedious
to make good the reſt of his deſcription of him,
which is ſcattered here and there in</hi> M. D.<hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
where you may find him charged with</hi> abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities;
ridiculouſneſs; cavilling; ſpeaking things which
exceed the height of impudence; (and, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more ſcurrilous, or more frantick) inſana,
mad things, proceeding rather from anger and rage,
than from any judgment. <hi>In ſhort, he ſays he</hi> is a
trifler; a man of little reaſon; eaſily deceived with
ſlight appearances of things which are not; more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
than Plautus his Pyrgopolinices, contemning not
only thoſe that he oppoſes, but making little account of
other Writers on his ſide in compariſon with himſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe are hard ſayings, ſome will be apt to think:
But from thence the ſober Reader may be able to
judge what kind of creature this <hi>Lewis</hi> is. Whom
a perſon of ſuch temper as <hi>M. Daillé,</hi> who never
gives a hard word to our greateſt Adverſaries, but
in all his other Writings (as <hi>Lewis</hi> himſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes)
had expreſſed a moſt candid ſpirit, was forced
to handle in this manner. Nothing but ſuch a ſharp
and publick rebuke from ſo excellent and holy a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
as <hi>M. D.</hi> was, could do any good upon a man
of ſuch a cankered ſpirit. Who is not cured neither
by this ſevere method, but is rather grown more
virulent; and ſpits out his venom with greater ſpite
than ever againſt this poor Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> For the haughty fierceneſs of this cholerick man,
and his reſolution not to be convinced of any thing,
that is againſt his conceptions, appears in this.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48661:10"/>
That when <hi>M. Daillé</hi> had alledged an CXXIV.
Witneſſes from among the Fathers, and from the
Proteſtants LXV. and brought no fewer teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
than <hi>Twelve Hundred,</hi> for his opinion; This
Man, with great gravity, and no ſmall charity, blows
them all away with one ſtrong breath: Pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
that <hi>M. Daillé</hi> intended to cheat the unskilful;
and had either put theſe teſtimonies upon the rack,
or drawn them awry to another ſenſe. And this he
is pleaſed to ſay, <hi>Pythagoras like,</hi> without troubling
himſelf to prove it. For out of that multitude of
Teſtimonies, he only ſingles out a place of Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins;</hi>
which he, falſly too, pretends was not alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
intirely.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we do with ſuch a man as this? Or
what regard is to be had to him? who confidently,
and yet careleſly ſhoots his bolt; and expects to be
believed, becauſe he ſays it. And he ſays it in a
paſſion, or rather rage; and out of virulency of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
which makes him think he ſees things, which
are raiſed in his imagination meerly by his fury.</p>
            <p>And how little a thing will do it, you may judg <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/>
by this; that all this ill uſage of <hi>M. Daillé,</hi> was
only for maintaining that <hi>Chriſt dyed for all mankind;</hi>
and thereby put them into a poſſibility of ſalvation,
if they do not refuſe the Grace of God. A Doctrin
which the Church of <hi>England</hi> always aſſerted, and
is one of her Articles. And, though this man would
have the World believe the contrary, yet Maſter
<hi>Baxter</hi> hath plainly demonſtrated againſt him; that
herein he either betrays his ignorance, or too much
confidence. You may read his cenſure of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in his Preface to <hi>Diſputations about the Sacraments.</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48661:11"/>
Where (having taken notice that this <hi>Lewis</hi> had ſaid;
<hi>Amyraldus</hi> his Method pleaſed no body in <hi>England,</hi>
but one ſingle <hi>Baxter)</hi> he writes in theſe terms: <hi>I
meet with ſo many of Amyraldus mind in the point of
Univerſal Redemption, that if I might judge of all the
reſt by thoſe of my acquaintance, I ſhould conjecture that
half the Divines in England are of that opinion.</hi> And
then proceeds to ſhow it is a thing famouſly known,
that this hath been maintained by <hi>writing, diſputing</hi>
and <hi>preaching,</hi> by as excellent Divines, for learning,
judgment, holineſs, and powerful preaching, (as far as
we can judge) as ever <hi>England</hi> bred: mentioning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> and the Divines ſent
to the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> &amp;c. and then concluding, are
not theſe more than <hi>unus Baxterus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> And now I mention Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I ſhall deſire this
may be ſeriouſly conſidered, before I conclude; that if
<hi>Lewis du Moulin</hi> had that honeſt zeal in him to which
he pretends, he would have handled Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as
ſmartly, and complained of him as heavily, as he doth
of any men he hath accuſed for advancing towards
Popery. For though he be not of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> yet no body is more guilty of what he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to our Divines (if it be a crime) than Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi>
in what he hath written about <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification</hi>
and <hi>Chriſts imputed Righteouſneſs:</hi> which he explains
juſt as thoſe men whom he reviles; who have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
opinions about theſe things (I am well aſſured
from my acquaintance with them) than what Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf hath. Nor is there any man alive
among us, from whom <hi>Lewis du Moulin</hi> (unleſs he
have changed his mind) differs more, than he doth
from Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> For He defended, as <hi>M. Daillé</hi>
obſerves, this monſtrous opinion againſt his own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48661:11"/>
               <hi>Cyrus Molinaeus,</hi> that <hi>we are not juſtified by Faith,
but juſtified before we have faith.</hi> Which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
I am certain accounts a portentous Doctrine, as well
as <hi>M. Daillé:</hi> and hath alſo ſaid all that this <hi>Lewis</hi>
condemns in the diſcourſes of our Divines about <hi>faith,</hi>
in this ſhort ſentence; <hi>It is all one in my account to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Chriſt, and to become a Chriſtian.</hi> And yet we
hear not one word or ſyllable (ſuch is this man's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality)
of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s leading the way to Popery.
No, by no means; He hath ſomething of the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist</hi>
in him; and for that reaſon he ſpares him.</p>
            <p>But time was when ſuch fiery ſpirits as <hi>L. du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/>
reviled Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> juſt as he doth the Divines of
our Church. They ſaid he attributed too much to
good works; nay, according to Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Crandon,</hi> the Papiſts give no more to Works than He;
who taught the People, alſo they ſaid, to depend too
much upon their Guides; and in down-right terms,
He was called a <hi>Papist.</hi> And all, becauſe he left their
way of ſpeaking, and endeavoured to make things
plainer, and ſtate them more clearly: which is all the
fault they can now find with thoſe Perſons, whom
<hi>L. du Moulin</hi> hath belied, and groſly abuſed by his
Impoſtures. They may, if they think it worth their
while, beſtow a particular Anſwer upon him, and
ſhow how he hath miſrepreſented them: But in my
poor opinion they had better never trouble themſelves
with ſuch a Reviler: whom no body will mind, that
will conſider this deſcription which <hi>M. Daillé</hi> hath
given of him. Or it may be ſufficient for any of them
to ſay in the Name of the reſt (I beg their pardon, if
they think I take too much upon me in directing them
what to do) as <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> doth to thoſe, who would
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48661:12"/>
have had him made a particular reply to <hi>Mr. Crandons</hi>
Book; <hi>God hath given me my hours for better and more
uſeful works. And if any object that the ignorance of
common people is ſuch;</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>that confidence, and railing, and
ſlanders will take with them, as if they were valid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and therefore have need of as diligent confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I anſwer, it is not in my power to cure the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of ſuch people, nor the ſlanderous Tongues or Pens
of ſuch Writers. And if I muſt write as long as ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
tongues will make me work, or ignorant men need
it, then I ſhall have work enough to do, and my labours
be at the command of every man's Vices.</hi> If any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
farther, that our Divines are bound to vindicate
their Reputation, I may Anſwer for them, as <hi>Mr.
Baxter</hi> doth there, (in his Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>p.</hi> 7, 8.)
<hi>that God hath ſuffered the Calumniator to play his part ſo
groſly, &amp;c. that I think ſuch a tongue is not much capable
to diminiſh a man's reputation; nor is it any way needful
to vindicate it from ſuch.</hi>

               <hi>Yet if you pleaſe take</hi> Mr. Baxter<hi>'s judgment alſo
of this man, whereby you may ſee what kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
he hath, and how fully I have vindicated
their reputation. You may find it in his Preface to
the Diſputations about the Sacraments (Printed the

where he cenſures that Book, in the Preface to which
he uſed</hi> M. Daillé <hi>ſo courſly.</hi> A Book, <hi>ſays</hi> Mr. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that hath much learning, and more truth than is
fairly uſed; the face of it being writhen to frown upon
them that own it; and parties wronged, where truth
is defended; though, through the unhappineſs of the
diſtinctions, oft clouded when it ſeems to be explicated;
and through—I know not what, the controverſie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48661:12"/>
ſeldom truly stated. <hi>In ſhort, he ſays, it is an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

of PALPABLE UNTRUTHS IN MATTER
OF FACT:<note place="margin">☜</note> 
               <hi>But he lays no leſs than XX. Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in his way, where his Conſcience, he tells him,
may find them. At the end of which He cries out,
(mark it I beſeech you) This is the</hi> faithfulneſs of
the World! it ſhames and grieves me to ſay, of fiding
Divines; and as much almoſt to ſay, of a PUBLICK
PROFESSOR OF HISTORY IN OXFORD:
For the principal honour of an Historian, is his Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and impartial fidelity; and how much of that his
Preface to the Paraeneſis is guilty of, I leave to conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s judgment of the <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/>
and ſincerity of <hi>Lewis du Moulin:</hi> who ought
to ſubmit unto it, and confeſs himſelf unqualified to
be a Writer; For (if he ſpeak his true mind in his
late Book, <hi>p.</hi> 64.) he thinks <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>to be one of the
ſincereſt perſons in the World, and the moſt diſengaged
and free in his judgment.</hi> To which, would to God
our diſſenting Brethren would be pleaſed to truſt, and
to rely upon <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s judgment ſo far, as not to
give much credit to the <hi>reaſonings</hi> or <hi>reports</hi> of a man,
who hath ſuch a flaw in his underſtanding, and ſuch
partiality in his affections; as make the one very
weak, and the other very falſe. As it will be very
eaſie to demonſtrate, if they ſhall ſtill think him ſo
conſiderable, as to expect a particular diſcovery of all
the <hi>falſities, impostures</hi> and <hi>calumnies,</hi> wherewith his
late Book abounds, and hath groſly abuſed both the
dead and the living. I will now forbear the inſtances,
becauſe I had rather employ my time otherwiſe; and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48661:13"/>
would gladly hope they will ſo ſeriouſly weigh, what
opinion <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> and <hi>M. Daillé</hi> (who was no leſs
ſincere, and free, and diſintereſſed in his judgment)
have of this troubleſome man's ability and honeſty;
as to conſider how little credit is to be given to what
he hath written, in his <hi>moſt falſe Account of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
toward Rome.</hi> Where, for example, he affirms
in his furious rage and paſſion, (1.) <hi>that the Prelates
in their proceedings have exceeded the barbarouſneſs of
the Heathens in the perſecution of the Chriſtians, p.</hi> 27.
And (2<hi>dly) that there are ſome excellent Proteſtants
who ſee as much reaſon to abhor the ways of the Church
of England, as thoſe of Rome, p.</hi> 28. And, 3<hi>dly,</hi> (to
name no more of his mad, frantick ſayings) <hi>that the
beſt interpretation can be made of the preſent zeal of the
Prelatical party againſt the Papiſts, is, that they are
awakened by the love they have to their Benefices;</hi>
which they hoped the Papiſts being their kind Friends,
would have ſuffered them to have kept, but now ſee
they meant to have all, <hi>p.</hi> 46, 47. What is all this
but lewd and ignorant, if not malicious railing? It
being apparent (to ſpeak one word of the laſt) that
many Years before the late Popiſh Plot was diſcovered,
the Prelatical party, as he calls them, were not only
awake, but honeſtly gave the Nation warning of their
danger; and were the only men that did it; for the
<hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> were either then aſleep, or ſo ſilent,
that we could hear nothing of their fears of Popery;
but they lay ſtill,<note place="margin">☞</note> fondly hugging the Indulgence that
was given them. This is known to all thoſe, that
have obſerved any thing of the Paſſages of late Years:
and may ſatisfie all thoſe, who have any liſt to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
informed, how little conſcience this man makes of
what he ſays.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48661:13"/>
And therefore as they ought not to mind what he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/>
               <hi>hath</hi> written; ſo it would be well if they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how little good, or rather how much hurt they
are like to get by what he intends to write. I mean
his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory</hi> (which he tells us he deſigns)
compoſed by a man, who, in <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s opinion,
wants the principal quality of an Hiſtorian, <hi>veracity
and impartial fidelity,</hi> of which he ſays he is not much
guilty: <hi>His error in writing being</hi> (when <hi>he</hi> had to do
with him, and then he was publick Profeſſor of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
at <hi>Oxford) a multiplication of palpable untruths
in matters of fact.</hi> A foul error indeed; which made
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> aſhamed, and grieved his heart, as it
ought to do all other good men, to think there is no
more honeſty, among men that pretend Conſcience:
ſo much partiality in ſiding Divines; and ſo little
faithfulneſs in a publick Profeſſor of Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>O that all thoſe who now greedily entertain his
Books, would lay it to heart! and ſee how they ſuffer
themſelves to be miſled; and what kind of men they
are, who labour might and main, to make the breach
wider between us, than really it is. Let them open
their eyes and behold, what ſuch violent ſpirits are a
doing: diſgracing the beſt men in the Church, and
making the World believe they are marching towards
Popery; when they are ready, I am confident, to
lay down their lives rather than ſubmit to it, or move
one ſtep towards it; though they might thereby not
only keep all their dignities, but have the addition of
all that the Papacy is able to heap upon them. Why
are you ſo injurious to ſuch men? who are not angry
with you, becauſe you diſſent from them; if you did
not withall rail upon them; or love, and cheriſh thoſe
that do. This ſhows you would deſtroy them, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48661:14"/>
pull our Church in pieces. Men of this ſpirit are not
content, meerly not to be of it; but they would have
it not to be. Elſe we might all joyn together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Common Enemy; though we cannot in
all things agree one with another. But as long as
they take this courſe, <hi>they</hi> become alſo an Enemy, of
another ſort: and cannot juſtly blame thoſe of our
Church, who, they complain, cry out againſt them
and remember them of old things; when they ſhould,
in their opinion, only preach againſt the Papiſts.
Why do they tempt them to it, by their out-cries
againſt the Church; and by pouring forth ſuch ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
language in their Pamphlets?</p>
            <p>For my part, I hope the greateſt part of the Body
of <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> do not deſire to deſtroy this Church.
But they that rave ſo furiouſly againſt it, give too
much ground to men to believe otherways: the reſt
not contradicting them, nor endeavouring to bring
them to moderation. Which is a work now very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
for them (and which they are always calling
for from our men) if they would indeed ſecure this
Church; and perſwade the members of it, that they
deſire not to ſubvert or unſettle it. Let them openly
declare, that they look upon this <hi>Lewis du Moulin,</hi>
as no better than <hi>M. Daillé</hi> and <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
him: one, whoſe reports they do not truſt;
a vain Writer and malicious, if not mad and diſtracted.
Who endeavours to infuſe ungrounded jealouſies into
your minds of the Divines of our Church: many of
which he would perſwade you have for theſe Hundred
Years been moving towards Popery: at leaſt ſince
the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> have been
daily making nearer advances to it. And yet, when
by ſuch wicked ſuggeſtions, this Church was pulled
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48661:14"/>
down, how few of them were there found, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
unto Popery? How can theſe things conſiſt
together; that men ſhould be making their advances
nearer and nearer to <hi>Rome,</hi> and not then cloſe with
it? Why did not the corrupt party (as he terms it)
then follow their inclinations, if they had any that
way, when there was ſo great a temptation? All
their maintenance being then taken away; and little
hope left of ſeeing it reſtored?</p>
            <p>This, one would think, ſhould open your eyes, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/>
ſee how you have been cheated by evil minded men:
And make you more careful, how you involve your
ſelves in a new guilt of the ſame kind; by joyning
with thoſe among you, who would once more deſtroy
this Church, which hath been ſo miraculouſly reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
and had not been in ſuch danger, as now it is,
if it had not been for the miſerable havock and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which you made by the laſt War. For which,
I doubt, you have not ſhed any tears; nor (to uſe this
man's own words, <hi>p.</hi> 4.) are touched as you ought to
be: though he would have us believe <hi>(p.</hi> 42.) <hi>your life
is a continual practice of repentance.</hi> For then, he that
ſays this, would not have had the confidence to affirm,
almoſt in the ſame breath, <hi>(p.</hi> 41.) that they who are
diſtinguiſht from us, by the Names of Puritans, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
Independents, Fanaticks, &amp;c. <hi>are the beſt

and Puritans, <hi>have above all others</hi> (mark I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48661:15"/>
               <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers.</hi> If this
be to repent; I know not what it is to juſtifie your

the expreſſion; for I intend it only to ſuch men
as <hi>Lewis du Moulin;</hi> who if he had truly repented,
would in ſtead of writing ſuch a Book as this, have
made an honeſt acknowledgment in Print, that <hi>you
are the true cauſe of all our preſent evils.</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> Some of you

down, the Liturgy exploded by the very beſt of you.
And then, the worſer ſort of you plotted the death of
the King: upon which followed, the baniſhment of
the Royal Family into a ſtrange Land: Where, if one
of them changed his Religion; I pray conſider to
whom that, and all the miſchievous conſequences of
it, ought originally to be imputed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> I would proſecute this a little further; if I did not
think it better to leave you to follow it your ſelves,
and preſs it home, in your own conſciences: which
you may do without being angry at any body, but
your ſelves. Whereas, ſhould I attempt it, perhaps
you would be as much inraged at me, as you were
at the Author of the <hi>Friendly Debate.</hi> Whom you
ought to have heartily thankt (though now you will
ſcarce forgive him) for his plain dealing; in calling
to your mind all that folly and madneſs (to omit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

had overturn'd the beſt conſtituted Church in the

bare relating theſe things, a reproachful uſage of you:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48661:15"/>
Nor would <hi>Lewis du Moulin</hi> have again blown the

<hi>viz.</hi> about the inclination of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> to Popery.</p>
            <p>Which is a calumny deviſed meerly to kindle the

and he will be convinced, if he be not one of thoſe
who have eyes to ſee, and ſee not; that <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>
hath been as much to blame, as any body; if there be
any fault to be found about ſuch matters. And for
his clearer conviction I will point him to another paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
in the Book there quoted, <hi>(Diſput. of Juſtification,
p.</hi> 94.) like to which he will not eaſily find in the
men whom he hath expoſed to the Peoples hatred. <hi>I

moſt I know (ſome yet living) in a publick Meeting ſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note>
               <hi>that Biſhop</hi> Uſher, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Gataker <hi>affirmed, that the

of Juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this he may know ſomething of <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s
mind, and other eminent Divines of his acquaintance;
and therefore either leave his bawling, or in his next
Book open his Mouth wider (as there is reaſon) and
tell the World, with tears running down his cheeks,
that alas! alas! there is a corrupt, rotten party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48661:16"/>
the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> too: who are as bad as thoſe
among the Epiſcopal Clergy. For every body knows
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> is a leading man, and hath a great many
Followers; and there are other eminent Divines alſo
of his mind: who muſt all now be proclaimed, by
this great and careful Defender of pure Religion, to
be in the number of thoſe, who endeavour to bring
in Popery, <hi>at leaſt a Mungrel one</hi> (as he ſpeaks, <hi>p.</hi> 41.)
<hi>that comes pretty near to the true Popery.</hi>
            </p>

will ſcarce oblige <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> ſo much, as to injure
him with moderation and modeſty (which as the
World goes, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> there tells us, he muſt take for
a favour) I mean, acquit him from the charge of

how little he will care for his, or any other mens cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of this kind, (and therefore, why ſhould our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
value them?) for he may read, if he pleaſe, in

               <hi>what it is that goes under the name of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianity

and behave your ſelves ſo, that we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,

We will let him rail, and vomit up all the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs

which will not let him underſtand aright. For I
am as ſure there are no ſuch Divines, not one; much

that <hi>Amyraldus</hi> was no Patron of the Jeſuits; <hi>M.
Daillé</hi> no Arminian; Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> no Papiſt; and that
they are not perſecuted, who are ſuffered to write
even ſuch Books as this without any puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But I will leave thoſe Divines, as I ſaid, to purge
themſelves, if they think fit; or turn him over to
the Author of the <hi>Friendly Debate:</hi> who can, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
if he will attempt it, make this <hi>Lewis</hi> repent at

ſuch reproach: When it is viſible, in my poor opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
it is nothing ſo ſharp and ſevere upon the <hi>N. C.</hi>
as <hi>M. Daillé</hi> is upon their Champion <hi>L. du Moulin.</hi>
And yet (ſuch is their partiality, of which I pray God
they may all repent) they never ſpeak of <hi>M. Daillé,</hi>
but as of a holy Man of an excellent temper, who is
highly reverenced by all the Party; but generally
condemn the other, as a prophane and ſcurrilous
Writer, an Enemy of the People of God, and I know
not what. O the power of <hi>studium cauſae,</hi> as <hi>M.
Daillé</hi> calls it, zeal to ſerve the cauſe, and affection to
a ſide! I beſeech again the Father of lights to give
them a better mind; and us all grace thoroughly to
ſearch and try our ways; and to ſee and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our errors.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> That's a good Prayer, will ſome perhaps be apt to
ſay, who diſlike all the reſt, and we have a wiſh for
you, as you have for us; that you would ſee and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48661:17"/>
the preſent error that is among you, in accuſing
us of intending to deſtroy the Government. Is not
that as great an out-cry every where, as this of <hi>du
Moulin</hi>'s? I anſwer ſincerely; there are many, I
believe, very jealous of you, and declare it freely:
But their ſuſpicions are raiſed by ſuch kind of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
as his; which clearly demonſtrate, they think,
that the Diſſenters, at leaſt ſuch as He, intend to
ſtir up the hatred of the People againſt the Men of
our Church, as much as againſt the Papiſts, if not
more: (For He mentions the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain, p.</hi> 26.
with far more reſpect, than he doth our Divines)
the conſequence of which can be nothing elſe, than
an indeavour to pull us in pieces.</p>
            <p>But for my part, as I ſaid before, I am willing
to hope the main body of <hi>N. C.</hi> are not ſo diſpoſed:
though there be factious ſpirits among them (too
many) that would thruſt them forward to our, and
their own deſtruction. They underſtand better, and
are better inclined, I hope, than to pull down a
well ſetled Government; when, it is apparent, as
I have noted above, they can ſet up none in the
room of it: And the beſt Demonſtration they can
give of this, will be to diſown ſuch Writers as <hi>L.
du Moulin,</hi> by ſome publick Declaration: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
aſſure us, that they mean not to diſturb the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is eſtabliſhed; but will
heartily joyn with us, againſt the Papiſts, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and maintain it: deſiring only to have their
own juſt liberty under that Government; which
they will highly deſerve, when they have contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to its ſupport.</p>
            <p>As for the project of <hi>Lewis du Moulin,</hi> it is as vain
as himſelf; for were the Ceremonies (which he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48661:18"/>
moſt unconſcionably reviles as Popiſh) removed out
of the way, it would not make up the breach: but
the main body of <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> would ſtill remain
divided from us; becauſe they will not admit of a
preſcribed form of Prayer. Nay, He himſelf, I have
too much reaſon to believe, would not be ſatisfied,
unleſs the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to the ſenſe of Mr. <hi>Calvin:</hi> which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
down with very great numbers of the Diſſenters,
no more than with them among us, againſt whom he
hath ſpit out all this venome.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not inlarge upon this ſubject, having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
buſineſs that expects me; now that the <hi>Twelve
days</hi> are expiring. In the midſt of which, I told you,
his Book firſt coming to my hand, I imployed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of them, as you ſee, in giving this ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it, and of him. Who may thereby be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that we are not ſo ill taught, as to ſpend our
time <hi>in the Play-houſe, or with a Pack of Cards:</hi> (which
he would have you believe is the common divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Miniſters, <hi>p.</hi> 36.) though I think that had
been far more innocent, than to be writing ſuch Books
as his. For therein I ſhould, at the worſt, only have
done a little harm to my ſelf: whereas his buſineſs is
to abuſe the Nation with falſe reports; nay to poiſon
it with deſtructive opinions; and t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſlander thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
as men that <hi>ſatisfie themſelves with the profeſſion
of a ſuperficial piety, (p.</hi> 35.) who are moſt laborious
in their ſtudies; devoutly attend the Divine Service;
and make it their buſineſs by Word and Writing to do
good to Men.</p>
