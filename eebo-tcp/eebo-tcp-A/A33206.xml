            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Difference of the Caſe, between the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of Proteſtants from the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the Separation of Diſſenters
from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SInce the happy <hi>Reformation</hi> of this Church, they
of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſwaſion have with their utmoſt
Art inſinuated, that our Reformation proceeded
upon Principles Deſtructive of all <hi>Order and Government</hi>
in the Church; and that it naturally tends to <hi>endleſs
Separations.</hi> To this end they have laid hold upon that
advantage which the Diviſions amongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have
offered them, and ſaid that the Reaſons upon which
we ground <hi>our Separation</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> will
hold to juſtify the <hi>Separation</hi> of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And the Truth is ſome of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
have been ſo Indiſcreet, to ſay no more, as to
alledge the ſame thing. And I am very ſorry that Men
of the ſame Perſwaſion with us in Oppoſition to the
Impious Errors and Practices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
ſhould give ſo much Countenance to that grievous Charge
upon the Reformation, as ſome of them have done. The
<hi>Papiſts</hi> are too much beholden to them for giving the
Occaſion of this Accuſation: but to joyn with them
in the ſame Charge, is too great a kindneſs in all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and indeed Deſtructive of the Common Cauſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62890:3"/>
of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> by inſinuating one of theſe two
things, either that there was no Reaſon for this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
on either part; or elſe that notwithſtanding
our pretended Reformation, we are ſtill as bad as the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for otherwiſe they cannot have the
ſame Reaſon to ſeparate from us, that we had at firſt
to ſeparate from that Church.</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour with Gods help to ſhew in a ſhort
and plain Diſcourſe upon this ſubject, that the Caſes
are vaſtly different; and that we have very good
Reaſons wherewith to juſtify our Separation
from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that the Diſſenters who
forſake our Communion cannot by any good Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from thoſe Reaſons, warrant their ſeparation
from our Church.</p>
            <p>In this attempt, I am ſenſible that I have Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
on both ſides; and that it often happens to be
a nice and hazardous buſineſs to determine between
two Extremes. But I hope there is no reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
great Danger in this Caſe; ſince it is the ſame
falſe Charge againſt the Reformation, in which theſe
Extreme Parties agree; and it is of that nature, that 'tis
all one whether I confute it againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or againſt
the <hi>Proteſtant Separatiſts,</hi> for if it be diſproved againſt
one, 'tis ſhewn to be unjuſt in both.</p>
            <p>This is our Caſe, that as we Charge thoſe of the
Separation from our Church with <hi>Schiſm,</hi> ſo do the
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> Charge us of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with
<hi>Schiſm</hi> too: But with this Difference, as we pretend, that
we have good Reaſon for that, ſo have not they for
this. For <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a <hi>Cauſeleſs Separation from a Church.</hi>
And we think we may appeal to all Diſintereſſed and
Judicious <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that we have ſhewn our Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from <hi>Rome</hi> to be grounded upon Juſt and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Cauſes; but that the Diſſenters have ſhewn none
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62890:3"/>
ſuch for their Separation from us. And when all is
done it ſhould not incline any Man to think that the
Truth is either with the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> or with the <hi>Diſſenter,</hi>
becauſe the Charge of <hi>Schiſm</hi> is laid by the <hi>Romaniſt</hi>
againſt us, and by us againſt the <hi>Separtiſt</hi> with equal
Confidence, unleſs he ſees withal that it is laid with
equal Juſtice.</p>
            <p>For it was not indeed to be expected, but that when
ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> demanding a farther Reformation, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from our Church, this pretence would ſoon
after be ſet on foot both by thoſe of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and by thoſe of the Separation. It lay fair for
them both, and right or wrong was likely to be taken
up by both; ſince it would ſerve exceedingly well to
help a bad Cauſe and to give popular colours to the
weak Arguments, both of the one and of the other
ſide. The <hi>Romaniſt</hi> was not likely to forego ſuch an
advantage as the Separation of our Diſſenters gave him,
to diſgrace the Reformation amongſt thoſe that loved
Unity. Nor was the <hi>Separatiſt</hi> likely to omit that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
which our Reformation gave him, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his Separation from us under the notion of a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Separation from <hi>Rome,</hi> to thoſe that abhorred
<hi>Popery.</hi> And therefore it will ſtand all Diſcreet perſons
in hand to weigh the merits of the Cauſe on both ſides,
and not to admit any prejudice againſt our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in favour either of the <hi>Papiſt</hi> or the <hi>Sectary,</hi> meerly
becauſe they both ſay that in juſtifying our Separation
from the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> we vindicate the Separation of the
<hi>Sectary</hi> from our ſelves.</p>
            <p>I muſt not in this narrow Compaſs pretend to enter
upon a Diſcuſſion of the ſeveral Queſtions controverted
between us and our Adverſaries on both ſides: But ſhall
take it for Granted, that what has been ſaid in Anſwer
to the ſeveral Objections of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> againſt our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62890:4"/>
Communion has been well argued againſt <hi>them:</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that in charging the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with thoſe
ſeveral Corruptions in Doctrine and Practice, which
have made her Communion Intolerable, we have ſaid
upon each point no more than what has been well
proved againſt <hi>that Church;</hi> and which upon all fit
Occaſions, we ſhall, by the Grace of God, be ready
to make good again. But my principal deſign is to
ſhew that there is no manner of Inconſiſtence in the
way we take to vindicate our ſelves from <hi>Schiſm</hi>
charged upon us by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with thoſe
principles upon which we accuſe our Diſſenting Brethren
of that fault, who ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
And that the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> cannot take our Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Separation of the Diſſenters, to condemn
our Reformation; nor the Separatiſt our Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Communion of the <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in forſaking the Communion of our Church.</p>
            <p>This I conceive will be made to appear. 1. by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the Reaſons on both ſides; thoſe by which
we pretend to juſtify our Separation from the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> and thoſe upon which the Diſſenters lay the
ſtreſs of their Separation from us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By Comparing them together, that we may
Judg wherein and how far theſe Caſes agree with,
or differ from one another.</p>
            <p>In laying down the Reaſons on both ſides, I ſhall
begin with the grounds upon which this Church ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and then proceed
to thoſe upon which the Diſſenters ſeparate from us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> charging us with Schiſm
we Anſwer in general: That our Separation from her
was neceſſary by Reaſon of thoſe Corruptions in her
Communion, which we could not comply with againſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62890:4"/>
the Conviction of our Conſciences. More particularly
we ſay, That this Church of <hi>England</hi> had no dependence
upon the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
She might not lawfully throw off, and that She does
not owe any Subjection to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but
had juſt Power without asking his leave, or ſtaying for
his Conſent, to Reform Her ſelf. And withal that
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ought to have Reformed Her ſelf,
as we have done, ſince there were moſt neceſſary
Cauſes for ſo doing; the Communion of that Church
being defiled with the profeſſion of thoſe damnable
Errors, and the practice of thoſe Superſtitions and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries
which we have done away. To this purpoſe
we challenge thoſe of that Communion with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of their <hi>Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> their
<hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs,</hi> their <hi>Service in an unknown Tongue,</hi>
their <hi>half Communion,</hi> their <hi>Worſhip of Images,</hi> their
<hi>Adoration of the Hoſt,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whereof the Communion of that Church doth
in great part Conſiſt. We acknowledge that we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from them in theſe things, when we Reformed
our ſelves; but in ſo doing we were not guilty of <hi>Schiſm</hi>
from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that if nothing elſe
were to be ſaid, becauſe this Church owes no Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to that: but withal that the Cauſes of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
being ſo neceſſary as we pretend them to be,
the Separation of Communion that enſued upon our
being, and their hating to be Reformed, was on our
ſide juſt and neceſſary upon that account alſo, and
therefore not <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that our Anſwer is twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Church of <hi>England</hi> being by no kind of
Right, ſubject to the <hi>Roman,</hi> or any Forreign Biſhop,
<hi>had full Power and Authority without asking leave of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62890:5"/>
to Reform her ſelf.</hi> And this we ſay would have
cleared her from the Imputation of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> if the cauſes
of the Reformation had not been ſo neceſſary as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they were. If before the Reformation there had
been no Unlawful conditions of Communion required
in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches, and all the fault that could have
been found in them, had amounted to no more than
bare Inconveniences and Imprudence in the manner of
their Diſcipline, or in ordering the outward Mode of
Worſhip; it had yet been free for the Church of <hi>England</hi>
to have Reformed thoſe leſſer faults within her ſelf,
though no other Church would have done the like.
And though for ſuch defects remaining in other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<hi>abroad</hi> ſhe <hi>ought not</hi> to have <hi>Separated</hi> from their
Communion; yet ſhe <hi>might</hi> very juſtly and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
<hi>free her ſelf</hi> from them <hi>at home.</hi> But if a <hi>Forreign</hi>
Church ſuppoſe that of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould hereupon have
abſtained from the Communion of this Church, till we had
returned to the former <hi>Inconvenient,</hi> though <hi>Lawful</hi> Rites,
and Cuſtoms, that <hi>Forreign</hi> Church had been guilty
of Schiſm in ſo doing. And if the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
not willing to part with her <hi>Liberty</hi> and to proſtitute
her <hi>Authority</hi> to the Uſurpation of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
ſhould have adher'd to her own Reformation, ſhe had not
been guilty of the breach of Communion, following
that her Reſolution; becauſe ſhe had done nothing,
but what was within the compaſs of her juſt Power to
do, and in which ſhe was not liable to be controuled
by any other Church.</p>
            <p>We ſay with St.<hi> Cyprian, </hi>that<hi> the Epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church ought to be but one,<note place="margin">Ad Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum, <hi>Ep.</hi> 52.</note> ſpread abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Biſhops, many in number, but heartily agreeing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>But with the ſame excellent Man we ſay too,
that<hi> it is Equal that every one of them ſhould have a part
of the Flock aſſigned to him,<note place="margin">Ad Cornclium, <hi>Ep.</hi> 55.</note> which he is to Govern, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62890:5"/>
that he is to give an account of his management
to God. </hi>Which he ſaid, in aſſerting the Freedom
of the<hi> African </hi>Churches from Subjection to the<hi>Roman. </hi>This we think is juſtly applicable to our
Caſe.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> is a <hi>National Church,</hi> once
indeed under the Uſurpation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop, and
at length reſcued from that ſervitude; we are at preſent
United together by Common Rules for Government and
Worſhip, Conſulted upon and agreed unto by the
Biſhops and Presbyters in Convocation, and then made
Laws to all the particular Churches of this Kingdom,
by the Authority of the Soveraign. Theſe Laws ſhew
the Reformation of the Church; And they do not
want any Authority they ought to have, for wanting
the conſent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop, upon whom we have
neither <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> nor <hi>Civil</hi> Dependence. For if any
one ſingle Biſhop of the <hi>African</hi> Church might deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
Cauſes, and judge matters of Eccleſiaſtical cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
(which yet was ſeldom done in things of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without the advice of Collegues when the Church
had reſt from Perſecution) and this without allowing
Appeals to <hi>Rome;</hi> much more may the Biſhops of a
whoſe Chriſtian Kingdom confederate together to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Church matters Independently upon the See of
<hi>Rome,</hi> eſpecially being required thereunto by their
Chriſtian Soveraign to whom they all owe Subjection
and Obedience in all things, ſaving their Common
Chriſtianity. So that if the Cauſes of the Reformation
had not been ſo weighty as indeed they were, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the Authority by which it was effected; our
Separation from <hi>Rome</hi> thereupon enſuing was wholly
Guiltleſs on our part, it being neceſſary unleſs we would
ſubmit to the Unjuſt and Tyrannous Claims of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Biſhop.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62890:6"/>
2. To the charge of <hi>Schiſm</hi> laid againſt us by the
<hi>Romaniſt,</hi> we Anſwer alſo, that <hi>the conditions of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
required in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, were many of them
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful to be ſubmitted unto;</hi> ſince we could not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with her without profeſſing Doctrines that are
plainly contrary to Gods Word, nor without doing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things that are clearly and particularly forbidden
by it. And ſince it is not in the Power of any Man
or Church, to diſpenſe with our Obligations to the
Laws of God, we could not be obliged to preſerve Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Adherents,
upon thoſe Terms. But becauſe Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ought to be preſerved, they ought to have put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
thoſe Scandals from amongſt themſelves, which
ſince they have not done, though the <hi>Separation</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
on both ſides, yet the <hi>Schiſm</hi> is not ours but theirs
only.</p>
            <p>And therefore we farther ſay that if the Corruptions
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (which God forbid) ſhould ever
come to be eſtabliſht in this Church of <hi>England</hi> again
by the ſame Authority that has aboliſht them; it were
not only Lawful, but a neceſſary Duty to ſeparate from
the Communion of this Church in that Caſe. We have
that Reverence of Church Authority, and of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magiſtrate, that we will ſubmit to their Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
in all things wherein God has left us to our
own Liberty. But if they Command us to do things
contrary to his Determination, and to take that liberty
which he has not given us, we muſt remember that
we are to obey God rather than Man. We have that
ſenſe alſo of the miſchief of Diviſions and Separations,
and of the Duty of maintaining Church-Communion,
that if the Laws of God be but obſerved, we are not
only ready to comply with what our own Superiours im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon us, for the ſake of Peace and Unity at home;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62890:6"/>
but if we were to go abroad, we ſhould obſerve the
Cuſtoms of other Churches, though perhaps very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from ours, and this for the ſake of maintaining
one Communion of Chriſtians every were. But neither
abroad, nor at home can we purchaſe Unity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
at ſo dear a rate as to break Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for it.</p>
            <p>We know it is a good thing for all the parts of the
Church to have but one Communion, but we <hi>muſt not
do evil, that</hi> even this <hi>good may come:</hi> And leaſt of all
that evil which Church Communion and Church Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
were in great part deſigned to prevent. For
as we believe that Chriſt formed his Diſciples into a
Spiritual Society, ſo we have great reaſon to conclude
that one main end hereof was, that by the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſtians under their Governours, the holy
Truths and Laws of God concerning his Worſhip and
our Salvation might be more advantageouſly held forth
to the World, and more effectually guarded and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
And therefore to keep this Communion <hi>one</hi>
as much as in us lies, we will do any thing required by
our Superiors that God has left us free to do or not:
But to deny that Holy Truth or any part of it, or to
break any of thoſe Divine Laws, for the ſake of which
this Communion it ſelf was Inſtituted, neither of theſe
things dare we do to prevent Diviſions and Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And we are as ſure that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Adoration
of the Hoſt, Worſhiping of Images, Praying to the Dead</hi>
and <hi>Praying in an unknown Tongue,</hi> are Repugnant to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
expreſs Texts of Scripture, not to ſay to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Senſe and Reaſon: We are I ſay as ſure that they
are the plain Laws and Truths of God to which theſe
things are contrary; and withal that to guard theſe
Truths God Inſtituted <hi>a Church,</hi> and <hi>a Communion of
Saints,</hi> as we are that there was any ſuch thing as a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62890:7"/>
Church Inſtituted, or Church Communion required.
And truly if Separation, when there is ſuch cauſe for
it, as we pretend, were not a neceſſary Duty, it might
becom the Duty of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be United in Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Impieties and Damnable Errors. And I think no
body will ſay that in ſuch things one Communion is
either to be deſired or excuſed, but rather to be broken,
and that every Man is concerned as much as his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is worth to break away from it. And we are
certain it can never be neceſſary to any Mans Salvation
to be a <hi>Schiſmatick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this account, we ſay, that they who in Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s days choſe to lay down their lives, rather
than return to the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
were ſo far from being <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> that they were
Gods Martyrs in ſo doing. And had it been, or ſhould
it be our lot to have this choice ſo hard to Fleſh and
Blood offered to us; we truſt, that through the mighty
Grace of God, we ſhould follow the Faith and Patience
of thoſe holy Men and Women, who Sealed this Cauſe
with their Blood, meekly ſuffering under the Diſpleaſure
of that Juſt Authority, the Unjuſt Commands where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they could not honeſtly obey. This plain, though Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
account, we give of the Separation of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
no more in our own Defence againſt that Church,
than we can prove, we have Reaſon to think our ſelves
ſafe on that ſide.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us now ſee upon what Principles and by what
pleas the Diſſenters Defend their Separation from the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> To us therefore charging them
with <hi>Schiſm</hi> upon this account, they Anſwer alſo, That
our Communion is <hi>Corrupt,</hi> and that they cannot with
a <hi>ſafe Conſcience</hi> continue in it; and that they are bound
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62890:7"/>
for <hi>greater Purity</hi> of Worſhip and Ordinances, to divide
from us. But in making out this general Anſwer they
do not all go the ſame way, nor do ſome of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thoſe to be good Reaſons for a Separation, which
others think ſubſtantial enough. That in which moſt
of them do agree is in aſſigning ſome <hi>Ceremonies</hi> injoined
in our Church, concerning which ſome of them ſay
that they are Unlawful to be uſed in Gods Worſhip;
others of them, that there is great cauſe to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be Lawful or not; And theſe dare not join
in our Communion with Scrupulous and Unſatisfied
minds. The things of this ſort are the <hi>Sign of the
Croſs in the office of Baptiſm,</hi> (though this be made by
the Miniſter only) <hi>Kneeling in the Act of Receiving the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi>
and <hi>the Miniſters wearing a Surplice in Publick
Worſhip.</hi> The other Faults they find with the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
however they are thought by the Generality of
Diſſenters to be a Reaſon ſufficient to ground Separation
upon, are not I think produced by thoſe that ſhould
beſt underſtand the Cauſe, as amounting to make our
Communion directly Unlawful. But yet there are
that ſay, they <hi>ought not to prefer a worſe mode of ſerving
God before a better:</hi> And the mode which themſelves
obſerve being better they are to prefer that before ours,
and therefore to ſeparate from us for the moſt part.
Others go yet further from us, and take Liturgies, and
preſcribed Forms of Prayer to be Unlawful to be uſed,
or at leaſt ſuſpect them ſo to be. And all theſe do Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
diſlike the Form of <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Epiſcopacy: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they ſeem not to lay the ſtreſs of their Separation
upon that, ſince they acknowledge our Churches to be
true Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and if it were not for other
things, might be Lawfully Communicated with, although
they are governed by Biſhops. And becauſe the Civil
Authority concurs with the Eccleſiaſtical in requiring
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62890:8"/>
Conformity to our Church Laws, they do not pretend
thoſe Laws to be enforced by an Authority to which
they are not bound to ſubmit. And therefore as far
as I can find they rather chuſe to Juſtify their Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the account of the Unlawfulneſs, or ſuſpected
Unlawfulneſs of the things Impoſed, or upon the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of a better Communion then ours is. But out of
theſe I muſt except the <hi>Independents</hi> who acknowledge
no other Church to be agreeable to the Word of God,
but ſuch a Company of Chriſtian People United one to
another by a particular Covenant under Officers of their
own chuſing, as can at once Aſſemble in the ſame place
for the Worſhip of God. And theſe Men think the
very Conſtitution of our Church to be reaſon enough for
a Separation from it. I will take notice of no other
Diſſenters at preſent, but thoſe that Separate upon ſome
one, or more of theſe grounds; which may be reduced
to three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a National Church Authority, is an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
upon particular Congregations, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be the only Churches of Chriſts Inſtitution,
and that every ſuch Church has full Power in it ſelf to
order all things relating to Worſhip and Diſcipline, and
is not of right accountable to any other Authority for
the order it ſhall take to govern it ſelf in theſe things;
And therefore the <hi>Independents,</hi> as I ſaid, think themſelves
clear of the Guilt of <hi>Schiſm</hi> as having Separated from
a Church which is not of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Inſtitution. For they
take an Independent Congregation only, to be ſuch.
But yet theſe are willing to come in with the other
Diſſenters for their Intereſt in the next ground of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
upon which all of them, as far as I can Judge, hope
to find the ſureſt Footing; And that is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the conditions of our Communion, thoſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62890:8"/>
namely before mentioned, are not Lawful for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to Submit unto. And here I include thoſe that do
but Scruple the Lawfulneſs of thoſe things which are
injoined in our Church. For they that ſay poſitively
they are Unlawful, and they that but ſuſpect them to
be Unlawful, produce the ſame Arguments, the former
to juſtify their <hi>Peremptorineſs,</hi> the latter their <hi>Scruples.</hi> The
Reaſons I ſay upon which they go are the ſame, only
they work up ſome of them to a greater height of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
then others are come to; and ſome again they
leave altogether doubtful what to ſay, whether to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
for us or againſt us. They agree in blaming our
Church for requiring things to be done in Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
which he has not Commanded, ſome alſo of which
have been and ſtill are done by <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their <hi>Idolatrous</hi>
Services, from whom we ought to depart in all things
that are not neceſſary to be done. Upon theſe grounds
ſome pretend to be <hi>ſure,</hi> others to be <hi>afraid</hi> that to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their Children <hi>to be ſigned with the ſign of the Croſs,</hi>
to <hi>Kneel at the Communion,</hi> to <hi>be preſent at Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
where a Surplice is worn,</hi> and to ſubmit to <hi>Liturgies
and preſcribed Forms of Worſhip,</hi> are Unlawful. And
theſe Reaſons I find owned in the <hi>Caſe of Indifferent
Things uſed in Gods Worſhip, Stated on the behalf of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
juſt now publiſhed.</p>
            <p>For thus that Author declares in their behalf,<hi> We
cannot, </hi>ſaith he,<hi> conceive it Poſſible that in things of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worſhip, things of an Indifferent Nature ſhould be
the Juſt matter of any Human Determination,<note place="margin">Caſe on behalf of Diſſ.</note> farther than
the particular Practice of the Perſon determining.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 5.</note> And
again,<note place="margin">P. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Where in matters of Worſhip God hath wrote Ors,
whether by his Pen in Sacred Writing or by his not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
the particular Circumſtances, no Man can blot
them out; though themſelves may as to their own Practice,
for this or that Time or Act, where they cannot uſe more
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62890:9"/>
than one of thoſe Poſtures or Circumſtances. </hi>That is;
where God hath left Men at their Liberty to do this,<hi>Or </hi>that, they may Determin themſelves, but no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Authority may Determin for them. Farther,<hi> As
to things in Gods Worſhip not Determined by God, they
Judge every Man is </hi>Sui Juris<hi> and ought to be Determined
by God alone to this, Or that; i. e. </hi>he can be obliged
to this or that Part by God only. And he ſays plainly
that,<hi> moſt </hi>of them<hi> are Confident that in matters of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
no Superiors may reſtrain what God hath left at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
In Purſuance </hi>of this general Principle he ſays,
ſome Poſture in an<hi> Human Action being neceſſary, and
none by God Determined in every Act of Worſhip; where
there is no Determination, they believe themſelves at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,<note place="margin">P. 16. 17.</note>
and think they ought not to be Determined by any
thing but their own practical Judgment, according to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Circumſtances: It is a Liberty with which God hath made
them free. </hi>Again, He acknowledges that they<hi> Judge </hi>it<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>unlawful </hi>to obey Laws concerning<hi> Words in prayer
which God hath left at Liberty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 9.</note> and concerning<hi> Habits
and Geſtures, ſuppoſing them to be left at Liberty, and
that none who is to uſe them verily Judgeth them <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>And he intimates more then once that<hi> things not
neceſſary,<note place="margin">P. 20. &amp;c.</note> and Ordinarily uſed in Idolatrous and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
Services may not, </hi>in their Judgment,<hi> be lawfully
uſed: </hi>How well he has proved theſe Poſitions I am
not concerned to examine; but leave him for that to
his Learned<hi> Antagonist. </hi>Theſe Obſervations are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
enough for my purpoſe, which is to ſhew the
Difference between the ground of our Separation from
the<hi> Roman </hi>Church, and thoſe of their Separation from
us whom this Gentleman defends.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are thoſe who, for all this, ſeem not to
think our Communion Unlawful in it ſelf, ſince they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62890:9"/>
can ſometimes Communicate with us in our whole
Service. But they Judge the way of the Separate
Meetings to be more perfect, and a better means of
Edification; and the ground of their Separation is this,
that it is Unlawful to Communicate Ordinarily in a
more imperfect way of Worſhip and enjoying the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of the Goſpel, where a better may be had.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I come now to the ſecond Point which is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the grounds of Separation on both ſides together;
that we may Judge wherein they differ or how far they
agree.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I do acknowledge that the moſt general ground
of all is the ſame on both ſides, or at leaſt may be
ſo; that is, that we Separate from the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in a <hi>full Perſwaſion of Conſcience,</hi> that ſo we ought to
do; And that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Separate from the Church
of <hi>England</hi> with the like Perſwaſion. But how far
this Agreement makes the Caſe of Separation the ſame
on both ſides; and whether it will equally juſtify the
the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Separating from <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Separating from the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
will be Conſidered, time enough after all the other
Reaſons are compared.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next general Reaſon on both ſides alledged
is, that Separation was neceſſary for <hi>greater Purity of
Worſhip and Ordinances. We</hi> for greater Purity Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from <hi>Rome:</hi> The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> for greater Purity Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from us. Now whether this may or may not
reaſonably be pretended by the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in their Caſe,
as well as by the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Hers, will beſt
oppear when we have laid together the particulars ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aepted
againſt on both ſides, by us with Reference to
the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
with Reference to the Communion of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62890:10"/>
Church of <hi>England;</hi> and have alſo Conſidered the way
of maintaining Objections againſt the Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> that is peculiar to each
ſide. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is not the ſame Plea offered to juſtify the
Separation in both Caſes with Reſpect to that <hi>Authority</hi>
by which the Conditions of Communion are preſcribed.
For we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do unanimouſly
deny that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath any Juſt Authority
to make Rules for the Communion, or to preſcribe
Laws for the Government of our Church. But all the
Diſſenters do not queſtion the Lawfulneſs of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by which our <hi>Liturgy</hi> is Eſtabliſht, and thoſe
things which they Object againſt are required. For
thoſe of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Perſwaſion amongſt us, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they diſlike <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Epiſcopacy, yet ſeem not to
inſiſt upon it in their late Writings, as a ground of
Separation from this Church; but if other things were
Reformed according to their mind, they would Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to our Biſhops, and by their Conformity contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to uphold the Order of this <hi>National Church.</hi>
But then the <hi>Independents</hi> indeed muſt in Conſequence
of their Principles, deny that Biſhops ſingly or jointly,
whether with the Civil Authority or without it, have
any right to preſcribe to their Congregations in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> ſince in theſe things they hold
their Members to be accountable to no Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God, but that of the Congregation to which they
belong.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall compare the two Caſes of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with reſpect to three things which will, I conceive,
Comprehend all the forementioned Pleas on both ſides;
that is with reſpect, 1. to Authority. 2. To <hi>Terms of
Communion,</hi> and under this head to the Common pretence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62890:10"/>
of <hi>Separating for greater Purity.</hi> 3. To the <hi>Plea of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. With reſpect to <hi>Authority.</hi> We are divided from
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as one particular Conſtituted
Church from another, neither of which has any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to preſcribe to the other in matters <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
And therefore as I ſaid before, tho the Terms of the
Communion of that Church were not Unlawful, yet if
She would have no Communion with us, unleſs we would
be govern'd by Her Laws: And if our Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
ſhould uſe their own Liberty and Authority to
preſcribe to us what they Judged more Sutable to the
General Rules of Scripture and more Conducible to
the great ends of Chriſtianity: The Separation enſuing
upon that Churches affecting an Uſurpation over us,
could not be <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> on our Part, who are not the
Subjects of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> but upon the Part of
that Church it would be ſo for Her exerciſing an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
where She has no right ſo to do.</p>
            <p>But the Caſe of the Diſſenters is far otherwiſe, who
Separate from this National Church in which they
were Born and Baptized, and where they live. For
by thus doing we ſay that they withdraw their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
from their Lawful Governours; from whom if
they Divide, eſpecially if they ſet up a Communion
diſtinct from that of their Superiors, and of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
under them, they are guilty of manifeſt
Schiſm, unleſs the Terms of Communion be Unlawful.
For it is by no means ſufficient to clear them of this
fault, that thoſe things which fall within the Compaſs of
Church Authority are not well order'd; becauſe, although
this were true, yet in theſe things their practice is to be
Determined by that Authority. For we think it very
Evident that no Society can be united and maintained
without this Principle, that a Lawful Authority is to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62890:11"/>
be Submitted unto and Obeyed by Inferiors in all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things, and that the mere Imprudence or Inexpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of its Determinations, cannot abſolve them from
their Obligation to comply therewith.</p>
            <p>Now that it is a Lawful Authority upon which the
Conſtitutions of this National Church ſtands, I think
no Man can deny that will grant a National Church
it ſelf to be but a Lawful Conſtitution. For there is
the Concurrence both of Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
to give them force. The <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi>
firſt agreed upon the ſame Rule and Order for Church
Government and Worſhip, which being afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> was
then made a Law by the <hi>King.</hi> ſo that if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation
of the particular Churches of this Kingdom
to govern themſelves and to ſerve God in Religious
Aſſemblies, by the ſame <hi>Rule,</hi> and according to the
ſame <hi>Term,</hi> can become the matter of a Law obliging
all Chriſtians amongſt us to Conformity; here is no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hority
wanting to induce ſuch an Obligation.</p>
            <p>And it is to be Conſider'd that every one who Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates
from that <hi>Parochial</hi> Congregation where he lives,
and betakes himſelf to an Oppoſite Communion, had
been guilty of Schiſm in ſo doing, although the Churches
of this Kingdom had not been United as they are into
a National Form; but each <hi>Biſhop</hi> with his <hi>Presbyters</hi>
had made Rules for Religious Aſſemblies Independently
upon the Reſt. But now the fault of ſuch Separation
is heinouſly Aggravated as the Caſe ſtands by theſe
two Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That thoſe Orders or Impoſitions upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
whereof he Separates from the Pariſh where he
lives, were made by the Common advice of the Paſtors
of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Flock in this Kingdom; and that for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Rule to them All: Which method was a moſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62890:11"/>
proper means to Unite their particular Churches more
cloſely one to another, and to Edify and Strengthen
them by ſuch Union. Therefore that Separation which
would have been blameable of it ſelf, is ſo much the
worſe as it tends to break ſo profitable an Union, and
to expoſe the Authority of ſo many Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to Contempt, as contributed towards it by their
Advice and Conſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſince the Rules thus agreed upon are made
Laws alſo by the Soveraign Power; ſuch Schiſm is
aggravated farther by Diſobedience to the Lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Civil Authority under which we live, and
to which all particular Churches in this Kingdom do
owe Obedience in all Lawful things. And now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
our <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Brethren will grant that upon
theſe accounts there is a vaſt difference between the
Caſes of Separation from the Church of <hi>England</hi> and
from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in point of Authority.</p>
            <p>But then I muſt confeſs the <hi>Independents</hi> are likely
enough to ſay, that theſe Impoſitions are as truly U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations
upon particular Congregations, as if they had
been enforced upon this Kingdom by a pretended Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from <hi>Rome.</hi> And if there were no difference
between ſaying and proving, we might here be at a
conſiderable loſs. However this muſt be granted, that
an <hi>Engliſh Biſhop</hi> may have good Authority to Govern
his <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter</hi> his <hi>Pariſh</hi> here in <hi>England;</hi>
and yet it may be fooliſh and unjuſt in a <hi>Forreign Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
to claim any Authority over the one or the other.
And I hope they will not deny that the King has good
Authority here, though the Pope has none; nor that
the Laws of the Land concerning Religion and Gods
Worſhip, do bind the Conſciences of the Kings Subjects
ſomething more, than if they had wanted the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Legiſlative Power at home, and came to us from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62890:12"/>
abroad with nothing but the Seal of the Fiſherman to
recommend them; <hi>i. e.</hi> that in this latter caſe we might
have refuſed them as wanting Authority, but not ſo
in the Former; but that the matter of them being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be Lawful, they ought to be complied with.
And whereas the Independents ſuppoſe the Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of their Congregations to be of Divine Right, both
in Oppoſition to Epiſcopal Superiority, and to National
Church-Government, this we muſt leave to the merits
of the cauſe between them and us. And I may as well
take it for granted, that their pretended Right to Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency
has been as clearly argued of Novelty and
Weakneſs, as the Popes pretended Right to Supremacy
has been; argued I ſay of <hi>more Novelty,</hi> and almoſt <hi>as
much Weakneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſtep a little out of the way of my preſent
buſineſs; I may appeal to all underſtanding perſons,
who cannot judge of the <hi>Learning</hi> uſed on both ſides;
whether that Notion of <hi>a Church</hi> or <hi>of Church-Communion</hi>
is likely to be true, which makes it impoſſible for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Kingdom to be United un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Soveraign Authority in the obſervation of the
ſame Rules adviſed upon, and the ſame Laws made for
the benefit of them all. In the mean time I conclude
this head with ſaying, that though the <hi>Pope</hi> has no
Authority in this Kingdom, yet it follows not that <hi>every
particular Congregation</hi> muſt be <hi>Independent.</hi> And I
challenge any Man to take any one Argument uſed by
any of our Church to prove the <hi>Independency</hi> of <hi>our
Church</hi> upon the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and make it hold to prove
the <hi>Independency</hi> of a <hi>Congregation,</hi> either upon a National
or Epiſcopal Church if he can. Wherefore ſuppoſing the
<hi>Decrees</hi> of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be of no good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
amongſt us; and <hi>our own Laws</hi> in matters <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi>
to want no good Authority, the conditions of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62890:12"/>
Communion being otherwiſe Lawful on both ſides;
then the Separation enſuing upon our refuſal to ſubmit
to thoſe <hi>Decrees,</hi> would not be <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> on our part;
but the Separation of our <hi>Independents,</hi> and all others
amongſt us refuſing to Submit to theſe Laws would be
ſo on their part. And thus much for the Difference
in point of <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We are to compare the Caſes alſo with reſpect
to the <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> relating to matters of <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the firſt place the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> acknowledge that
the Faith profeſſed in this Church is pure and intire,
and that ſhe does not require the profeſſion of any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in Order to her Communion, which a good
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> has reaſon to ſuſpect. And this makes a great
difference between the Terms of Communion with <hi>our</hi>
Church, and the Terms thereof with the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which requires the profeſſion of Groſs and Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
Errors, of all whom ſhe admits to her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>But the great oſſence is taken at our <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Divine
Service,</hi> and the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> thereunto belonging. And
the offended parties are of three ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that do not directly charge any of our
practices in Worſhip as Sinful, but ſuppoſe ſome of them
to be <hi>Inexpedient</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nedifying:</hi> And they that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
upon this account muſt acknowledge this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the Caſe, that whereas we ſeparating from
<hi>Rome</hi> forſook an Unlawful Communion for one that
was Lawful; they Separating from us forſake a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Communion for one that they believe to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And of theſe I ſhall take notice again in a fitter
place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another ſort are they who pretend ſomething
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62890:13"/>
more, that is, that they <hi>Scruple</hi> the Lawfulneſs of the
things enjoined, and that they ought not to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with us ſo long as they remain under theſe
doubts. And theſe Men alſo muſt confeſs a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the reaſon upon which they Separate
from us, and that for which we Separate from the Church
of <hi>Rome:</hi> Since we are <hi>paſt doubting</hi> in the caſe, and <hi>poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
affirm thoſe conditions of Communion with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which we complain of, to be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Unlawful. And in Conſequence hereof, they muſt
not deny that there is a great difference alſo between
thoſe <hi>grounds</hi> upon which they and we pretend againſt <hi>that
Church</hi> the Unlawfulneſs of her Impoſitions, and thoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they <hi>ſuſpect</hi> the like of <hi>ours;</hi> And that is, that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church is by us attacqued with <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
evidence of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> againſt her; but that
it remains doubtful whether there be any good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in Scripture againſt us; concerning which more
will be ſaid under the next head. In the mean time
it does by no means follow, that becauſe Separation is
<hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> where ſome things are required to
be done which we <hi>certainly know</hi> God has forbidden;
therefore it is <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary</hi> alſo where other things
are required, concerning which we do not know but
they may be Lawful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third ſort are they that pretend theſe <hi>Forms</hi>
of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which the former either
<hi>Scruple,</hi> or judge only <hi>Inexpedient,</hi> to be indeed <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
and to render our Communion not only <hi>ſuſpected,</hi>
and <hi>leſs deſirable,</hi> but <hi>plainly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful.</hi> And I grant
that theſe are the Men who come up to the point; And
if they could but make good what they ſay, they
would ſhew their Separation from our Church to be
grounded upon one General Reaſon of our Separation
from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which would ſufficiently
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62890:13"/>
clear us from the Imputation of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> if no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
were to be given. But I believe a very wide dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the caſe will appear when we come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>particular Practices themſelves</hi> which are by
us ſaid to be Unlawful in the Communion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church; and thoſe which by the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are
ſaid to be Unlawful in <hi>ours.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The way and means</hi> by which we pretend to <hi>prove
thoſe,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> by which they pretend to <hi>prove theſe</hi>
Unlawful.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us Conſider the particulars themſelves. The
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> do with us Condemn as Unlawful, <hi>Prayers</hi>
in <hi>an unknown Tongue;</hi> the <hi>Adoration of the Hoſt; Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
the Croſs,</hi> and the like Practices of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church in Her Forms of Worſhip, from which they
acknowledge alſo that we have Purged our Communion.
But they ſay we have retained other Practices ſomething
akin to theſe, though not quite ſo bad; for Inſtance <hi>Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Communion; wearing the Surplice; Signing with
the Sign of the Croſs;</hi> and ſome of them add, <hi>the
Publick uſe of Forms of Prayer.</hi> Now all that I deſign
under this head in Comparing the former and the later
particulars together, is to ſhew, that the Unlawfulneſs
of the former being ſuppoſed, the Unlawfulneſs of the
latter cannot be from thence inferr'd; And that for
this plain Reaſon, becauſe the Queſtions concerning the
one and the other, are perfectly diſtinct from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For as the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s having no Authority
here in <hi>England,</hi> ſhall not hinder the Authority which
our Biſhops exerciſe in <hi>England</hi> from being Lawful and
Good: So to pray in an <hi>unknown Tongue</hi> may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
and contrary to Scripture, but for all this <hi>Forms
of Prayer</hi> in a Language underſtood by the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
may not only be Lawful but Profitable, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62890:14"/>
in moſt Caſes neceſſary. The Adoration of the <hi>Hoſt</hi>
may be an <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Practiſe; yet to Kneel in the
Act of receiving the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> where ſuch Adoration
is diſclaimed, ſhall be no ſuch Practiſe. We may <hi>Sign</hi>
the <hi>Baptized,</hi> Inſant with the Sign of the Croſs; and
yet not <hi>Worſhip</hi> that Sign: we may do the former in
token of the <hi>Obligation</hi> which <hi>Baptiſm</hi> layeth upon us:
without Attributing any of that Virtue or Efficacy
thereunto, which makes the <hi>Popiſh</hi> uſe of it Fooliſh
and Superſtitious. What Practice is there in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church which we as Unlawful have abandoned,
from whence the Unlawfulneſs of <hi>Wearing a Surplice,</hi>
or <hi>ſeeing</hi> it worn, can with any Colour of Reaſon be
drawn? In a word, what <hi>Erroneous Doctrine</hi> in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or Unlawful Practice confeſs'd by
the Diſſenters to be by us rejected, can be aſſign'd,
from which the Unlawfulneſs of any of thoſe things
excepted againſt in our <hi>Liturgy</hi> can be inferr'd? Let
them take any one Argument uſed by us to prove
ſuch or ſuch a particular Condition of Communion Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
which that Church requires, and by that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
prove ſome Condition Unlawful in ours, if
they can. But perhaps they will ſay, That if they
can prove this by other Arguments, the Caſe in general
will ſtill be the ſame. This I confeſs and therefore I
proceed to the ſecond Point which was,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew the <hi>Difference</hi> between the <hi>way and
means by us uſed to prove</hi> thoſe Conditions of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Communion <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful,</hi> which we except againſt;
and the <hi>manner of arguing</hi> uſed by the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> againſt us.
Now our way is plain and direct; for we prove thoſe
particulars in the <hi>Roman</hi> Worſhip Unlawful which we
Condemn, by this Argument that they are forbidden
in Gods Word, and this we prove by thoſe expreſs and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62890:14"/>
particular places of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> to which they are
repugnant. And if we fail not of producing ſuch
Teſtimonies againſt the Corruptions of that Church,
we have the Advantage againſt the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> And if the
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> charge <hi>any Condition</hi> of our Communion with
Repugnancy to Gods Law, and can as clearly ſhew
where he hath forbidden it, they have the like Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
againſt us.</p>
            <p>Now indeed they ſay that the things Impoſed upon
them, however weeſteem them but <hi>Indifferent,</hi> are by
themſelves Judged Unlawful.<note place="margin">Caſe on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Diſſ.</note> Thus the forementioned
Author ſaith <hi>Could</hi> they <hi>[Diſſenters] but look upon the</hi>
Forms and Rites of our Worſhip <hi>under that Notion</hi>
[of things Indifferent] <hi>poſſibly their Conteſt would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be great nor long.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 2.</note> I do not like theſe words, for
that which may be may not be; and <hi>poſſibly the
Conteſt would be great and long,</hi> though they ſhould
<hi>look upon</hi> theſe things as <hi>Indifferent.</hi> However he
ſaies,<note place="margin">P. 3.</note> that <hi>we ſuppoſe thoſe things indifferent which</hi> they
<hi>cannot but Judge <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful, as they have often told
their Brethren.</hi> But how do they prove them Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?
Do they ſhew where God hath forbidden them?
As we, for Inſtance, produce the <hi>ſecond Commandment</hi> to
tſhew that in that Commandment God hath forbidden
he <hi>Worſhip of Images,</hi> ſo do they; or can they produce
any ſuch Teſtimony of Scripture againſt <hi>Kneeling</hi> when
we receive the <hi>Euchariſt?</hi> And as we alledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
againſt praying in an <hi>unknown Tongue;</hi> can they ſhew
us any Text in all the Bible againſt praying by a <hi>Form
of Words?</hi> No; this is not what they pretend to do.
But then we are apt to Conclude, that if theſe things
be not forbidden, that they are at leaſt <hi>Indifferent,</hi> and
therefore Lawful. And which is ſomething more, we
have their leave alſo thus to Conclude,<note place="margin">P. 3.</note> ſeeing <hi>there
is none of them but agreeth with us in our Notion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62890:15"/>
things</hi> viz. <hi>that they are ſuch things as by the
Divine Law are neither enjoyned nor forbidden: Things
undertermined by the Law of God in Nature or Scripture.</hi>
How then do they prove thoſe things Unlawful to
be done in Gods Worſhip, which God hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
either in the Law of Nature or Scripture? To
make ſhort Work of it: Thoſe particulars in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
which they except againſt, are Unlawful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are not neceſſary to Worſhip, nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by any expreſs Law of God. Which is as
much as to ſay, that though they <hi>are Indifferent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are <hi>neither enjoyned nor forbidden by the Law
of God in Nature or Scripture;</hi> yet they <hi>are</hi> not <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi>
and that becauſe they are <hi>not enjoyned.</hi> So that
whilſt our Brethren allow the Determination of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things to Authority, they take away with
one hand, what they give with the other. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Principles there is nothing left for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to Determin, as to the ordering of Gods Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip. For one would think that the matter
of ſuch Determination ſhould be thoſe things, which
God hath <hi>left</hi> to our <hi>Liberty.</hi> But you are miſtaken
if you think ſo; ſince for this very Reaſon that they
are <hi>left at Liberty,</hi> it is Unlawful for one Man be his
Authority what it will, ſo long as it is but Human Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to Determin in them for another; and it is
Unlawful for this other Man to Submit to his Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
For we are told that <hi>the Light of Nature
directeth us to uſe the moſt Convenient Circumſtances for
the Worſhip of God, and the Law of Nature will enforce
Men in doing Actions, to uſe Time and Place. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, ſuch as the Poſtures of Prayer, or Words
uſed in Prayer, the Holy Scripture is every where as
ſufficient to us as the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>was to the</hi> Jews,
<hi>which Commanded as to the</hi> Paſſover <hi>the offering a Lamb
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62890:15"/>
or a Kid, and left it to the Diſcretion and Conveniency
of the Offerer to Determin which—. So for Standing,
Sitting, or Kneeling at Prayer, God indeed hath left
the one or the other of them to us not Determined, leaving
it to our Choice or Conveniency which to uſe,<note place="margin">Caſe.</note> who ſometimes
cannot uſe Standing,<note place="margin">P. 29, 30.</note> another time cannot uſe Kneeling.
He hath Commanded us to pray, and that with our Voice,
as well as our Hearts; But that he hath not told us
what Words we ſhould always uſe—. God hath therefore
left us at Liberty what Words to uſe, as he left the</hi> Jews
<hi>at Liberty whether to offer a Lamb or a Kid—And</hi>
Moſes <hi>might by the ſame Authority have tied up all the</hi>
Jews <hi>to Offer none but Kids, or none but Lambs, as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
can tye up Inferiours to uſe none but ſuch or ſuch
Words in Prayer. And the</hi> Jews <hi>might every whit as
Lawfully have Obeyed</hi> Moſes <hi>in ſuch a Command, as we
can Obey any Superiors in ſuch a Caſe.</hi> That is, it <hi>had
been <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful</hi> in the <hi>Jews to have Obeyed</hi> Moſes <hi>in ſuch a
Caſe,</hi> and <hi>it would be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful</hi> in the Diſſenters, and
<hi>it is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful</hi> in us to <hi>Obey our Superiors</hi> in any of
their Determinations Concerning <hi>things in Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
which God hath left at Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How this Author hath purſued his Argument, is
not my buſineſs to Conſider. It is ſufficient for my
deſign to ſhew the vaſt difference between the <hi>grounds
upon which</hi> we charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
Unlawful Terms of Communion with her in
her Worſhip, and <hi>thoſe upon which</hi> the ſame fault is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the Church of <hi>England</hi> by the Diſſenters. <hi>we</hi>
prove our charge, by ſhewing, that <hi>God hath forbidden</hi>
what that Church requires to be done: <hi>They</hi> prove
theirs againſt us by ſhewing that <hi>God hath left thoſe
things at Liberty</hi> which are required in this Church.
<hi>We</hi> ſhew that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> injoyns Practices
that are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful for any Man to Determin himſelf to:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62890:16"/>
They</hi> ſhew that this Church enjoyns Practices which are
<hi>not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful</hi> for a Man to chooſe <hi>for himſelf;</hi> but for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to chooſe for him. The things they except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
in our Communion are <hi>in themſelves</hi> Indifferent,
and they cannot make them Unlawful otherwiſe then
by fetching a Compaſs about, and pretending that they
are then Unlawful to be done, when our Superiors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
us to do them.</p>
            <p>And now I may leave it to the Judgment of all
Men that can Conſider a Caſe without great Prejudice,
whether there be Reaſon to forſake the Church of <hi>England</hi>
upon the account of Unlawful Terms of Communion
pretended to be in her Worſhip; as well as upon the
ſame account to leave the Communion of the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> that is, whether a thing may become Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in Gods Worſhip for not being Commanded by God,
and for being enjoyned by Man; becauſe every thing
that God hath forbidden is neither Lawful to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Man; nor to be done, though it be ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
I know not whether ſome of our Brothers party
may not think that he hath given us too much Advantage
by reducing the Queſtion to this State. But I think
it is not <hi>his</hi> Weakneſs but the Weakneſs of <hi>his Cauſe</hi>
that has led him to it. For they are not able to prove
the Unlawfulneſs of the preſent Impoſitions in Order
to Communion, but upon ſuch Principles as theſe are.
And I may appeal to Mankind Concerning the <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the Caſe</hi> between <hi>them</hi> againſt us, and <hi>us</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this matter; that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of our Separation from <hi>Rome</hi> will not juſtify their
Separation from us, nor that the Reaſon upon which
we challenge them of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> can fly in our own Faces,
when the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> challengeth us of the ſame
Crime. But I ſhall ſay no more of this Point at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62890:16"/>
becauſe I foreſee Occaſion of reſuming it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
in another place.</p>
            <p>But this Author offereth another Reaſon alſo of the
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfullneſs</hi> of thoſe things that are required, and
that becauſe they have been and ſtill are uſed in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
Services,</hi> and are <hi>not of themſelves neceſſary</hi> to
be uſed by us. I think I may venture to ſay that this
Reaſon has been ſufficiently expoſed. But my buſineſs
is to note the <hi>Difference of the Caſe:</hi> We Separate
from <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe we muſt Communicate
with her in her <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which is <hi>neceſſary not to be done:</hi>
The Diſſenters Separate from us, becauſe otherwiſe
they muſt do ſome things <hi>not neceſſary to be done,</hi> which
have been and ſtill are done by <hi>Idolaters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again the Diſſenters, as he ſays <hi>Scruple Kneeling in
the Act of Receiving the Communion, becauſe there is an
Objectum Motivum,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>before their eyes.</hi> I
think he means becauſe the Elements are Worſhipped by
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who ſay they believe them to be no longer
Elements, but God himſelf. And to Kneel therefore
when we take theſe into our hands, is to give ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to others to think that we Worſhip the Elements;
and therefore the Diſſenters <hi>Queſtion the Lawfulneſs of
an Adoration of God under theſe Circumſtances.</hi> I am glad
if it be but <hi>Queſtion</hi> and <hi>Scruple,</hi> though I am ſorry 'tis
ſo much. But whether they only Scruple <hi>Kneeling</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account, or more than Scruple it, for this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
does not always ſpeak ſo diſtinctly as I could
wiſh: There is however this difference in the Caſe;
that whereas one principal Reaſon why we Separate
from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is becauſe we dare not Worſhip Bread,
which <hi>without all Queſtion</hi> is Idolatry; one reaſon why
the Diſſenters Separate from us, is becauſe we who
have ſo loudly declared againſt that Idolatry, do Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
(not the Bread, which we believe to retain its
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62890:17"/>
own Nature, but) God only, as they <hi>themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,</hi>
when we partake of that Bread.</p>
            <p>And here I may be content to let the matter reſt, that
whether we conſider the <hi>Particulars</hi> pretended to be
Unlawful in both Communions; or the <hi>way</hi> taken by
us <hi>to prove</hi> thoſe Unlawful which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
would impoſe upon us, and <hi>that way</hi> which the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>
uſe to <hi>make out</hi> the like charge againſt the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> the difference is ſo great, that the charge
of <hi>Schiſm</hi> which, upon this account, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Terms of
Communion in Worſhip,</hi> we bring againſt the Diſſenters
for Separating from us, cannot with Reaſon and Modeſty
be returned upon our ſelves for Separating from the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now compared the two Caſes with Reſpect
to <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Terms of Communion.</hi> But before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to compare them with reſpect to the <hi>Plea of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi>
I ſhall endeavour to repreſent ſome other Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of the Caſe that are plainly conſequent upon
one or both of thoſe Differences which we have already
conſidered. And they are theſe three;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Difference of the Caſe, with reſpect to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for <hi>greater purity of Worſhip and Ordinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Difference with reſpect to that Common
Queſtion <hi>who ſhall be the Judge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Difference of the principles upon which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide Separates, as to their <hi>tendency either to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
or to overthrow one Communion amongſt Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. With reſpect to Separation, for <hi>greater purity</hi> of
Worſhip and Ordinances. The Diſſenters ſay, that <hi>if
for greater purity</hi> England <hi>Separated from</hi> Rome, <hi>others
alſo may for greater purity Separate from England.</hi> And
becauſe I perceive this <hi>Conſequence</hi> is inſiſted upon, not
only by well meaning People, but by ſome that would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62890:17"/>
not be thought the meaneſt of the party, I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin
it as throughly as I can; hoping to gain the
Readers Pardon, if I repeat ſome things that have been
already Diſcourſed; but which are neceſſary to be
obſerved in order to a right underſtanding of this
matter.</p>
            <p>The ground I ſhall proceed upon in Diſcourſing of
this Conſequence, is that we and the Diſſenters do not
underſtand the ſame thing by <hi>greater purity.</hi> By the
<hi>Impurity</hi> or <hi>Corruption</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion which
is the principal Reaſon of our departing from it, we
underſtand the <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> thereof; and by <hi>Separating
from that Church for greater purity</hi> we therefore mean
forſaking her Communion that we might not <hi>partake
in her Sins;</hi> which otherwiſe we could not avoid. To
make good this charge, that her Communion was and
ſtill is <hi>Corrupted</hi> in this Senſe, we have but that one plain
way already declared. We ſhew that there are ſeveral
<hi>Doctrines</hi> which ſhe <hi>Profeſſeth;</hi> ſeveral <hi>Things</hi> in her
Worſhip which ſhe <hi>Practiſeth,</hi> that are plainly contrary
to the Truth which God hath revealed and to the
Laws which he hath delivered to us: And that thoſe
Errors and theſe Practices are <hi>not of a ſlight Nature,</hi>
but that they grate upon the very Foundations of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity:</hi>
And moreover, that ſhe <hi>exacteth the profeſſion</hi> of the
one, and <hi>the doing</hi> of the other from all her Members.
So that when we ſay, that we <hi>Separate from that
Church for greater purity,</hi> we mean that there are ſeveral
<hi>Impure,</hi> or <hi>Sinful</hi> conditions of Communion required
in that Church, with which, as ſhe has ordered the
matter, we muſt pollute our ſelves, and of which we
our ſelves muſt be guilty, if we Communicate with her
at all: And therefore it was neceſſary for us to depart
from her, becauſe it is moſt neceſſary not to deny the
Truths or break the Laws of God. Therefore alſo by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62890:18"/>
ſaying that we Separated for greater purity, we mean
not that we have forſaken <hi>but ſome</hi> Corruptions <hi>only</hi> of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Worſhip, as if our Communion were now
indeed <hi>purer</hi> then theirs though not <hi>ſo pure</hi> as it ought
to be. This is not our meaning: For we contend that
this Church hath purged away all thoſe <hi>Practices,</hi> and
aboliſht all thoſe <hi>Rules</hi> relating to Gods Worſhip, which
are contrary to his Word; and by Conſequence that
there is no <hi>Impurity</hi> left in the conditions of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
ſo that any Man whoſe Conſcience is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
informed may Communicate with us without Sin.
Wherefore this comparative expreſſion of Separating
for <hi>greater purity</hi> from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, reſpecteth
the State of that Church, ſuppoſing indeed that <hi>all</hi> the
conditions of that Churches-Communion were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
but withal implying that <hi>ſome</hi> of them, and thoſe
truly <hi>not a few,</hi> were ſo; And therefore that her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
was <hi>not pure enough</hi> for any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to join
in it with a good Conſcience. Thus I have ſhewn
what we underſtand by Separating for greater purity,
and how we maintain this Plea in Anſwer to the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now therefore although the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> uſe the ſame
Plea in Words, in Anſwer to us, yet if they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the ſame thing by it that we do, nor attempt
to make it out by ſhewing wherein our Communion
is Corrupted with ſuch conditions as oblige the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of this Church to do what God hath forbidden,
or to neglect what he hath Commanded them to do,
or to contradict what he hath revealed; This Plea I ſay
if it be not made out by ſuch particulars as theſe, is
by them weakly brought to juſtify their Separation
from us, by our example in Separating from <hi>Rome.</hi>
And though the general pretence may ſerve to delude
Injudicious People, who have not learnt to diſtinguiſh
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62890:18"/>
between Reaſons and Colours; yet it will neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
them before God, nor in the Judgment of Wiſe
Men who can eaſily diſcern and will Impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Difference of the Caſe. It is indeed a plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Colour</hi> for their Separation from us, that we Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>greater purity;</hi> and <hi>but</hi> a Colour
unleſs they could ſhew wherein our Communion is <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,</hi>
or which is all one, what are thoſe conditions
thereof which be <hi>Sinful</hi> or Repugnant to the Laws of
God.</p>
            <p>But what is it that they mean by this <hi>greater purity
of Worſhip</hi> for which they Separate? Wherein doth this
purity conſiſt? Let Reaſonable Men Judge. <hi>Extemporary
Prayers</hi> are more pure than <hi>Forms of Prayer:</hi> To <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Communion Sitting</hi> or <hi>Standing</hi> is more pure
than to <hi>Receive it Kneeling.</hi> To <hi>omit the Sign of the
Croſs after Baptiſm,</hi> is more pure than to uſe it. And
the Miniſters Praying in a <hi>Coat or a Cloak,</hi> is more pure
then to Pray in a <hi>Surplice.</hi> But till they can ſhew that
our way in any of theſe inſtances is forbidden by God,
either they cannot juſtly pretend that <hi>it is Impure;</hi> or at
leaſt they muſt confeſs that they mean by <hi>Impurity,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe when they charge it upon us, than what we
mean by it, when we charge it upon the Communion
of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and therefore that they do not
uſe the ſame Plea againſt us, that we produce againſt
that. For with us <hi>Impurity</hi> is <hi>Sin,</hi> and an <hi>Impure</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is a Communion in which <hi>we cannot Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
without Sin, i. e.</hi> without tranſgreſſing the Law of
God. But as far as I can ſee, <hi>Impurity</hi> with them muſt
go for ſomething elſe, that is, either for doing things
that God hath not forbidden, or for the omitting of
things that he hath not Commanded. And if the Church
hath Power in Indifferent things; and that be <hi>pure,</hi>
againſt which there is <hi>no Law;</hi> their pretence of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62890:19"/>
for <hi>greater purity</hi> is altogether groundleſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they can prove that they cannot have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with us, without neglecting to do what God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
or doing what he forbids.</p>
            <p>Therefore the former diſcourſe concerning <hi>Terms of
Communion</hi> ſhews that there is a vaſt difference between
this Plea as it is uſed by us, and as it is uſed by the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts</hi>
againſt us. For we do not Separate from the
Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church upon this principle
that <hi>the Church hath no Power to make Orders for the
Worſhip of God in matters that are left to our Liberty,</hi> or
<hi>to preſcribe Rites and Ceremonies that are not contrary to
Gods Word.</hi> But upon this principle as far as we can
Judge, do the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Separate from us; and the main
controverſie we have with them is, whether it be
within the compaſs of <hi>Human</hi> Authority to preſcribe in
things of this ſort; and conſequently whether it be
part of the Duty of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to ſubmit unto, and in
their Practice to comply with ſuch preſcriptions. They
will not deny, that we ſhew the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
where the Scripture forbids what that Church requires,
and this, through all thoſe inſtances of their Corruption
in Worſhip, for which we pretend it neceſſary for us
to depart from her Communion. Now if the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
can ſhew the like of any condition in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
I promiſe to recant all that I have ſaid in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> under this head of the
<hi>purity of her Communion,</hi> and inſtead of Vindicating my
Defence of our Church as to this particular, to depart
from her Communion in that thing, whatever may
come of it, from this time forwards. And I truſt that
through the Grace of God I ſhould not for the ſake of
any Worldly Intereſt, either reſiſt the Evidence of any
clear Argument tending to my conviction, or act in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62890:19"/>
contradiction to a convinced conſcience and judgment,
in a matter of this high nature.</p>
            <p>But to deal plainly, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſeem to be very
ſenſible of the uncaſineſs of this task, that is, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in the ſame method to convince us of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Terms of Communion, which we uſe againſt the
<hi>Church of Rome.</hi> They go another way to work, and
it would make an Indifferent Man ſuſpect their cauſe,
to ſee what ſhifts they uſe to make good their pretence.
They demand of us <hi>where Scripture Commands,</hi> or <hi>what
need</hi> there is of thoſe things, which our Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
They pretend that the Liberty of <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
does in great part conſiſt in this, that they ought not
by <hi>Man</hi> to be determined to any practice in Gods Worſhip,
to which God, or the Nature of the thing has not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
them. They ſay, that the appointment of
<hi>Significant Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> is a derogation from the
Royalty of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the ſufficiency of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
And to give ſome countenance to theſe pretences they
would perſwade us that the Scripture it ſelf intimates
ſome ſuch thing, as if nothing were to be done in Gods
Worſhip but what is by God himſelf Commanded,
excepting always thoſe circumſtances neceſſary to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the choice whereof muſt yet be left to every
Man, and, as we are now taught, Authority muſt not
ſo much as meddle with them. To this purpoſe we
are told of the <hi>Pattern in the Mount,</hi> of <hi>Strange Fire
that was not Commanded,</hi> and of the Unlawfulneſs of
<hi>adding to, or diminiſhing from the Law of</hi> Moſes: As if
theſe places of Scripture made all impoſitions concerning
the Order of Divine Worſhip, as Unlawful, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Word of God ſhews ſo many particular practices
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in her Worſhip to be. But leaving
theſe attempts of theirs to be examined in the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Controverſies: Who ſees not what a wide dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62890:20"/>
there is in the particular management and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this general Propoſition, that we muſt not
Communicate with any Church in <hi>Impurity,</hi> between
the <hi>Church of England</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and between
the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> againſt the Church of <hi>England?</hi> For we
are ſecure againſt all juſt accuſation from the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> if this one Propoſition be true, That <hi>it is not in
the Power of any Church to diſpenſe with the Laws of God,
or to abſolve us from our Obligation to keep them.</hi> But the
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> cannot avoid the Juſtice of our charge againſt
them, unleſs this propoſition be true alſo, That <hi>the
Church hath no Authority in things of an Indifferent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to preſcribe ſuch in Divine Service, as ſhall be
thought moſt agreeable to the general Rules of Reaſon and
Scripture, and moſt Sutable to the great ends of Chrſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
Now if what we ſay in theſe things will hang well
together, that is, if the former Propoſition be true, and
if the Truth thereof, ſhall not hinder the latter from
being falſe; then with very good Reaſon may we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that it was neceſſary for us to Separate from <hi>Rome</hi>
for <hi>greater purity,</hi> or for the avoiding of Sin: But the
Diſſenters will have no juſt ground from our example
to pretend the ſame, in their Separation from the
Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, I think, the Difference is plainly enough confeſs'd
by thoſe of the Separation that hold <hi>occaſional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
with our Church to be Lawful, that is who think
it Lawful to Communicate actually with us upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
though they are all the while Members of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Churches. For if our Communion is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
with Sinful conditions, how comes it to paſs that
this <hi>occaſional Communion</hi> as they call it, ſhould be more
Lawful then <hi>Conſtant</hi> Communion? Unleſs they will
ſay it is Lawful <hi>ſometimes</hi> to break Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but not Lawful to do it <hi>ordinarily.</hi> But I know
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62890:20"/>
they will not ſay ſo. And therefore when they ſay
that they cannot without Sin become Members of our
Churches, though without Sin they can ſometimes join
in our Publick Worſhip; they ſeem to ſuppoſe that the
way of Worſhip in the Separate meetings, is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
than ours in reſpect of thoſe things which do not
fall under any particular Law of God, but may be
ordered better or worſe, as Men are more or leſs prudent,
or as they take greater or leſs heed to the general Rules
of Reaſon and Scripture concerning things Indifferent.
And withal that there is ſo much more gravity, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
Simplicity and Tendency to Edification in the
outward mode of their Worſhip, that it would be a
Sin to let it fall, or in practiſe to prefer ours before it.
But by this I think any body may ſee what a Difference
there is between what we, and theſe Men mean by the
ſame pretence of <hi>refuſing to Communicate, where it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done without Sin.</hi> For our meaning is, that there
are ſuch conditions of Communion in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that as the Caſe ſtands, it would be a Wickedneſs to
Communicate with her at any time. But they mean
no ſuch thing againſt us, ſince without Scruple they
can ſometimes Communicate with us; only they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they have ſet up a more perfect Communion;
and they do not forſake our Communion as Unlawful
in it ſelf, but they think it their Duty to prefer a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before it. So that in this pretence for Separation,
theſe Men do not underſtand <hi>purity</hi> in oppoſition to
<hi>Sin,</hi> or breaking any of Gods Commandments; but
<hi>purity</hi> in oppoſition to a <hi>leſs Convenient or Prudent</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of the outward mode of Worſhip. That is,
they do not underſtand the ſame thing by <hi>Separating</hi>
from the Communion of a Church for greater purity,
that we underſtand by it: Nor can they urge that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for Separation from us, as we do urge it againſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62890:21"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And conſequently our Reaſon of
Separating from that Church for <hi>greater purity,</hi> does
not hold to juſtify their Separation from us.</p>
            <p>Upon conſideration of the whole matter I hope the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> will find no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> of our Church eaſy and
ſilly enough to be deluded by ſuch Superficial Colours
as theſe are. <q>You ſee, ſay they, what is become of
leaving the Communion of the Church <hi>for greater
purity.</hi> The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at firſt forſook the <hi>Catholick,</hi>
i. e. <hi>Roman</hi> Church for greater purity. And do not
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> forſake the Church of <hi>England</hi> for
greater purity? And ſo do the <hi>Independents</hi> ſet up
their <hi>Congregations</hi> for greater purity. And the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi>
for the ſame reaſon depart from them: And
the <hi>Quakers</hi> from them <hi>All:</hi> And there is no end
of breaking Communion upon ſuch pretences as theſe
are; which are as good againſt your ſelves, as they
are againſt us: And therefore you may chooſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you will return to the Church from which you
firſt brake away under pretence of <hi>Reformation,</hi> or
whether you will follow your Principle till you are
Refined into <hi>Quakers,</hi> or it may be into a more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
and mad ſort of People than the <hi>Quakers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is a lamentable thing to ſee Men of Common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
couzened by ſuch Palpable Fallacies as theſe
are; though it is not to be wondred at, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church make the beſt uſe of them,
they can; ſince a Foul Cauſe muſt be beholden to ſuch
Artifices as theſe, to blanch it over.</p>
            <p>But I pray might there not be <hi>ſuch Corruptions</hi> in <hi>your</hi>
Church, that we with good Reaſon might pretend it
neceſſary to forſake your Communion for <hi>one that was
purer;</hi> and yet there may be none in <hi>ours</hi> to give any
Man <hi>Juſt</hi> Cauſe to leave us upon that pretence? Is it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62890:21"/>
impoſſible that it ſhould ever be juſt and neceſſary to
depart from the Communion of a Church upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of her Corruptions, becauſe every Man that
has a mouth, and can ſpeak, may ſay if he pleaſe, that
he Separates for greater purity, though there be no
reaſonable Cauſe to ſay ſo? Or does it follow that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are <hi>miſtaken</hi> in Believing that we
have given them ſufficient cauſe to deal by us, as we
have done by you, that is, to forſake <hi>our</hi> Communion
<hi>for greater purity,</hi> as we have forſaken <hi>yours</hi> upon the
ſame account; that therefore we alſo muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon miſtakes in ſo doing? What if ſome of them
are Erroneouſly perſwaded that they ought not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to <hi>Human Orders</hi> in the performance of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
if there be <hi>no particular Warrant</hi> in Gods Word
for them; may not we for all this be ſure that your
Church requireth Men to do things which God hath
<hi>particularly forbidden?</hi> And if we be ſure of this upon
the plain Grounds of Reaſon and Scripture; ſhould
we be afraid to reject your Communion in theſe things,
becauſe another ſort of Men are ſo unreaſonably wilful
as to reject our Communion for the ſake of things that
are nothing like to theſe?</p>
            <p>What if they conceiving that <hi>our Forms of Prayer are
not ſo Edifying,</hi> that <hi>our Rites and Ceremonies are not ſo
expedient,</hi> but rather <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful</hi> as being <hi>Human Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
what, I ſay, if they lay ſo great a ſtreſs upon
theſe things as to ſet up a Communion which they
Fancy to be more refined and unexceptionable? May
they not be <hi>to blame</hi> in all this, and yet the Church
of <hi>England not be liable to blame,</hi> but worthy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
for departing from you <hi>in your Latin Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
your half Communion, your Praying to Dead Men and
Women, your giving Divine Honors to a Wafer</hi> and <hi>your
other Groſs Superſtitions and Idolatries?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62890:22"/>
Although our Church had not ordered her publick
Worſhip ſo diſcreetly and carefully, but that in ſundry
things it might be reformed to good purpoſe; it might
yet by no means be neceſſary for any of her Members
to forſake her Communion; but it would on the other
hand be their great fault ſo to do, ſo long as ſhe holds
forth all the neceſſary means of Salvation and requires
nothing to be profeſſed, or to be done that is contrary
to Gods Word. But yet it would be neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the profeſſion of your Impious Errors, and to
forſake you in all things wherein your ſelves have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the plain Truths of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
and contradicted the plain <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>Though it may happen that a Man may do ſo <hi>Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
as to run himſelf upon great inconvenience in forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Habitation, becauſe there is ſome <hi>petty</hi> Diſeaſe
reigning thereabouts, which is known to endanger no
Mans Life; yet it may be <hi>Wiſely</hi> done by another
Man to run his Country when the <hi>Plague</hi> is raging in
every corner of it, eſpecially if he could know that it
were impoſſible for him to eſcape, if he ſhould tarry
there any longer: And yet, I ſuppoſe, you will not
deny but the one as well as the other may pretend that
he left his dwelling for the ſake of <hi>better health,</hi> and
<hi>more ſafely:</hi> But I hope you will grant that the later
pretends this like a <hi>Wiſe-Man,</hi> though the other does
it like a <hi>Fool.</hi> The caſe we are upon is much what the
ſame. From you it was neceſſary to depart for the
ſake of <hi>greater purity;</hi> but ſo it is not neceſſary for
you or others to depart from us; and yet others may
take the ſame Plea into their mouths againſt us, and
we may not be able to help it; though we can well
ſhew, that they have no good reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the Difference of the Caſe with
reſpect to <hi>Separation for greater purity.</hi>

2. I proceed next to conſider the Difference with
reſpect to that common Queſtion, <hi>Who ſhall be the
Judge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> arrogating to her ſelf an <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
in determining all Queſtions of Faith, doth in
purſuance of this claim deny private perſons the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of examining her <hi>Definitions</hi> by the Holy Scriptures;
and requireth them to acquieſce therein without more
ado, as there is great reaſon they ſhould, if indeed they
have reaſon to believe her Infallible. The <hi>Church of
England</hi> pretendeth not to Infallibility; But we ſay
that ſhe is not deceived in thoſe points which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
to be believed as neceſſary to Salvation nor in
rejecting thoſe other Articles which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
propounds under that notion: And agreeably to this
pretence ſhe hath Tranſlated the Holy Scriptures into
<hi>plain Engliſh,</hi> which are the beſt means whereby to
Judge, if what ſhe ſays be not true; ſhe not only <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth</hi>
the People to Read them, but <hi>exhorteth</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth</hi>
them ſo to do, and <hi>cauſeth</hi> them to be <hi>Publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Read</hi> to the People in all <hi>Religious Aſſemblies.</hi> By
this means ſhe traineth up her Members to an Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Judging, according to their ſeveral Capacities;
not only concerning All that ſhe teaches them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but alſo concerning All that ſhe teaches them to
do as their Duty to God or Man; ſo that ſhe does not
bring them up, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Educates her
Children to an <hi>Implicit Faith,</hi> and a <hi>Blind Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet the Superiors of our Church do challenge a
Right to Judge in ſome things for the People commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their charge, and will not allow that in thoſe
things they ſhould Judge for themſelves; and they are
<hi>All things that relate to Publick Order,</hi> and which may
without Sin be determined one way or another,
but are capable of a better or worſe Determination;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62890:23"/>
that is, <hi>All Indifferent things.</hi> We ſay that things of
this nature being determined by a <hi>Competent Authority,</hi>
ought without farther inquiry into the Reaſons of ſuch
Determination, to be done by all that are under that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
As for the Peoples <hi>Faith</hi> in God, and their <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
to him in doing what he hath Commanded and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
what he hath Forbidden, our Church does not
reſolve that into her own Authority, but into thoſe very
Reaſons upon which they that are in Authority do build
their own Faith and Obedience; which Reaſons are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Holy Scriptures. But as to her Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Orders in all things neither injoined by God
himſelf, nor by him forbidden, ſhe expecteth Submiſſion
to them upon the Account of her own Authority; and
alloweth not us to Judge of the <hi>Expediency</hi> or <hi>Inexpedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
of them before we will Conform our Practice to them.
All which is ſo to be underſtood that ſtill her Authority
in theſe things is ſuppoſed to be of God, and the Duty
of Submitting thereunto required in the general precepts
of Obedience to Superiors.</p>
            <p>But if any Man ask,<note place="margin">Caſe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> 
               <hi>Who is to be Judge of things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
as to a Mans practice, whether his own Conſcience
or his Superior?</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 2.</note> I Anſwer that as to a Mans own practice,
<hi>himſelf is to be Judge what things are Indifferent,</hi> and
which conſequently come within the compaſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Authority to Determin. For it is plain enough
that by the ſame Rule which ſheweth us what is <hi>Duty,</hi>
and what is <hi>Sin,</hi> we come to Judge of what is <hi>Indifferent.</hi>
And therefore when we grant to Private Perſons a
Judgment of Diſcretion concerning <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> we
cannot deny them the right to Judge what is <hi>neither</hi>
Duty <hi>nor</hi> Sin, but <hi>Indifferent;</hi> which is the Sum of
what the Author of the <hi>Caſe in behalf of Diſſenters</hi> hath
ſaid upon that matter.<note place="margin">P. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But then how can Authority pretend to abridge pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62890:23"/>
Perſons of <hi>Judging,</hi> as to their own practice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Indifferent</hi> things? To this I Anſwer in the
Words of the ſame Author, where he acknowledges his
Adverſary to have <hi>ſaid well to thoſe who cannot comply
with ſome things required in the Liturgy and can ſay no
more then that they think them not Decent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 36.</note> 
               <hi>not Expedient,
not Orderly, for,</hi> ſays he, <hi>no Private Perſon is a Judge
of theſe things.</hi> Which is an excellent ſaying, but ſo
directly contrary to the main principles of his Book,
that I wonder how it fell from him. We are then to
Judge whether the things required by Authority be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi>
that is, <hi>Lawful;</hi> and then to Judge no farther
<hi>as to our own Practice:</hi> But for the <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
and <hi>Orderlineſs</hi> of thoſe things to leave our Superiors
to Anſwer to God for that. Our doing them is War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by our Rule, which is to obey Authority in all
Lawful things.</p>
            <p>Now it is things of this ſort only, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi> and <hi>Prudent</hi> Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what is moſt <hi>likely</hi> to <hi>Edify,</hi> that our Superiors
pretend to Judge for us what is, and what is not to be
done; ſo as to <hi>allow us no right to Judge for our ſelves,
about them.</hi> They claim Obedience to their Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in theſe things, upon the Account of <hi>their</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which, when the matter is <hi>Lawful,</hi> ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado conclude our <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed they Judge alſo what <hi>Faith</hi> we are to profeſs,
what <hi>Worſhip</hi> we are to offer up to God, and what
<hi>Life</hi> we are to lead, in order to our receiving the
benefit of Church Communion; and by conſequence
they do take upon them to Judge in our behalf, what
are the Articles of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, what is the true
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Worſhip, and what it is to lead a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Life. For otherwiſe it were impoſſible that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould diſcreetly and honeſtly uſe that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62890:24"/>
Authority which he hath left them to take into the
Church thoſe that are duly qualified for it, and to turn out
thoſe that are no longer fit to be continued in it. But
ſtill there is a great difference between their Judging
for us in thoſe things, and in the matters aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
            <p>For they ſuppoſe that the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian
Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Commandments</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> are the ſame that
ever they were from the beginning of the Church; and
that it is not in the Power of Man to make any alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in theſe ſtanding Rules of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and that
Obedience is not due to any Authority of Man going
about to make ſuch alterations. From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that Private Perſons ſhould be able to Judge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
true <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> conſinſts as well as their Superiors, that
they alſo may offer up unto God a Reaſonable Service.
To which end the Bible is put into all Mens hands;
the meaning of the Scriptures is opened in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Aſſemblies; the People are trained up to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the particulars of Chriſtian Faith and Obedience,
with the Reaſons and Motives thereof, that as we ſaid
before, they may be able to reſolve their Faith into the
ſame grounds of Divine Authority, upon which the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
and <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Church do themſelves believe.
And we do Unanimouſly acknowledge, that if this
Church makes the profeſſion of falſe Doctrine, or the
braking of any of Gods Commandments, a condition
of her Communion; they that upon this account Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from her Communion are before God clear of
the Guilt of <hi>Schiſm</hi> in ſo doing. And here ſhe makes
all Private Perſons Judges for themſelves, whether ſhe
doth this or not, and that by training them up the
beſt way ſhe can, to be able to inform themſelves in
theſe matters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:62890:24"/>
But the caſe is otherwiſe with reſpect to <hi>Indifferent</hi>
things relating to Gods Worſhip. For though our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
profeſs that they are not to meddle, in adding
to or taking from the <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>Commandments of
God;</hi> and though they appeal to Private Perſons, that
they do not in <hi>Fact</hi> uſurp an Authority to this purpoſe,
which they <hi>profeſs</hi> to diſclaim; yet in theſe Indifferent
things, they claim a Power to add, or diminiſh, or to
make ſuch expedient alterations, as they ſhall think fit
to be made; and this without being any way account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the People for their diſcretion in ſo doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Orders be obeyed: And we ſay that whoever
they are, that will not be concluded by Authority in
theſe things, but upon any pretence whatſoever taken
from them, do break away from the Communion of
the Church, they are Guilty of <hi>Schiſm</hi> in ſo doing.
And this muſt be truly ſaid, if what that Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
hath ſaid be true, <hi>that no Private Perſon is Judge
of thoſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I think any one may ſee a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>claim</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Judge of what ſhe impoſes upon her Members, and
the <hi>claim</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the ſame with
reference to hers; that in the former caſe it is unjuſt
and unreaſonable; but in the later very equal and
neceſſary, and which no Man that is not over-ruled by
a fit of paſſion and prejudice, but muſt allow to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Authority.</p>
            <p>Whereas therefore we have conſidered the points in
Queſtion between the Diſſenters and our ſelves, with
reſpect to <hi>Prudence, Expedience,</hi> and <hi>Better Edification:</hi>
We ſay withal that this is more than we were bound
to do in order to the Conviction of Diſſenters, that it
is their Duty to conform to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi>
of the Church. And that becauſe the Authority by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62890:25"/>
which they are Eſtabliſht obligeth us to Submiſſion (if
there be nothing in them to make our Communion
with the Church Sinful) though we ſhould be ſo arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
as to think we could have ordered theſe matters
with more diſcretion, if <hi>our Advice</hi> had been taken. But
if, ſetting aſide the conſideration of Authority, we have
moreover ſhewn that upon all accounts of <hi>Decency</hi> and
<hi>Expediency, Forms of Prayer</hi> are to be preferred before
<hi>Extemporary Prayers,</hi> and that the particulars now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
againſt are ſo far from betraying any want of
Judgment in thoſe that preſcribed them, that they are
Indications of the great <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Caution</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they proceeded; we have not, I ſay, performed
this, believing it <hi>neceſſary</hi> to prove the Separation to be
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſtifiable,</hi> but intending to ſhew thereby that it is
<hi>more Inexcuſable.</hi> And although it was no part of our
<hi>Deſign</hi> to render <hi>thoſe</hi> of the Separation more Inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by this performance, yet I beſeech them to take
care that it happens not ſo in the <hi>Event.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If after all, it be asked what an Inferior is to do,
that Judgeth thoſe things to be <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful,</hi> which his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
in full Perſwaſion that they are <hi>Indifferent</hi> at
leaſt, require him to do? I Anſwer, as all Men that
have a Senſe of Honeſty will Anſwer; That whileſt he
is perſwaded that they are Unlawful, he ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
them. But then, as no Man of Underſtanding
will deny, he is yet a Sinner before God for refuſing
that Obedience to a Lawful Authority, which he
ought to perform; ſince in order to the performance
of it, he might and ought to underſtand his Duty bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than he does. For as the forementioned Author
ſays, <hi>Things Indifferent and Things Commanded and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
are not Things which we Fancy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 3.</note> 
               <hi>but which indeed
are ſo.</hi> If the Light of Nature, and the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are a Rule of what is <hi>Duty,</hi> and what is Sin, they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62890:25"/>
are a Rule alſo of what is Indifferent: And the ſame
Light that ſhews what is <hi>neceſſary to be done,</hi> and what
is <hi>neceſſary not to be done,</hi> does withal ſhew what is
<hi>Lawful</hi> to be <hi>done</hi> or to be <hi>forborn.</hi> And as an Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſwaſion that ſomething is <hi>Lawful</hi> which God
hath forbidden, will not acquit any Man, that hath the
means of better Information, from Sin, in doing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Perſwaſion of the Lawfulneſs of what he
does: So neither will any Mans Erroneous Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that his Superiors require him to do what is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
when the thing it ſelf is Lawful, acquit him of
the Guilt of Diſobedience in following that Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In what degrees <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Mans Ignorance in
theſe things is culpable, God only knoweth for the moſt
part, and therefore he only can <hi>Judge the World in
Righteouſneſs.</hi> But more or leſs culpable it is in <hi>All</hi> that
have means of Knowledge. And it concerns every one
of us, as we love our own Souls, to conſider Impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what God hath Commanded and what he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
in his <hi>Word,</hi> and conſequently what he has left
to our Liberty; and that becauſe his <hi>Word</hi> is a Rule
ſufficiently plain as to theſe things.</p>
            <p>For if <hi>thoſe</hi> to whom God hath given <hi>Authority,</hi>
being corrupted in their Judgments by Paſſion or any
Worldly Intereſt, take thoſe things to be <hi>Lawful</hi> which
<hi>God hath forbidden,</hi> and impoſe them upon All that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to their Rule; their Perſwaſion ſhall not hinder their
being grievous Sinners againſt God, nor Exempt them
from being anſwerable to him for <hi>abuſing their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
and for all the pernicious conſequences thereof in
<hi>drawing ſome Men into Wicked Practices,</hi> and in <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others for well doing.</hi> And by like Reaſon, if <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
not rightly attending to the Rule of their Duty, are
grown to a Perſwaſion that thoſe things are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful,</hi>
which their Superiors injoin them to do; whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62890:26"/>
they are <hi>Indifferent;</hi> and thereupon refuſe to do
them: This Perſwaſion ſhall not acquit them before
God, nor hinder them from being anſwerable for <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their
Liberty,</hi> and for all the pernicious Conſequences
of their Diſobedience, in <hi>Setting a bad Example,</hi> in
<hi>Breaking the Peace of the Church,</hi> in <hi>Diſturbing Publick
Order,</hi> and, which very often happens, in <hi>Giving occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the worſt of Men to profane the Name of God, and
to ſpeak Evil and Blaſphemous things of his Holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
I ſay, Ignorance will help no more in this later caſe
than in the former, becauſe it is as eaſie for the <hi>Subject</hi>
to know what is <hi>Indifferent,</hi> as for the <hi>Ruler</hi> to know
what is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful.</hi> Theſe conſiderations I confeſs do
more properly belong to the laſt Plea of <hi>Conſcience;</hi>
but it was very convenient to touch upon them here,
where we have been inquiring what things they are,
in which Authority is to over-rule private Judgment,
and to determine the Practice of Inferiors; and withal
how great a difference there is between the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Anſwering this
Common Queſtion: <hi>Who ſhall be the Judge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I come now to the laſt Difference conſequent upon
the<hi> two firſt </hi>reſpecting<hi> Authority, </hi>and<hi> Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>and that is the<hi> Difference of the Principles upon which
each ſide Separates, as to their tendency either to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
or to overthrow one Communion amongſt Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This will fall under a double Conſideration. 1. That
of maintaining one Communion amongſt Chriſtians in
this Kingdom. 2. That of maintaining one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Forreign Churches. I ſhall begin with the
Firſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity at home.</hi> The <hi>Romaniſt</hi> pretends that
upon the grounds of <hi>our Reformation,</hi> Diviſions and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62890:26"/>
will be endleſs amongſt us; <hi>We</hi> alſo pretend
that the principles of the <hi>Separation from the Church of
England,</hi>
tend to the ſame: But with what difference
of Reaſon on each ſide, it is eaſy to Judge by what has
been ſaid already. We have Reaſon to think there
would be no end of Diviſions, if a <hi>Competent Authority,</hi>
injoining nothing but what is <hi>Lawful</hi> to be done in the
Communion of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> is not to be obeyed: And
certainly this may be very true, although it be falſe,
that to Submit to the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
and that too in things Unlawful to be done by any
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or by any <hi>Man,</hi> is neceſſary to prevent Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
We ſay farther, that there can be no need
of an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Tyranny</hi> on the one hand, and a <hi>blind
Obedience</hi> on the other, to keep thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> together
in one Communion that live within one <hi>Juriſdiction;</hi>
if a <hi>due</hi> uſe of Authority in Lawful Superiors on the
one hand, and a <hi>Dutiful Subjection</hi> of Inferiors thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
on the other, would do the buſineſs, as moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it would. But if ſome Men will be <hi>Stubborn,</hi> we
cannot help that, any more than we can hinder other
Men from being <hi>Tyrants.</hi> But we are ſure it concerns
both the one and the other, as much as their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerns them, not to be ſo. And if this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will not keep them within bounds, and make them
Wiſe and Honeſt; they muſt Anſwer it to God one
day. And in the mean time <hi>Subjects</hi> that Suffer <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly</hi>
for refuſing to Obey the <hi>Wicked</hi> Commands of
their Superiors, muſt bear it as patiently as they can,
and by their <hi>Prayers to God,</hi> and their <hi>Meek Obedience
to their Rulers</hi> in all <hi>Lawful</hi> things, endeavour to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
themſelves into their good Opinion. And <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi>
that are vexed with Froward and Diſorderly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
who break <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Communion when no juſt
Cauſe is given them, muſt do what they can to lay
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62890:27"/>
the Truth before them; and if this be to no purpoſe,
they muſt uſe their Authority as Prudently as they can
to prevent the Evil Example from going farther.</p>
            <p>We are ſenſible what advantages the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make
to themſelves againſt our Reformation by the examples
of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> by the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> When
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have Men and Women of weak underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to deal with, they tell them, that <hi>the Reformation</hi>
is run out into ſeveral <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> and no Man
can tell where Separation will end: If therefore you
Love <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> return to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> where we
are all of one Faith and Communion. The <hi>Separatiſts</hi>
on the other ſide ſet off their claims to an unreſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Liberty of chooſing in what Communion to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God, by ſhewing to their Proſelytes the <hi>Tyranny</hi>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Now we of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
are as much againſt the <hi>Tyrannical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations</hi> of
that Church as the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and as much for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity
againſt cauſleſs Separation,</hi> and for <hi>Obedience</hi> to Lawful
Authority <hi>againſt Stubbornneſs,</hi> as the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> And
both theſe upon principles that conſiſt well with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
We ſay on the one ſide that a Foreigner
ſhould not affect an Authority over us, and that thoſe
who have the Authority, ought to require nothing in
the Communion of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but what is agreeable to
Gods Word, and Lawful to be done: And on the other
ſide, that in ſuch things we ought to do what is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and by no means to run into a Separate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
Upon theſe principles we departed from <hi>Rome,</hi>
and ſtick where we are; and I truſt that through the
Grace of God, we ſhall neither go back to <hi>Rome,</hi> nor
run after the <hi>Separation,</hi> there being no need, either of
the former to preſerve <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> or of the later to avoid
<hi>Tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To draw to a concluſion of this matter; The main
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62890:27"/>
Reaſon of our Separation from <hi>Rome</hi> was this, that we
could not continue in her Communion, without doing
things that God hath plainly forbidden: The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of our Church was at firſt effected by, and
hath all along ſtood upon Good and Juſt Authority:
She does not only hold forth all neceſſary means of
Salvation, but ſhe requires nothing to be done in her
Communion that is contrary to Gods Word. And
therefore we hold our ſelves bound under the pain of
<hi>Schiſm</hi> to continue in her Communion. Now I do not
underſtand how upon theſe principles Men muſt run
into <hi>Endleſs Separations,</hi> unleſs it be impoſſible for us
(whatever we pretend) to know who are our Lawful
Governours, and to know what God hath Commanded,
and what he hath Forbidden us to do. And I muſt
confeſs if theſe things be Impoſſible to be known 'tis a
Fooliſh thing for any Man to trouble his Conſcience
with Caſes of <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Separation.</hi> As for the
Diſſenters (to omit the <hi>Independents</hi> whoſe Churches
are in their very Conſtitution inconſiſtent with Submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to a Common Authority in matters of Worſhip)
they have forſaken us for nothing but becauſe the
Forms of our Worſhip, or our two or three <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
in it, are not Commanded in Gods Word, and becauſe
in things left otherwiſe to our Liberty, we are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the Authority of our Superiors: Or becauſe
theſe things might be better ordered, and becauſe the
Communion which they have taken upon them to ſet
up in Oppoſition to the Church of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>purer</hi>
than ours, though ours be a Lawful Communion. Now
theſe principles do indeed tend to Endleſs Separations
unleſs theſe Men could tell us either how we could be
United in one Communion, though <hi>all of us believed it
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful to Obey a Competent Authority that ſhould preſume
to determin any Indifferent things relating to Gods Worſhip;</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:62890:28"/>
or <hi>what particular Communion that is from which it would
be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful to Separate even upon</hi> this principle; <hi>That
there is no Obligation to Communion, where there is any
thing poſſible to be mended in the outward mode of Gods
Worſhip.</hi> In a Word, they that Separate upon Juſt and
Neceſſary cauſe as the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath done
from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and ſtop there, are not to
be charged with the conſequence of their practice,
who Separate without ſuch Cauſes, as the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> do
from <hi>our Church.</hi> And if they have proceeded farther
than they are able to juſtify themſelves by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of our Reformation, they muſt Anſwer for it
themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The principles of <hi>our Reformation</hi> do not obſtruct
our Communion with any true Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
where there are no Unlawful Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But ſo do the principles of the <hi>Diſſenters Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the ſame reaſon that our Governours determin
one Common order of Worſhip and Diſcipline for the
Churches over which they have Authority; The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of other Churches alſo may determin in theſe
things according to their Prudence for the People ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to their Authority. And we, who blame the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for interpoſing her Authority amongſt
us, with whom ſhe has no more Right to meddle than
any other Forreign Church has, muſt in all things that
come within the Liberty of Chriſtians, leave other
<hi>Churches</hi> that are as <hi>Independent</hi> upon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> as we are
upon <hi>Rome,</hi> to their Authority and Liberty. And this
is what our Church has expreſly declared. <hi>In theſe our
doings we condemn not other Nations nor preſcribe any thing
but to our own People only, for we think it convenient that
every Country ſhould uſe ſuch Ceremonies as they ſhall think
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62890:28"/>
beſt to the ſetting forth of Gods Honor and Glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface to the Liturgy.</note> 
               <hi>and to
the reducing of the People to a moſt Perfect and Godly
living without Error or Superſtition, and that they ſhould
put away other things, which from time to time they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be moſt abuſed, as in Mens Ordinances it often
chanceth diverſly in divers Countries.</hi> In purſuance of
which excellent and truly <hi>Catholick</hi> Declaration, I would
not only Communicate with Foreign Churches, who
differ from us in nothing but matters of <hi>From</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony;</hi>
but if I were amongſt them, I ſhould obſerve
their Eſtabliſh'd <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> of Worſhip; and though
I thought our own way at home, worthy upon all the
accounts of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Tendency</hi> to <hi>Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
to be preferred before theirs; yet I ſhould not
only conform to their way; but Religiouſly abſtain from
creating any prejudice againſt it in the minds of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
People in thoſe places; and rather do all that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly</hi>
I could to bring thoſe to a favourable Opinion
of it, who were prejudiced againſt it. This is that
Rule which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought ſhould take place, not
only in reſpect of thoſe <hi>Orders</hi> which were Eſtabliſh'd
by <hi>Synods of Biſhops,</hi> but in reſpect alſo of thoſe <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi>
which had crept into particular Churches though
it was hard to tell <hi>why</hi> or <hi>how</hi> they came in. <hi>In things
of this Nature</hi> ſaith he <hi>there is one moſt wholeſom Rule to
be obſerved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad Januarium.</note> 
               <hi>That wherever we ſee any of them obtain which
are neither contrary to Faith nor good Manners,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. 119.</note> 
               <hi>and have
ſome tendency to Edification, we ſhould not only abſtain
from finding fault with them, but Commend and Practiſe
them our ſelves.</hi> And yet he complains in this very <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle</hi>
of the multitude of Ceremonious Obſervations, in
which particular Churches differed from one another,
and wiſhes that a Reformation were made by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Thus in the foregoing Epiſtle, ſpeaking of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
obſervations of divers places, for Inſtance, that <hi>ſome
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62890:29"/>
faſt upon the Saturday</hi> and <hi>ſome do</hi> not,<note place="margin">Ep. 118.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of this kind which are <hi>to be accounted Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
Nothing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>does more become the Gravity
and Prudence of a Chriſtian, then to do after the manner
of that Church into which he ſhall happen to come.</hi> Then
he relates St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his celebrated Anſwer to <hi>Monica</hi>
about things of this ſort: <hi>When I am at</hi> Rome <hi>I Faſt on
the</hi> Saturday, <hi>when I am here at</hi> Milan <hi>I do not Faſt.
And ſo when thou comeſt into any Church, obſerve its Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
if thou wouldeſt neither give juſt Cauſe of Offence,
nor take Offence without Cauſe.</hi> This advice St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
magnified highly, and the more he thought of it the
better he liked it. <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have often with great
ſorrow conſidered how the minds of Weak Chriſtians have
been diſturbed, by the Quarrelſom humour and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Niceneſs of ſome of the Brethren, who upon very ſlight
grounds of Reaſoning, or being addicted to their own Cuſtoms
at home, or fond of what they have obſerved abroad, raiſe
ſuch Wrangling Diſputes about things that cannot be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Determined either by the Authority of Holy Scripture,
or the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Tradition of the Church Catholick, or by
the Conſideration of what is beſt for Reformation of Life,
that they ſeem to reckon nothing well done, but what they
do themſelves.</hi> I ſhall add no more but that plain Rule
he gives elſewhere to this purpoſe: <hi>As to things in which the
Scripture defines nothing certain one way or the other,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad Caſula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> 
               <hi>the
Cuſtom of the Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. 86.</note> 
               <hi>and the Decrees of our Anceſtors,
are to be held for Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by this and much more that might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
we may ſee what the true Notion of that <hi>Liberty</hi> was
which <hi>the Ancient Church</hi> allowed in matters of Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
Not that there was no Rule in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Churches for the Ordering and Regulating of things
of this ſort: For we find the Biſhops did uſe their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in theſe things, over their charges, as St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>'s
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62890:29"/>
Words to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Mother about the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
caſe do plainly imply.<note place="margin">Ep. 86.</note> 
               <hi>Reſiſt not thy Biſhop in
this matter; but what he does, that do thou without any
Scruple or Diſpute:</hi> And beſides thoſe <hi>particular Cuſtoms,</hi>
the Variety and Multitude of which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of,<note place="margin">Ep. 119.</note> there were the <hi>Determinations of Epiſcopal Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi>
concerning things not Determined in Scripture,
which he does not complain of. But their Liberty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in this, that the Rules of this ſort eſtabliſht in
the Communion of any Church, were not impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Foreign</hi> Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Catholick</hi> Communion was
not broken upon the account of different Rites, and
Cuſtoms. For though St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſorry to ſee the
minds of ſome Weak Chriſtians troubled about Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this kind, yet I do not find that he had any
occaſion given him to complain that Communion was
broken upon theſe accounts; as before his time it had
been, by Pope <hi>Victors</hi> raſhneſs in preſuming to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Biſhops for obſerving <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon
the fourteenth of <hi>March;</hi> had not <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and other Wiſe
and Moderate perſons ſeaſonably interpoſed.</p>
            <p>To apply all this to the matter in hand: Since the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has made ſuch things conditions of
Communion with her as are in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s phraſe <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Faith and Good Manners,</hi> our Separation from
her upon this account, does not at all hinder us from
Communicating with any true Church in the World,
that does not bar us out by Unlawful Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
For in things that <hi>God</hi> hath left at <hi>Liberty,</hi>
this Church perſumes not to interpoſe her Authority
<hi>abroad;</hi> nor refuſes the Communion of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
whoſe Cuſtoms and Obſervations are <hi>different</hi> from
ours meerly becauſe they are <hi>different.</hi> Nay, let the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf make an end of Impoſing <hi>Falſe
Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Wicked Practices,</hi> and there will be an
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62890:30"/>
end of our <hi>Separation</hi> from her: Let her give over Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
things that God hath Forbidden, and make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Articles of Faith of things that are not revealed, but
are indeed contrary to Senſe and Reaſon; and ſhe
may for us uſe her Authority <hi>at home</hi> in things <hi>Indifferent;</hi>
and though ſhe be guilty of <hi>great Abuſes</hi> even in this
kind, which need a <hi>Reformation;</hi> yet I for my part
ſhould not break Communion with her for theſe things,
if ſhe would throughly Purge her ſelf from the other.
In the mean time we are of one Communion with all
<hi>Foreign</hi> Churches that preſume not to change the <hi>Faith,</hi>
nor to contradict the <hi>Laws</hi> of God; and this we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
by actual Communion with them, if we had
occaſion to go abroad amongſt them.</p>
            <p>But this makes our caſe very Different from that of
the Diſſenters who Separate from the Church. For ſo
long as they withdraw from our Communion for the
ſake of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Order that are not contrary to Gods
Word, and Separate from us upon this principle, that
every thing is Unlawful in Gods Worſhip which is
not Commanded in Scripture, but enjoined by our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
only; they muſt not upon thoſe principles have
Communicated with any Church in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times,
when there were far more <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncommanded Rites</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages</hi>
Eſtabliſh'd, for the regulating of Worſhip, than now
there are in our Church. And upon theſe principles
they muſt not Communicate with any <hi>Reformed</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
abroad, ſince how different ſo ever the External
<hi>Mode</hi> of their Worſhip may be from ours, yet ſome they
all have, and that conſiſting of Rules not Determined
by Gods Word, but by the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of Man. To
<hi>New England</hi> they muſt not go, hoping to find a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
there Lawful to be embraced upon theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
The <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to our <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
that are there, will ſtand to their own cenſures
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62890:30"/>
concerning <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and will make out
by their Church Authority ſuch as it is, what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſhew <hi>Chapter</hi> and <hi>Verſe</hi> for. Our Separatiſts if
they go thither ſhall find no other <hi>uſe</hi> of their <hi>Liberty</hi>
allowed there, but <hi>Conformity</hi> and <hi>Compliance</hi> with that
way of Worſhip and Government which there obtains.
It is a plain caſe that they who Separate from our
Church upon the account of Unommanded Rites
and Practices in Gods Worſhip, are ſomething more
obliged by this principle to avoid Communion with
all Foreign Churches; if Rules for Cuſtoms concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things Indifferent are to be found amongſt them
all, as moſt certainly ſuch Rules more or fewer all of
them have: For in the former caſe our <hi>Separatiſts</hi> are
diſobedient to their <hi>proper Governours</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> whoſe
Authority over them is ſome thing more clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable,
than that of the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
where they might happen to go. And therefore
if they will not in things of this Nature, be Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by an Authority <hi>at home,</hi> there is leſs reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their Conſciences will ſuffer them to be Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
therein by one <hi>abroad.</hi> I conclude therefore
that though <hi>our Reformation</hi> leaves usfree to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with all Churches abroad, that do not require
Sinful Terms of Communion as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
does; yet the <hi>Separation of the Diſſenters</hi> from us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
upon grounds deſtructive of Communion with
any Church in the World.</p>
            <p>Indeed I believe, moſt of our Diſſenters would Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with ſeveral <hi>Reformed Churches abroad,</hi> but
in ſo doing they muſt depart from the principles upon
which they Separate <hi>at home;</hi> unleſs they can find a
Reformed Church, which exerciſeth no Authority in
<hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer, nor in <hi>any Indifferent</hi> things for the
external Regulation of Publick Worſhip. But where
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62890:31"/>
ſuch a Church is to be found, I am yet to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>And thus much concerning thoſe Differences of the
Caſe, that are Conſequent upon the Difference in point
of <hi>Authority</hi> and of <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I come now to conſider the laſt Plea I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
which I confeſſed was not only <hi>Common</hi> to both
ſides, but which alſo may be as <hi>truly alledged</hi> on the
one ſide, as on the other. And that is the Plea of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Diſſenters ſay that they Separate from us, being
perſwaded that they ought ſo to do. And I muſt needs
ſay that ſome Degree of Integrity is implyed in this
Plea, if honeſtly it be made; and ſuch a Degree it is,
as without which no Man can be an honeſt Man. And
therefore inſtead of going about to make it queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
whether indeed it be out of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that they
generally Separate from us; I ſhall here admit it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
only that it ſtands every one of them in hand,
to be as ſure as they can be, that there is this Reaſon
at leaſt for their Separation from us. And I hope none
of them will take this admonition in ill part; ſince
I charge my ſelf and deſire all the People of our own
Communion to be careful that we be fully perſwaded in
our own minds that in Duty to God we are bound to
Separate even from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that we
do not either chuſe one Communion or refuſe another
for Carnal and Worldly Intereſt. For we ſay the
very ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That in <hi>Conſcience</hi> we are
perſwaded, that to forſake the Communion of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of every Church in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
as the Terms of her Communion now ſtand,
is a neceſſary Duty. But then if we had no more to
ſay for our ſelves then this comes to, we ſhould make
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62890:31"/>
but a very Weak <hi>Apology</hi> for our Separation from the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, and have ſome Reaſon to be aſhamed
of it.</p>
            <p>For, to deal plainly, this is no more then what a
<hi>Turk</hi> or a <hi>Jew</hi> may ſay for refuſing to become a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
and no more then what he may truly ſay too, that
is, that his <hi>Conſcience</hi> will not let him be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
ſince he is verily perſwaded that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is not from
God, ſo far as it is contrary to the Religion by him
profeſſed. Now this, if it be truly ſaid, ſhall make
him a <hi>more honeſt Turk</hi> or <hi>Jew,</hi> than another that is in
his Conſcience convinced of the Truth, which with
his mouth he denies, yet it ſhall not make <hi>that</hi> which
he <hi>profeſſes</hi> to be more true in <hi>his</hi> mouth, than it is
in the mouth of a <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> And I ſuppoſe no <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
will ſay that his pretence of Conſcience though it
be not meer pretence, will acquit him of Sin in reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> when it's offered to him with
reaſonable Evidence. From whence I think it follows,
that the <hi>Miſinformation of his Conſcience,</hi> or his <hi>Erroneous
perſwaſion</hi>
is his <hi>Sin.</hi> And therefore though it be true
that we do Separate from the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion out
of Conſcience; yet whether we do well upon the whole
matter in this or not, muſt be judged of by thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
upon which we are perſwaded that ſo we ought
to do, and not meerly by our perſwaſion it ſelf. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
we ſhould lay down a principle that would
Vindicate a Man in the greateſt Errors that can be
profeſs'd, and juſtify him in the moſt Wicked things that
can be done under an Erroneous perſwaſion that thoſe
are not <hi>Errors</hi> and that theſe are not <hi>Wicked</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I beſeech all thoſe that forſake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> upon a <hi>general</hi> and
looſe perſwaſion of which they are able to give little or no
<hi>particular</hi> account, that they do well in forſaking us,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62890:32"/>
and that they ſhould Sin in Communicating with us:
I beſeech them, I ſay, to lay this to heart, and a moſt
evident truth it is, that if their perſwaſion be Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
they are notwithſtanding their perſwaſion guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Schiſm:</hi> And withal, that if they are perſwaded,
this is no great matter, as I plainly perceive they are
for the moſt part, yet if <hi>Schiſm</hi> be a very great and
aggravated Sin; neither will their <hi>Ignorance</hi> acquit
them of <hi>guilt</hi> proportionable to the heinous Nature of
the Sin. For my part I ſhould not envy their ſafety,
could I believe they had reaſon to be ſecure, upon giving
this account of their Separation and that honeſtly too,
that <hi>they are ſatisfied in Conſcience</hi> about it; and there
is an end. But I have reaſon to warn them of the
Danger of ſuch Preſumption; ſince many of the <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Heathens</hi> that delivered up the Servants of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
to be Killed for their profeſſion, were doubtleſs ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in Conſcience, that they did God Service in ſo
doing. And for ought I know ſome that have ſerved
the ends of the Bloody Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> may have been
ſo perſwaded too. But do you think that God will
give them thanks for what they did, becauſe of their
good meaning? And if you do not think ſo; you have
no reaſon to conclude that you ſhall be acquitted
from your Separation, if a <hi>Sin</hi> it be, and a <hi>great one</hi>
too, meerly becauſe you do not believe it to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of any great Conſequence, or indeed any fault at
all, but rather a Duty.</p>
            <p>I do not know to what purpoſe Divine Truth is
made known to us by <hi>Nature</hi> and by <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the
Laws of God are Written upon our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and theſe
and more Laws beſides Written in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> if we
might yet be ſafely Ignorant of our Duty as we are
<hi>Men,</hi> or as we are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and of that <hi>Truth</hi> which
is neceſſary to the performance of that Duty. To what
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62890:32"/>
end hath God made <hi>known</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> and given us the
<hi>means</hi> of knowing it, and a <hi>Reaſonable</hi> Nature to make
us capable of uſing thoſe means, if Ignorance might
ſtill be Pleaded in our Juſtification? For my Part I
cannot tell, and let him that cannot look to it, that
no Prejudice nor Paſſion, nor Lazineſs, nor Worldly
Intereſt lye at the bottom of his Heart either to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his ſearching, or if he ſearches, to hinder his find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out that Divine Truth, which is the Rule of his
Duty. I ſay this the rather, becauſe no body will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that it is well ſaid. But it fares with this as it does
with many other good Sayings, it is ſtill by all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be <hi>good,</hi> but it is by few well applied.
But thus far at leaſt I may deſire thoſe of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to apply it to themſelves, that if they <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily</hi>
Divide themſelves from the Communion of this
Church, the perſwaſion of their Conſcience that they
are bound to divide from us, will by no means bring
them off in ſo doing from the Condemnation that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to <hi>that Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To break the Communion of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Ordinance and Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who
made his Church <hi>one Body;</hi> and the Conſequences of
it are very Deſtructive of all the great ends of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi>
and in ſuch Caſes, the blame is very great,
wherever it lies; and I will be bold to ſay, it
could not be very great, if it were hard for an
honeſt and unprejudiced mind to find what ought, and
what ought not to be done to maintain <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
amongſt <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And therefore it concerns
every Man as he tenders the Salvation of his Soul, to
look to it, that the Cauſe of his Separation be Juſt.
For this is one of thoſe Caſes wherein a meer Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
of Conſcience, will not ſecure a Man acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to it from ſinning againſt God. And from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62890:33"/>
hence it is evident that this Plea that we cannot in
<hi>Conſcience</hi> hold Communion with the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi>
may in our mouths be a very good Plea againſt the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> as without queſtion it is if our Conſciences are
rightly informed as to the Points controverted between
them and us: But the ſame Plea in the mouths of the
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> may not be
good, as moſt certainly it is not, if they are perſwaded
that our Church hath given them juſt Cauſe for their
Separation, when there is indeed no ſuch matter. And
therefore we may at leaſt hope that they will all of
them now ſeriouſly apply themſelves to conſider the
merits of the Cauſe between them and us, which they
are now in an eſpecial manner bound to do, ſince
the Charity of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of this City hath made
the doing of it eaſie to all Perſons, that will be at
the Pains to Judge for themſelves, and that by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the particular Queſtions in Controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and us to the Capacity of <hi>Ordinary Chriſtians.</hi>
And if they will not uſe this Opportunity that is given
them to Conſider theſe things they will have the more
to Anſwer to God; and they moſt of all that diſſwade
them from it.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Point: whereas the <hi>Papiſts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
againſt our Separation from them, under pretence
of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as if this had ſhewn the way to all
ſorts of <hi>Sectaries</hi> to Separate from us upon the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
We hope that all Perſons who are not willing
to be deceived, will be able to Diſtinguiſh between a
<hi>miſguided</hi> Conſcience on the one hand, and a <hi>well In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Conſcience</hi> on the other; and then proceed
to examine the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of our Separation, whether they
be not <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary;</hi> and if they find them ſo to
be, that they will acquit us from all their blame, who
Separate without <hi>ſuch Reaſons.</hi> For it is very Fooliſh
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62890:33"/>
and unjuſt not to allow the pretence of <hi>Conſcience</hi> to
be good in any Caſe, becauſe it is not ſo in all Caſes.
Surely if one Mans Conſcience tell him that he may
and ought to Rebel, while himſelf does not believe
that 'tis <hi>Rebellion</hi> he is going about; this hinders not,
but another Man may Lawfully and juſtly pretend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
for his <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and Duty to the Government.
And though in ſome Places of the World, there are
Sovereign Princes, who extend their Authority for the
maintaining of <hi>Damnable Errors,</hi> and the ſuppreſſing of
Gods <hi>Holy Truth,</hi> and all the while believe that they
uſe their Power as they ought to do; yet this ſhall not
hinder but that Princes who believe and profeſs the true
Religion, and withal protect and encourage it with
their Authority as much as they can, being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that ſo they ought to do, that they, I ſay, ſhall
for this receive Gods thanks and rewards, while the
former ſhall go without them. In like manner <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
may be pretended for Diſobeying the juſt Laws
of that Authority which God hath ſet in the World,
and in the Church; but this ſhall not hinder his Plea
from being good, who pretends Conſcience for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to Commit <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though all the Powers under
Heaven ſhould require him ſo to do. Men may by
miſtake, think they do God good Service in murdering
his Servants; For this has been done by you of the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if in ſuch <hi>Plain</hi> Caſes as theſe,
your underſtandings have been ſo foully Corrupted, it
is not ſo greatly to be wondred at, that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of other Men are ſo perverted by Intereſt and
Paſſion, as to believe themſelves <hi>Countermanded</hi> by <hi>God</hi>
in things <hi>required</hi> by their <hi>Superiors;</hi> but in which it
would <hi>not be their Sin,</hi> but a <hi>Performance of their Duty</hi>
to obey. And yet I hope this Anſwer <hi>whether it be
better to Obey God or Man, Judge ye,</hi> was once Truly and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62890:34"/>
Pertinently made; and may be ſo again. And ſo much
for the Difference of the Caſe with reſpect to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
which was the laſt thing to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>And now I know that all this will ſignify very little
to any Man that brings not an honeſt mind with him
to Conſider it, or who had rather take his Opinions
in theſe things upon Truſt, than be at the Pains to
Judge for himſelf. But why ſhould a Man diſparage
himſelf ſo much, as not to uſe that Underſtanding
which God hath given him in matters that Concern his
Salvation? Why ſhould he be ſuch an Enemy to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as not to let go a Dangerous miſtake, when he
may enjoy the Truth inſtead of it, if he will uſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Diligence to Conſider what is ſaid on both ſides?
Give me leave to put you in mind of your Duty in
this Caſe, in the Words of an Ancient <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writer
<hi>In all matters of Practice and Duty it Concerns every Man
to uſe his own Judgment and Diſcretion, in ſearching for
Truth, and in weighing what is fit to be done, rather
then to be betrayed into Error and Sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lactant. lib 2. De Origine Erroris. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>by ſuch a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
reliance upon others, as if himſelf had not the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a Man, and were incapable of Conſideration.</hi> God <hi>has
given to every Man his ſhare of Wit both to find out ſome
things by himſelf, and to weigh thoſe which he hears from
others. 'Tis Natural to all men to love Wiſdom, and to
deſire the Knowledge of the Truth. And they make Fools
of themſelves, who without Diſcretion take the Words of
their Leaders for all that they ſay, and follow them
more like Beaſts, than like Reaſonable Creatures,</hi> which
words are not ſo to be taken, as if it were <hi>Diſhonourable</hi>
or <hi>Dangerous</hi> to any Man to make uſe of the help of
others in Learning the Truth: For this were to deſtroy
the uſe of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to
take away the benefit of mutual endeavours to lead
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62890:34"/>
one another into a right Underſtanding of our Duty.
But for all this, it may be a very Fooliſh and Unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
part, and it may betray us into very Dangerous
Errors, not to uſe our own Judgment at all in matters
of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> and in <hi>Opinions</hi> leading to the one
or the other; but inſtead thereof to rely altogether
upon their Authority whom we have taken for our
Guides. This is what we ſay both to the People of
the <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and of the <hi>Diſſenting</hi> Party; that if they
would apply themſelves with Ordinary Diligence,
and with a ſincere mind, to find out the Truth in
thſe Caſes they would not meet with any great Difficulty
to Perplex them in the way; eſpecially if they whoſe
Authority they very much rely upon, would ſpeak as
plainly and clearly to the Points in Queſtion as, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Vanity I may ſay, we have hitherto done.</p>
            <p>We do not deſire them to ſtop their Ears againſt
thoſe whom they follow at preſent: All that we beg
of them is, that they would not take every thing upon
Truſt, that others tell them in theſe matters, but hear
what we alſo have to offer to them, and not only hear,
but conſider and weigh it with the beſt Judgment they
have. And let me ſay this to all thoſe whom I now
ſpeak of, whether <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that if you ſet
your ſelves with a ſincere deſire of being rightly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
to compare our Reaſons, with them whom
hitherto you have truſted, ſome Advantage you will
gain by it, whatever the Succeſs be. For <hi>if the
Truth be not on our ſide,</hi> you will in all likelihood
get this benefit by it, to be Confirmed in your own
way, upon better grounds than you had before. But
<hi>if it be,</hi> it is then to be hoped that through the
Grace of God you will diſcorn it, and entertain it, for
which bleſſing you and we ſhall have great reaſon to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62890:35"/>
yield our hearty Thanks and Praiſes to the <hi>Father of
Lights;</hi> who <hi>giveth Wiſdom to them that ask him.</hi> But
if you ſhould be ſo unhappily Prejudiced on the wrong
ſide as to miſs this benefit, yet let me tell you it will
turn to ſome good account for you at laſt, that you
took Pains to be better informed; and that you
were not altogether wanting to your ſelves to come to
a right Underſtanding of your Duty in theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
by diſpoſing your ſelves to Impartiality, and by
<hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>Meditating,</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi> in all this, for the
Illumination of Gods Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>And now, I truſt, there is little need to tell you,
that if your Leaders diſcourage you from taking this
pains, it may juſtly make you ſuſpect that your Cauſe
will not bear the Trial. If they would keep up <hi>your</hi>
Confidence by <hi>their own,</hi> and all the while divert you
from comparing one thing with another, and from
trying what is ſaid on both ſides; you have ſufficient
Cauſe to Queſtion either their Honeſty or their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
And the more unwilling they are that
you ſhould examin what we and they ſay, the more
Reaſon do they give you to reſolve that you will do
ſo.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewn how greatly different the Caſe of the
True <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant</hi> is from that of the <hi>Papiſt</hi> on
the one hand, and that of the <hi>Separatiſt</hi> on the other.
And though the difference be ſo very notorious as it
is, yet we know the <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> have repreſented our
Reformation under ſuch Colours, as to make it look
like <hi>Fanaticiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on the other hand that our Reformation is but a
better ſort of <hi>Popery.</hi> And ſome little popular things
are ſaid on both ſides to make theſe pretences look like
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62890:35"/>
Truth. But now I have brought theſe Colours into
the Light; and if you will but take upon your ſelves
to uſe your own Eyes, you may, I think, eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that you have been all this while abuſed. At leaſt
I have given you Reaſon enough to make farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
and to Conſider more particular Queſtions. But
if upon Reading this general Diſcourſe, you ſhould
reſolve to keep where you are, and to trouble your
ſelves no farther; I am Confident the true Reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
muſt be this, that you are afraid to proceed, leſt
you ſhould be convinced; and this is nothing leſs than
<hi>Wilfully</hi> to bar up your minds againſt the Knowledge
of the Truth. For though I have no conceit of this
performance, as if I had done any great matter in it;
yet I am Conſcious to my ſelf that I intended honeſtly
all along, and I am ſure I have Written plainly, and
have laid ſome things together that may give juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to any well meaning <hi>Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Sectary</hi> to Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſafety of the way he is in at preſent; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if he has never troubled himſelf to Conſider theſe
things before.</p>
            <p>And now I do heartily deſire you all, for I cannot
deſire this too often or too earneſtly; that you would
take the Word of God for your Rule, and propound
the Rewards of another Life for your end, and ſet the
Fear of God before your Eyes, whileſt you Conſider
and Examin theſe things. It is our concern for the
<hi>ſafety of your Souls,</hi> as well as for the <hi>Welfare</hi> of this
Poor Church ſo diſtreſſed with Adverſaries on both
ſides, that putteth us forward upon all occaſions, to
lay theſe things before you. Do not therefore Read
theſe Books which are indeed publiſht for <hi>your ſakes,</hi> as
if they were Written <hi>againſt you.</hi> There is not one of
us, I am Confident but is troubled to ſee you expoſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62890:36"/>
your ſelves to the penalties of the Laws of the Land
that are againſt you: But we are more ſorry to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that at the ſame time you do alſo incur the high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
of God. We would ſain have you to avoid
both the one and the other. And if you would heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to us, the worſt you would get by it, is to live
with leſs Diſturbance in this World, but whether that
ſhould prove true or not, you would walk in a more
Safe and Plain way to Heaven, than that which any
of you are in at preſent. And I hope you would not
grudge that good which this Church ſhould receive by
your return to us, when you would do your ſelves ſo
much more by it.</p>
            <p>If therefore you think our Importunity troubleſom,
pray remember what it is that makes us Importunate; and
let no miſconſtruction of the Deſign of your Friends,
render their honeſt endeavours Ineffectual to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.
We would have you underſtand the Truth,
and do your Duty; And as this end is Charitable, ſo
you muſt needs grant thoſe means to be Charitable
alſo, by which we are contributing towards it. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
our Concern that theſe means ſhould take place,
but it is yours ſomething more, if you are under great
and dangerous, miſtakes as I am perſwaded you are.
But if you ſhould be ſo prejudiced againſt us as to think
that we Write theſe Controverſies more in Concern
for the Temporal Intereſts of this Church, than for your
Spiritual Good, Pray will you make this profitable uſe
of that hard thought, as to excel us in this matter, by
being more careful not to mix any Carnal and Worldly
affection with your Judgment in <hi>Reading</hi> theſe things,
then you imagine us to be in <hi>Writing</hi> of them. Be
as ſtrict as you will in Examining what we ſay in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of our Church; only be willing that Truth ſhould
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62890:36"/>
Overcome; and Conſider that if that prevails againſt
your Errors, you indeed are the <hi>Conquerours,</hi> and that
the greateſt Gain will be yours, both in this World
and in the World to come.</p>
            <p>I have no mind to prejudge which Party it is that
we may hope to win more of to the Truth than of
the other; being very willing to believe that there is
no Cauſe of deſpairing to do good on either ſide.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> methinks, it ſhould not be
hard to diſſwade the moſt of them, from breaking the
Communion of that Church any longer, with which
they agree in the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and
from differing with <hi>Authority</hi> for the future about
things <hi>Indifferent.</hi> The Cauſe of the Separation, as
it is managed by themſelves is ſo very Slight, that one
would hope they ſhould be of themſelves ſomething
afraid to venture their being <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> upon it, and
conſequently that they ſhould be ready to conſider
what has been ſaid to ſhew that there is indeed no Juſt
Cauſe given them to Separate from our Church; and
that there is no Reaſon to call any thing <hi>Popery</hi> which
they diſlike in our Communion; as ſome of them
have done to the great diſadvantage of the <hi>Proteſtant
Religion;</hi> ſince as much as in them lay, they have
made the World believe that the Cauſe of Popery is
better than it is; and that it doth not conſiſt only of
Opinions and Practices that cannot be defended, but
of ſome alſo that may. And it is not the leaſt kindneſs
that the indiſcreet Zeal of ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> hath done to
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they have inveighed againſt
ſome things, which may be eaſily juſtified, as if they alſo
were <hi>Popiſh Corruptions.</hi> And the Learned Men of that
Church have not been behind hand in making uſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62890:37"/>
of this advantage, and that by ſtraining their utmoſt
Wit, to repreſent the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> under ſuch
Colours, as if it ſtood in Oppoſition to <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and
<hi>Liturgy,</hi> and to all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Canons</hi> and <hi>Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
And I am perſwaded the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> cannot do the
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion a greater kindneſs, than by forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to give them this occaſion for the Future. For let
a Cauſe be never ſo good in it ſelf, it is never like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to thrive in their hands, who inſtead of preſſing
their Adverſaries with what they can never maintain,
are ſtill forward to deny what they are well able to
prove.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> amongſt us, their miſtakes in Faith
and Worſhip are ſo Groſs and Foul that if they would
give themſelves a little time to Conſider what has, and
what may farther be ſaid to convince them; I do not
doubt but all of them that are endued with a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Underſtanding, and an Honeſt Senſe of things,
would ſoon feel thoſe palpable Errors, into the belief
and practiſe of which they have been hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded,
by an unreaſonable deference to the Authority
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and no longer ſtand off from
the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
any fault is, one would think, it ſhould be more
eaſily ſpied. Now theſe Men Separate from us meerly
becauſe we have abandoned thoſe wicked Doctrines and
Practices, which are of themſelves a moſt neceſſary Cauſe
of Separation from any Church in the World, that ſhould
Impoſe them. And therefore they of all Men are the
moſt Notorious <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> that can be imagined.
And I beſeech God to open their Eyes to ſee it; and
to recover into the <hi>way of Truth all ſuch as have Erred
and are Deceived;</hi> that thoſe who have hitherto been
obſtinate may <hi>prove all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5. 21.</note> and that thoſe who can
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62890:37"/>
be perſwaded to Conſider theſe things, may <hi>hold faſt
that which is good.</hi>
