         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OTHING but a great experience of Your Lordships Candor could warrant the laying what concernment I have in these Papers at Your Lordships feet. Not but that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is in it self Great and Venerable, and a considerable part of it built upon that Authority that needs no Patronage to defend it: But to prefix Your Lordships Name to a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject so thinly and meanly manag'd, may perhaps deserve a bigger Apologie than I can make. I have only brought some few scattered handfuls of Primitive Story, contenting my self to Glean, where I could not Reap. And I am well assur'd, that Your Lordships wisdom and love to Truth would neither allow me to make my Materials, nor to trade in Legends and Fabulous reports. And yet alas! how little solid Foundation is left to Build upon in these matters? So fatally mischievous was the carelesness of those who ought to have been the Guardians of Books and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their several Ages, in suffering the Records of the Ancient Church to perish. Vnfaithful Trustees, to look no better after such Divine and inestimable Treasures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them. Not to mention those infinite Devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that in all Ages have been made by Wars and Flames,
<pb facs="tcp:98271:3"/>
which certainly have prov'd the most severe and merciless Plagues and Enemies to Books.</p>
                  <p>By such unhappy accidents as these we have been robb'd of the Treasures of the wiser and better Ages of the World, and especially the Records of the first times of Christianity, whereof scarce any footsteps do remain. So that in this Enquiry I have been forc'd to traverse remote and desert paths, ways that afford little fruit to the weary Passenger: but the consideration, that it was <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> sweetned my journey, and rendred it pleasant and delightful. Our inbred thirst after knowledge naturally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to pursue the notices of former times, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to us with this peculiar advantage, that the Stream must needs be purer and clearer,<note place="margin">In Phileb. pag. 16.

                     <p>We live in times, wherein Religion is almost wholly dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into talk and clamour, men wrangle eternally about use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and insignificant Notions, and which have no tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to make a man either wiser or better.

one another with hard names and characters of reproach, and after all consecrate their fierceness with the honourable title of Zeal for Truth And what is yet a much sorer evil, the Peace and Order of an excellent Church, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the best that ever was since the first Ages of the Gospel, is broken down, her holy Offices derided, her solemn Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies deserted, her Laws and Constitutions slighted, the Guides and Ministers of Religion despised, and reduc'd to their Primitive Character, <hi>The Scum and Off-scouring of the World.</hi> How much these evils have contributed to the Atheism and Impiety of the present Age, I shall not take upon me to determine. Sure I am, the thing it self is too sadly visible, men are not content to be modest and retired Atheists, and with the <hi>Fool</hi> to <hi>say</hi> only <hi>in their hearts, there is no God</hi>; but Impiety appears with an open fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and disputes its place in every company, and without any regard to the Voice of Nature, the Dictates of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the common sence of Mankind, men perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily determine against a Supreme Being, account it a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant divertisement to Droll upon Religion, and a piece of Wit to plead for Atheism. To avoid the Press and troublesome importunity of such uncomfortable Reflections, I find no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way, than to retire into those Primitive and better times, those first and purest Ages of the Gospel, when men really were, what they pretended to be, when a solid Piety and Devotion, a strict Temperance and Sobriety, a Catholick and unbounded Charity, an exemplary Honesty and Integrity, a great reverence for every thing that was Divine and Sacred, rendred Christianity Venerable to the World, and led not only the Rude and the Barbarous, but the Learned and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter part of Mankind in triumph after it.</p>

It was drawn up under some more disadvantageous circumstances, than a matter of this nature did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; which were it worth the while to represent to the Reader, might possibly plead for a softer Censure. However such as it is, it is submitted to the Readers Ingenuity and Candor.</p>

                        </gap> as the <hi>Jews</hi> call it, <hi>the days of empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> commenced from the beginning of the World, and lasted till the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> And under this state the Laws which God gave for the exercise of Religion, and the Government of his Church were either Natural, or Positive. Natural Laws are those innate Notions and Principles, whether speculative or practical, with which every Man is born into the World, those common sentiments of Vertue and Religion, those <hi>Principia justi &amp; decori,</hi> Principles of fit and right, that naturally are upon the minds of Men, and are obvious to their reason at first sight, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding what is just and honest, and forbidding what is evil and uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and that not only in the general, that what is good is to be embraced, and what is evil to be avoided, but in the particular instances of duty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their conformity or repugnancy to natural light, being conversant about those things, that do not derive their value and authority from any arbitrary constitutions, but from the moral and intrinsick nature of the things themselves. These Laws, as being the results and dictates of right reason, are, especially as to their first and more immediate emanations, the same in all Men in the World, and in all Times and Places, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

That there are such Laws and Principles naturally planted in Mens breasts, is evident from the consent of Mankind, and the common experience of the World. Whence else comes it to pass, that all wicked Men even among the Heathens themselves, after the commission of gross sins, such as do more sensibly rouze and awaken conscience, are filled with horrors and fears of punishment? but because they are conscious to themselves of having vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated some Law and Rule of Duty. Now what Law can this be? not the
<pb n="III" facs="tcp:98271:6"/>
written and revealed Law, for this the Heathens never had: it must be therefore the inbred Law of Nature, that's born with them, and fixed in their minds, antecedently to any external revelation.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14, 15:</note> 
                        <hi>For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature</hi> (by the light and evidence, by the force and tendency of their natural notions and dictates) <hi>the things contained in the Law, these having not a Law, are a Law unto themselves, which shew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts,</hi>

And to this their very Consciences bear witness, for according as they either observe or break these natural Laws, their Consciences do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquit or condemn them. Hence we find God in the very infancy of the World, appealing to <hi>Cain</hi> for the truth of this, as a thing sufficiently plain and obvious, <hi>Why art thou wroth, and why is thy countenance fallen?</hi>

For what more comely and reasonable, and more agreeable to the first notions of our minds, than that we should worship and adore God alone, as the Author of our beings, and the Fountain of our happiness, and not derive the lustre of his incommunicable perfections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Creature; that we should entertain great and honourable thoughts of God, and such as become the Grandeur and Majesty of his being; that we should abstain from doing any wrong or injury to another, from invading his right, violating his priviledges, and much more from making any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon his life, the dearest blessing in this World; that we should be just and fair in our transactions, and <hi>do to all men, as we would they should do to us</hi>; that we should live chastely and temperately, and not by wild and extravagant lusts and sensualities offend against the natural modesty of our minds; that Order and Government should be maintained in the World, Justice advanced, and every Man secured in his just possessions? And so sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table did these Laws seem to the reason and understandings of Men, that the <hi>Jews</hi> though the most zealous People under Heaven of their Legal Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, received those <hi>Gentiles</hi> who observed them as Proselytes into their Church, though they did not oblige themselves to Circumcision, and the rest of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Rites. Nay, in the first Age of Christianity, when the great
<pb n="V" facs="tcp:98271:7"/>
controversie arose between the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi>-Converts about the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as necessary to salvation, the observation only of these Precepts, at least a great part of them, was imposed upon the <hi>Gentile</hi>-Converts as the best expedient to end the difference, by the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. BUT though the Law of Nature was the common Law by which God then principally governed the World, yet was not he wanting by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods extraordinary to supply, as occasion was, the exigencies and necessities of his Church, communicating his mind to them by Dreams and Visions, and other ways of Revelation, which we shall more particularly remark, when we come to the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Oeconomy. Hence arose, those positive Laws which we meet with in this period of the Church, some whereof are more expresly recorded, others more obscurely intimated. Among those that are more plain and obvious two are especially considerable, the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition for not eating <hi>bloud,</hi> and the Precept of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> the one given to <hi>Noah,</hi> the other to <hi>Abraham.</hi> The prohibition concerning bloud is thus recorded, <hi>every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 9.3, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>but flesh with the life thereof, which is the bloud thereof, shall you not eat.</hi> The bloud is the <hi>vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi> to carry the spirits, as the Veins are the chanels to convey the bloud, now the <hi>animal</hi> spirits give vital heat and activity to every part, and being let out, the bloud presently cools, and the Creature dies. <hi>Not flesh with the bloud, which is the life thereof,</hi> that is, not flesh while it is alive, while the bloud and the spirits are yet in it. The mystery and signification whereof was no other than this, that God would not have Men train'd up to arts of cruelty, or whatever did but carry the colour and aspect of a merciless and a savage temper, lest severity towards Beasts should degenerate into fierceness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men.

In these acts of worship they were careful to use gestures of the greatest reverence and submission, which commonly was prostration. <hi>Abraham bowed himself towards the ground</hi>:<note place="margin">Gen. 18.2.</note> and when God sent the <hi>Israelites</hi> the happy news of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>

But to me the case seems plainly this, That as to Eucharistical Sacrifices, such as first-fruits, and the like oblations, Mens own reason might
<pb n="VIII" facs="tcp:98271:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
suggest and perswade them, that it was fit to present them as the most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural significations of a thankful mind. And thus far there might be Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the state of Innocence: for Man being created under such excellent circumstances as he was in <hi>Paradise,</hi> could not but know that he owed to God all possible gratitude and subjection; obedience he owed him as his Supreme Lord and Master, gratitude, as his great Patron and Benefactor, and was therefore obliged to pay to him some Eucharistical Sacrifices, as a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his grateful acknowledgment, that he had both his being and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation from him. But when sin had changed the scene, and Mankind was sunk under a state of guilt, he was then to seek for a way how to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God's anger: and this was done by bloudy and expiatory sacrifices, which God accepted in the sinners stead. And as to these, it seems reasonable to suppose that they should be founded upon a positive Institution, because par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin being a matter of pure grace and favour, whatever was a means to signifie and convey that, must be appointed by God himself, first reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Adam,</hi> and by him communicated to his Children. The Deity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiated by these atonements was wont to testifie his acceptance of them by some external and visible sign; <hi>Thus Cain</hi> sensibly perceived that God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>Abel</hi>'s sacrifice, and not to his: though what this sign was, it is not easie to determine.

For their Sacrifices they had <hi>Altars,</hi> whereon they offered them, contemporary no doubt with Sacrifices themselves, though we read not of them till after the Floud,<note place="margin">Gen 8.20.</note> when <hi>Noah</hi> built an Altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon it:<note place="margin">Gen. 12.7, 8. <hi>vid.</hi> chap. 13.4-18.</note> So <hi>Abraham</hi> immediately after his being called to the worship of the true God, in <hi>Sichem</hi> built an Altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him, and removing thence to a Mountain <hi>Eastward,</hi> he built another Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and called on the Name of the Lord, as indeed he did almost in every place where he came.

And indeed the Ancient devotion of the World much delighted in Groves, in

Woods and Mountains, partly for the conveniency of such Places, as better composing the thoughts for divine contemplations, and resounding their joynt-praises of God to the best advantage,<note place="margin">Judg. 6.25.</note> partly because the silence and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redness of the Place was apt to beget a kind of sacred dread and horror in the mind of the Worshipper.

                        </gap> denoting not simply an end, but a determinate and an appointed end. I know many with great zeal and eagerness contend, that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or Seventh Day from the Creation was set apart, and universally observed as the time of Publick Worship, and that from the beginning of the World. But alas the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which this opinion is built, is very weak and sandy, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to rely on,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.3.</note> but one place where it is said, that <hi>God resting on the Seventh Day from all his Works, blessed the Seventh Day and sanctified it.</hi> Which words are reasonably thought to have been set down by <hi>Moses</hi> by way of <hi>Prolepsis,</hi> as it was in his time, if they relate at all to the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and are not rather to be understood of God's blessing and sanctifying the Seventh Day, as having then completed all his Works in the creating of Man, and in whom, as in the crown and glory of the Creation, he would sanctifie himself. For that it should be meant of a Weekly <hi>Sabbath,</hi> hath as little countenance from this Text, as it hath from the practice of those times, there being no footsteps or shadow of any such <hi>Sabbath</hi> kept through all the Patriarchal periods of the Church, till the times of <hi>Moses,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the evidence of the story, is universally owned by the Ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> and very many of the Fathers do expresly assert it.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. THE last circumstance concerns the <hi>Persons</hi> by whom the Publick Worship was administred. Impossible it is that any Society should be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly managed, where there are not some peculiar Persons to superintend, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and govern the affairs of it. And God who in all other things is a God of Order, is much more so in matters of Religion: and therefore no doubt from the beginning appointed those, whose care and business it should be to discharge the publick parts of Piety and Devotion in the name of the rest. Now the Priesthood in those times was vested in the Heads of Tribes, and in the <hi>first-born</hi> of every Family. To the Patriarch or Head of every Tribe it belonged to bless the Family, to offer Sacrifice, to interceed for them by Prayer, and to minister in other solemn acts of Religion. And this Office hereditarily descended to the first-born, who had power to discharge it during the life of his Father; for it was not necessary, that he who was Priest by vertue of his primogeniture, should be also the eldest of the House. <hi>Jacob,</hi> who succeeded in his Brother's right, offered Sacrifices in the life of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Priest, though <hi>Sem</hi> the Head of the Family, and ten degrees removed from him in a direct line, was then alive, yea sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived <hi>Abraham</hi> (as some learned men think) near Forty Years. Every first-born had three great Prerogatives, a double portion of the Paternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a Lordship and Principality over his Brethren, and a right to the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to instruct them in the knowledge of Divine things, and to manage the common Offices of Religion. So that in those times there was a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Priesthood in every Family, the administration whereof was usually appropriate to the first-born. Thus <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> offered Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and <hi>Job</hi> (who lived about that time, or not long after) both for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="XI" facs="tcp:98271:10"/>
and his Friends. Thus <hi>Esau</hi> was a Priest by his primogeniture, and that <hi>goodly Raiment</hi> of her son <hi>Esau</hi> which <hi>Rebeccah</hi> put upon <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he went in to his Father, is by many not improbably understood of the Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Vestments, wherein as first-born he was wont to execute his Office. Of these Priests we are to understand that Place,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.22.</note> 
                        <hi>Let the Priests which come near to the Lord, sanctifie themselves.</hi> This could not be meant of the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Priests, (the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Order not being yet instituted) and therefore must be understood of the Priesthood of the first-born, and so <hi>Solomon Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi>'s gloss expounds it. Thus when <hi>Moses</hi> had built an Altar at the foot of the Mountain, he sent <hi>young men of the children of Israel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 24.5.</note> 
                        <hi>which offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings unto the Lord.</hi> Where for <hi>young men,</hi> the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase and the <hi>Hierusalem Targum</hi> have <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>the first-born of the children of Israel</hi>; so has that of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> who expresly adds this reason, <hi>for unto that very Hour the worship remained among the first-born, the Tabernacle of the Covenant not being yet made, nor the Aaronical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood set up.</hi> So when <hi>Jacob</hi> bequeathed his blessing to <hi>Reuben,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 49.3.</note> 
                        <hi>Reuben thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power,</hi> the same <hi>Jewish</hi> Paraphrasts tell us, that there were three things in this blessing conveyed and confirmed to <hi>Reuben,</hi> the <hi>Birth-right,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> and the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> but that for his enormous and unnatural sin they were transferred to others, the primogeniture to <hi>Joseph,</hi> the Kingdom to <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Priesthood to <hi>Levi.</hi> But though the Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal function ordinarily belonged to the first-born, yet was it not so wholly invested in them, but that it might in some cases be exercised by younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, especially when passing into other Families, and themselves becoming Heads of Tribes and Families. <hi>Abraham</hi> we know was not a first-born, and it's highly probable that <hi>Sem</hi> himself was not <hi>Noah</hi>'s eldest Son, <hi>Moses</hi> was a Priest, yea <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> as the <hi>Jews</hi> call him, <hi>the Priest of Priests,</hi> and yet was but <hi>Amram</hi>'s second Son, and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s younger Brother. So that the case in short seemed to lie thus: The Patriarch or surviving Head of every Tribe was a kind of High-Priest over all the Families that were descended from him, the first-born in every Family was the ordinary Priest, who might officiate in his Father's stead, and who after his decease succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his room, the younger Brethren, when leaving their Father's house, and themselves becoming heads of Families, and their seats removed too far distant to make use of the ordinary Priesthood, did themselves take the office upon them, and exercise it over all those that were under them, and sprung from them, though the main honour and dignity was reserved for the Priesthood of the first-born. Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> though but a second Son, yet when become the head of a great Family, and removed into another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, became a Priest, and that not only during the life of his Father, but of <hi>Sem</hi> himself, the grand surviving Patriarch of that time. I observe no more concerning this, than that this right of the first-born was a prime ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and priviledge, and therefore the reason (say the <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Jews</hi>) why <hi>Jacob</hi> was so greatly desirous of the birth-right, was because in those days the Priesthood was entail'd upon it. And for this chiefly no doubt it was that <hi>Esau</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">

HAVING thus seen what were the Laws, what the Worship of those times, it remains briefly to consider what was the face of the Church, and the state of Religion under the several Patriarchs of this Oeconomy.

no sooner was he fallen from that innocent and happy state wherein God had placed him, but Conscience began to stir, and he was sensible that God was angry, and saw it necessary to propitiate the offended Deity by Prayer and Invocation, by Sorrow and Repentance, and probably by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice;<note place="margin">Gen. 3.21.</note> a conjecture that hath at least some countenance from those <hi>Coats of Skins</hi> wherewith God clothed our first Parents, which seem likely to have been the Skins of Beasts slain for Sacrifice; for that they were not killed for food is evident, because flesh was not the ordinary diet (if it was at all) of those first Ages of the World. And God might purposely make choice of this sort of covering, to put our first Parents in mind of their great degeneracy, how deep they were sunk into the <hi>animal</hi> life, and by gratifying brutish and sensual appetites at so dear a rate, how like they were become to the Beasts that perish.

But however this was, 'tis certain that <hi>Adam</hi> was careful to instruct his Children in the knowledge of Divine things, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Religion and the worship of God in his Family.

us, that a great noise and shout coming up from the Valley, an hundred of the holy Mountaineers agreed to go down to the sons of <hi>Cain,</hi> whom <hi>Jared</hi> endeavoured to hinder by all the arts of counsel and perswasion. But what can stop a mind bent upon an evil course? down they went, and being ravished with the beauty of the <hi>Cainité</hi>-women, promiscuously committed folly and lewdness with them; from whence sprang a race of Giants, men of vast and robust bodies, but of more vicious and ungovernable tempers, who made their Will their Law, and Might the standard and rule of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Attempting to return back to the holy Mount, Heaven had shut up their way, the stones of the Mountain burning like fire when they came upon them; which whether the Reader will have faith enough to believe, I know not. <hi>Jared</hi> being near his death, advised his Children to be wise by the folly of their Brethren, and to have nothing to do with that prophane generation. His son <hi>Enoch</hi> followed in his steps, a man of admirable strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and piety, and peculiarly exemplary for his innocent and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, it being particularly noted of him, that <hi>he walked with God:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 5.24.</note> He set the Divine Majesty before him, as the guide and pattern, the spectator and rewarder of his actions, in all his ways endeavoured to approve himself to his All-seeing eye, by doing nothing but what was grateful and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him; he was the great instance of vertue and goodness in an evil Age, and by the even tenor and constancy of a holy and a religious life shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his firm belief and expectation of a future state, and his hearty depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the Divine goodness for the rewards of a better life. And God, who is never behind-hand with his servants, crowned his extraordinary obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with an uncommon reward.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.5, 6.</note> 
                        <hi>By faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him: For before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</hi> And what that faith was, is plain by what follows after, a belief of God's Being and his Bounty, <hi>Without faith it is impossible to please him: For he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</hi> What this translation was, and whither it was made, whether into that Terrestrial Paradise out of which <hi>Adam</hi> was expelled and banished, and whereunto <hi>Enoch</hi> had desired of God he might be translated, as some fancy, or whether placed among the Stars, as others, or carried into the highest Heavens, as others will have it, were nice and useless speculations. 'Tis certain he was taken out of these mutable Regions, and set beyond the reach of those miseries and misfortunes, to which a present state of sin and morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity does betray us; translated, probably, both Soul and Body, that he might be a type and <hi>specimen</hi> of a future Resurrection, and a sensible demonstration to the World that there is a reward for the righteous, and another state after this, wherein good Men shall be happy for ever. I pass by the fancy of the <hi>Jews</hi> as vain and frivolous, that though <hi>Enoch</hi> was a good Man, yet was he very mutable and inconstant, and apt to be led aside, and that this was the reason, why God translated him so soon, lest he should have been debauched by the charms and allurements of a wicked World. He was an eminent Prophet, and a fragment of his Prophecy is yet extant in S. <hi>Jude</hi>'s Epistle, by which it appears, that wickedness was then grown rampant, and the manners of men very corrupt and vicious, and that he as plainly told them of their faults, and that Divine vengeance that would certainly overtake them. Of <hi>Methuselah</hi> his Son nothing considerable is upon Record, but his great Age, living full DCCCCLXIX. Years (the longest proportion which any of the Patriarchs arrived to) and died in that very Year wherein the Floud came upon the World.</p>

It is the crown of vertue to be good, when there are all manner of temptations to the contrary, when the greatest part of Men go the other way, when vertue and honesty are laughed and drolled on, and censured as an over-wise and affected singularity; when lust and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery are accounted the modes of Gallantry, and pride and oppression suffered to ride in prosperous triumphs without controll. Thus it was with <hi>Noah,</hi> he contended with the Vices of the Age, and dared to own God and Religion, when almost all Mankind besides himself had rejected and thrown them off.

take advantage of the sins of men, <hi>not willing that any should perish, but that all should come unto Repentance.</hi> In the mean time righteous <hi>Noah</hi> found favour with Heaven (a good man hath a peculiar guardianship and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the worst of times) and God orders him to <hi>prepare an Ark for the saving of his House.</hi> An Hundred Years was this Ark in building, not but that it might have been finished in a far less time, but that God was willing to give them so long a space for wise and sober considerations, <hi>Noah</hi> preaching all the while both by his doctrine and his practice, that they would break off their sins by repentance, and prevent their ruine. But <hi>they that are filthy, will be filthy still</hi>; the hardned World persisted in their impieties, till the wrath of God came upon them to the uttermost; and <hi>destroyed the World of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi> God shut up <hi>Noah,</hi> his Wife, his three Sons and their Wives into the Ark, together with provisions, and so many Creatures of every sort as were sufficient not only for food, but for reparation of the kind (Miracles must not be expected, where ordinary means may be had) and then <hi>opened</hi> the <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> of Heaven, and <hi>broke</hi> up the <hi>Fountains</hi> of the Deep, and brought in the Floud that swept all away. Twelve months <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family continued in this floating habitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the Waters being gone, and the Earth dried, he came forth, and the first thing he did, was to erect an <hi>Altar,</hi> and offer up an Eucharistical Sacrifice to God for so remarkable a deliverance (some of the <hi>Jews</hi> tell us, that coming out of the Ark he was bitten by a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and rendred unfit for Sacrifice, and that therefore <hi>Sem</hi> did it in his room) he did not concern himself for food, or a present habitation, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betook himself to his devotion. God was infinitely pleased with the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and grateful sense of the good man, and openly declared that his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was over, and that he would no more bring upon the World such effects of his severity as he had lately done, and that the Ordinances of Nature should duly perform their constant motions, and regularly observe their peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odical revolutions. And because Man was the principal Creature in this lower World, he restored to him his Charter of Dominion and Soveraignty over the Creatures, and by enacting some Laws against Murder and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty secured the peace and happiness of his life: and then established a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with <hi>Noah</hi> and all Mankind, that he would no more drown the World, for the ratification and ensurance whereof he placed the <hi>Rain-bow</hi> in the Clouds, as a perpetual sign and memorial of his Promise. <hi>Noah</hi> after this betook himself to Husbandry, and planting Vineyards, and being unwarily overtaken with the fruit of the Vine, became a scorn to <hi>Cham</hi> one of his own Sons, while the two others piously covered their Fathers shame. Awaking out of his sleep, and knowing what had been done, he prophetically cursed <hi>Cham</hi> and his Posterity; blessed <hi>Sem,</hi> and in <hi>Japhet</hi> foretold the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the worship of God, and the knowledge of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that God should <hi>enlarge Japhet, and that he should dwell in the Tents of Shem.</hi> He died in the DCCCCL.

He was a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted to the honour of God, and had consecrated all his services to the interests of Religion, scarce any duty either towards God or men for which he is not eminent upon record. Towards God, how great was his zeal and care to promote his worship? erecting Altars almost in every place, whereon he publickly offered his prayers and sacrifice. His love to God wholly swallowed up the love and regard that he had to his dearest interests, witness his intire resignation of himself, his chearful renouncing all the concernments of his Estate and Family, and especially his readiness to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his only son, the son of his old age, and which is above all, the son of the promise, when God by way of trial required it of him.

Towards others he shewed the greatest tenderness and respect, the most meek and unpassionate temper, a mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with a desire of peace and concord: Admirable his justice and equity in all his dealings, his great hospitality and bounty towards strangers, and for that end (say the <hi>Jews</hi>) he got him an house near the entring into <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> that he might entertain strangers as they went in, or came out of the City, at his own table; as indeed he seems to have had that most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and Divine temper of mind, an universal love and charity towards all men.

But whatever he did towards others, we are sure he did it towards those that were under his own charge. He had a numerous family, and a vast retinue, and he was as careful to inform them in the knowledge of the true God, and to instruct them in all the duties of Religion.

                     <p n="19">19. HITHERTO we have surveyed the state of the Church in the constant succession of the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Line. But if we step a little further into the History of those times, we shall find that there were some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary persons without the Pale of that holy Tribe, renowned for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and the profession of Religion; among whom two are most considerable, <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> and <hi>Job. Melchisedeck</hi> was King of <hi>Salem</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Priest of the most high God.</hi> The short account which the Scripture gives of him hath left room for various fancies and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.
<pb n="XXII" facs="tcp:98271:16"/>
The opinion that has most generally obtained is, that <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was <hi>Sem,</hi> one of the sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> who was of a great Age, and lived above LXX. years after <hi>Abraham</hi>'s coming into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and might therefore well enough meet him in his triumphant return from his conquest over the Kings of the Plain. But notwithstanding the universal authority which this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion assumes to it self, it appears not to me with any tolerable probability, partly because <hi>Canaan,</hi> where <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> lived, was none of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which were allotted to <hi>Sem</hi> and to his posterity, and unlikely it is that he should be Prince in a foreign Country: partly, because those things which the Scripture reports concerning <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> do no ways agree to <hi>Sem,</hi> as that <hi>he was without Father and Mother, without genealogie,</hi> &amp;c. whenas <hi>Moses</hi> does most exactly describe and record <hi>Sem</hi> and his Family, both as to his Ancestors, and as to his posterity. That therefore which seems most probable in the case, is, that he was one of the <hi>Reguli,</hi> or petty Kings (whereof there were many) in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but a pious and devout man, and a worshipper of the true God, as there were many others in those days among the Idolatrous Nations; he being extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raised up by God from among the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and brought in without mention of Parents, original or end, without any Predecessor or Successor in his office, that he might be a fitter type of the Royal and Eternal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Christ.</hi> And for any more particular account concerning his person, it were folly and rashness over-curiously to enquire after what God seems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously to have concealed from us. The great character under which the Scripture takes notice of him, is his relation to our blessed Saviour, who is more than once said to <hi>be a Priest, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, after the order,</hi> in the same way and manner that <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was, or (as the Apostle explains himself) <hi>after the similitude of Melchisedeck.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 7.15.</note> Our Lord was such a Priest as <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was, there being a nearer similitude and conformity between them, than ever was between any other Priests whatsoever. A subject which S. <hi>Paul</hi> largely and particularly treats of. Passing by the minuter instances of the parallel, taken from the name of his person, <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> that is, <hi>King of righteousness,</hi> and his title to his Kingdom, <hi>King of Salem,</hi> that is, <hi>of Peace</hi>; we shall observe three things especially wherein he was a type of <hi>Christ.</hi> First, in the peculiar qualification of his person, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being recorded of him uncommon to the rest of men, and that is, that he was <hi>without Father,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 7.3.</note> 
                        <hi>without Mother,</hi> and <hi>without descent.</hi> Not that <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> like <hi>Adam</hi> was immediately created, or in an instant dropt down from Heaven, but that he hath no kindred recorded in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which brings him in without any mention of Father or Mother, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Homil.</hi> 12. <hi>in Hebr. p.</hi> 1838.</note> as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> glosses, we know not what Father or Mother he had: He was (says S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>without genealogie,</hi> without having any <hi>pedigree</hi> extant upon record, whence the ancient <hi>Syriack</hi> Version truly expresses the sence of the whole passage thus, <hi>Whose neither Father nor Mother are written, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> among the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> that is, the genealogies of the ancient Patriarchs. And thus he eminently typified <hi>Christ,</hi> of whom this is really true: He is without Father in respect of his humane nature, begotten only of a pure Virgin; without Mother, in respect of his Divinity, being begotten of his Father before all Worlds, by an eternal and ineffable generation. Secondly, <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> typified our Saviour in the duration and continuance of his office; for so 'tis said of him, that he was <hi>without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God, abideth a Priest continually.</hi>
                        <pb n="XXIII" facs="tcp:98271:16"/>
By which we are not to understand that <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> never died, for being a man he was subject to the same common Law of mortality with other men: But the meaning is, that as he is said to be <hi>without Father and Mother,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Scripture speaking of him makes no mention of his Parents, his Genealogy and descent: So he is said to <hi>abide a Priest for ever, without any beginning of days, or end of life,</hi> because we have no account of any that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preceeded, or succeeded him in his office, no mention of the time ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he took it up, or laid it down. And herein how lively and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a type of <hi>Christ,</hi> the true <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> who as to his Divine nature was without beginning of days from Eternal Ages, and who either in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or vertue of his office abides for ever. There is no abolition, no tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of his office, no expectation of any to arise that shall succeed him in it: <hi>He was made a Priest not after the Law of a carnal Commandment,</hi> a transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and mutable dispensation, <hi>but after the power of an endless life.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was a type of <hi>Christ</hi> in his excellency above all other Priests. S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s great design is to evince the preheminence and precedency of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck</hi> above all the Priests of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> ministration, yea, above <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, the Founder and Father of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, from whom they reckoned it so great an honour to derive themselves. And this the Apostle proves by a double instance. First, that <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whose loins the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priests then were, paid <hi>tithes</hi> to <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> when he <hi>gave him the tenth of all his spoils,</hi> as due to God and his Ministers, thereby confessing himself and his posterity inferiour to him.<note place="margin">Heb. 7.4, 5, 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the Patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</hi> Secondly, that <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> conferred upon <hi>Abraham</hi> a solemn benediction, it being a standing part of the Priests office to bless the people. And this was an undeniable argument of his superiority.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ibid.</hi> Ver. 6, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>He whose descent is not counted from them</hi> (the legal Priests) <hi>received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises: And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</hi> Whereby it evidently appears, that <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was greater than <hi>Abraham,</hi> and consequently than all the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priests that descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from him. Now herein he admirably prefigured and shadowed out our blessed Saviour, a person peculiarly chosen out by God, sent into the World upon a nobler and a more important errand, owned by more solemn and mighty attestations from Heaven, than ever was any other person; his office incomparably beyond that of the legal Oeconomy, his person greater, his undertaking weightier, his design more sublime and excellent, his oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more valuable and meritorious, his prayers more prevalent and success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, his office more durable and lasting, than ever any whose business it was to intercede and mediate between God and man.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. THE other extraordinary person under this <hi>Oeconomy</hi> is <hi>Job,</hi> concerning whom two things are to be enquired into, Who he was, and when he lived. For the first, we find him described by his Name, his Country, his Kindred, his Quality, his Religion, and his Sufferings, though in many of them we are left under great uncertainties, and to the satisfaction only of probable conjectures. For his name, among many conjectures two are especially considerable, though founded upon very different reasons, one that it is from <gap reason="foreign">

He <hi>was the son of Barachel, of the kindred of Ram,</hi> who was the head of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and his habitation was in the parts of <hi>Arabia</hi> the <hi>Desart</hi> near <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> or at least in the Southern part of <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> bordering upon it. As for <hi>Job</hi> himself, he is made by some a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> of the posterity of <hi>Cham</hi>; by others to descend from <hi>Sem</hi> by his son <hi>Amram,</hi> whose eldest sons name was <hi>Uz</hi>; by most from <hi>Esau,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Idumaean</hi> Nations; but most probably either from <hi>Nahor, Abraham</hi>'s brother, whose sons were <hi>Huz, Buz, Chesed,</hi> &amp;c. or from <hi>Abraham</hi> himself by some of the sons which he had by his wife <hi>Keturah,</hi> whereby an account is most probably given, how <hi>Job</hi> came to be imbued with those seeds of Piety and true Religion, for which he was so eminently remarkable, as deriving them from those Religious principles and instructions which <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Nahor</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to their posterity. His quality and the circumstances of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal state were very considerable, a man rich and honourable; <hi>His sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance was seven thousand Sheep, and three thousand Camels, and five hundred yoke of Oxen, and five hundred she-Asses, and a very great houshold,</hi> so that he was <hi>the greatest of all the men of the East</hi>; himself largely describes the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and prosperity of his fortunes, that <hi>he washed his steps in Butter, and the rock poured out rivers of Oil; when he went out to the gate through the City, and prepared his seat in the street, the young men saw him, and hid themselves, the aged arose and stood up, the Princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless and him that had none to help him, the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckt the spoil out of their teeth,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed so great his state and dignity, that it has led ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into a perswasion, that he was King of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> a powerful and mighty Prince; a fancy that has received no small encouragement from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon but groundless confounding of <hi>Job</hi> with <hi>Jobah</hi> King of <hi>Edom,</hi> of the

Nay, that he might not want fit Companions in his Regal capacity, three of his friends are made Kings as well as he, the LXX.

Ruined in his health, being smitten with <hi>sore boils</hi> from the crown of the Head to the sole of the Foot, till his Body became a very Hospital of Diseases: tormented in his mind with sad and uncomfortable reflections, <hi>The arrows of the Almighty being shot within him, the poison whereof drank up his spirit, the terrors of God setting themselves in array against him.</hi> All which were aggravated and set home by <hi>Satan,</hi> the grand Engineer of all those torments, and all this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing for at least Twelve Months (say the <hi>Jews</hi>) probably for a much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time; and yet endured with great courage and fortitude of mind, till God put a period to this tedious Trial, and crowned his sufferings with an ample restitution.

the King. Follies that need no confutation. 'Tis certain that he was elder than <hi>Moses,</hi> his Kindred and Family, his way of sacrificing, the Idolatry rise in his time, evidently placing him before that Age; besides that there are not the least foot-steps in all his Book of any of the great things done for the <hi>Israelites</hi> deliverance, which we can hardly suppose should have been omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, being examples so fresh in memory, and so apposite to the design of that Book. Most probable therefore it is, that he lived about the time of the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Captivity in <hi>Egypt,</hi> though whether, as some <hi>Jews</hi> will have it, born that very Year that <hi>Jacob</hi> came down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and dying that Year that they went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> I dare not peremptorily affirm. And this no question is the reason why we find nothing concerning him in the Writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> the History of those Times being crowded up into a very little room, little being recorded even of the <hi>Israelites</hi> themselves for near Two Hundred Years, more than in general that they were heavily oppressed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Yoke.

They were not educated under any foreign Institutions, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by a Body of numerous Laws and written Constitutions,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>, they maintained a free and uninterrupted course of Religion, conducting their lives according to the rules of Nature, so that having purged their minds from lust and passion, and attained to the true knowledge of God, they had no need of external and written Laws. Their Creed was short and perspicuous, their notions of God great and venerable, their devotion and piety real and substantial, their worship grave and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and such as became the grandeur and majesty of the Divine being, their Rites and Ceremonies few and proper, their obedience prompt and sincere, and indeed the whole conduct of their conversation discovering it self in the most essential and important duties of the humane life. According to this standard it was that our blessed Saviour mainly designed to reform Religion in his most excellent Institutions, to retrieve the piety and purity, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and simplicity of those first and more uncorrupted Ages of the World, to improve the Laws of Nature, and to reduce Mankind from ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al observances to natural and moral duties, as the most vital and essential parts of Religion, and was therefore pleased to charge Christianity with no more than two positive Institutions, <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> that Men might learn,<note place="margin">

THE Church, which had hitherto lyen dispersed in private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and had often been reduced to an inconsiderable number, being now multiplied into a great and a populous Nation, God was pleased to enter into Covenant, not any longer with particular Persons, but with the Body of the People, and to govern the Church by more certain and regular ways and methods, than it had hitherto been. This Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation began with the delivery of the Law, and continued till the final peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of the <hi>Jewish</hi> state, consisting only <hi>of meats and drinks, and divers wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and carnal Ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</hi> In

the survey whereof we shall chiefly consider what Laws were given for the Government of the Church, by what Methods of revelation God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his mind and will to them, and what was the state of the Church, especially towards the conclusion of this Oeconomy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. THE great Minister of this Dispensation was <hi>Moses</hi> the Son of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> of the House of <hi>Levi,</hi> a Person, whose signal preservation when but an Infant presaged him to be born for great and generous undertakings. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> desirous to suppress the growing numbers of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation had afflicted and kept them under with all the rigorous severities of tyranny and oppression. But this not taking its effect, he made a Law that all <hi>Hebrew</hi> Male-children should be drowned as soon as born, knowing well enough how to kill the root, if he could keep any more Branches from spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up. But the wisdom of Heaven defeated his crafty and barbarous designs. Among others that were born at that time was <hi>Moses</hi> a <hi>goodly</hi> Child, and whom his Mother was infinitely desirous to preserve: but having conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, till the saving of his might endanger the losing her own life, her affection suggested to her this little stratagem: she prepared an <hi>Ark</hi> made of Paper-reeds, and pitched within, and so putting him a-board this little Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, threw him into the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> committing him to the mercy of the waves, and the conduct of the Divine Providence.

She commanded the Ark to be brought a-shore, which was no sooner opened, but the mournful oratory of the weeping Infant sensibly struck her with compassionate resentments: And the <hi>Jews</hi> add,<note place="margin">

His Sister <hi>Miriam,</hi> who had all this while beheld the scene afar off, officiously proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her service to the Princess to call an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nurse, and accordingly went and brought his Mother. To her care he was committed with a charge to look tenderly to him, and the promise of a reward. But the hopes of that could add but little, where nature was so much concerned. Home goes the Mother joyful and proud of her own pledge, and the royal charge, carefully providing for his tender years. His infant-state being pass'd, he was restored to the Princess, who adopted him for her own son, bred him up at Court, where he was polished with all the arts of a noble and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous education, instructed in the modes of civility and behaviour, in the methods of policy and government, <hi>Learned in all the wisdom of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whose renown for wisdom is not only once and again taken notice of in holy Writ, but their admirable skill in all liberal Sciences, Natural, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Divine, beyond the rate and proportion of other Nations, is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently celebrated by foreign Writers. To these accomplishments God was pleased to add a Divine temper of mind, a great zeal for God, not able to endure any thing that seemed to clash with the interests of the Divine honour and glory; a mighty courage and resolution in God's service, whose edge was not to be taken off either by threats or charms; <hi>He was not afraid of the Kings commandment,</hi>

of the Crown, the treasures and pleasures of that rich, soft and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Country, out of a firm belief of the invisible rewards of another World; <hi>He refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</hi>

                        <hi>for he had respect unto the recompence of reward. Josephus</hi> relates, that when but a child he was presented by the Princes to her Father, as one whom she had adopted for her son, and designed for his successor in the Kingdom, the King taking him up into his arms, put his Crown upon his head, which the child immediately pull'd off again, and throwing it upon the ground, trampled it under his feet.

                        </gap>, as portending a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Omen</hi> to the Kingdom, did however evidently presage his generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the grandeur and honours of the Court, and those plausible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Soveraignty that were offered to him. His patience was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable, not tired out with the abuses and disappointments of the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with the hardships and troubles of the Wilderness, and which was beyond all, with the cross and vexatious humours of a stubborn and unquiet generation. He was of a most calm and treatable disposition, his spirit not easily ruffled with passion; he who in the cause of God and Religion could be bold and fierce as a Lion, was in his own patient as a Lamb, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self having given this character of him, <hi>That he was the meekest man upon the Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. THIS great personage thus excellently qualified, God made choice of him to be the Commander and conducter of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, and his Embassador to the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to demand the enfranchisement of his people, and free liberty to go serve and worship the God of their Fathers. And that he might not seem a mere pretender to Divine revelation, but that he really had an immediate commission from Heaven, God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to furnish him with extraordinary Credentials, and to seal his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission with a power of working Miracles beyond all the Arts of <hi>Magick,</hi> and those tricks for which the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sorcerers were so famous in the World. But <hi>Pharaoh</hi> unwilling to part with such useful Vassals, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving oppressed them beyond possibility of reconcilement, would not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the proposal, but sometimes downright rejected it, otherwhiles sought by subtil and plausible pretences to evade and shift it off; till by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny astonishing Miracles, and severe Judgments God extorted at length a grant from him. Under the conduct of <hi>Moses</hi> they set forwards after at least two hundred years servitude under the <hi>Egyptian</hi> yoke; and though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sensible of his error, with a great Army pursued them, either to cut them off, or bring them back, God made way for them through the midst of the Sea, the waters becoming like a wall of Brass on each side of them, till being all passed to the other shore, those invisible cords which had hitherto tied up that liquid Element, bursting in sunder, the waters returned and overwhelmed their enemies that pursued them. Thus God by the same stroke can protect his friends, and punish his enemies. Nor did the Divine Providence here take its leave of them, but became their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant guard and defence in all their journeys, waiting upon them through their several stations in the wilderness; the most memorable whereof was that at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia:</hi> The place where God delivered them <hi>the pattern in the Mount,</hi> according to which the form both of their Church and State was to be framed and modelled. In order hereunto <hi>Moses</hi> is called up into the Mount, where by Fasting and Prayer he conversed with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

These were nothing else but a summary Comprehension of the great Laws of Nature, engraven at first upon the minds of all men in the World; the most material part whereof was now consigned to writing, and incorporated into the body of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law. I know the Decalogue is generally taken to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete <hi>System</hi> of all natural Laws: But whoever impartially considers the matter, will find that there are many instances of duty so far from being commanded in it, that they are not reducible to any part of it, unless hook'd in by subtilties of wit, and drawn thither by forc'd and unnatural inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. What provision except in one case or two do any of those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments make against neglects of duty? Where do they oblige us to do good to others, to love, assist, relieve our enemies? Gratitude and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to benefactors is one of the prime and essential Laws of Nature, and yet no where that I know of (unless we will have it implied in the Preface to the Law) commanded or intimated in the Decalogue: With many other cases, which 'tis naturally evident are our duty, whereof no footsteps are to be seen in this <hi>Compendium,</hi> unless hunted out by nice and sagacious reasonings, and made out by a long train of consequences, never originally intended in the Commandment, and which not one in a thousand are capable of deducing from it. It is probable therefore that God reduc'd only so many of the Laws of Nature into writing, as were proper to the present state and capacities of that people to whom they were given, super-adding
<pb n="XXXIII" facs="tcp:98271:21"/>
some, and explaining others by the Preaching and Ministery of the Prophets, who in their several Ages endeavoured to bring men out of the Shades and Thickets, into clear light and Noon-day, by clearing up mens obligations to those natural and essential duties, in the practice whereof hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature was to be advanced unto its just accomplishment and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hence it was that our Lord, who <hi>came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil</hi> and perfect <hi>it,</hi> has explained the obligations of the natural Law more fully and clearly, more plainly and intelligibly, rendred our duty more fixed and certain, and extended many instances of obedience to higher mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, to a greater exactness and perfection, than ever they were understood to have before. Thus he commands a free and universal charity, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we love our friends and relations, but that <hi>we love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully use and persecute us:</hi> He hath forbidden malice and revenge with more plainness and smartness; obliged us not only to live according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of sobriety, but extended it to <hi>self-denial,</hi> and <hi>taking up the Cross,</hi> and laying down our lives, whenever the honour of God, and the interest of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion calls for it; he not only commands us to do no wrong, but when we have done it, to make restitution; not only to retrench our irregular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, but <hi>to cut off our right hand, and pluck out our right eye, and cast them from us,</hi> that is, mortifie and offer violence to those vicious inclinations, which are as dear to us, as the most useful and necessary parts and members of our body. Besides all this, had God intended the <hi>Decalogue</hi> for a perfect summary of the Laws of Nature, we cannot suppose that he would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any but such into the collection, whereas the Fourth Commandment concerning the <hi>Seventh day</hi> is unquestionably Typical and Ceremonial, and has nothing more of a Natural and Eternal obligation in it, than that God should be served and honoured both with publick and private worship, which cannot be done without some portions of time set apart for it: but that this should be done just at such a time, and by such proportions, upon the Seventh rather than the Sixth or the Eighth day, is no part of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion. And indeed the reasons and arguments that are annexed to it, to enforce the observance of it, clearly shew that it is of a later date, and of another nature than the rest of those Precepts in whose company we find it, though it seems at first sight to pass without any peculiar note of discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from the rest. As for the rest they are Laws of Eternal righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and did not derive their value and authority from the Divine sanction which God here gave them at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but from their own moral and internal goodness and equity, being founded in the nature of things, and the essential and unchangeable differences of good and evil. By which means they always were, always will be obligatory and indispensable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Eternal and Immutable as the nature of God himself.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. THE second sort of Laws were <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> Divine Constitutions concerning Ritual observances, and matters of Ecclesiastical cognizance and relation, and were instituted for a double end, partly for the more orderly government of the Church, and the more decent administration of the worship of God; partly that they might be types and figures of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical state, <hi>shadows of good things to come,</hi> visible and symbolical represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and those great blessings and priviledges which he was to introduce into the World; which doubtless was the reason why God was so infinitely punctual and particular in his directions about these matters, giving orders about the minutest circumstances of the Temple-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, because every part of it had a glance at a future and better state

of things. The number of them was great, and the observation burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, the whole Nation groaning under the servility of that yoke. They were such as principally related to God's worship, and may be reduced either to such as concerned the worship it self, or the circumstances of time, place and persons that did attend it. Their worship consisted chiefly in three things, Prayers, Sacrifices and Sacraments. <hi>Prayers</hi> were daily put up together with their Offerings, and though we have very few Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning them, yet the constant practice of that Church, and the particular forms of Prayer yet extant in their writings, are a sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were the constant and most solemn part of their publick worship;<note place="margin">Exod. 29.</note> yea, they had their <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>their continual burnt-offering,</hi> a Lamb offered Morning and Evening with a Measure of Flower, Oil and Wine, the charge whereof was defrayed out of the Treasury of the Temple. The rest of their Sacrifices may be considered either as they were <hi>Expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or <hi>Eucharistical.</hi> Expiatory were those that were offered as an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the sins of the people, to pacifie the Divine displeasure, and to procure his pardon, which they did by vertue of their Typical relation to that great Sacrifice which the Son of God was in the fulness of time to offer up for the sins of the World. They were either of a more general relation, for the expiation of sin in general, whole burnt-offerings, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely (the skin and the entrails only excepted) burnt to ashes; or of a more private and particular concernment, designed for the redemption of particular offences, whereof there were two sorts: <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>the meat-offering,</hi> made up of things without life, oil, fine flower, incense, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the worshipper offered as a thankful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for the daily preservation and provisions of life, and therefore it consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only of the fruits of the ground. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> or <hi>the peace-offering</hi>; this was done either out of a grateful sense of some blessing conferred, or as a voluntary offering to which the Person had obliged himself by vow in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of some safety or deliverance which he had prayed for. In this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice God had his part, the fat which was the only part of it burnt by fire, the Priest his, as the instrument of the ministration, the Offerer his, that he might have wherewith to <hi>rejoyce before the Lord.</hi> 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>a thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-offering,</hi> or a Sacrifice of praise, it was a mixt kind of Sacrifice, consisting of living Creatures, and the fruits of the Earth, which they might offer at their own will, but it must be eaten the same day, and none of it left until the morrow. What other provisions we meet with concerning ceremonial uncleannesses, first-fruits, the first-born, tenths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are conveniently redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to some of these heads which we have already mentioned. The last part of their worship concerned their <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which were two, <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi> and the <hi>Paschal Supper.</hi> Circumcision was the federal Rite annexed by God as a Seal to the Covenant which he made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Posterity, and accordingly renewed and taken into the Body of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> constitutions. It was to be administred the eighth day, which the <hi>Jews</hi> understand not of so many days complete, but the current time, six full days, and part of the other.

Church. The <hi>Passover,</hi> which was the eating of the <hi>Paschal</hi> Lamb, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted as an Annual memorial of their signal and miraculous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and as a typical representation of our spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by <hi>Christ</hi> from the bondage of sin and that Hell that follows it. It was to be celebrated with a Male-lamb without <hi>blemish</hi> taken out of the <hi>Flock,</hi> to note <hi>the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the World,</hi> who was <hi>taken</hi> from <hi>among men, a Lamb without blemish and without spot, holy, harmless, and separate from sinners.</hi> The Door-posts of the House were to be <hi>sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> with the <hi>bloud</hi> of the Lamb, to signifie our security from the Divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance by the <hi>bloud of sprinkling.</hi> The Lamb was to be <hi>roasted</hi> and eaten whole, typifying the great sufferings of our blessed Saviour, who was to pass through the <hi>fire</hi> of Divine wrath, and to be <hi>wholly</hi> embrac'd and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by us in all his Offices, as King, Priest, and Prophet. None but those that were <hi>clean</hi> and circumcised might eat of it, to shew that only true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, holy and good men can be partakers of <hi>Christ</hi> and the merits of his Death; It was to be eaten standing, with their <hi>Loins girt,</hi> and their staff in their hand, to put them in mind what haste they made out of the house of bondage, and to intimate to us what present diligence we should use to get from under the empire and tyranny of sin and <hi>Satan,</hi> under the conduct and assistance of <hi>the Captain of our Salvation.</hi> The eating of it was to be mixed with <hi>bitter herbs,</hi> partly as a memorial of that bitter servitude which they underwent in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> partly as a type of that repentance and bearing of the cross (duties difficult and unpleasant) which all true Christians must undergo. Lastly, it was to be eaten with <hi>unleavened</hi> Bread, all manner of leaven being at that time to be banished out of their Houses with the most critical diligence and curiosity, to represent what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite care we should take to cleanse and purifie our hearts,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7, 8.</note>

THE Places of their Publick Worship were either the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> made in the Wilderness, or the <hi>Temple</hi> built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> between which in the main there was no other difference, than that the Tabernacle was an ambulatory Temple, as the Temple was a standing Tabernacle, together with all the rich costly Furniture that was in them. The parts of it were three, the <hi>Holiest of all,</hi> whither none entred but the High-Priest, and that but once a Year, this was a type of Heaven; the <hi>holy place,</hi> whither the Priests entred every Day to perform their Sacred Ministrations; and the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court,</hi> whither the People came to offer up their Prayers and Sacrifices.

looking towards each other, and both to the Mercy-seat denoted the two Testaments, or Dispensations of the Church, which admirably agree, and both direct to Christ the Mediator of the Covenant. The <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> or Mercy-seat was the Golden covering to the Ark, where God veiling his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was wont to manifest his Presence, to give Answers, and shew Himself reconciled to the People, herein eminently prefiguring our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who interposes between us, and the Divine Majesty, <hi>whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation, through faith in his bloud for the remission of sins</hi>; so that now <hi>we may come boldly to the Throne of Grace, and find mercy to help us.</hi> Within the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> or the Holy Place was the <hi>Golden Candlestick</hi> with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-Branches, representing Christ, who is <hi>the Light of the World,</hi> and who <hi>enlightens every one that comes into the World,</hi>

Here was the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Laver,</hi> with its Basis, made of the brazen Looking-glasses of the Women that assembled at the Door of the Tabernacle, wherein the Priests washed their Hands and their Feet, when going into the Sanctuary, and both they and the People, when about to offer Sacrifice; to teach us to purifie our hearts and to <hi>cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,</hi> especially when we approach to offer up our services to Heaven; hereunto <hi>David</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, <hi>I will wash mine hands in innocency,</hi>

                     <p n="7">7. THE stated <hi>times</hi> and seasons of their worship are next to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they were either Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly. Their <hi>Daily</hi> worship was at the time of the Morning, and the Evening Sacrifice; their <hi>Weekly</hi> solemnity was the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which was to be kept with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable care and strictness, they being commanded to rest in it from all servile labours, and to attend the Duties and Offices of Religion, a type of that <hi>rest that remains for the People of God.</hi> Their <hi>monthly</hi> Festivals were the <hi>New-moons,</hi> wherein they were to blow the Trumpets over their Sacrifices and Oblations, and to observe them with great expressions of joy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, in a thankful resentment of the blessings which all that Month had been conferred upon them. Their <hi>Annual</hi> Solemnities were either ordinary or extraordinary; <hi>Ordinary</hi> were those that returned every Year, whereof the first was the <hi>Passover,</hi> to be celebrated upon the Fourteenth day of the first Month, as a Memorial of their great deliverance out of <hi>Egypt:</hi>
                        <pb n="XXXVII" facs="tcp:98271:23"/>
The second, <hi>Pentecost,</hi> called also the <hi>Feast of Weeks,</hi> because just seven Weeks, or fifty days after the <hi>Passover:</hi> Instituted it was partly in memory of the promulgation of the Law, published at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> fifty days after their celebration of the Passover in <hi>Egypt,</hi> partly as a thanksgiving for the in-gathering of their Harvest, which usually was fully brought in about this time. The third was the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> kept upon the Fifteenth day of the Seventh Month for the space of Seven days together; at which time they dwelt in Booths made of green Boughs, as a <hi>memento</hi> of that time when they sojourn'd in Tents and Tabernacles in the Wilderness, and a sensible demonstration of the transitory duration of the present life, that <hi>the Earthly house of our Tabernacle must be dissolved,</hi> and that therefore <hi>we should secure a building of God, an house not made with hands, Eternal in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> These were the three great solemnities, wherein all the Males were obliged to appear at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to present themselves and their offerings in testimony of their homage and devotion unto God: Besides which they had some of lesser moment, such as their <hi>Feast of Trumpets,</hi> and that of <hi>Expiation.</hi> The <hi>Annual</hi> Festivals <hi>extraordinary</hi> were those that recurr'd but once in the periodical return of several years; such was the <hi>Sabbatical year,</hi> wherein the Land was to lye fallow, and to rest from ploughing and sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all manner of cultivation; and this was to be every seventh year, typifying the Eternal <hi>Sabbatism</hi> in Heaven, where good men shall <hi>rest from their labours, and their works shall follow them.</hi> But the great <hi>Sabbatical</hi> year of all was that of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> which returned at the end of seven ordinary <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batick</hi> years, that is, every fiftieth year, the approach whereof was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the sound of Trumpets; in it servants were released, all debts discharged, and mortgaged Estates reverted to their proper heirs. And how evidently did this shadow out the state of the Gospel, and our Lord's being sent <hi>to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted,<note place="margin">Isa. 61.1, 2. Luke 4.18.</note> to preach liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, that they might lift up their heads, because their redemption drew nigh?</hi>

LASTLY, They had Laws concerning the <hi>persons</hi> by whom their publick worship was administred; and here there was appointed an High-Priest, who had his proper offices and rules of duty, his peculiar attire and consecration; ordinary Priests, whose business was to instruct the people, to Pray and offer sacrifice, to bless the Congregation, and judge in cases of <hi>Leprosie,</hi> and such like; at their Ordination, they were to be chosen before all the people, to be sprinkled with the water of Expiation, their Hair sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and their Bodies washed, afterwards anointed, and sacrifices to be offered for them, and then they might enter upon their Priestly ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Next to these were the <hi>Levites,</hi> who were to assist the Priests in preparing the Sacrifices, to bear the Tabernacle (while it lasted) and lay up its Vessels and Utensils, to purifie and cleanse the Vessels and Instruments, to guard the Courts and Chambers of the Temple, to watch weekly in the Temple by their turns, to sing and celebrate the praises of God with Hymns and Musical Instruments, and to joyn with the Priests in judging and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Ceremonial causes; they were not to be taken into the full discharge of their Function till the thirtieth, nor to be kept at it beyond the fiftieth year of their age; God mercifully thinking it fit to give them then a Writ of Ease, whose strength might be presumed sufficiently impaired by truck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for so many years under such toilsom and laborious ministrations. Though the Levitical Priests were types of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet it was the High-Priest, who did eminently typifie him, and that in the unity and singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="XXXVIII" facs="tcp:98271:24"/>
of his office; for though many Orders and Courses of inferior Priests and Ministers, yet was there but one High-Priest, <hi>There is one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, the man Christ Jesus</hi>; in the qualifications necessary to his election, as to place, he was to be taken out of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi>; as to his person, which was to be every ways perfect and comely, and the manner of his Consecration; in his singular capacity, that he alone might enter into the <hi>holy of holies,</hi> which he did once every year upon the great day of Expiation, with a mighty pomp and train of Ceremonies, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sacrifices, burning Incense, sprinkling the bloud of the Sacrifice before and upon the Mercy-seat, going within the veil, and making an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within the holy place. All which immediately referred to <hi>Christ,</hi> who <hi>by the sacrifice of himself,</hi> and <hi>through the veil of his own flesh entred,</hi> not into the holy place made with hands, but <hi>into Heaven it self, now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the presence of God for us.</hi> All which might be represented more at large, but that I intend not a discourse about these matters.</p>

BESIDES the Laws which we have hitherto enumerated, there were several other particular Commands, Ritual Constitutions about Meats and Drinks, and other parts of humane life. Such was the difference they were to make between the Creatures, some to be clean, and others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; such were several sorts of pollution and uncleanness, which were not in their own nature sins, but Ceremonial defilements; of this kind were several provisions about Apparel, Diet, and the ordering Family-affairs, all evidently of a Ceremonial aspect, but too long to be insisted on in this place.

Masters and Servants; such as concerned the Publick and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, relating to Magistrates, and Courts of Justice, to Contracts and matters of right and wrong, to Estates and Inheritances, to Executions and Punishments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> such as belong'd to strangers, and matters of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nature, as Laws concerning Peace and War, Commerce and Dealing with persons of another Nation; or lastly, such as secured the honour and the interests of Religion, Laws against Apostates and Idolaters, Wizards, Conjurers and false Prophets, against Blasphemy, Sacriledge, and such like; all which not being so proper to my purpose, I omit a more particular enumeration of them. These Laws were peculiarly calculated for the <hi>Jewish</hi> State, and that while kept up in that Country wherein God had placed them, and therefore must needs determine and expire with it. Nor can they be made a pattern and standard for the Laws of other Nations; for, though proceeding from the wisest Law-giver, they cannot reasonably be imposed upon any State or Kingdom, unless where there is an equal concurrence of circumstances, as there were in that people, for whom God enacted them. They went off the Stage with the <hi>Jewish</hi> Polity, and if any parts of them do still remain obligatory, they bind not as <hi>Judicial</hi> Laws, but as branches of the Law of Nature, the reason of them being Immutable and Eternal. I know not whether it may here be useful to remark what the <hi>Jews</hi> so frequently tell us of, that the intire body of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law consists of DCXIII.

The <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was a way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation peculiar to the High Priest:<note place="margin">Exod. 28.30.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou shalt put on the breast-plate of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Urim and the Thummim, and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the Lord, and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually.</hi> Thus <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Priest is commanded to <hi>ask counsel after the Judgment of Urim before the Lord.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Numb. 27.21.</note> What this <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was, and what the manner of receiving an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers by it, is difficult, if not impossible to tell, there being scarce any one difficulty that I know of in the Bible that hath more exercised the thoughts either of <hi>Jewish</hi> or <hi>Christian</hi> Writers. Whether it was some addition to the High-Priests breast-plate made by the hand of some curious Artist, or whether only those two words engraven upon it, or the great name <hi>Jehovah</hi> carved and put within the foldings of the breast-plate, or whether the twelve stones resplendent with light, and completed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with the Tribes names therein, or whether some other mysterious piece of artifice immediately framed by the hand of Heaven, and given to <hi>Moses,</hi> when he delivered him the two Tables of the Law, is vain and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to enquire, because impossible to determine. Nor is the manner of its giving answers less uncertain: Whether at such times the fresh and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lustre of the stones signified the answer in the Affirmative, while their dull and dead colour spake the Negative; or whether it was by some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary protuberancy and thrusting forth of the letters engraven upon the stones, from the conjunction whereof the Divine Oracle was gathered; or whether probably it might be, that when the High-Priest enquired of God, with this breast-plate upon him, God did either by a lively voice, or by immediate suggestions to his mind, give him a distinct and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous answer, illuminating his mind with the <hi>Urim,</hi> or the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his will in those cases, and satisfying his doubts and scruples with the <hi>Thummim</hi> of a perfect and complete determination of those difficulties that were propounded to him, thereby enabling him to give a satisfactory and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible answer in all the particulars that lay before him. And this several of the <hi>Jews</hi> seem to intend, when they make this way of revelation one of the degrees of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and say that no sooner did the High-Priest put on the <hi>Pectoral,</hi> and had the case propounded to him, but that he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

And as God permitted the <hi>Jews</hi> the use of Sacrifices, which had been notoriously abused to Superstition and Idolatry in the Heathen World, so he might indulge them these <hi>Teraphim</hi> (though now converted to a sacred use) that so he might by degrees wean them from the Rites of the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, to which they had so fond an inclination. And this probably was the reason, why when <hi>Moses</hi> is so particular in describing the other parts of the Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Ornaments, nothing at all is said of this, because a thing of common use among the Nations, with whom they had conversed, and notoriously known among themselves.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the <hi>daughter</hi> or Eccho of a <hi>Voice,</hi> which they confess to have been the lowest kind of revelation, and to have been in use only in the times of the second Temple, when all other ways of Prophecy were cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. But notwithstanding their common and confident assertions whether ever there was any such standing way of revelation as this, is justly questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable (nay,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dr. Lightf. H.

A voice from Heaven is the most immediate testimony, and therefore fittest to do honour to him who came down from Heaven, and was sure to meet with an obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and incredulous Generation, and to give evidence to that Doctrine
<pb n="XLII" facs="tcp:98271:26"/>
that he published to the World. Thus by a <hi>Bath-Col</hi> or a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven God bare witness to our Saviour at his Baptism, and a second time at his Transfiguration, and again at the Passover at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when there came a Voice from Heaven, which the People took for Thunder, or the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of an Angel, and most of S. <hi>John</hi>'s intelligences from above record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Book of <hi>Revelation</hi> are ushered in with an, <hi>I heard a Voice from Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. BUT the most frequent and standing method of Divine communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations was that whereby God was wont to transact with the Prophets, and in extraordinary cases with other Men, which was either by Dreams, Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or immediate Inspirations. The way by <hi>Dreams</hi> was when the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son being overtaken with a deep sleep, and all the exteriour senses locked up, God presented the <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of things to their understandings, and that in such a manner, that they might be able to apprehend the will of God, which they presently did upon their awaking out of sleep. These Divine Dreams the <hi>Jews</hi> distinguish into two sorts, <hi>Monitory,</hi> such as were sent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by way of instruction and admonition, to give Men notice of what they were to do, or warning of what they should avoid, such were the Dreams of <hi>Pharaoh, Abimelech, Laban, &amp;c.</hi> or else they were Prophetical, when God by such a powerful energy acted upon the mind and imagination of the Prophet, as carried the strength and force of a Divine evidence along with it. This was sometimes done by a clear and distinct impression of the thing upon the mind without any dark or enigmatical representation of it, such as God made to <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he first revealed himself to him in the Temple: sometimes by apparition, yet so as the Man though a-sleep was able to discern an Angel conversing with him. By <hi>Visions,</hi> God usually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated himself two ways, First, when something really appeared to the sight; thus <hi>Moses</hi> beheld the Bush burning, and stood there while God conversed with him; <hi>Manoah</hi> and his Wife saw the Angel, while he took his leave, and in a flaming <hi>Pyramid</hi> went up to Heaven; the three Angels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Abraham</hi> a little before the fatal ruine of <hi>Sodom</hi>; all which appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were unquestionably true and real, the Angel assuming an humane shape, that he might the freelier converse with, and deliver his message to those to whom he was sent. Secondly, by powerful impressions upon the imagination, usually done while the Prophet was awake, and had the free and uninterrupted exercise of his reason, though the Vision oft over-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cast him into a trance, that the Soul being more retired from sensible objects might the closer intend those Divine notices that were represented to it. Thus all the Prophets had the <hi>Idea</hi>'s of those things that they were to deliver to the People, the more strongly impressed upon their fancies, and this commonly when they were in the greatest solitude and privacy, and their powers most called in, that the Prophetical <hi>influx</hi> might have the greater force upon them. In some such way S. <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up into the third Heaven, probably not so much by any real separation of his Soul from his Body, or local translation of his Spirit thither, as by a profound abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it from his corporeal Senses, God, during the time of the trance, entertaining it with an internal and admirable scene of the glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that state, as truly and effectually, as if his Soul had been really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed thither.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. THIRDLY, God was wont to communicate his mind by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>Inspirations,</hi> whereby he immediately transacted with the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Men, without any relation to their fancy or their senses. It was the most pacate and serene way of Prophecy, God imparting his mind to the
<pb n="XLIII" facs="tcp:98271:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Prophet not by Dreams or Visions, but while they were awake, their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers active, and their minds calm and undisturbed. This the <hi>Jews</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> the <hi>gradus Mosaicus,</hi> or that way of Prophecy that God used towards <hi>Moses,</hi> of whom it is particularly said,<note place="margin">Exod. 33.11.</note> that <hi>the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a Man speaketh unto his friend:</hi> and elsewhere it is evidently distinguished from all inferiour ways of Prophecy, <hi>If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my self known unto him in a Vision, and will speak unto him in a Dream: my Servant Moses is not so,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Numb. 12.6, 7, 8.</note> 
                        <hi>with him I will speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches, and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold</hi>: Clearly implying a mighty preheminence in God's way of revelation to <hi>Moses</hi> above that of other Prophets, which the <hi>Jewish</hi> Writers make to have lyen in four things. First, that in all God's communications to <hi>Moses</hi> he immediately spake to his understanding, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any impressions upon fancy, any visible appearances, any Dreams or Visions of the Night. Secondly, that <hi>Moses</hi> had prophecies conveyed to him without any fears or consternations, whereas the other Prophets were astonished and weakned at the sight of God. Thirdly, that <hi>Moses</hi> had no previous dispositions or preparations to make him capable of the Divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, but could directly go to God and consult him, as <hi>a man speaketh with his friend,</hi> other Prophets being forced many times by some preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry arts to invite the Prophetick spirit to come upon them. Fourthly, that <hi>Moses</hi> had a freedom and liberty of spirit to prophesie at all times, and could when he pleased have recourse to the Sacred Oracle. But as to this the Scripture intimates no such thing, the spirit of Prophecy retiring from him at some times as well as from the rest of the Prophets. And indeed the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick spirit did not reside in the holy men by way of habit, but occasionally, as God saw fitting to pour it out upon them; it was not in them as light is in the Sun, but as light in the Air, and consequently depended upon the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate irradiations of the Spirit of God.</p>

                        <note place="margin">2 Chron. 34.3.</note> he began <hi>to seek after the God of David his Father,</hi> and in the <hi>twelfth year</hi> he began to purge <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; he defaced whatever had been abused and prostituted to Idolatry and Superstition throughout the whole Kingdom, repaired God's house, and ordered its wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship according to the prescript of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, a copy whereof they had found in the ruines of the Temple, solemnly engaged himself and his people to be true to Religion and the worship of God, and caused so great and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn a Passeover to be held, that <hi>there was no Passeover like to it kept in Israel from the days of Samuel.</hi> And more he had done, had not an immature death cut him off in the midst both of his days, and his pious designs and projects. Not many years after God being highly provoked by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious impieties of that Nation, delivered it up to the Army of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who demolished the City, harassed the Land, and carried the people captive unto <hi>Babylon.</hi> And no wonder the Divine patience could hold no longer,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 36.14.</note> when <hi>all the chief of the Priests and the people transgressed very much, after all the abominations of the Heathen, and polluted the house of the Lord, which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</hi> Seventy years they remained under this captivity, during which time the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> gave lively and particular accounts of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that he should come into the World to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a Law of <hi>everlasting righteousness,</hi> to die as a sacrifice and expiation for the sins of the people, and to put a period to the <hi>Levitical</hi> sacrifices and oblations.

They told Men that when the Law forbad <hi>murder,</hi> so they did not actually <hi>kill</hi> another, and sheath their Sword in their Brother's bowels, it was well enough, Men were not restrained from furious and intemperate passions, they might be angry, yea, though by peevish and uncomely speeches they betray'd the rancor and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of their minds. They confessed the Law made it <hi>adultery</hi> actually to embrace the bosom of a stranger, but would not have it extend to wanton thoughts and unchast desires, or that it was adultery for a man to lust after a Woman, and to commit folly with her in his heart: they told them that in all <hi>oaths</hi> and <hi>vows,</hi> if they did but perform what they had sworn to God, the Law took no further notice of it, when as every vain and unnecessary oath, all customary and trifling use of the name of God was forbidden by it. They made them believe that it was lawful for them to proceed by the rigorous Law of retaliation, to exact their own to the utmost, and to right and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themselves; when as the Law requires a tender, compassionate, and benevolent temper of mind, and is so far from owning the rigorous puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's of revenge, that it obliges to meekness and patience, to forgiveness and charity, and which is the very height of charity, not only to pardon, but to <hi>love</hi> and befriend our greatest <hi>enemies,</hi> quite contrary to the doctrine which these men taught, that though they were to <hi>love</hi> their <hi>neighbours</hi>; that is, <hi>Jews,</hi> yet might they <hi>hate</hi> their <hi>enemies.</hi> In these and such like instances they had notoriously abused and evacuated the Law, and in a manner ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it of no effect. And therefore when our Lord, as the great Prophet sent from God, came into the World, the first thing he did after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon his publick Ministry, was to cleanse and purifie the Law, and to remove that rubbish which the <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors had cast upon it. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued it out of the hands of their poisonous and pernicious expositions, resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to its just authority, and to its own primitive sence and meaning, he taught them that the Law did not only bind the external act, but prescribe to the most inward motions of the mind, and that whoever transgresses here, is no less obnoxious to the Divine Justice, and the penalties of the Law, than he that is guilty of the most gross and palpable violations of it: he shewed them how infinitely more pure and strict the command was, than these Impostors had represented it, and plainly told them that if ever they expected to be happy, they must look upon the Law with an other-guise eye, and follow it after another rate, than their blind and deceitful Guides did, <hi>For I say unto you, Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, you can in no case enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>

So that though they were under the precedent obligations of a natural duty, a duty as clearly commanded by God as words could express it, yet a blind Tradition, a rash and impious Vow, made for the most part out of passion or covetousness, should cancel and supersede all these obligations, it being unlawful hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to give them one penny to relieve them: <hi>Ye suffer him no more</hi> (says our Lord) <hi>to do ought for his Father or his Mother, making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. GOD having from the very infancy of the World promised the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as the great Redeemer of Mankind, was accordingly pleased in all Ages to make gradual discoveries and manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him, the revelations concerning him in every Dispensation of the Church still shining with a bigger and more particular light, the nearer this <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> was to his rising. The first Gospel and glad tidings of him commenced with the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> God out of infinite tenderness and commiseration promising to send a person who should triumphantly vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and rescue mankind from the power and tyranny of their Enemies, and that he should do this by taking the humane nature upon him, and being born of <hi>the seed of the Woman.</hi> No further account is given of him till the times of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom it was revealed, that he should proceed out of his loins, and arise out of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, though both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> should be made happy by him. To his Grandchild <hi>Jacob</hi> God made known out of what <hi>Tribe</hi> of that Nation he should rise, the <hi>Tribe of Judah</hi>; and what would be the time of his appearing, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>departure of the Scepter from Judah,</hi> the abrogation of the Civil and Legislative power of that Tribe and People (accomplished in <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Idumaean,</hi> set over them by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> power.) And this is all we find concerning him under that Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Under the Legal Dispensation we find <hi>Moses</hi> foretelling one main er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand of his coming, which was to be the great <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Church,<note place="margin">Deut. 18.15—18, 19.</note> to whom all were to hearken as an extraordinary person sent from God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the World with the Counsels and the Laws of Heaven. The next news we hear of him is from <hi>David,</hi> who was told that he should spring out of his house and family, and who frequently speaks of his sufferings, and the particular manner of his death, by <hi>piercing his hands and his feet,</hi>

                     <p n="2">2.

                        </gap>, as S. <hi>Cyril</hi> says of him, the great and eminent Fore-runner, a Person remarkable upon several accounts. First for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary circumstances of his Nativity, his Birth foretold by an Angel, sent on purpose to deliver this joyful Message, a sign God intended him for great undertakings, this being never done but where God designed the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for some uncommon services; his Parents aged, and though <hi>both righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God,</hi> yet hitherto Childless; Heaven does not dispence all its bounty to the same Person, Children, though great and desirable blessings, are yet often denied to those, for whom God has otherwise very dear regards. <hi>Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well stricken in years.</hi> But <hi>is any thing too hard for the Lord?</hi> said God to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the same case; God has the <hi>Key</hi> of the Womb in his own keeping, it is one of the Divine Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that <hi>he makes the barren Woman to keep house, and to be a joyful Mother of Children.</hi> A Son is promised, and mighty things said of him: a promise which old <hi>Zachary</hi> had scarce faith enough to digest, and therefore had the assurance of it sealed to him by a miraculous dumbness imposed upon him till it was made good, the same Miracle at once confirming his faith, and punishing his infidelity. Accordingly his Mother conceived with Child, and as if he would do part of his errand before he was born, he <hi>leaped in her Womb</hi> at her salutation of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> then newly conceived with Child of our Blessed Saviour; a piece of homage paid by one, to one, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. THESE presages were not vain and fallible, but produced a Person no less memorable for the admirable strictness and austerity of his life. For having escaped <hi>Herod</hi>'s butcherly and merciless Executioners (the Divine providence being a shelter and a cover to him) and been educated among the rudenesses and solitudes of the Wilderness, his manners and way of life were very agreeable to his Education. His Garments borrowed from no other Wardrobe than the backs of his Neighbour-creatures, the skins of Beasts,

Indeed his abstinence was so great, and his food so unlike other Mens, that the Evangelist says of him, that <hi>he came neither eating nor drinking,</hi> as if he had eaten nothing, or at least what was worth nothing. But <hi>Meat commends us not to God</hi>; it is the devout mind, and the honest life that makes us valuable in the eye of Heaven.

And this probably is the reason, why the Apostle writing to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 6.2.</note> speaks of the <hi>Doctrine of Baptisms</hi> (in the plural number) as one of the primary and elementary Principles of the faith, wherein the <hi>Catechumens</hi> were to be instructed; meaning that besides the Baptism whereby they had been initiated into the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Covenant, there was another by which they were to enter into this new Oeconomy, that was come upon the World. Hence the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> (to whom the cognizance of such cases did peculiarly appertain) when told of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, never expressed any wonder at it, as a new upstart Ceremony, it being a thing daily practised in their Church, nor found fault with the thing it self, which they supposed would be a federal Rite under the dispensation of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but only quarrelled with him for taking upon him to administer it, when yet he denied himself to be one of the prime Ministers of this new state. <hi>They said unto him,</hi>

AFTER his Preparatory Preachings in the Wilderness he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Court by <hi>Herod,</hi> at least he was his frequent Auditor, was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with his plain and impartial Sermons, and had a mighty reverence for him, the gravity of his Person, the strictness of his Manners, the freedom of his Preaching commanding an awe and veneration from his Conscience, and making him willing in many things to reform; But the bluntness of the holy Man came nearer, and touched the King in the tenderest part, smartly reproving his adultery and incestuous embraces, for that Prince kept <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias</hi> his Brother <hi>Philip</hi>'s Wife. And now all corrupt interests were awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to conspire his ruine. Extravagant Lusts love not to be controll'd and check'd, <hi>Herodias</hi> resents the affront, cannot brook disturbance in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of her Bed, or the open challenging of her honour, and therefore by all the arts of Feminine subtilty meditates revenge. The issue was, the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> is cast into Prison, as the <hi>praeludium</hi> to a sadder fate. For among other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and scenes of mirth performed upon the King's Birth-day, <hi>Herod</hi> being infinitely pleased with the Dancing of a young Lady, Daughter of this <hi>Herodias,</hi> promised to give her Her request, and solemnly ratified his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise with an Oath. She prompted by her Mother, asks the Head of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> which the King partly out of a pretended reverence to his Oath, partly out of a desire not to be interrupted in his unlawful pleasures, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted, and it was as quickly accomplished. Thus died the Holy man, a man strict in his conversation beyond the ordinary measures of an Anchoret, bold and resolute, faithful and impartial in his Office, indued with the <hi>power and spirit of Elias, a burning and a shining light,</hi> under whose light the <hi>Jews rejoyced to sit,</hi> exceedingly taken with his temper and principles. He was the happy Messenger of the Evangelical tidings, and in that respect <hi>more than a Prophet, a greater not arising among them that were born of Women.</hi> In short, he was a Man loved of his Friends, revered and honoured by his Enemies; <hi>Josephus</hi> gives this character of him, that <hi>he was a good man,</hi>

proper and material to observe in this place is, what the Scripture so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes notice of, the excellency of this above the preceding dispensations, especially that brought in by <hi>Moses,</hi> so much magnified in the Old Testament, and so passionately admired and adhered to by the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day. <hi>Jesus is the Mediator</hi>

And first, the <hi>Mosaick</hi> dispensation was almost wholly made up of types and shadows, the <hi>Evangelical</hi> has brought in the truth and substance,<note place="margin">John 1.17.</note> 
                        <hi>The Law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</hi> Their Ordinances were but <hi>shadows of good things to come,</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible representations of what was to follow after, <hi>the Body is Christ,</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and accomplishment of their whole ritual Ministration. Their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were <hi>Figures of those things that are true,</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Heaven, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> were types of the Blessed <hi>Jesus,</hi> and the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites after the flesh</hi> of the <hi>true Israel which is after the Spirit,</hi> and all their Expiatory Sacrifices did but represent that Great Sacrifice whereby Christ offered up himself, and by his own bloud purged away the sins of mankind, indeed the most minute and inconsiderable circumstances of the Legal Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy were intended as little lights, that might gradually usher in the state of the Gospel. A curious Artist that designs a famous and excellent piece is not wont to complete and finish it all at once, but first with his Pencil draws some rude lines and rough draughts before he puts his last hand to it. By such a method the wise God seems to have delivered the first draughts and Images of those things by <hi>Moses</hi> to the Church, the substance and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof he designed should be brought in by <hi>Christ.</hi> And how admirably did God herein condescend to the temper and humour of that people; for being of a more rough and childish disposition, apt to be taken with gaudy and sensible objects, by the external and pompous institutions of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Dispensation he prepared them for better things, as children are brought on by things accommodate to their weak capacities. The Church was then an <hi>heir under age,</hi> and was to be trained up in such a way, as agreed best with its Infant-temper, till it came to be of a more ripe manly age, able to digest Evangelical mysteries, and then the cover and the veil was taken off, and things made to appear in their own form and shape.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. HENCE in the next place appears our happiness above them, that we are redeemed from those many severe and burdensom impositions wherewith they were clogg'd, and are now obliged only to a more easie and reasonable service. That the Law was a very grievous and servile Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, is evident to any that considers, how much it consisted of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ordinances, costly duties, chargeable sacrifices, and innumerable little Rites and Ceremonies. Under that state they were bound to undergo (yea even new-born Infants) the bloudy and painful Ceremony of Circumcision, to abstain from many sorts of food, useful and pleasant to man's life, to keep multitudes of solemn and stated times, new Moons, and Ceremonial Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, to take long and tedious journeys to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to offer their sacrifices at the Temple, to observe daily washings and purifications, to use infinite care and caution in every place; for if by chance they did but touch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, besides their present confinement, it put them to the expences of a sacrifice, with hundreds more troublesom and costly observances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them. A cruel bondage, <hi>heavy burdens, and grievous to be born</hi>; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight whereof good men did then groan, and earnestly breath after

                        <hi>the time of reformation</hi>;<note place="margin">Acts 15.10.</note> the very Apostles complained that it was <hi>a yoke upon their necks, which neither their Fathers nor they were able to bear.</hi> But this yoke is taken off from our shoulders, and the way open into the liberties of the children of God. The Law bore a heavy hand over them, as children in their minority, we are got from under the rod and lash of its tutorage and <hi>Pedagogie,</hi> and are no more subject to the severity of its commands, to the exact punctilio's and numerousness of its impositions. Our Lord has removed that low and troublesome Religion, and has brought in a more manly and rational way of worship, more suitable to the perfections of God, and more accommodate to the reason and understandings of men. A Religion incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably the wisest and the best that ever took place in the World. God did not settle the Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their way of worship, because good and excellent in it self, but for its suitableness to the temper of that people. Happy we, whom the Gospel has freed from those intolerable observances to which they were obliged, and has taught us to serve God in a better way, more easie and acceptable, more humane and natural, and in which we are helped forwards by greater aids of Divine assistence, than were afforded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Dispensation. All which conspire to render our way smooth and plain, <hi>Take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is easie, and my burden is light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. THIRDLY, the Dispensation of the Gospel is founded upon more noble and excellent promises:<note place="margin">Heb. 8.6.</note> 
                        <hi>A better Covenant established upon better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> And better promises they are both for the nature and clearness of their revelation. They are of a more sublime and excellent nature, as being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of spiritual and eternal things, such as immediately concern the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and happiness of mankind, grace, peace, pardon, and eternal life. The Law strictly considered as a particular Covenant with the <hi>Jews</hi> at Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi> had no other promises but of temporal blessings, plenty and prosperity, and the happiness of this life. This was all that appeared above-ground, and that was expresly held forth in that transaction, whatever might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by due inferences, and proportions of reason be deduced from it. Now this was a great defect in that Dispensation, it being by this means, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the nature and disposition of that people, and the use they would make of it, apt to intangle and debase the minds of men, and to arrest their thoughts and desires in the pursuit of more sublime and better things. I do not say but that under the Old Testament there were promises of spiritual things, and of eternal happiness, as appears from <hi>David's Psalms,</hi> and some passages in the Books of the Prophets: But then these though they were <hi>under</hi> the Law, yet they were not <hi>of</hi> the Law, that is, did not properly belong to it as a legal Covenant; God in every age of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church raising up some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary persons, who preached notions to the people above the common stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of that Dispensation, and who spoke things more plainly, by how much nearer they approached the times of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> But under the Christian Oeconomy the promises are evidently more pure and spiritual; not a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Canaan,</hi> external prosperity, or pardon of ceremonial uncleanness, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, reconciliation with God, and everlasting life are proposed and offered to us. Not but that in some measure temporal blessings are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to us as well as them, only with this difference, to them earthly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings were pledges of spiritual, to us spiritual blessings are ensurances of temporal, so far as the Divine wisdom sees fit for us. Nor are they better in themselves, than they are clearly discovered and revealed to us. Whatever spiritual blessings were proposed under the former state were obscure and dark, and very few of the people understood them: But to us <hi>the veil is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off,</hi> and <hi>we behold the glory of the Lord with open face,</hi> especially the things

that relate to another World;<note place="margin">1 John 2.25. 2 Tim. 1.10.</note> for <hi>this is the promise that he hath promised us, even Eternal Life.</hi> Hence our Lord is said to <hi>have brought life and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to light through the Gospel.</hi> Which he may be justly said to have done, inasmuch as he has given the greatest certainty, and the clearest account of that state. He hath given us the greatest assurance and certainty of the thing, that there is such a state. The happiness of the other World was a notion not so firmly agreed upon either amongst <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Among the <hi>Jews</hi> it was peremptorily denied by the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> a considerable Sect in that Church, which we can hardly suppose they would have done, had it been clearly propounded in the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And among the <hi>Heathens</hi> the most sober and considering persons did at some times at least doubt of it, witness that confession of <hi>Socrates</hi> himself, the wisest and best man that ever was in the Heathen World, who when he came to plead his cause before his Judges, and had bravely discoursed of the happy state of good men in the other Life,<note place="margin">

                           </gap>, unknown to any but to God alone.</hi> But our blessed Saviour has put the case past all peradventure, having plainly published this doctrine to the World, and sealed the truth of it, and that by raising others from the dead, and especially by his own Resurrection and Ascension, which were the highest pledge and assurance of a future Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. But besides the security, he hath given the clearest account of the nature of it. 'Tis very probable that the <hi>Jews</hi> generally had of old, as 'tis certain they have at this day, the most gross and carnal apprehensions concerning the state of another Life. But to us the Gospel has perspicuously revealed the invisible things of the other World; told us what that Heaven is, which is promised to good men, a state of spiritual joys, of chaste and rational delights, a conformity of ours to the Divine Nature, a being made like to God, and an endless and uninterrupted communion with him.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. BUT because in our lapsed and degenerate state we are very unable without some foreign assistance to attain the promised rewards, hence arises in the next place another great priviledge of the Evangelical Oeconomy, that it is blessed with larger and more abundant communications of the Divine Spirit, than was afforded under the <hi>Jewish</hi> state. Under the one it was given by <hi>drops,</hi> under the other it is <hi>poured</hi> forth. The Law laid heavy and hard commands, but gave little strength to do them, it did not assist humane nature with those powerful aids that are necessary for us in our present state, it could <hi>do nothing in that it was weak through the flesh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.

Whereas now the Gospel does not only prescribe such Laws as are happily accommodate to the true temper of humane nature, and adapted to the reason of mankind, such as every wise and prudent man must have pitched upon, but it affords the influences of the Spirit of God, by whose assistance our vitiated faculties are repaired, and we enabled under so much weakness, and in the midst of so many temptations to hold on in the paths of piety and vertue. Hence it is that the plentiful effusions of the Spirit were reserved as the great blessing of the Evangelical state,<note place="margin">Isai. 44.3, 4.</note> that God would then <hi>pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground,</hi> that he <hi>would pour out his Spirit upon their seed, and his blessing upon their off-spring,</hi> whereby they should <hi>spring up as among the

                     <p n="10">10. FIFTHLY, The Dispensation of the Gospel had a better establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confirmation than that of the Law; for though the Law was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced with great scenes of pomp and Majesty, yet was the Gospel usher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in by more kindly and rational methods, ratified by more and greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, whereby our Lord unquestionably evinced his Divine Commission, and shewed that he came from God, doing more miracles in three years than were done through all the periods of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, and many of them such as were peculiar to him alone. He often raised the dead, which <hi>Moses</hi> never did, commanded the winds and waves of the Sea, expelled De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils out of <hi>Lunaticks</hi> and possessed persons, who fled assoon as ever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be gone, cured many inveterate and chronical distempers with the speaking of a word, and some without a word spoken, vertue si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently going out from him. He searched men's hearts, and revealed the most secret transactions of their minds; had this miraculous power always residing in him, and could exert it when, and upon what occasions he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and impart it to others, communicating it to his Apostles and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to the Primitive Christians for the three first Ages of the Church; he never exerted it in methods of dread and terror, but in doing such miracles as were highly useful and beneficial to the World. And as if all this had not been enough, he laid down his own life after all to give testimony to it. Covenants were ever wont to be ratified with bloud, and the death of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. But when our Lord came to introduce the Covenant of the Gospel, he did not consecrate it with the bloud of Bulls and Goats, but with his own most precious bloud, as of a Lamb without spot and blemish. And could he give a greater testimony to the truth of his doctrine, and those great things he had promised to the World, than to seal it with his bloud? Had not these things been so, 'twere infinitely unreasonable to suppose, that a person of so much wisdom and goodness as our Saviour was, should have made the World believe so, and much less would he have chosen to die for it, and that the most acute and ignominious death. But he died, and rose again for us, and appeared after his Resurrection: His enemies had taken him away by a most bitter and cruel death, had guarded and secured his Sepulchre with all the care, power and diligence which they could invent. And yet he
<pb n="LXVI" facs="tcp:98271:38"/>
rose again the third day in triumph, visibly conversed with his Disciples for forty days together, and then went to Heaven. By which he gave the most solemn and undeniable assurance to the World,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> that he was the Son of God (for <hi>he was declared to be the Son of God with power by the Resurrection from the dead</hi>) and the Saviour of mankind, and that those doctrines which he had taught were most true, and did really contain the terms of that solemn trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, which God by him had offered to men in order to their eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in another World.</p>

THE last instance I shall note of the excellency of this above the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical</hi> Dispensation, is the universal extent and latitude of it, and that both in respect of place and time.

                     <p n="12">12. AND as the true Religion was in those Days pent up within one particular Country, so the more publick and ordinary worship of God was confined only to one particular place of it, viz. <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> hence called the <hi>Holy City.</hi> Here was the Temple, here the Priests that ministred at the <hi>Altar,</hi> here all the more publick Solemnities of Divine adoration,<note place="margin">Psal. 122.4.</note> 
                        <hi>Thither the Tribes go up, the Tribes of the Lord unto the Testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.</hi> Now this was not the least part of the bondage of that dispensation to be obliged thrice every Year to take such long and tedious Journies, many of the <hi>Jews</hi> living some Hundreds of Miles distance from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and so strictly were they limited to this place, that to build an <hi>Altar,</hi> and offer Sacrifices in any other place (unless in a case or two wherein God did extraordinarily dispense) although it were to the true God, was, though not false, yet unwarrantable worship; for which reason the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from Sacrifices, because banished from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Temple, the only legal place of offering.

For the Law and the Gospel did not differ in this, that the one commanded publick worship, the other not, but that under the one publick worship was fixed to one only place, under the other it is free to any where the providence of God has pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us, it being part of the duty bound upon us by natural and unalterable obligations, that we should publickly meet together for the solemn Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine honour and service.</p>

NOR is the Oeconomy of the Gospel less extensive in time than place; the Old Testament was only a temporary dispensation, that of the Gospel is to last to the end of the World; the Law was to continue only for a little time the Gospel is an Everlasting Covenant; the one to be quickly antiquated and abolished, the other never to be done away by any other to succeed it.

of the First-fruits a <hi>statute for ever,</hi> and the like in other places, which seem to intimate a perpetual and unalterable Dispensation. But the answer is short and plain, that this phrase <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>for ever</hi> (though when 'tis applied to God it always denotes Eternity) yet when 'tis attributed to other things, it implies no more than a periodical duration, limited according to the will of the Lawgiver, or the nature of the thing; thus the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Servant was to serve his Master <hi>for ever,</hi>

Thus when the Ritual services of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law are called Statutes for ever, the meaning is, that they should continue a long time obligatory, until the time of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> in whose days <hi>the Sacrifice and Oblation was to cease,</hi> and those carnal Ceremonies to give way to the more spiritual services of the Gospel. Indeed the very typical nature of that Dispensation evidently argued it to be but for a time, the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow being to cease, that the substance might take place; and though many of them continued some considerable time after <hi>Christ</hi>'s death, yet they lost their positive and obligatory power, and were used only as things indifferent in compliance with the inveterate prejudices of new Converts, lately brought over from <hi>Judaism,</hi> and who could not quickly lay aside that great veneration which they had for the Rites of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Institution. Though even in this respect it was not long before all <hi>Jewish</hi> Ceremonies were thrown off, and <hi>Moses</hi> quite turn'd out of doors. Whereas the Evangelical state is to run parallel with the age and duration of the World, 'tis the <hi>Everlasting Covenant,</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will not, I suppose, seem improbable to the Reader, when I tell him, with how much reluctancy and unwillingness I set upon this undertaking. Besides the disadvantage of having this piece annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Elaborate Book of that excellent Prelate, so great a Master both of Learning and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I was intimately conscious to my own unfitness for such a Work at any time, much more when clogg'd with many habitual Infirmities and Distempers. I considered the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the thing it self, perhaps not capable of being well managed by a much better Pen than mine; few of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Monuments of the Church being extant, and little of this nature in those few that are. Indeed I could not but think it reasonable, that all possible honour should be done to those, that first <hi>Preached the Gospel of peace, and brought glad tidings of good things,</hi> that it was fit men should be taught how much they were obliged to those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Persons, who were willing at so dear a rate to plant Christianity in the World, who they were, and what was that Piety and that Patience, that Charity and that Zeal,
<pb facs="tcp:98271:41"/>
which made them to be reverenc'd while they liv'd, and their Memories ever since to be honourably celebrated through the World, infinitely beyond the glories of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the triumphs of a <hi>Pompey</hi> or a <hi>Caesar.</hi> But then how this should be done out of those few imperfect <hi>Memoires,</hi> that have escaped the general shipwrack of <hi>Church-Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and much more by so rude and unskilful a hand as mine, appear'd, I confess, a very difficult task, and next door to impossible. These, with some other considerations, made me a long time obstinately resolve against it, till being overcome by importunity, I yielded to do it, as I was able, and as the nature of the thing would bear.</p>
                  <p>THAT which I primarily designed to my self, was to draw down the History of the New Testament especially from our Lord's death, to enquire into the first Originals and Plantations of the Christian Church by the Ministry of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the success of their Doctrine, the power and conviction of their Miracles, their infinite Labours and hardships, and the dreadful Sufferings which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went; to consider in what instances of Piety and Virtue they ministred to our imitation, and served the purposes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and an Holy Life. Indeed the accounts that are left us of these things are very short and inconsiderable, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent possibly to excite the appetite, not to allay the hunger of an importunate Enquirer into these matters. A considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that might give us just occasion to lament the irreparable loss of those Primitive Records, which the injury of time hath deprived us of, the substance being gone, and little left us but the shell and carcass. Had we the Writings of <hi>Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> and Scholar, says <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> to S. <hi>John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apud Euseb. H. Eccl. lib. 3. c. 39. p. 111.</note> (wherein, as himself tells us, he set down what he had learnt from those who had familiarly conversed with the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the sayings and discourses of <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Thomas, &amp;c.</hi>) Had we the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="tcp:98271:41"/>
                     <hi>Commentaries</hi> of <hi>Hegesippus, Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> his <hi>Institutions, Africanus</hi> his <hi>Chronography,</hi> and some others, the Reader might expect more intire and particular relations, But alas! these are long since pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd, and little besides the names of them transmitted to us. Nor should we have had most of that little that is left us, had not the commendable care and industry of <hi>Eusebius</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd it to us.<note place="margin">H. Eccl. lib. 1. c. 2. p. 4.</note> And if he complain'd in his time (when those Writings were extant) that towards the composing of his History he had only some few particular accounts here and there left by the Ancients of their times; what cause have we to complain, when even those little portions have been ravish'd from us? So that he that would build a work of this nature, must look upon himself as condemn'd to a kind of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task, to make <hi>Brick</hi> without <hi>Straw,</hi> at least to pick it up where he can find it, though after all it amounts to a very slender parcel. Which as it greatly hinders the beauty and completeness of the structure, so does it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly multiply the labour and difficulty. For by this means I have been forc'd to gather up those little fragments of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, that lie dispers'd in the Writings of the Ancients, thrown some into this corner, and others into that: which I have at length put together, like the pieces of a broken Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that it might have at least some kind of resemblance of the person, whom it designs to represent.</p>
                  <p>HAD I thought good to have traded in idle and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Authors, <hi>Abdias Babylonius,</hi> the <hi>Passions</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Paul, Joachim Perionius, Peter de Natalibus,</hi> and such like, I might have presented the Reader with a larger, not a better account. But besides the averseness of my nature to falshoods and trifles, especially in matters wherein the honour of the Christian Religion is concern'd, I knew the World to be wiser at this time of day, than to be imposed upon by <hi>Pious frauds,</hi> and cheated with Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
<pb facs="tcp:98271:42"/>
                     <hi>Romances,</hi> and Legendary Reports. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I have more fully and particularly insisted upon the Lives of the two first <hi>Apostles,</hi> so great a part of them being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by an unquestionable Authority, and have presented the larger portions of the Sacred History, many times to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minute circumstances of action. And I presume the wise and judicious Reader will not blame me, for chusing rather to enlarge upon a story, which I knew to be infallibly true, than to treat him with those, which there was cause enough to conclude to be certainly false.</p>
                  <p>THE Reader will easily discern, that the Authors I make use of are not all of the same rank and size. Some of them are <hi>Divinely inspir'd,</hi> whose Authority is Sacred, and their reports rendred not only credible, but unquestionable, by that infallible and unerring Spirit that presided over them. Others such, of whose faith and testimony, especially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, there is no just cause to doubt, I mean the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Writings of the Ancient Fathers, or those, which though unduly assign'd to this or that particular Father, are yet generally allowed to be Ancient, and their credit not to be despis'd, because their proper Parent is not certainly known. Next these come the Writers of the middle and later Ages of the Church, who though below the former in point of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, have yet some particular advantages that recommend them to us. Such I account <hi>Symeon Metaphrastes, Nicephorus Callistus,</hi> the <hi>Menaea</hi> and <hi>Menologies</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein though we meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vain and improbable stories, yet may we also rationally expect some real and substantial accounts of things, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally seeing they had the advantage of many Ancient and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick Writings, extant in their times, which to us are utterly lost. Though even these too I have never called in, but in the want of more Ancient and Authentick Writers. As for others, if any passages occur either in themselves
<pb facs="tcp:98271:42"/>
of doubtful and suspected credit, or borrowed from spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uncertain Authors, they are always introduced or dismissed with some kind of censure or remark, that the most easie and credulous Reader may know what to trust to, and not fear being secretly surpriz'd into a belief of doubtful and fabulous reports. And now after all I am sufficiently sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, how lank and thin this Account is, nor can the Reader be less satisfied with it, than I am my self; and I have only this piece of justice and charity to beg of him, that he would suspend his censure, till he has taken a little pains to enquire into the state of the Times and Things I Write of: And then however he may challenge my prudence in undertaking it, he will not, I hope, see reason to charge me with want of care and faithfulness in the pursuance of it.</p>

                        </gap>, an Apostle or Messenger is not greater than him that sent him.</hi> This then being the common notion of the word, our Lord fixes it to a particular use, applying it to those select persons, whom he had made choice of to act by that peculiar authority and commission, which he had deriv'd upon them. <hi>Twelve, whom he also named Apostles</hi>; that is, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, those who were to be Embassadors for Christ, to be sent up

                  <p n="3">III. The next thing then to be considered is the nature of their Office; and under this enquiry we shall make these following remarks. First, it is not to be doubted but that our Lord in founding this Office had some respect to the state of things in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, I mean not only in general, that there should be superiour and subordinate Officers, as there were superiour and inferiour Orders under the <hi>Mosaic</hi> dispensation; but that herein he had an eye to some usage and custom common among them. Now among the <hi>Jews</hi> as all Messengers were called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

MS. apud Heins. exercit. in Luc.</hi> 6.</note> so were they wont to dispatch some with peculiar letters of authority &amp; Commission, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they acted as Proxies and Deputies of those that sent them, thence their Proverb, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>every man's Apostle is as himself,</hi> that is, whatever he does is look'd upon to be as firm and valid, as if the person himself had done it. Thus when <hi>Saul</hi> was sent by the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> to <hi>Damascus</hi> to apprehend the <hi>Jewish</hi> converts, he was furnished with letters from the High-Priest, enabling him to act as his Commissary in that matter. Indeed <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us of a sort of persons called <hi>Apostles,</hi> who were Assessors and Counsellors to the <hi>Jewish Patriarch,</hi> constantly attending upon him to advise him in matters pertaining to the Law, and sent by him (as <note n="‖" place="margin">

                     <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> more than once mentioning the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="4">IV. Secondly, We observe that the persons thus deputed by our Saviour were not left uncertain, but reduced to a fixed definite number, confin'd to the just number of Twelve: <hi>he ordained twelve that they should be with him.</hi>

the truth; by the twelve precious stones in <hi>Aaron</hi>'s breast-plate, to illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Church, the garment which Christ our great High-Priest has put on; by the twelve stones which <hi>Joshua</hi> chose out of <hi>Jordan</hi> to lay up within the Ark of the Testament, respecting the firmness and solidity of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Faith, their being chosen by the true <hi>Jesus</hi> or <hi>Joshua</hi> at their Baptism in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and their being admitted in the inner Sanctuary of his Covenant. By others we are told that it was shadowed out by the twelve Spies taken out of every Tribe, and sent to discover the Land of Promise: or by the twelve gates of the City in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s vision; or by the twelve Bells appendant to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron</hi>'s garment, <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>their sound going out into all the World, and their words unto the ends of the Earth.</hi> But it were endless, and to very little purpose to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on up all the conjectures of this nature, there being scarce any one number of Twelve mentioned in the Scripture, which is not by some of the Ancients adapted and applied to this of the Twelve Apostles, wherein an ordinary fancy might easily enough pick out a mystery. That which seems to put in the most rational plea is, that our Lord pitched upon this number, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity either to the twelve <hi>Patriarchs</hi> as founders of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> or to the twelve <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>chief heads,</hi> as standing Rulers of those Tribes among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as we shall afterwards possibly more particularly <note n="*" place="margin">See S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Life, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Num.</hi> 2.</note> remark. Thirdly, these Apostles were immediately called and sent by Christ himself, elected out of the body of his Disciples and followers, and receiv'd their Commission from his own mouth. Indeed <hi>Matthias</hi> was not one of the first election, being taken in upon <hi>Judas</hi> his Apostasie after our Lord's Ascension into Heaven. But besides that he had been one of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Disciples,</hi> called and sent out by our Saviour, that extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Divine will and pleasure that appeared in determining his election, was in a manner equivalent to the first election. As for S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he was not one of the Twelve,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.1.</note> taken in as a supernumerary Apostle, but yet an Apostle as well as they, and that <hi>not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ,</hi> as he pleads his own cause against the insinuations of those Impostors who traduced him as an Apostle only at the second hand; whereas he was immediately call'd by Christ as well as they, and in a more extraordinary manner; they were called by him, while he was yet in his state of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and humiliation, he, when Christ was now advanced upon the Throne, and appeared to him encircled with those glorious emanations of brightness and majesty, which he was not able to endure.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Fourthly, The main work and imployment of these Apostles was to preach the Gospel, to establish Christianity, and to govern the Church that was to be founded, as Christ's immediate Deputies and Vicegerents: they were to instruct men in the doctrines of the Gospel, to disciple the World, and to baptize and initiate men into the Faith of Christ; to constitute and ordain Guides and Ministers of Religion, persons peculiarly set a-part for holy ministrations, to censure and punish obstinate and contumacious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to compose and over-rule disorders and divisions, to command or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand as occasion was, being vested with an extraordinary authority and power of disposing things for the edification of the Church. This Office the Apostles never exercised in its full extent and latitude during Christ's resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon Earth; for though upon their election he sent them forth to Preach and to Baptize, yet this was only a narrow and temporary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they quickly returned to their private stations, the main power being still executed and administred by Christ himself, the complete exercise whereof was not actually devolved upon them, till he was ready to leave the World:<note place="margin">John 20, 21, 22, 23.</note> for then it was that he told them, <hi>as my father hath sent me, even so
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:98271:47"/>
send I you; receive ye the Holy Ghost; whose soever sins ye remit, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> Whereby he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd in some proportion the same authority upon them, which he himself had derived from his Father. Fifthly, This Commission given to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles was unlimited and universal, not only in respect of power, as enabling them to discharge all acts of Religion relating either to Ministry or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but in respect of place,<note place="margin">

And indeed strange it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that in so few years these Evangelical Messengers should over-run all Countries; with what an incredible swiftness did the Christian Faith like <hi>lightning</hi> pierce from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> and diffuse it self over all quarters of the World, and that not only unassisted by any secular advantages, but in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the most fierce and potent opposition, which every where set it self against it? 'Tis true the impostures of <hi>Muhammed</hi> in a very little time gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great part of the East. But besides that this was not comparable to the universal spreading of Christianity, his doctrine was calculated on purpose to gratifie mens lusts, and especially to comply with the loose and wanton manners of the East, and, which is above all, had the sword to hew out its way before it: and we know how ready even without force in all changes and revolutions of the World, the conquered have been to follow the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Conquerors. Whereas the Apostles had no visible advantages, nay, had all the enraged powers of the World to contend against them. And yet in despite of all went on in triumph, and quickly made their way into those places, where for so many Ages no other conquest ever came; <hi>those parts of Britain</hi> (as <note n="*" place="margin">

He tells the <hi>Gentile</hi> (with whom he was disputing) that he would not prove Christ's Deity by a demonstration from Heaven, by his Creation of the World, his great and stupendious miracles, his raising the dead, curing the blind, expelling Devils; nor from the mighty promises of a future state, and the resurrection of the dead (which an Infidel might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily not only question, but deny) but from what was sufficiently evident and obvious to the meanest Idiot, his planting and propagating Christianity in the World. For it is not <hi>(says he)</hi> in the power of a meer man, in so short a time to encircle the World, to compass Sea and Land, and in matters of so great importance to rescue mankind from the slavery of absurd and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable customs, and the powerful tyranny of evil habits: and these not <hi>Romans</hi> only, but <hi>Persians,</hi> and the most barbarous Nations of the World. A reformation which he wrought not by force and the power of the sword; nor by pouring into the world numerous Legions and Armies: but by a few inconsiderable men (no more at first than Eleven) a company of obscure and mean, simple and illiterate, poor and helpless, naked and unarmed persons, who had scarce a shooe to tread on, or a coat to cover them. And yet by these he perswaded so great a part of mankind to be able freely to reason, not only of things of the present, but of a future state; to renounce the Laws of their Country, and throw off those ancient and inveterate customs, which had taken root for so many Ages, and planted others in their room; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced men from those easie ways, whereinto they were hurried, into the more rugged and difficult paths of vertue.

For even the <hi>British Islands</hi> that lie beyond the Ocean, and those that are in it, have felt the power of the Christian Faith; Churches and Altars being erected there to the service of Christ. A matter truly great and admirable, and which would clearly have demonstrated a Divine and Supereminent Power, although there had been no opposition in the case, but that all things had run on calmly and smoothly, to think that in so few years the Christian Faith should be able to reclaim the whole World from its vicious customs, and to win them over to other manners, more laborious and difficult, repugnant both to their native inclinations, and to the Laws and Principles of their education, and such as oblig'd them to a more strict and accurate course of life; and these persons not one or two, not twenty or an hundred, but in a manner all Mankind: and this brought about by no better instruments than a few rude and unlearned, private and unknown tradesmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had neither estate nor reputation, learning nor eloquence, kindred nor Country to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to the World; a few Fishermen and Tent-makers, and whom distinguished by their Language as well as their Religion, the rest of the World scorn'd as barbarous. And yet these were the men, by whom our Lord built up his Church, and extended it from one end of the World unto the other. Other considerations there are with which the Father does urge and illustrate this argument, which I forbear to insist on in this place.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Sixthly, The power and authority convey'd by this Commission to the Apostles, was equally conferr'd upon all of them. They were all chosen at the same time, all equally impowred to Preach and Baptize, all equally intrusted with the power of binding and loosing, all invested with the same mission, and all equally furnished with the same gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost. Indeed the Advocates of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do with a mighty zeal and fierceness contend for S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s being Head and Prince of the Apostles, advanced by Christ to a supremacy and prerogative not only above, but over the rest of the Apostles; and not without reason, the fortunes of that Church being concerned in the supremacy of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> No wonder therefore they ransack all corners, press and force in whatever may but seem to give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to it. Witness those thin and miserable shifts, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls arguments, to prove and make it good; so utterly devoid of all rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, so unable to justifie themselves to sober and considering men, that a Man would think they had been contrived for no other purpose, than to cheat fools, and make wise men laugh. And the truth is, nothing with me more shakes the reputation of the wisdom of that learned man, than his making use of such weak and trifling arguments in so important and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an Article, so vital and essential to the constitution of that Church.

the same being done to <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi>) from his being first reckoned up in the Catalogue of Apostles, his walking with Christ upon the water, his paying tribute for his Master and himself, his being commanded to let down the Net, and Christ's teaching in <hi>Peter</hi>'s ship, (and this ship must denote the Church, and <hi>Peter</hi>'s being owner of it, entitle him to be supreme Ruler and Governour of the Church, so <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in terms as plain as he could well express it) from Christ's first washing <hi>Peter</hi>'s feet (though the story re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by the Evangelist says no such thing) and his foretelling only his death: all which, and many more prerogatives of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to the number of no less than XXVIII. are summoned in to give in evidence in this cause; and many of these two drawn out of Apocryphal and supposititious Authors, and not only uncertain, but absurd and fabulous: and yet upon such argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as these do they found his paramount authority. A plain evidence of a desperate and sinking cause, when such twigs must be laid hold on to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and keep it above water. Had they suffered <hi>Peter</hi> to be content with a primacy of Order (which his age and gravity seemed to challenge for him) no wise and peaceable man would have denied it, as being a thing ordinarily practised among equals, and necessary to the well governing a society: but when nothing but a primacy of Power will serve the turn, as if the rest of the Apostles had been inferiour to him, this may by no means be granted, as being expresly contrary to the positive determination of our Saviour, when the Apostles were contending about this very thing, <hi>which of them should be accounted the greatest,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 20.25, 26, 27.

Nor do we ever find S. <hi>Peter</hi> himself laying claim to any such power, or the Apostles giving him the least shadow of it. In the whole course of his affairs there are no intimations of this matter; in his Epistle he styles himself but their <hi>fellow-Presbyter,</hi> and expresly forbids the Governours of the Church to <hi>Lord it over God's heritage.</hi> When dispatched by the rest of the Apostles upon a message to <hi>Samaria,</hi> he never disputes their authority to do it; when accused by them for going in unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> does he stand upon his prerogative? no, but submissively apologizes for himself; nay, when smartly reprov'd by S. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> (when, if ever, his credit lay at stake) do we find him excepting against it as an affront to his supremacy, and a sawcy controlling his superiour? surely the quite contrary; he quietly submitted to the reproof, as one that was sensible how justly he had deserved it. Nor can it be supposed but that S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have carried it towards him with a greater reverence, had any such peculiar soveraignty been then known to the World. How confidently does S. <hi>Paul</hi> assert himself to be no whit <hi>inferiour to the chiefest Apostles,</hi> not to <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? <hi>the Gospel of the uncircumcision being committed to him, as that of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was to Peter.</hi> Is <hi>Peter</hi> oft named first among the Apostles? else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where others, sometimes <hi>James,</hi> sometimes <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> are placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.

                  <p n="8">VIII. We proceed next to enquire into the fitness and qualification of the Persons commissionated for this employment; and we shall finde them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably qualified to discharge it, if we consider this following account. First, They immediately received the Doctrine of the Gospel from the mouth of Christ himself; he intended them for <hi>Legati à latere,</hi> his peculiar Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to the World, and therefore furnished them with instructions from his own mouth; and in order hereunto he train'd them up for some years under his own Discipline and institution: he made them to understand the <hi>myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Kingdom of Heaven, when to others it was not given</hi>; treated them with the affection of a Father, and the freedom and familiarity of a friend. <hi>Henceforth I call you not servants,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.15.</note> for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doth, but I have called you friends: for all things that I have heard of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have made known unto you.</hi> They heard all his Sermons, were privy both to his publick and private discourses; what he preach'd abroad, he expounded to them at home; he gradually instructed them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:98271:50"/>
of Divine things, and imparted to them the notions and mysteries of the Gospel, not all at once, but <hi>as they were able to bear them.</hi> By which means they were sufficiently capable of giving a satisfactory account of that doctrine to others, which had been so immediately, so frequently communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to themselves. Secondly, They were infallibly secured from error in delivering the Doctrines and Principles of Christianity: for though they were not absolutely priviledg'd from failures and miscarriages in their lives, (these being of more personal and private consideration) yet were they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in their Doctrine, this being a matter whereupon the salvation and eternal interests of men did depend.<note place="margin">Joh. 16.13.</note> And for this end they had the <hi>spirit of truth</hi> promised to them, who should <hi>guide them into all truth.</hi> Under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this unerring Guide they all steer'd the same course, taught and spake the same things, though at different times, and in distant places: and for what was consign'd to writing, <hi>all Scripture was given by inspiration of God, and the holy men spake not, but as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> Hence that exact and admirable harmony that is in all their writings and relations, as being all equally dictated by the same spirit of truth. Thirdly, They had been eye-witnesses of all the material passages of our Saviour's life, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conversant with him from the commencing of his publick ministery, till his ascension into Heaven; they had survey'd all his actions, seen all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, observ'd the whole method of his conversation, and some of them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him in his most private solitudes and retirements. And this could not but be a very rational satisfaction to the minds of men, when the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers of the Gospel solemnly declared to the World, that they reported no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning our Saviour, but what they had seen with their own eyes, and of the truth whereof they were as competent Judges, as the acutest Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher in the World. Nor could there be any just reason to suspect that they impos'd upon men in what they delivered; for besides their naked plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and simplicity in all other passages of their lives, they chearfully submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the most exquisite hardships, tortures, and sufferings, meerly to attest the truth of what they published to the World. Next to the evidence of our own senses, no testimony is more valid and forcible, than his who relates what himself has seen.<note place="margin">Act. 1.8.</note> Upon this account our Lord told his Apostles, <hi>that they should be witnesses to him both in Judaea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the Earth.</hi> And so necessary a qualification of an Apostle was this thought to be, that it was almost the only condition propounded in the choice of a new Apostle after the fall of <hi>Judas:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 1.21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Wherefore</hi> (says <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the Baptism of John, unto the same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</hi> Accordingly we find the Apostles constantly making use of this argument as the most rational evidence to convince those whom they had to deal with.<note place="margin">Act. 10.39, 40, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>We are witnesses of all things which Jesus did both in the Land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem, whom they slew and hanged on a tree: Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly, not to all the people, but unto witnesses, chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead: And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testifie that it is he that is ordained of God to be Judge of the quick and dead.</hi> Thus S. <hi>John</hi> after the same way of arguing appeals to sensible demonstration, <hi>That which was from the beginning,</hi>

Fourthly, The Apostles were invested with a power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as the readiest means to procure their Religion a firm belief and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in the minds of Men. For Miracles are the great confirmation of the truth of any doctrine, and the most rational evidence of a divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. For seeing God only can create, and controll the Laws of nature, produce something out of nothing, and call things that are not, as if they were, give eyes to them that were born blind, raise the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> things plainly beyond all possible powers of nature; no man that believes the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodness of an infinite being, can suppose that this God of truth should affix his seal to a lye, or communicate this power to any that would abuse it, to confirm and countenance delusions and impostures. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his reasoning was very plain and convictive, when he concludes that Christ <hi>must needs be a Teacher come from God,</hi>

                  <p n="10">X. But because besides Miracles in general, the Scripture takes particular notice of many gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost conferred upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and first Preachers of the Gospel, it may not be amiss to consider some of the chiefest and most material of them, as we find them enumerated by the Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.9, 10.</note> only premising this observation, that though these gifts were distinctly distributed to persons of an inferiour order, so that one had this, and another that, yet were they (probably) all conferr'd upon the Apostles, and doubtless in larger proportions than upon the rest. First, we take notice of the <hi>gift of Prophecy,</hi> a clear evidence of divine inspiration, and an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary mission,<note place="margin">Rev. 19.10.</note> 
                     <hi>the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</hi> It had been for many Ages the signal and honourable priviledge of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, and that the <hi>Christian</hi> Oeconomy might challenge as sacred regards from men, and that it might appear that God had not withdrawn his Spirit from his Church in this new state of things, it was revived under the dispensation of the Gospel, according to that famous Prophecy of <hi>Joel</hi> exactly accomplished (as <hi>Peter</hi> told the <hi>Jews</hi>) upon the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> when the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost were so plentifully shed upon the Apostles and Primitive Christians;<note place="margin">Joel 2.18, 19. Act. 2.16, 17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>This is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel, It shall come to pass in the last days</hi> (saith God) <hi>I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh, and your Sons and your Daughters shall prophesie, and your young Men shall see Visions, and your old Men shall dream Dreams; and on my servants, and on my Hand-maidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesie.</hi> It lay in general in revealing and making known to others the mind of God, but discovered it self in particular instances; partly in foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling things to come, and what should certainly happen in after-times: a thing set beyond the reach of any finite understanding; for though such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as depend upon natural agents, or moral and political causes, may be

foreseen by studious and considering persons, yet the knowledge of futurities, things purely contingent, that meerly depend upon mens choice, and their mutable and uncertain wills, can only fall under his view, who at once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds things past, present, and to come. Now this was conferred upon the Apostles and some of the first Christians, as appears from many instances in the History of the <hi>Apostolick Acts,</hi> and we find the Apostles writings frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interspersed with prophetical predictions concerning the great apostasie from the faith, the universal corruption and degeneracy of manners, the rise of particular heresies, the coming of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and several another things <hi>which the spirit said expresly should come to pass in the latter times</hi>; besides that S. <hi>John</hi>'s whole Book of <hi>Revelation</hi> is almost intirely made up of Prophecies concerning the future state and condition of the Church. Sometimes by this spirit of prophecy God declared things that were of present concernment to the exigences of the Church, as when he signified to them that they should set apart <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for the conversion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and many times immediately designed particular persons to be Pastors and Governours of the Church. Thus we read of <hi>the gift that was given to Timothy by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,</hi> that is, his Ordination, to which he was particularly pointed out by some prophetick designation. But the main use of this prophetick gift in those times was to explain some of the more difficult and particular parts of the Christian doctrine, especially to expound and apply the ancient Prophecies concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi> and his Kingdom in their publick Assemblies;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.2.</note> whence the <hi>gift of prophecy</hi> is explained <hi>by understanding all mysteries, and all knowledge,</hi> that is, the most dark and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult places of Scripture, the types and figures, the ceremonies and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Old Testament. And thus we are commonly to understand those words, <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>prophesying,</hi> that so familiarly occur in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12.8.</note> 
                     <hi>whether prophecy, let us prophesie according to the proportion of faith,</hi> that is, expound Scripture according to the generally-received principles of Faith and Life. So the Apostle elsewhere prescribing Rules for the decent and orderly mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Divine worship in their publick Assemblies,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.29, 30, 31, 32.</note> 
                     <hi>let the Prophets</hi> (says he) <hi>speak two or three</hi> (that is, at the same Assembly) <hi>and let the other judge</hi>; and if while any is thus expounding, another has a Divine <hi>afflatus,</hi> whereby he is more particularly enabled to explain some difficult and emergent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, <hi>let the first hold his peace: for ye may all,</hi> all that have this gift, <hi>prophesie one by one,</hi> that so thus orderly proceeding, <hi>all may learn, and all may be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Nor can the first pretend that this interruption is an unseasonable check to his revelation, seeing he may command himself; for though among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the prophetick and ecstatick impulse did so violently press upon the inspired Person, that he could not govern himself, yet in the Church of God <hi>the spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets,</hi> may be so ruled and restrained by them, as to make way for others. This order of Christian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets considered as a distinct Ministery by it self is constantly placed next to the Apostolical Office, and is frequently by S. <hi>Paul</hi> preferred before any other spiritual Gifts then bestowed upon the Church. When this spirit of Prophecy ceased in the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, we cannot certainly finde. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued some competent time beyond the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Age. <note n="(i)" place="margin">

                  <p n="11">XI. Secondly, They had <hi>the gift of discerning spirits,</hi> whereby they were enabled to discover the truth or falshood of mens pretences, whether their gifts were real or counterfeit, and their persons truly inspired or not. For many men, acted only by diabolical impulses, might entitle themselves to Divine inspirations, and others might be imposed upon by their delusions, and mistake their dreams and fancies for the Spirits dictates and revelations; or might so subtilly and artificially counterfeit revelations, that they might with most pass for currant, especially in those times when these supernatural gifts were so common and ordinary; and our Lord himself had frequently told them that <hi>false Prophets would arise,</hi> and that many would confidently plead for themselves before him, that they had <hi>prophesied in his name.</hi> That therefore the Church might not be imposed upon, God was pleased to endue the Apostles, and it may be some others, with an immediate faculty of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Caffe from the Wheat, true from false Prophets; nay, to know when the true Prophets delivered the revelations of the Spirit, and when they expressed only their own conceptions. This was a mighty priviledge, but yet seems to me to have extended farther, to judge of the sincerity or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie of mens hearts in the profession of Religion, that so bad men being discovered, suitable censures and punishments might be passed upon them, and others cautioned to avoid them. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> at first sight discovered <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and the rotten hypocrisie of their intentions, before there was any external evidence in the case; and told <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> though baptized before upon his embracing Christianity, <hi>that his heart was not right in the sight of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 8.21, 23.</note> 
                     <hi>for I perceive</hi> (says he) <hi>that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</hi> Thirdly, the Apostles had the <hi>gift of Tongues,</hi> furnished with variety of utterance, able to speak on a sudden several Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages which they had never learnt, as occasion was administred, and the exigences of persons and Nations with whom they conversed, did require. For the Apostles being principally designed to convert the World, and to plant Christianity in all Countries and Nations; it was absolutely necessary that they should be able readily to express their minds in the Languages of those Countries to which they addressed themselves: seeing otherwise it would have been a work of time and difficulty, and not consistent with the term of the Apostles lives, had they been first to learn the different Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of those Nations, before they could have preached the Gospel to them. Hence this gift was diffused upon the Apostles in larger measures and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than upon other men;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.18.</note> 
                     <hi>I speak with Tongues more than you all,</hi> says S. <hi>Paul</hi>; that is, than all the gifted persons in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Our Lord had told the Apostles before his departure from them, <hi>that they should be endued with power from on high,</hi> which upon the day of <hi>Pentecost</hi> was particularly made good in this instance, when in a moment they were enabled to speak almost all the Languages of the then known World, and this as a specimen and first-fruits of the rest of those miraculous powers that were conferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. A fourth gift was that of <hi>Interpretation,</hi> or unfolding to others what had been delivered in an unknown tongue. For the Christian Assemblies in those days were frequently made up of men of different Nations, and who could not understand what the Apostles or others had spoken to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; this God supplied by this gift of interpretation, enabling some to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret what others did not understand, and to speak it to them in their own

native Language.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>S. Paul</hi> largely discourses the necessity of this gift in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the instructing and edifying of the Church, seeing without it their meetings could be no better than the Assembly at <hi>Babel</hi> after the confusion of Languages, where one man must needs be a <hi>Barbarian</hi> to another, and all the praying and preaching of the Minister of the Assembly be to many alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fruitless and unprofitable, and no better than a <hi>speaking into the Air.</hi> What's the speaking though with the <hi>tongue of Angels</hi> to them that do not understand it? How can the <hi>Idiot and unlearned say Amen,</hi> who understands not the language of him that giveth thanks? The duty may be done with admirable quaintness and accuracy, but what's he the better, from whom 'tis lock'd up in an unknown tongue? A consideration that made the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle solemnly profess,<note place="margin">Vers. 19.</note> that <hi>he had rather speak five words in the Church with his understanding, that by his voice he may teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. Therefore if any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be but by two, or at most by three,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 27, 28.</note> 
                     <hi>and let one interpret</hi> what the rest have spoken: <hi>but if there be no interpreter,</hi> none present able to do this, <hi>let him keep silence in the Church, and speak to himself and to God.</hi> A man that impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially reads this discourse of the Apostle, may wonder how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in defiance of it can so openly practise, so confidently defend their Bible and Divine Services in an unknown tongue, so flatly repugnant to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of common reason, the usage of the first Christian Church, and these plain Apostolical commands. But this is not the only instance wherein that Church has departed both from Scripture, Reason, and the practice of the first and purest Ages of Christianity. Indeed there is some cause why they are so zealous to keep both Scripture and their Divine Worship in a strange Language, lest by reading the one the People should become wise enough to discover the gross errors and corruptions of the other. Fifthly, The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had the <hi>gift of Healing,</hi> of curing Diseases without the arts of Physick; the most inveterate distempers being equally removable by an Almighty po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and vanishing at their speaking of a word. This begot an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary veneration for them and their Religion among the common sort of men, who, as they are strongliest moved with sensible effects, so are most taken with those miracles that are beneficial to the life of man. Hence the infinite Cures done in every place, God mercifully providing that the Body should partake with the Soul in the advantages of the Gospel, the cure of the one ushering in many times the conversion of the other. This gift was very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in those early days, bestowed not upon the Apostles only, but the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Governours of the Church,<note place="margin">Jam. 5.14, 15, 16.</note> who were wont <hi>to lay their hands upon the sick,</hi> and sometimes <hi>to anoint them with Oil</hi> (a symbolick rite in use among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to denote the grace of God) and <hi>to pray over,</hi> and for <hi>them in the name of the Lord Jesus,</hi> whereby, upon a hearty confession and forsaking of their sins, both health and pardon were at once bestowed upon them. How long this gift, with its appendant ceremony of Unction lasted in the Church, is not easie to determine; that it was in use in <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ad Scapul. c.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 71.</note> 
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, we learn from the instance he gives us of <hi>Proculus</hi> a Christian, who cured the Emperor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> by anointing him with Oil; for which the Emperor had him in great honour, and kept him with him at Court all his life; it afterwards vanishing by degrees, as all other miraculous powers, as Christianity gain'd firm foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World. As for <hi>Extreme Unction,</hi> so generally maintained and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nay, and by them made a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> I doubt it will receive very little countenance from this Primitive usage. Indeed could they as easily restore sick men to health, as they can anoint them with Oil, I think no body would contradict them; but till they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:98271:53"/>
to the one, I think it unreasonable they should use the other. The best is, though founding it upon this Apostolical practice, they have turn'd it to a quite contrary purpose, instead of recovering men to life and health, to dispose and fit them for dying, when all hopes of life are taken from them.</p>

                  <p n="14">XIV. Having seen how fitly furnished the Apostles were for the execution of their Office, let us in the last place enquire into its duration and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And here it must be considered, that in the Apostolical Office there was something extraordinary, and something ordinary. What was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary was their immediate Commission derived from the mouth of Christ himself, their unlimited charge to preach the Gospel up and down the World, without being tied to any particular places; the supernatural and miraculous powers conferr'd upon them as Apostles; their infallible guidance in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the doctrines of the Gospel; and these all expired and determined with their persons. The standing and perpetual part of it was to teach and instruct the People in the duties and principles of Religion, to administer the Sacraments, to constitute Guides and Officers, and to exercise the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and government of the Church: and in these they are succeeded by the ordinary Rulers and Ecclesiastick Guides, who were to superintend and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the affairs and offices of the Church, to the end of the World. Whence it is that Bishops and Governours came to be styled Apostles, as being their successors in ordinary; for so they frequently are in the writings of the Church.

So fatally does sin under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the greatest, the goodliest places; so certainly does God's Word take place, and not one <hi>Iota</hi> either of his promises or threatnings fall to the ground. Next to the honour that was done it by our Saviour's presence, who living most in these parts frequently resorted hither, it had nothing greater to recommend it to the notice of posterity, than that (besides some other of the Apostles) it was the Birth-place of S. <hi>Peter</hi>; a person how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable soever in his private fortunes, yet of great note and eminency, as one of the prime Embassadors of the Son of God, to whom both Sacred and Ecclesiastical stories give, though not a superiority, a precedency in the Colledge of Apostles.</p>

THE particular time of his Birth cannot be recovered, no probable footsteps or intimations being left of it: in the general we may conclude him at least Ten years elder than his Master; his married condition, and setled course of life at his first coming to <hi>Christ,</hi> and that authority and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect which the gravity of his person procured him amongst the rest of the Apostles, can speak him no less: but for any thing more particular and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive in this matter, I see no reason to affirm. Indeed might we trust the account, which one (who pretends to calculate his Nativity with ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enough) has given of it, we are told that he was born three years before the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> and just XVII. before the Incarnation of our Saviour. But let us view his account.

When I met with such a pompous train of <hi>Epocha</hi>'s, the least I expected was truth and certainty. This computation he grounds upon the date of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s death, placed (as <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ib. c.</hi> 49.</note> elsewhere he tells us) by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the LXXXVI. year of his Age; so that recounting from the year of <hi>Christ</hi> LXIX. when <hi>Peter</hi> is commonly said to have suffered, he runs up his Age to his Birth, and spreads it out into so many several dates. But alas, all is built upon a sandy bottom. For besides his mistake about the year of the World, few of his dates hold due correspondence. But the worst of it is, that after all this, <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (upon whose single testimony all this fine fabrick is erected) says no such thing, but only supposes, merely for arguments-sake, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> might very well be LXXXVI.

Certainly had humane wisdom been to manage the business, it would have taken quite other measures, and chosen out the profoundest <hi>Rabbins,</hi> the acutest <hi>Philosophers,</hi> the smoothest Orators, such as would have been most likely by strength of Reason and arts of Rhetorick to have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd over the minds of men, to grapple with the stubbornness of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and baffle the finer notions and speculations of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> We find that those <hi>Sects</hi> of Philosophy that gain'd most credit in the Heathen-world, did it this way, by their eminency in some Arts and Sciences, whereby they recommended themselves to the acceptance of the wiser and more ingenious part of mankind. <note n="*" place="margin">

Had they dealt only with the rude and the simple, the idiot and the unlearned, there might have been some pretence to suspect, that they lay in wait to deceive, and designed to impose upon the World by craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and insinuative arts and methods. But alas they had other persons to deal with, men of the acutest wits, and most profound abilities, the wisest Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, and most subtil disputants, able to weigh an argument with the greatest accuracy, and to decline the force of the strongest reasonings, and who had their parts edg'd with the keenest prejudices of education, and a mighty veneration for the Religion of their Country, a Religion that for so many Ages had governed the World, and taken firm possession of the minds of men. And yet notwithstanding all these disadvantages these plain men conquered the wise and the learned, and brought them over to that Doctrine that was despised and scorned, opposed and persecuted, and that had nothing but its own native excellency to recommend it.

and barren Earth thirsted for the showers of Heaven? It hapned that our Lord retiring out of the City, to enjoy the privacies of contemplation upon the banks of the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 5.1.</note> it was not long before the multitude found him out; to avoid the crowd and press whereof he step'd into a <hi>Ship</hi> or <hi>Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Boat,</hi> that lay near to the shore, which belonged to <hi>Peter,</hi> who together with his companions after a tedious and unsuccessful night, were gone a-shore to wash and dry their Nets. He who might have commanded, was yet pleased to intreat <hi>Peter</hi> (who by this time was returned into his Ship) to put a little from the shore. Here being sate, he taught the people, who stood along upon the shore to hear him. Sermon ended, he resolv'd to seal up his doctrine with a miracle, that the people might be the more effectually convinced, that <hi>he was a Teacher come from God.</hi> To this purpose, he had <hi>Simon</hi> lanch out further, and cast his Net into the Sea: <hi>Simon</hi> tells him, they had dont already, that they had been fishing all the last night, but in vain; and if they could not succeed then (the most proper season for that employment) there was less hope to speed now, it being probably about Noon. But because where God commands, it is not for any to argue, but obey; at our Lord's instance he let down the Net, which immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed so great a multitude of Fishes, that the Net began to break, and they were forced to call to their partners, who were in a Ship hard by them, to come in to their assistance.

So evident were the appearances of Divinity in this miracle, that he was over-powred and dazled with its brightness and lustre, and reflecting upon himself, could not but think himself unworthy the presence of so great a person, so immediately sent from God; and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his own state (Conscience being hereby more sensibly awakened) was afraid, that the Divine vengeance might pursue and overtake him. But our Lord to abate the edge of his fears, assures him that this miracle was not done to amaze and terrifie him, but to strengthen and confirm his Faith; that now he had nobler work and employment for him; instead of <hi>catching Fish,</hi> he should, by perswading men to the obedience of the Gospel, <hi>catch the Souls of men</hi>: And accordingly commanded him and his brother to follow him: (the same command which presently after he gave to the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee.</hi>) The word was no sooner spoken, and they landed, but disposing their concerns in the hands of friends (as we may presume prudent and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable men would) they immediately left all, and followed him; and from this time <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest became his constant and inseparable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, living under the rules of his Discipline and Institutions.</p>

the just number of Twelve (whereof before) it may deserve to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether our Lord being now to appoint the Supreme Officers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of his Church, which the <hi>Apostle</hi> styles the <hi>Commonwealth of Israel,</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. AMONGST these Apostles, our Lord chose a Triumvirate, <hi>Peter</hi> and the two sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> to be his more intimate companions, whom he admitted more familiarly than the rest, unto all the more secret passages and transactions of his Life.<note place="margin">Mark 5.22.</note> The first instance of which was on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <hi>Jairus,</hi> a Ruler of the Synagogue, had a daughter desperately sick, whose disease having baffled all the arts of Physick, was only curable by the immediate agency of the God of Nature. He therefore in all humility ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses himself to our Saviour; which he had no sooner done, but servants came post to tell him, that it was in vain to trouble our Lord,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98271:60"/>
for that his daughter was dead. <hi>Christ</hi> bids him not despond, if his Faith held out, there was no danger. And suffering none to follow him, but <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> goes along with him to the house; where he was derided by the sorrowful friends, and neighbours, for telling them that she was not perfectly dead. But our Lord entering in, with the commanding efficacy of two words, restor'd her at once both to life and perfect health.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. OUR Lord after this preached many Sermons, and wrought many Miracles: amongst which, none more remarkable, than his feeding a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of five thousand men,<note place="margin">Matth. 14.17.</note> besides women and children, but with five Loaves, and two Fishes; of which, nevertheless, twelve Baskets of frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were taken up. Which being done, and the multitude dismissed, he commanded the Apostles to take Ship, it being now near night, and to cross over to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> whilest he himself, as his manner was, retired to a neighbouring mountain, to dispose himself to Prayer and Contemplation. The Apostles were scarce got into the middle of the Sea, when on a sudden a violent Storm and Tempest began to arise, whereby they were brought into present danger of their lives. Our Saviour, who knew how the case stood with them, and how much they laboured under infinite pains and fears, having himself caused this Tempest, for the greater trial of their Faith, a little before morning (for so long they remained in this imminent danger) immediately conveyed himself upon the Sea, where the Waves received him, being proud to carry their Master. He who refused to gratifie the Devil, when tempting him to throw himself down from the Pinnacle of the Temple, did here commit himself to a boisterous and instable Element, and that in a violent Storm, walking upon the water, as if it had been dry ground. But that infinite power that made and supports the World, as it gave rules to all particular beings, so can when it pleaseth countermand the Laws of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and make them act contrary to their natural inclinations. If God say the word, the Sun will stand still in the middle of the Heavens; if Go back, 'twill retrocede, as upon the Dial of <hi>Ahaz:</hi> if he command it, the Heavens will become as <hi>Brass,</hi> and the Earth as <hi>Iron,</hi> and that for three years and an half together, as in the case of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s prayer; if he say to the Sea, Divide, 'twill run upon heaps, and become on both sides as firm as a wall of Marble. Nothing can be more natural, than for the fire to burn, and yet at God's command it will forget its nature, and become a screen and a fence to the three Children in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Furnace. What heavier than Iron, or more natural than for gravity to tend downwards? and yet when God will have it, Iron shall float like Cork on the top of the water. The proud and raging Sea that naturally refuses to bear the bodies of men while alive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came here as firm as Brass, when commanded to wait upon, and do homage to the God of Nature. Our Lord walking towards the Ship, as if he had an intention to pass by it, he was espied by them, who presently thought it to be the Apparition of a Spirit. Hereupon they were seiz'd with great terror and consternation, and their fears in all likelihood heightned by the vulgar opinion, that they are evil Spirits that chuse rather to appear in the night than by day. While they were in this agony, our Lord taking compassion on them, calls to them, and bids them not be afraid, for that it was no other than he himself. <hi>Peter</hi> (the eagerness of whose temper carried him forward to all bold and resolute undertakings) entreated our Lord, that if it was he, he might have leave to come upon the water to him. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his orders, he went out of the Ship, and walked upon the Sea to meet his Master. But when he found the wind to bear hard against him, and the waves to rise round about him, whereby probably the sight of Christ was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98271:60"/>
intercepted, he began to be afraid; and the higher his fears arose, the lower his Faith began to sink, and together with that, his body to sink under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: whereupon in a passionate fright he cried out to our Lord to help him, who, reaching out his arm, took him by the hand, and set him again upon the top of the water, with this gentle reproof, <hi>O thou of little Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore didst thou doubt?</hi> It being the weakness of our Faith that makes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Divine power and goodness to have no better effect upon us. Being come to the Ship, they took them in, where our Lord no sooner arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but the winds and waves observing their duty to their Sovereign Lord, and having done the errand which they came upon, mannerly departed, and vanished away, and the Ship in an instant was at the shore. All that were in the Ship being strangely astonished at this Miracle, and fully convinced of the Divinity of his person, came and did homage to him, with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, <hi>Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</hi> After which they went ashore, and landed in the Country of <hi>Genezareth,</hi> and there more fully acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him before all the people.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. THE next day great multitudes flocking after him,<note place="margin">John 6.24.</note> he entred into a Synagogue at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and taking occasion from the late Miracle of the <hi>loaves,</hi> which he had wrought amongst them, he began to discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himself, as the <hi>true Manna,</hi> and the <hi>Bread that came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; largely opening to them many of the more sublime and Spiritual my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and the necessary and important duties of the Gospel. Hereupon a great part of his Auditory, who had hitherto followed him, finding their understandings gravelled with these difficult and uncommon Notions, and that the duties he required were likely to grate hard upon them, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now that he was not the <hi>Messiah</hi> they took him for, whose Kingdom should consist in an external Grandeur and plenty, but was to be managed and transacted in a more inward and Spiritual way; hereupon fairly left him in open field, and henceforth quite turned their backs upon him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our Lord turning about to his Apostles, asked them whether <hi>they also would go away from him? Peter</hi> (spokes-man generally for all the rest) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, whither should they go to mend and better their condition? should they return back to <hi>Moses</hi>? Alas! he <hi>laid a yoke upon them, which neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear.</hi> Should they go to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees?</hi> they would feed them with <hi>Stones</hi> instead of <hi>Bread,</hi> obtrude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Traditions upon them for Divine dictates and Commands. Should they betake themselves to the <hi>Philosophers</hi> amongst the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> they were miserably blind and short-sighted in their Notions of things, and their senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and opinions not only different from, but contrary to one another. No, 'twas <hi>he only had the words of Eternal life,</hi> whose doctrine could instruct them in the plain way to Heaven; that they had fully assented to what both <hi>John</hi> and he had said concerning himself, that they were fully perswaded both from the efficacy of his Sermons, which they heard, and the powerful conviction of his Miracles, which they had seen, that he was <hi>the Son of the living God,</hi> the true <hi>Messiah</hi> and Saviour of the World. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this fair and plausible testimony, he tells them, that they were not all of this mind, that there was a <hi>Satan</hi> amongst them, one that was moved by the spirit and impulse, and that acted according to the rules and interest of the Devil: intimating <hi>Judas</hi> who should betray him. So hard is it to meet with a body of so just and pure a constitution, wherein some rotten member or distempered part is not to be found.</p>

They answered, that the Opinions of Men about him were various and different; that some took him for <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> lately risen from the dead, between whose Doctrine, Discipline, and way of life, in the main there was so great a Correspondence. That others thought he was <hi>Elias</hi>; probably judging so, from the gravity of his Person, freedom of his Preaching, the fame and reputation of his Miracles, especially since the Scriptures assured them he was not dead, but taken up into Heaven; and had so expresly foretold, that he should return back again. That others look'd upon him as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> alive again, of whose return the <hi>Jews</hi> had great expectations, in so much that some of them thought the Soul of <hi>Jeremias</hi> was re-inspired into <hi>Zacharias.</hi> Or if not thus, at least, that he was one of the more eminent of the ancient <hi>Prophets,</hi> or that the Souls of some of these Persons had been breathed into him; The Doctrine of the <gap reason="foreign">

Peter,</hi> whom our Lord had infinitely encouraged and endeared to him, by the great things which he had lately said concerning him, so that his spirits were now afloat, and his passions ready to over-run the banks, not able to endure a thought that so much evil should befall his Master, broke out into an over-confident and unseasonable interruption of him: <hi>He took him and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord, this shall not be unto thee</hi> Besides his great kindness and affection to his Master, the minds of the Apostles were not yet throughly purged from the hopes and expectations of a glorious reign of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> so that <hi>Peter</hi> could not but look upon these sufferings as unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inconsistent with the state and dignity of the Son of God. And therefore thought good to advise his Lord, to take care of himself, and while there was time to prevent and avoid them. This, our Lord, who valued the redemption of Mankind infinitely before his own ease and safety, resented at so high a rate, that he returned upon him with this tart and stinging re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan</hi>; The very same treatment which he once gave to the Devil himself,<note place="margin">Luk. 4.8.</note> when he made that insolent proposal to him, <hi>To fall down and worship him</hi>: though in <hi>Satan</hi> it was the result of pure malice and hatred; in <hi>Peter</hi> only an error of love, and great regard. However our Lord could not but look upon it as mischievous and diabolical counsel, prompted and promoted by the great Adversary of Mankind. A way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, says <hi>Christ,</hi> with thy hellish and pernicious counsel, <hi>Thou art an offence unto me,</hi> in seeking to oppose and undermine that great design, for which I purposely came down from Heaven: In this <hi>thou savourest not the things of God, but those that be of men,</hi> in suggesting to me those little shifts and arts of safety and self-preservation, which humane prudence, and the love of mens own selves are wont to dictate to them. By which, though we may learn <hi>Peter</hi>'s mighty kindness to our Saviour, yet that herein he did not take his measures right.

For while they were here
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98271:62"/>
earnestly imployed in Prayer, (as seldom did our Lord enter upon any eminent action, but he first made his address to Heaven) he was suddenly transformed into another manner of appearance; such a lustre and radiancy darted from his face, that the Sun it self shines not brighter at Noon-day; such beams of light reflected from his garments, as out-did the light it self that was round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, so exceeding pure and white, that the Snow might blush to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with it; nor could the <hi>Fullers</hi> art purifie any thing into half that white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: an evident and sensible representation of the glory of that state, wherein the <hi>just</hi> shall <hi>walk in white,</hi> and <hi>shine as the Sun in the Kingdom of the Father.</hi> During this Heavenly scene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there appeared <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> (who, as the <hi>Jews</hi> say, shall come together) clothed with all the brightness and majesty of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified state, familiarly conversing with him, and discoursing of the death and sufferings which he was shortly to undergo, and his departure into Heaven. Behold here together the three greatest persons that ever were the Ministers of Heaven: <hi>Moses,</hi> under God, the Instituter and promulgator of the Law; <hi>Elias</hi> the great reformer of it, when under its deepest degeneracy and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> the Son of God, who came to take away what was weak and imperfect and to introduce a more manly and rational institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to communicate the last Revelation which God would make of his mind to the World. <hi>Peter</hi> and the two Apostles that were with him, were in the mean time fallen asleep, heavy through want of natural rest, (it being probably night when this was done) or else over powred with these extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary appearances, which the frailty and weakness of their present stare could not bear, were fallen into a Trance. But now awaking were strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surprised to behold our Lord surrounded with so much glory, and those two great persons conversing with him, knowing who they were, probably by some particular marks and signatures that were upon them, or else by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate revelation, or from the discourse which passed betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and them, or possibly from some communication which they themselves might have with them. While these Heavenly guests were about to depart, <hi>Peter</hi> in a great rapture and ecstasie of mind addressed himself to our Saviour, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him how infinitely they were pleased and delighted with their being there; and to that purpose desiring his leave, that they might erect three <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> one for him, one for <hi>Moses,</hi> and one for <hi>Elias.</hi> While he was thus saying, a bright cloud suddenly over-shadowed the two great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and wrapt them up: out of which came a voice, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him:</hi> which when the <hi>Apostles</hi> heard, and saw the cloud coming over themselves, they were seized with a great conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and fell upon their faces to the ground, whom our Lord gently touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bad them arise and disband their fears: whereupon looking up, they saw none but their Master, the rest having vanished and disappeared.

                        <note place="margin">Matth. 17.24.</note> and asked him whether his Master was not obliged to pay the <hi>Tribute,</hi> which God, under the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, commanded to be yearly paid by every <hi>Jew</hi> above Twenty Years old, to the use of the Temple, which so continued to the times of <hi>Vespatian,</hi>

under whom the Temple being destroyed, it was by him transferred to the use of the <hi>Capitol</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> being to the value of half a <hi>Shekel,</hi> or Fifteen pence of our money. To this question of theirs, <hi>Peter</hi> positively answers, yes; knowing his Master would never be backward, either to <hi>give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, or to God the things that are God's. Peter</hi> going into the house to give an account to his Master, and to know his mind concerning it, <hi>Christ</hi> prevented him with this question, <hi>What thinkest thou, Simon, of whom do Earthly Kings exact Tribute,</hi> of their own <hi>Children</hi> and Family, or from other People? <hi>Peter</hi> answered, Not from their own <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> and Family, but from <hi>Strangers.</hi> To which our Lord presently replied, That then according to his own argument and opinion, both <hi>he</hi> himself, as being the <hi>Son</hi> of God, and <hi>they</hi> whom he had taken to be his Menial and Domestick <hi>Servants,</hi> were free from this Tax of Head-money, yearly to be paid to God. But rather than give offence, by seeming to despise the Temple, and to undervalue that Authority that had settled this Tribute, he resolves to put himself to the expence and charges of a Miracle, and therefore commanded <hi>Peter</hi> to go to the Sea, and take up the first <hi>Fish</hi> which came to his Hook, in whose mouth he should find a piece of money (a <hi>Stater,</hi> in value a <hi>Shekel</hi> or <hi>half a Crown</hi>) which he took and gave to the <hi>Collectors,</hi> both for his Master and himself.</p>

                        <hi>Peter</hi> being desirous to be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly informed in this matter, asked our Saviour, How <hi>oft</hi> a man was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to forgive his Brother, in case of offence and trespass, whether seven times were not enough? He told him, That upon his Neighbours repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he was not only bound to do it <hi>seven times,</hi> but <hi>until seventy times seven,</hi> that is, he must be indulgent to him, as oft as the offender returns and begs it, and heartily professes his sorrow and repentance. Which he further illustrates by a plain and excellent Parable, and thence draws this Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the same measures, either of <hi>compassion</hi> or <hi>cruelty,</hi> which men show to their fellow Brethren, they themselves shall meet with at the hands of God, the Supreme Ruler and Justiciary of the World.<note place="margin">Matth. 19.16.

Upon which <hi>Christ</hi> takes occasion to let them know, how hardly those men would get to Heaven, who build their comfort and happiness upon the plenty and abundance of these outward things. <hi>Peter</hi> taking hold of this opportunity, ask'd, What return they themselves should make, who had quitted and renounced whatever they had for his sake and service? Our Saviour answers, that no man should be a loser by his service; that, for their parts, they should be recompenced with far greater priviledges; and that whoever should <hi>forsake</hi> houses or lands, kindred and relations, out of love to him, and his Religion, should enjoy them again with infinite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in this World, if consistent with the circumstances of their state, and those troubles and persecutions which would necessarily arise from the profession of the Gospel: however, they should have what would make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite amends for all; <hi>Eternal life in the other World.</hi>

8. OUR Saviour in order to his last fatal journey to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that he might the better comply with the prophecy that went before of him, sent two of his Apostles, who in all probability were <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> with an Authoritative Commission to fetch him an <hi>Asse</hi> to ride on, (he had none of his own; he who <hi>was rich, for our sakes made himself poor</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 21.1.</note> he lived upon charity all his life, had neither an Asse to ride on, nor an House where to lay his head, no nor after his death a Tomb to lie in, but what the charity of others provided for him) whereon being mounted, and attended with the festivities of the people, he set forward in his journey; wherein there appears an admirable mixture of humility and Majesty: The <hi>Asse</hi> he rode on became the <hi>meanness</hi> and <hi>meekness</hi> of a Prophet; but his arbitrary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for the fetching it, and the ready obedience of its owners, spake the <hi>prerogative</hi> of a <hi>King</hi>: The <hi>Palms</hi> born before him, the <hi>Garments</hi> strew'd in his way, and the joyful <hi>Hosannahs</hi> and Acclamations of the people, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim at once both the <hi>Majesty</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>Triumph</hi> of a <hi>Saviour.</hi> For such expressions of joy we find were usual in publick and festival solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; thus the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>ALL things being now prepared, our <hi>Saviour</hi> with his Apostles comes down for the celebration of the <hi>Passeover.</hi> And being entred into the house, they all orderly took their places. Our Lord, who had always taught them by his practice, no less than by his doctrine, did now particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly design to teach them humility and charity by his own example. And that the instance might be the greater, he underwent the meanest offices of the Ministery: towards the end therefore of the <hi>Paschal</hi> Supper, he arose from the Table,<note place="margin">John 13.4.</note> and laying aside his upper garment (which, according to the fashion of those Eastern Countries, being long, was unfit for action) and himself taking a Towel, and pouring water into a Bason, he began to <hi>wash</hi> all the Apostles feet; not disdaining those of <hi>Judas</hi> himself.

What? the Master do this to the <hi>Servant?</hi> the <hi>Son of God</hi> to so vile a <hi>sinner?</hi> This made him a second time refuse it, <hi>Thou shalt never wash my feet.</hi> But our Lord soon corrects his imprudent modesty, by telling him, That <hi>if he wash'd him not, he could have no part with him:</hi> Insinuating the mystery of this action, which was to denote Remission of sin, and the purifying vertue of the Spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> to be poured upon all true Christians. <hi>Peter</hi> satisfied with this answer, soon altered his resolution, <hi>Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands, and my head.</hi> If the case be so, let me be wash'd all over, rather than come short of my portion in thee.

And then, that all this should be done by so great a person, their Lord and Master, preached to their very senses a Sermon of the greatest humility and condescension, and taught them how little reason they had to boggle at the meanest offices of kindness and charity towards others, when he himself had stoop'd to so low an abasure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. And now he began more immediately to reflect upon his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and upon him, who was to be the occasion of them; telling them that one of them would be the <hi>Traitor</hi> to betray him. Whereat they were strangely troubled, and every one began to suspect himself, till <hi>Peter</hi> (whose love and care for his Master commonly made him start sooner than the rest) made signs to S. <hi>John,</hi> who lay in our Saviour's bosom, to ask him particularly who it was? which our Saviour presently did, by making them understand, that it was <hi>Judas Iscariot,</hi> who not long after left the company.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. AND now our Lord began the Institution of his <hi>Supper,</hi> that great solemn Institution which he was resolved to leave behind him, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly celebrated in all Ages of the Church, as the standing monument of his love in dying for mankind. For now he told them, that he himself must leave them, and that <hi>whither he went, they could not come. Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 13.36. Luke 22.31.</note> not well understanding what he meant, asked him whither it was that he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Our Lord replied, It was to that place, whither he could not now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: but that he should do it afterwards: intimating the Martyrdom he was to undergo for the sake of <hi>Christ.</hi> To which <hi>Peter</hi> answered, that he knew no reason why he might not follow him, seeing that if it was even to the laying down of his life for his sake, he was most ready and resolved to do it. Our Lord liked not this over-confident presumption, and therefore told him, they were great things which he promised, but that he took not the true measures of his own strength, nor espied the snares and designs of <hi>Satan,</hi> who desired no better an occasion than this, to <hi>sift</hi> and <hi>winnow</hi> them. But that he had prayed to Heaven for him, <hi>That his faith might not fail</hi>: by which means being strengthened himself, he should be obliged to strengthen and confirm his brethren.

                        </gap>, his Soul was shaken with a vehement commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yea, he was <hi>in an Agony,</hi> a word by which the <hi>Greeks</hi> are wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the greatest conflicts and anxieties. The effect of all which was, that <hi>he prayed more earnestly,</hi> offering up <hi>prayers and supplications with strong cries and tears,</hi> as the Apostle expounds it, and sweat, <hi>as it were, great drops of bloud falling to the ground.</hi> What this bloudy sweat was, and how far na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or extraordinary, I am not now concerned to enquire. Certain it is, it was a plain evidence of the most intense grief and sadness: for if an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme fear or trouble will many times cast us into a cold sweat, how great must be the commotion and conflict of our Saviour's mind, which could force open the pores of his body, lock'd up by the coldness of the night, and make not drops of sweat, but <hi>great drops,</hi> or (as the word <gap reason="foreign">

While our Lord was thus contending with these Ante-Passions, the three Apostles, whom he had left at some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from him, being tired out with watching, and disposed by the silence of the Night, were fallen fast asleep. Our Lord, who had made three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral addresses unto Heaven, that if it might consist with his <hi>Father</hi>'s will, this bitter <hi>Cup might pass from him,</hi> (expressing herein the harmless and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent desires of humane Nature, which always studies its own preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) between each of them came to visit the Apostles, and calling to <hi>Peter,</hi> asked him, <hi>Whether they could not watch with him one hour?</hi> advising them <hi>to watch and pray, that they enter'd not into temptation,</hi> adding this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That <hi>the spirit indeed was willing, but that the flesh was weak,</hi>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:98271:65"/>
and that therefore there was the more need that they should stand upon their guard. Observe here the incomparable sweetness, the generous candor of our blessed Saviour, to pass so charitable a censure upon an action, from whence malice and ill-nature might have drawn monsters and prodigies, and have represented it black as the shades of darkness. The request which our Lord made to these Apostles, was infinitely reasonable, to <hi>watch</hi> with him in this <hi>bitter Agony,</hi> their company at least being some refreshment to one, under such sad fatal circumstances; and this but for a little time, <hi>one hour,</hi> it would soon be over, and then they might freely consult their own ease and safety: 'Twas their dear Lord and Master, whom they now were to attend upon, ready to lay down his life for them, sweating already under the first skirmishes of his sufferings, and expecting every moment when all the powers of darkness would fall upon him. But all these considerations were drown'd in a profound security, the men were fast asleep, and though often awakened and told of it, regarded it not, as if nothing but ease and softness had been then to be dream'd of. An action that look'd like the most prodigious ingratitude, and the highest unconcernedness for their Lord and Master, and which one would have thought had argued a very great cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and indifferency of affection towards him. But he would not set it upon the Tenters, nor stretch it to what it might easily have been drawn to: he imputes it not to their unthankfulness, or want of affection, nor to their carelesness of what became of him, but merely to their infirmity and the weakness of their bodily temper, himself making the excuse, when they could make none for themselves, <hi>the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</hi> Hereby teaching us, to put the most candid and favourable constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon those actions of others, which are capable of various interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and rather with the Bee to suck honey, than with the Spider to draw poison from them. His last Prayer being ended, he came to them, and told them with a gentle rebuke, That now they might <hi>sleep on</hi> if they pleased, that <hi>the hour was at hand, that he should be betrayed, and delivered into the hands of men.</hi>

WHILE he was thus discoursing to them, a <hi>Band of Souldiers</hi> sent from the <hi>High-Priests,</hi> with the Traitor <hi>Judas</hi> to conduct and direct them, rush'd into the Garden, and seized upon him: which when the Apostles saw, they asked him whether they should attempt his rescue. <hi>Peter</hi> (whose ungovernable zeal put him upon all dangerous undertakings) without stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an answer, drew his Sword, and espying one more busie than the rest in laying hold upon our Saviour, which was <hi>Malchus</hi> (who, though carrying <hi>Kingship</hi> in his name, was but <hi>Servant</hi> to the <hi>High-Priest</hi>) struck at him, with an intention to dispatch him: but God over-ruling the stroak, it only cut off his right Ear. Our Lord liked not this wild and unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table zeal, and therefore intreated their patience, whilest he miraculously healed the Wound. And turning to <hi>Peter,</hi> bad him put up his Sword again; told him, that they who unwarrantably use the Sword, should themselves perish by it; that there was no need of these violent and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant courses; that if he had a mind to be rid of his Keepers, he could ask his Father, who would presently send more than twelve Legions of <hi>Angels</hi> to his rescue and deliverance: But he must <hi>drink the Cup</hi> which his Father had put into his hand: for how else should the <hi>Scriptures</hi> be fulfilled, which had expresly foretold, <hi>That these things must be?</hi> Whereupon, all the Apostles forsook him, and fled from him; and they who before in their promises were as <hi>bold as Lions,</hi> now it came to it, like fearful and timorous <hi>Hares,</hi> ran away from him: <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> though staying last with him, yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

NO sooner was he apprehended by the Souldiers, and brought out of the Garden, but he was immediately posted from one Tribunal to another, brought first to <hi>Annas,</hi> then carried to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> where the <hi>Jewish Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi> met together in order to his Trial and Condemnation. <hi>Peter</hi> having a little recovered himself, and gotten loose from his fears, probably encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by his Companion S. <hi>John,</hi> returns back to seek his Master: And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them leading him to the High-Priests <hi>Hall,</hi> followed afar off, to see what would be the event and issue. But coming to the Door, could get no admittance, till one of the Disciples who was acquainted there, went out and perswaded the Servant, who kept the Door, to let him in. Being let into the <hi>Hall,</hi> where the Servants and Officers stood round the Fire, <hi>Peter</hi> also came thither to warm himself, where being espied by the <hi>Servant-maid</hi> that let him in, she earnestly looking upon him, charged him with being one of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Disciples; which <hi>Peter</hi> publickly denied before all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, positively affirming, that <hi>he knew him not</hi>; And presently withdrew himself into the Porch, where he heard the <hi>Cock crow:</hi> An intimation, which one would have thought should have awakened his Conscience into a quick sense of his duty, and the promise he had made unto his Master.

Nay, not only gave this evidence, but added, that he himself had seen him with <hi>Jesus</hi> in the Garden. <hi>Peter</hi> still resolutely denied the matter, and to add the highest accomplishment to his sin, ratified it not only with an <hi>Oath,</hi> but a solemn <hi>Curse</hi> and execration, that <hi>he was not the person,</hi> that <hi>he knew not the man.</hi> 'Tis but a very weak excuse, which <note n="*" place="margin">

bewailing his folly, and the aggravations of his sin; thereby endeavouring to make some reparation for his fault, and recover himself into the favour of Heaven, and to prevent the execution of Divine Justice, by taking a severe revenge upon himself: by these penitential tears he endeavoured to wash off his guilt; as indeed Repentance is the next step to Innocence.</p>

No doubt he stayed at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and probably with S. <hi>John,</hi> together with whom we first find him mentioned, when both setting forwards to the Sepulchre: which was in this manner. Early on that Morning, whereon our Lord was to return from the Grave,<note place="margin">Mark 16.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> and some other devout and pious Women brought Spices and Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with a design to Imbalm the Body of our crucified Lord. Coming to the Sepulchre at Sun-rising, and finding the Door open, they entred in, where they were suddenly saluted by an Angel, who told them, that <hi>Jesus</hi> was risen, and bad them go and acquaint his Apostles, and particularly <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that he was returned from the dead; and that he would go before them into <hi>Galilee,</hi> where they should meet with him. Hereupon they returned back, and acquainted the Apostles with what had passed, who beheld the story as the product of a weak frighted fancy. But <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> presently hastned towards the Garden; <hi>John</hi> being the younger and nimbler,<note place="margin">Luke 24.12. John 20.2.</note> out-ran his Companion, and came first thither, where he only looked, but entred not in, either out of fear in himself, or a great Reverence to our Saviour, <hi>Peter,</hi> though behind in space, was before in zeal, and being elder and more considerate, came and resolutely entred in, where they found nothing but the <hi>Linnen Clothes</hi> lying together in one place, and the <hi>Napkin</hi> that was about his Head wrapped together in another; which being disposed with so much care and order, shewed (what was falsly suggested by the <hi>Jews</hi>) that our Saviour's Body was not taken away by Thieves, who are wont more to consult their escape, than how to leave things orderly disposed behind them.</p>

THE same Day about Noon we may suppose it was, that our Lord himself appeared alone to <hi>Peter</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.5.</note> being assured of the thing, though not so precisely of the time. That he did so, S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly tells us; and so did the Apostles the two Disciples that came from <hi>Emmaus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 24.34.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord is risen, and hath appeared unto Simon:</hi> which probably intimates, that it was before his appearing to those two Disciples. And indeed we cannot but think that our Lord would hasten the manifestation of himself to him, as compassiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his case, being overwhelmed with sorrow for the late shameful denial of his Master: and was therefore willing in the first place to honour him with his presence, at once to confirm him in the Article of his Resurrection, and to let him see, that he was restored to the place which before he had in his grace and favour. S. <hi>Paul</hi> mentioning his several appearances after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, seems to make this the first of them, <hi>That he was seen of Cephas.</hi> Not that it was simply the first, for he first appeared to the <hi>Women.</hi> But as <note n="*" place="margin">

He also adds several probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, why our Lord first discovered himself to <hi>Peter</hi>: As, that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a more than ordinary firmness and resolution of mind, to be able to bear such a sight: For they who beheld him after others had seen him, and had heard their frequent Testimonies and Reports, had had their Faith greatly prepared and encouraged to entertain it; But he who was to be honoured with the first appearance had need of a bigger, and more undaunted Faith, left he should be over-born, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, with such a strange and unwonted sight: That <hi>Peter</hi> was the first that had made a signal confession of his Master, and therefore it was fit and reasonable, that he should first see him alive after his Resurrection: That <hi>Peter</hi> had lately <hi>denied</hi> his Lord, the grief whereof lay hard upon him, that therefore our Saviour was willing to administer some consolation to him, and as soon as might be to let him see, that he had not cast him off; like the kind <hi>Samaritan,</hi> he made haste to help him, and to pour Oil into his wounded Conscience.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. SOME time after this, the Apostles began to resolve upon their journey into <hi>Galilee,</hi> as he himself had commanded them. If it be enquired why they went no sooner, seeing this was the first message and intimation, they had received from him; <note n="‖" place="margin">

They went, as we may suppose, in several Companies, lest going all in one Body, they should awaken the power and malice of their enemies, and alarm the care and vigilancy of the state, which by reason of the Noise that our Saviour's Trial and Execution had made up and down the City and Country,<note place="margin">John 21.1.</note> was yet full of jealousies and fears. We find <hi>Peter, Thomas, Nathanael,</hi> and the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> and two more of the Disciples arrived at some Town about the <hi>Sea of Tiberias</hi>: Where, the Providence of God guiding the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of their employment, <hi>Peter</hi> accompanied with the rest, returns to his old Trade of Fishing. They laboured all Night, but caught nothing. Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Morning a grave Person, probably in the habit of a Traveller, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents himself upon the shore: And calling to them, asked them whether they had any meat: When they told him, No; He advised them to cast the Net on the <hi>right</hi> side of the Ship, that so the Miracle might not seem to be the effect of chance, and they should not fail to speed. They did so, and the Net presently inclosed so great a draught, that they were scarce able to drag

it a shore. S. <hi>John</hi> amazed with the strangeness of the matter, told <hi>Peter</hi> that surely this must be <hi>the Lord,</hi> whom the Winds and the Sea, and all the Inhabitants of that watry Region were so ready to obey. <hi>Peter</hi>'s zeal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently took fire, notwithstanding the coldness of the Season, and impatient of the least moments being kept from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his dear Lord and Master,<note place="margin">— <gap reason="foreign">

Landing, they found a Fire ready made, and Fish laid upon it, either immediately created by his Divine power, or which came to the shore of its own accord, and offered it self to his hand. Which notwithstanding, he commands them to bring of the Fish which they had lately caught, and prepare it for their Dinner, He himself dining with them; both that he might give them an instance of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love and fellowship, and also assure them of the truth of his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, since his return from the dead.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. DINNER being ended, our Lord more particularly addressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Peter</hi>; urging him to the utmost diligence in his care of Souls: and because he knew, that nothing but a mighty love to himself could carry him through the troubles and hazards of so dangerous and difficult an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; an employment attended with all the impediments, which either the perversness of men, or the malice and subtilty of the Devil could cast in the way to hinder it; therefore he first enquired of him, whether he loved him more than the <hi>rest</hi> of the Apostles, herein mildly reproving his former over-confident resolution, that <hi>though all the rest should deny him, yet would not he deny him. Peter</hi> modestly replyed, not censuring others, much less preferring himself before them, that our Lord knew the integrity of his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.

To each of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions our Lord added this signal trial of his affection; then, <hi>Feed my sheep,</hi> that is, faithfully instruct and teach them, carefully rule and guide them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, not compel them, feed, not fleece, nor kill them. And so 'tis plain <hi>S. Peter</hi> himself understood it, by the charge which he gives to the Guides and Rulers of the Church, that <hi>they should feed the Flock of God, taking the over-sight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind: Neither as being Lords over God's heritage, but as examples to the flock.</hi> But that <hi>by feeding Christ's Sheep and Lambs,</hi> here commended to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> should be meant an universal and uncontrollable Monarchy and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the whole Christian Church, and that over the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Successors in ordinary, and this power and supremacy solely invested in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and those who were to succeed him in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> is so wild an inference, and such a melting down words to run into any shape, as could never with any face have been offered, or been possible to have been imposed upon the belief of mankind, if men had not first subdued their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to their interest, and captivated both to an implicite faith and a blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.

yet the very same power in equivalent terms is elsewhere indifferently granted to all the Apostles, and in some measure to the ordinary Pastors and Governours of the Church: As when our Lord told them, That <hi>all power was given him in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> by vertue whereof <hi>they should go teach and baptize all Nations,</hi> and <hi>preach the Gospel to every Creature:</hi> That <hi>they should feed God's flock, Rule well,</hi> inspect and <hi>watch over</hi> those over whom they had the Authority and the Rule.

                     <p n="5">5. OUR Lord having thus engaged <hi>Peter</hi> to a chearful compliance with the dangers that might attend the discharge and execution of his Office, now particularly intimates to him what that fate was that should attend him: tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that though when he was young he girt himself, lived at his own pleasure, and went whither he pleased; yet when he was old, he should stretch forth his hands, and another should gird and bind him, and lead him whither he had no mind to go: intimating, as the <hi>Evangelist</hi> tells us, <hi>by what death he should glorifie God,</hi> that is, by Crucifixion, the Martyrdom which he afterward underwent. And then rising up, commanded him to follow him; by this bodily attendance mystically implying his conformity to the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> that he should follow him in dying for the truth and testimony of the Gospel. It was not long after,<note place="margin">Acts 1.8. Luke 24.49.</note> that our Lord appeared to them to take his last farewell of them, when leading them out unto <hi>Bethany,</hi> a little Village upon the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> he briefly told them, That they were the persons, whom he had chosen to be the <hi>witnesses</hi> both of his Death and Resurrection; a testimony which they should bear to him in all parts of the World: In order to which he would after his Ascension pour out his <hi>Spirit</hi> upon them in larger measures, than they had hitherto received, that they might be the better fortified to grapple with that violent rage and fury, wherewith both Men and Devils would endeavour to oppose them; and that in the mean time they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and stay till these miraculous powers were from on high conferred upon them. His discourse being ended, laying his hands upon them, he gave them his solemn blessing; which done, he was immediately taken from them, and being attended with a glorious guard and train of <hi>Angels,</hi> was received up into Heaven. <note n="*" place="margin">

Here the Church being met, to the number of about CXX, <hi>Peter,</hi> as Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Assembly,<note place="margin">Acts 1.15.</note> put them in mind, that <hi>Judas,</hi> one of our Lord's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, being betrayed by his own covetous and insatiable mind, had lately fallen from the honour of his place and ministery: that this was no more than what the <hi>Prophet</hi> had long since foretold should come to pass, and that the rule and over-sight in the Church, which had been committed unto him, should be devolved upon another: that therefore it was highly necessary, that one should be substituted in his room, and especially such a one as had been fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly conversant with our Saviour, from first to last, that so he might be a competent <hi>witness</hi> both of his doctrine and miracles, his life and death, but especially of his Resurrection from the dead. For seeing no evidence is so valid and satisfactory, as the testimony of an eye-witness, the Apostles all along mainly insisted upon this, that they delivered no other things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Saviour to the World, than what they themselves had seen and heard. And seeing his rising from the Dead was a principle likely to meet with a great deal of opposition, and which would hardliest gain belief and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment with the minds of men, therefore they principally urg'd this at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turn, that <hi>they were eye-witnesses of his Resurrection,</hi> that they had seen, felt, eaten, and familiarly conversed with him after his return from the Grave. That therefore such an Apostle might be chosen, two <hi>Candidates</hi> were propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>Joseph</hi> called <hi>Barsabas,</hi> and <hi>Matthias.</hi> And having prayed, that the Divine Providence would immediately guide and direct the choice, they cast lots, and the lot fell upon <hi>Matthias,</hi> who was accordingly admitted into the number of the twelve Apostles.</p>

Thus as the confounding of Languages became a curse to the old World, separating men from all mutual offices of kindness and commerce, rendring one part of Mankind Barbarians to another: so here the multiplying several Languages became a blessing, being intended as the means to bring men of all Nations <hi>into the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,</hi> into the fellowship of that Religion, that would banish discords, cement differences, and unite mens hearts in the bond of peace.

The word was no sooner said, than the thing was done: Immediately the Nerves and Sinews were enlarged, and the Joynts returned to their proper use. The man standing up went into the <hi>Temple</hi> walking, leaping, and praising God. The beholding so sudden and extraordinary a Cure begot great admiration in the minds of the People, whose curiosity drew them to the Apostles to see those who had been the Authors of it. Which <hi>Peter</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of, began to discourse to them to this effect; That there was no reason they should wonder at them, as if by their own skill and art they had wrought this Cure, it being intirely done in the Name of their crucified Master, by the Power of that very <hi>Christ,</hi> that Holy and Just Person, whom they themselves had denied and delivered up to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and preferred a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel and a Murtherer before him, when his Judge was resolved to acquit him: and that though they had put him to death, yet that they were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that God had raised him up again, and that He was gone to Heaven, where he must remain till the times of the General Restitution: That he presumed that this in them, as also in their Rulers, was in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the effect of ignorance, and the not being throughly convinced of the Greatness and Divinity of his Person; which yet God made use of for the bringing about his Wise and Righteous Designs, the accomplishing of what he had foretold concerning <hi>Christ</hi>'s Person and Sufferings, by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and all the holy <hi>Prophets which had been since the World began:</hi> That therefore it was now high time for them to repent, and turn to God, that their great wickedness might be expiated, and that when <hi>Christ</hi> should shortly come in Judgment upon the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, it might be a time of comfort and refreshing to them, what would be of vengeance and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to other men: that they were the peculiar persons, to whom the blessings of the promises did primarily appertain, and unto whom God in the first place sent his Son, that he might derive his blessing upon them by <hi>turning them away from their iniquities.</hi> While <hi>Peter</hi> was thus discoursing to the People in one place, we may suppose that <hi>John</hi> was preaching to them in another; and the success was answerable. The Apostles cast out the seed, and <hi>God</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>gave the increase.</hi> There being by this means no fewer than <hi>Five Thousand</hi> brought over to the Faith:<note place="margin">Acts 4.4.</note> though 'tis possible the whole Body of Believers might be comprehended in that Number.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

The next Day they were convented before the <hi>Jewish Sanhedrim</hi>; and being asked by what Power and Authority they had done this; <hi>Peter</hi> resolutely answered, That as to the Cure done to this impotent Person, Be it known to them and all the <hi>Jews,</hi> that it was perfectly wrought in the Name of that <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom they themselves had crucified, and God had raised from the dead, and whom, though they had thrown him by as waste and rubbish, yet, God had made <hi>head of the corner</hi>; and that there was no other way, wherein they, or others, could expect salvation, but by this crucified Saviour.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98271:71"/>
Great was the boldness of the Apostles, admired by the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> it self, in this matter; especially if we consider, that this probably was the very Court that had so lately sentenced and condemned their Master, and being fleshed in such sanguinary proceedings, had no other way but to go on and justifie one cruelty with another: that the Apostles did not say these things in corners, and behind the curtain, but to their very faces, and that in the open Court of Judicature, and before all the people: That the Apostles had not been used to plead in such publick places, nor had been polished with the Arts of education, but were ignorant unlearned men, known not to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the study of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. THE <hi>Council</hi> (which all this while had beheld them with a kind of wonder, and now remembred that they had been the companions and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of the late crucified <hi>Jesus</hi>) commanded them to withdraw, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated amongst themselves what they should do with them.

All authority is originally derived from God, and our duty to him may not be superseded by the Laws of any Authority deriving from him: and even <hi>Socrates</hi> himself in a parallel instance, when perswaded to leave off his excellent way of institution and instructing youth, and to comply with the humour of his <hi>Athenian</hi> Judges to save his life, returned this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that <hi>indeed he loved and honoured the Athenians; but yet resolved to obey God, rather than them.</hi> An answer almost the same both in substance and words, with that which was here given by our Apostles. In all other cases where the Laws of the Magistrate did not interfere with the commands of <hi>Christ,</hi> none more loyal, more compliant than they. As indeed no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World ever secured the interests of Civil authority like the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gospel. It positively charges <hi>every soul</hi> of what rank or condition soever <hi>to be subject to the higher powers,</hi> as a Divine <hi>ordinance</hi> and institution, and that <hi>not for wrath only, but for conscience-sake</hi>; it <hi>puts men in mind to be subject to Principalities and Powers, and to obey Magistrates, to submit to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordinance of man for the Lords sake, both to the King as supreme, and unto Governours as unto them that are sent by him: for so is the will of God.</hi> So far is it from allowing us to violate their persons, that it suffers us not boldly to censure their actions, <hi>to revile the Gods, despise Dominions, and speak evil of Dignities,</hi> or to vilifie and injure them so much, as by a dishonourable thought; commanding us when we cannot obey, to suffer the most rigorous penalties imposed upon us with calmness, and <hi>to possess our souls in patience.</hi> Thus when these two Apostles were shortly after again summoned before the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98271:71"/>
Council, commanded no more to Preach the Christian Doctrine, and to be scourged for what they had done already, though they could not <hi>obey</hi> the one, they chearfully <hi>submitted</hi> to the other without any peevish or tart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, but went away rejoycing. But what the carriage of Christians was in this matter in the first and best ages of the Gospel, we have in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place sufficiently discovered to the World. <note place="margin">

Nor do we find that the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> did except against the Plea. At least whatever they thought, yet not daring to punish them for fear of the People, they only threatned them, and let them go: who thereupon presently return'd to the rest of the Apostles and Believers.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Church exceedingly multiplied by these means: And that so great a Company (most whereof were poor) might be maintained, they generally sold their Estates, and brought the Money to the Apostles, to be by them deposited in one common Treasury, and thence distributed according to the several exigences of the Church: which gave occasion to this dreadful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.<note place="margin">Acts 5.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Ananias</hi> and his Wife <hi>Saphira</hi> having taken upon them the profession of the Gospel, according to the free and generous spirit of those times, had consecrated and devoted their Estate to the honour of God, and the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church. And accordingly sold their Possessions, and turned them into Money. But as they were willing to gain the reputation of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Persons, so were they loth wholly to cast themselves upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, by letting go all at once, and therefore privately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held part of what they had devoted, and bringing the rest, laid it at the Apostles feet: hoping herein they might deceive the Apostles, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately guided by the Spirit of God. But <hi>Peter</hi> at his first coming in, treated <hi>Ananias</hi> with these sharp enquiries; Why he would suffer <hi>Satan</hi> to fill his heart with so big a wickedness, as by keeping back part of his estate, to think to <hi>deceive the Holy Ghost?</hi> That before it was sold, it was wholly at his own disposure; and after, it was perfectly in his own power fully to have performed his vow: So that it was capable of no other interpretation, than that herein he had not only abused and injured men, but mocked God, and, what in him lay, <hi>lyed</hi> to, and cheated the Holy Ghost; who, he knew, was privy to the most secret thoughts and purposes of his heart. This was no sooner said, but suddenly to the great terror and amazement of all that were present, <hi>Ananias</hi> was arrested with a stroke from Heaven, and fell down dead to the ground. Not long after his Wise came in, whom <hi>Peter</hi> entertained with the same severe reproofs, wherewith he had done her Husband, adding, that the like sad fate and doom should immediately seize upon her, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon dropt down dead: As she had been Copartner with him in the Sin, becoming sharer with him in the punishment. An instance of great severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, filling all that heard of it with fear and terror, and became a seasonable prevention of that hypocrisie and dissimulation, wherewith many might possibly think to have imposed upon the Church.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. THIS severe Case being extraordinary, the Apostles usually exerted their power in such Miracles as were more useful and beneficial to the World: Curing all manner of Diseases, and dispossessing Devils:<note place="margin">Acts 5.12.</note> In so much that they brought the Sick into the Streets, and laid them upon Beds and Couches, that at least <hi>Peter</hi>'s shadow, as he passed by, might come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. These astonishing Miracles could not but mightily contribute

                        <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his reflection here is not unseasonable; that no honour or soveraignty, no power or dignity was comparable to this glory of the Apostle; that the things of <hi>Christ,</hi> though in another way, were more noble and excellent, than any thing that this World could afford. And therefore he tells us, that when he beheld the state and magnificence wherewith <hi>Pope Julius the Second</hi> appeared first at <hi>Bononia,</hi> and then at <hi>Rome,</hi> equalling the triumphs of a <hi>Pompey,</hi> or a <hi>Caesar</hi>; he could not but think how much all this was below the greatness and majesty of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who converted the World, not by Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Armies, not by Engines, or artifices of pomp and grandeur, but by Faith in the power of <hi>Christ,</hi> and drew it to the admiration of himself: and the same state (<hi>says he</hi>) would no doubt attend the Apostles Successors, were they Men of the same temper and holiness of life. The <hi>Jewish</hi> Rulers alarm'd with this News, and awakened with the growing numbers of the Church, sent to apprehend the Apostles, and cast them into Prison. But God who is never wanting to his own cause, sent that Night an <hi>Angel</hi> from Heaven to open the Prison doors, commanding them to repair to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and to the exercise of their Ministery. Which they did early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and there taught the People. How unsuccessful are the projects of the wisest Statesmen, when God frowns upon them! how little do any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels against Heaven prosper! In vain is it to shut the doors, where God is resolved to open them; the firmest Bars, the strongest Chains cannot hold, where once God has designed and decreed our liberty. The Officers return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next Morning, found the Prison shut and guarded, but the Prisoners gone: Wherewith they acquainted the <hi>Council,</hi> who much wondred at it: but being told where the Apostles were, they sent to bring them without any noise or violence before the <hi>Sanhedrim:</hi> where the High-Priest asked them, how they durst go on to propagate that Doctrine which they had so strictly commanded them not to preach? <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of the rest told them, That they must in this case <hi>obey God rather than men</hi>: That though they had so barbarously and contumeliously treated the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> yet that God had raised him up, and exalted him to be a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>Saviour</hi> to <hi>give</hi> both <hi>repentance and remission of sins</hi>: That they were witnesses of these things, and so were those Miraculous Powers which the Holy Ghost conferred upon all true Christians. Vexed was the <hi>Council</hi> with this Answer, and began to consider how to cut them off. But <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a grave and learned Senator, having commanded the Apostles to withdraw, bad the <hi>Council</hi> take heed what they did to them; putting them in mind, that several persons had heretofore raised parties and factions, and drawn vast Numbers after them; but that they had miscarried, and they and their designs come to nought: that therefore they should do well to let these men alone: that if their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and designs were merely humane, they would in time of themselves fall to the ground; but if they were of God, it was not all their power and policies would be able to defeat and overturn them: and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves would herein appear to oppose the counsels and designs of Heaven. With this prudent and rational advice they were satisfied; and having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Apostles to be scourged, and charged them no more to preach this doctrine, restored them to their liberty. Who notwithstanding this charge and threatning returned home in a kind of triumph, that they were accounted worthy to suffer in so good a cause, and to undergo shame and

This man hearing the Sermons, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miracles that were done by <hi>Philip,</hi> gave up himself amongst the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of believers, and was baptized with them. The Apostles, who yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> having heard of the great success of <hi>Philip</hi>'s ministery at <hi>Samaria,</hi> thought good to send some of their number to his assistance. And accordingly deputed <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who came thither. Where having prayed for, and laid their hands upon these new converts, they presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghost. <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Magician</hi> observing, that by laying on of the Apostle's hands, miraculous gifts were conferred upon men, offered them a considerable summ of money to invest him with this power, that on whom he laid his hands they might receive the Holy Ghost. <hi>Peter</hi> perceiving his rotten and insincere intentions, rejected his impious motion with scorn and detestation: <hi>Thy money perish with thee.</hi> He told him that his heart was naught and hypocritical; that he could have no share nor portion in so great a priviledge; that it more concerned him to repent of so great a wickedness, and sincerely seek to God, that so the thought of his heart might be forgiven him; for that he perceived that he had a very vicious and corrupt temper and constitution of mind, and was as yet bound up under a very wretched and miserable state, displeasing to God, and dangerous to himself. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the man was a little startled with this, and he prayed the Apostles to intercede with Heaven, that God would pardon his sin, and that none of these things might fall upon him. But how little cure this wrought upon him, we shall find elsewhere, when we shall again meet with him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The Apostles having thus confirmed the Church at <hi>Samaria,</hi> and preached up and down in the Villages thereabouts, returned back to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to joyn their counsel and assistance to the rest of the Apostles.</p>

THE storm, though violent, being at length blown over, the Church enjoyed a time of great calmness and serenity: during which <hi>Peter</hi> went out to visit the Churches lately planted in those parts by those Disciples who had been dispersed by the persecution at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

A miracle that was not confined only to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for being known abroad generally brought over the Inhabitants of that place. The fame of this miracle having flown to <hi>Joppa,</hi> a Sea-port Town, some six miles thence; the Christians there presently sent for <hi>Peter</hi> upon this occasion. <hi>Tabitha,</hi> whose <hi>Greek</hi> name was <hi>Dorcas,</hi> a woman venerable for her piety and diffusive charity, was newly dead, to the great lamentation of all good men, and much more to the loss of the poor that had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by her. <hi>Peter</hi> coming to the house, found her dressed up for her Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral solemnity, and compassed about with the sorrowful Widows, who shewed the Coats and Garments wherewith she had clothed them, the badges of her charitable liberality. <hi>Peter</hi> shutting all out, kneeled down and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then turning him to the body, commanded her to arise, and lifting

her up by the hand, presented her in perfect health to her friends, and those that were about her: by which he confirmed many, and converted more to the Faith. After which he staid some considerable time at <hi>Joppa,</hi> lodging in the house of <hi>Simon</hi> a <hi>Tanner.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. WHILE he abode in this City,<note place="margin">Acts 10.9.</note> retiring one morning to the house-top to pray, (as the <hi>Jews</hi> frequently did, having thence a free and open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect towards <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Temple) it being now near Noon, which was the conclusion of one of their stated times of Prayer, he found himself hungry, and called for meat: but while it was preparing he himself fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Trance, wherein was presented to him a large sheet let down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, containing all sorts of Creatures, clean and unclean; a voice at the same time calling to him, that he should rise, kill freely, and indifferently feed upon them; <hi>Peter</hi> tenacious as yet of the Rites and Institutions of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, rejoyn'd, That he could not do it, having never eaten any thing that was common or unclean. To which the voice replied, That what God had cleansed he should not account or call common. Which being done thrice, the Vessel was again taken up into Heaven, and the Vision pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently disappeared. By this symbolick representment, though <hi>Peter</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent knew not what to make of it, God was teaching him a new lesson, and preparing him to go upon an Errand and Embassy, which the Spirit at the same time expresly commanded him to undertake. While he was in this doubtful posture of mind, three messengers knock'd at the door, enquiring for him, from whom he received this account: That <hi>Cornelius</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a Band of <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> a person of great Piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (being a <hi>Proselyte</hi> of the <hi>Gate,</hi> who though not observing an exact conformity to the Rites of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, did yet maintain some general correspondence with it, and lived under the obligation of the <hi>seven Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Noah</hi>) had by an immediate command from God sent for him. The next day <hi>Peter</hi> accompanied with some of the Brethren, went along with them, and the day after they came to <hi>Caesarea.</hi> Against whose arrival <hi>Cornelius</hi> had summoned his friends and kindred to his house. <hi>Peter</hi> arriving, <hi>Cornelius</hi> (who was affected with a mighty reverence for so great a Person) fell at his Feet, and worshipped him: a way of address frequent in those <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi> Countries towards Princes and great men, but by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> appropriated as a peculiar honour to the Gods. <hi>Peter</hi> rejecting the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as due only to God, entred into the house, where he first made his Apology to the Company, that though they could not but know, that it was not lawful for a <hi>Jew</hi> to converse in the duties of Religion with those of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation, yet that now God had taught him another lesson. And then proceeded particularly to enquire the reason of <hi>Cornelius</hi> his sending for him. Whereupon <hi>Cornelius</hi> told him, That four days since, being conversant in the duties of Fasting and Prayer, an Angel had appeared to him, and told him, that his Prayers and Alms were come up for a memorial before God, that he should send to <hi>Joppa</hi> for one <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> who lodged in a Tanner's house by the Sea side, who should further make known his mind to him; that accordingly he had sent, and being now come, they were there met to hear what he had to say to them. Where we see, that though God sent an <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>Cornelius</hi> to acquaint him with his will, yet the Angel was only to direct him to the Apostle for instruction in the Faith; which no doubt was done, partly that God might put the greater honour upon an institution, that was likely to meet with contempt and scorn enough from the World; partly to let us see, that we are not to expect extraordinary and miraculous ways of teaching and information, where God affords ordinary means.</p>

While <hi>Peter</hi> was thus preaching to them, the Holy Ghost fell upon a great part of his Auditory, enabling them to speak several Languages, and therein to magnifie the giver of them. Whereat the <hi>Jews,</hi> who came along with <hi>Peter,</hi> did sufficiently wonder, to see that the gifts of the Holy Ghost should be poured upon the <hi>Gentiles. Peter</hi> seeing this, told the Company that he knew no reason why these persons should not be baptized, having received the Holy Ghost as well as they; and accordingly commanded them to be baptized.

Besides they were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily puffed up with their external priviledges, that they were the <hi>seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the People whom God had peculiarly chosen for himself, above all other Nations of the World, and therefore with a lofty scorn proudly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Reprobates,</hi> utterly refusing to shew them any office of common kindness and converse.

And finding that this gratified the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, resolved to send <hi>Peter</hi> the same way after him. In order whereunto he apprehended him, cast him into Prison, and set strong guards to watch him: the Church in the mean time being very instant and importunate with Heaven for his life and safety. The Night before his intended execution, God purposely sent an Angel from Heaven, who coming to the Prison, found him fast asleep between two of his Keepers. So soft and secure a Pillow is a good Conscience, even in the confines of Death, and the greatest danger. The Angel raised him up, knock'd off his Chains, bad him gird on his Garments, and follow him. He did so, and having passed the first and second Watch, and entred through the <hi>Iron-Gate</hi> into the City (which opened to them of its own accord) after having passed through one Street more, the Angel departed from him. By this time <hi>Peter</hi> came to himself, and perceived that it was no Vision, but a reality that had hapned to him. Whereupon he came to <hi>Mary</hi>'s house, where the Church were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Prayer for him. Knocking at the Door, the Maid, who came to let him in, perceiving 'twas his voice, ran back to tell them, that <hi>Peter</hi> was at the Door. Which they at first looked upon as nothing, but the effect of fright or fancy, but she still affirming it, they concluded that it was his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or some peculiar messenger sent from him. The Door being open, they were strangely amazed at the sight of him: but he briefly told them the manner of his deliverance, and charging them to acquaint the Brethren with it, presently withdrew into another place. 'Tis easie to imagine what a bustle and a stir there was the next Morning among the Keepers of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with whom <hi>Herod</hi> was so much displeased, that he commanded them to be put to Death.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98271:75"/>
as equally necessary to Salvation. To compose this difference, the best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that could be thought on, was to call a General Council of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Brethren, to meet together at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the case throughly scanned and canvassed. At last <hi>Peter</hi> stood up, and acquainted the Synod, that God having made choice of him among all the Apostles, to be the first that preached the Gospel to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> God who was best able to judge of the hearts of men, had born witness to them, that they were accepted of him, by giving them his Holy Spirit as well as he had done to the <hi>Jews</hi>; having put no difference between the one and the other. That therefore it was a tempting and a provoking God, to put a <hi>Yoke</hi> upon the necks of the Disciples, which neither they themselves nor their Fathers were able to bear: there being ground enough to believe, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> should be saved by the grace of the Gospel. After some other of the Apostles had declared their judgments in the case, it was unanimously decreed, that except the temporary observance of some few particular things, equally convenient both for <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> no other burden should be imposed upon them. And so the decrees of the Council being drawn up into a <hi>Synodical Epistle,</hi> were sent abroad to the several Churches, for allaying the heats and controversies that had been raised about this matter.</p>

Yea, so far did it spread, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> himself was carried away with the stream and torrent of this unwarrantable practice.

                        <hi>Orosius</hi> tells us, that coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> he brought prosperity along with him to that City: For besides several other extraordinary advantages which at that time hapned to it, this was not the least observable, that <hi>Camillus Scribonianus</hi> Governor of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> soliciting the Army to rebell against the Emperor, the <hi>Eagles,</hi> their Military <hi>Standard,</hi> remained so fast in the Ground, that no power, nor strength was able to pluck them up. With which unusual accident the minds of the Souldiers were surprized and startled, and turning their Swords against the Author of the sedition, continued firm and loyal in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Whereby a dangerous Rebellion was prevented, likely enough o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to have broken out.

                        <hi>Hegesippus</hi> the <hi>younger,</hi> an Author contemporary with S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> if not (which is most probable) S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> himself, we shall from him represent the summary of the story. There was at this time at <hi>Rome</hi> an eminent young Gentleman, and a Kinsman of the Emperors, lately dead. The fame which <hi>Peter</hi> had for raising persons to life, perswaded his friends that he might be called. Others also prevailing that <hi>Simon</hi> the Magician might be sent for. <hi>Simon</hi> glad of the occasion to magnifie himself before the People, propounded to <hi>Peter,</hi> that if he raised the Gentleman unto life, then <hi>Peter,</hi> who had so injuriously provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the <hi>great power of God,</hi> (as he stiled himself) should lose his life: But if <hi>Peter</hi> prevailed, he himself would submit to the same fate and sentence. <hi>Peter</hi> accepted the termes, and <hi>Simon</hi> began his Charmes and Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Whereat the dead Gentleman seemed to move his hand. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that stood by, presently cryed out, that he was alive, and that he talked with <hi>Simon,</hi> and began to fall foul upon <hi>Peter,</hi> for daring to oppose himself against so great a power. The Apostle entreated their patience, told them, that all this was but a <hi>phantasm</hi> and appearance, that if <hi>Simon</hi> was but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Bed-side, all this pageantry would quickly vanish. Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accordingly removed, the Body remained without the least sign of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Peter</hi> standing at a good distance from the Bed, silently made his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to Heaven, and then before them all commanded the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Name of the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> to arise: who immediately did so spoke, walked, and ate, and was by <hi>Peter</hi> restored to his Mother. The People who saw this, suddenly changed their opinions, and fell upon the Magician with an intent to stone him. But <hi>Peter</hi> begged his life, and told them, that it would be a sufficient punishment to him, to live and see that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of all his power and malice, the Kingdom of <hi>Christ</hi> should increase and flourish. The Magician was inwardly tormented with this defeat, and vext to see the triumph of the Apostle, and therefore mustering up all his powers, summoned the People, told them that he was offended at the <hi>Galileans,</hi> whose Protector and Guardian he had been, and therefore set them a Day, when he promised that they should see him fly-up into Heaven. At the time appointed he went up to the <hi>Mount</hi> of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and throwing himself from the top of the Rock, began his flight. A sight which the People en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with great wonder and veneration, affirming that this must be the power of God, and not of man. <hi>Peter</hi> standing in the Croud, prayed to our Lord, that the People might be undeceived, and that the vanity of the Impostor might be discovered in such a way, that he himself might be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of it. Immediately the Wings which he had made himself, began to fail him, and he fell to the ground, miserably bruised and wounded with the fall: Whence being carried into a neighbouring Village, he soon after dyed. This is the story, for the particular circumstances whereof, the <hi>Reader</hi> must rely upon the credit of my <hi>Author,</hi> the thing in general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficiently acknowledged by most ancient Writers. This contest of <hi>Peter</hi>'s with <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is placed by <hi>Eusebius</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> but by the generality both of ancient and later Authors, it is referred to the Reign of <hi>Nero.</hi>

carried out upon any action, and in all things shew'd a great strength and courage both of mind and body. The <hi>Galileans</hi> (says he) being fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from their childhood, the men being as seldom overtaken with cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, as their Country with want of men. And yet notwithstanding this, his fervor and fierceness had its intervals; there being some times when the <hi>Paroxysms</hi> of his heat and courage did intermit, and the man was surprised and betrayed by his own fears. Witness his passionate crying out, when he was upon the Sea in danger of his life, and his fearful deserting his Master in the Garden, but especially his carriage in the High-Priests Hall, when the confident charge of a sorry Maid made him sink so far beneath himself, and notwithstanding his great and resolute promises so shamefully deny his Master, and that with curses and imprecations. But he was in danger, and passion prevailed over his understanding, and <hi>fear betrayed the succours which reason offered,</hi> and being intent upon nothing but the present safety of his life, he heeded not what he did, when he disown'd his Master, to save himself; so dangerous is it to be left to our selves, and to have our natural passions let' loose upon us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. CONSIDER him as a <hi>Disciple</hi> and a Christian, and we shall find him exemplary in the great instances of Religion. Singular his <hi>Humility,</hi> and lowliness of mind. With what a passionate earnestness upon the conviction of a Miracle, did he beg of our Saviour to depart from him: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting himself not worthy, that the Son of God should come near so vile a sinner. When our Lord by that wonderful condescension stoopt to wash his Apostles feet, he could by no means be perswaded to admit it, not thinking it fit, that so great a person should submit himself to so servile an office to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards so mean a person as himself; nor could he be induced to accept it, till our Lord was in a manner forced to threaten him into obedience. When <hi>Cornelius</hi> heightned in his apprehensions of him by an immediate command from God concerning him, would have entertained him with expressions of more than ordinary honour and veneration; so far was he from complying with it, that he plainly told him, he was no other than such a man as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. With how much candor and modesty does he treat the inferiour Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Ministers of the Church. He, upon whom Antiquity heaps so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honourable titles, stiling himself no other than their <hi>fellow-Presbyter.</hi> Admirable his <hi>love</hi> to, and zeal for his Master, which he thought he could never express at too high a rate: for his sake venturing on the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and exposing himself to the most imminent hazards of life. 'Twas in his quarrel that he drew his Sword against a Band of Souldiers, and an arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed multitude; and 'twas love to his Master drew him into that imprudent advice, that he should seek to save himself, and avoid those sufferings that were coming upon him, that made him promise and engage so deep, to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and die with him. Great was his forwardness in owning Christ to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> and Son of God; which drew from our Lord that honourable <hi>Encomium, Blessed art thou Simon Bar Jonah.</hi> But greater his courage and constancy in confessing <hi>Christ</hi> before his most inveterate enemies, especially after he had recovered himself of his fall. With how much plainness did he tell the <hi>Jews</hi> at every turn to their very faces, that they were the Murderers and Crucifiers of the Lord of Glory. Nay, with what an undaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, with what an Heroick greatness of mind did he tell that very <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> that had sentenced and condemned him, that they were guilty of his murder, and that they could never be saved any other way, than by this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Jesus,</hi> whom they had crucified and put to death.</p>

                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98271:79"/>4. LASTLY, let us reflect upon him as an <hi>Apostle,</hi> as a Pastor and Guide of Souls. And so we find him faithful and diligent in his office, with an infinite zeal endeavouring to instruct the ignorant, reduce the erroneous, to strengthen the weak, and confirm the strong, to reclaim the vicious, and <hi>turn Souls to righteousness.</hi> We find him taking all opportunities of preaching to the people, converting many thousands at once. How many voyages and travels did he undergo? with how unconquerable a patience did he endure all conflicts and trials, and surmount all difficulties and oppositions, that he might plant and propagate the Christian Faith? Not thinking much to lay down his own life, to promote and further it. Nor did he only do his duty himself, but as one of the prime Superintendents of the Church, and as one that was sensible of the value and the worth of Souls, he was careful to put others in mind of theirs, earnestly pressing and perswading the Pastors and Governours of it, <hi>To feed the flock of God,</hi>

                        <hi>To take upon them the Rule</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of it <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>willingly,</hi> not out of a sinister end, merely of gaining advantages to themselves, but out of a sincere design of doing good to Souls; that they would treat them mildly and gently, and be themselves <hi>examples</hi> of Piety and Religion to them, as the best way to make their Ministery suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful and effectual. And because he could not be always present to teach and warn men,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.12, 13, 15.</note> he cea<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

A course, he tells them, which he was resolved to hold as long as he lived, as <hi>thinking it meet while he was in this Tabernacle, to stir them up, by putting them in mind of these things,</hi> that so <hi>they might be able after his decease, to have them always in remembrance.</hi> And this may lead us to the consideration of those <hi>Writings,</hi> which he left behind him for the benefit of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. NOW the Writings that entitle themselves to this Apostle, were either genuine, or supposititious. The genuine Writings are his two <hi>Epistles,</hi> which make up part of the Sacred Canon. For the first of them, no certain account can be had when it was written. Though <hi>Baronius</hi> and most Writers commonly assign it to the year of <hi>Christ Forty Four.</hi> But this cannot be, <hi>Peter</hi> not being at <hi>Rome</hi> (from whence it is supposed to have been written) at that time, as we shall see anon. He wrote it to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Converts, dispersed through <hi>Pontus, Galatia,</hi> and the Countries thereabouts, chiefly upon the occasion of that persecution, which had been raised at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> And accordingly the main design of it, is to confirm and comfort them under their present sufferings and persecutions, and to direct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them how to carry themselves in the several states and relations, both of the Civil, and the Christian life. For the place whence it was written, 'tis expresly dated from <hi>Babylon.</hi> But what, or where this <hi>Babylon</hi> is, is not so easie to determine. Some think it was <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and probably <hi>Alexandria</hi>; and that there <hi>Peter</hi> preached the Gospel. Others will have it to have been <hi>Babylon</hi> the Ancient <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and where great numbers of <hi>Jews</hi> dwelt ever since the times of their Captivities. But we need not send <hi>Peter</hi> on so long an Errand, if we embrace the Notion of a Learned <note n="*" place="margin">

And this Notion of the Word he endeavours to make good, by calling in to his assistance two of the Ancient <note n="*" place="margin">

God. But generally the Writers of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, and the more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate of the <hi>Reformed</hi> party, acquiescing herein in the Judgment of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, by <hi>Babylon</hi> understand <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 18. v. 2, 10, 21.</note> And so 'tis plain S. <hi>John</hi> calls it in his <hi>Revelation,</hi> either from its conformity in power and greatness to that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent City, or from that great <hi>Idolatry</hi> which at this time reign'd in <hi>Rome.</hi> And so we may suppose S. <hi>Peter</hi> to have written it from <hi>Rome,</hi> not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his coming thither, though the precise time be not exactly known.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. AS for the <hi>Second Epistle,</hi> it was not accounted ol old of equal value and authority with the First, and therefore for some Ages not taken into the Sacred Canon, as is expresly affirmed by <note n="*" place="margin">

The greatest <note n="*" place="margin">Hier. de script.

But as a Judicious <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. Ham. in Argum.

And indeed there is a concurrence of circumstances to prove S. <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it. It bears his name in the Front and Title, yea, somewhat more expresly than the former, which has only <hi>one,</hi> this, <hi>both</hi> his Names. There's a passage in it, that cannot well relate to any but him. When he tells us, that he was present with <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>holy Mount,</hi>

<q>That amongst many strange and wonderful things which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> preached at <hi>Rome,</hi> and left upon Record, this was one, That within a short time God would send a <hi>Prince,</hi> who should destroy the <hi>Jews,</hi> and lay their Cities level with the ground, straitly besiege them, destroy them with Famine, so that they should feed upon one another: That their Wives and Daughters should be ravished, and their Childrens brains dasht out before their faces; that all things should be laid waste by Fire and Sword, and themselves perpetually banished from their own Country; and this for their insolent and merciless usage of the innocent and dear Son of God.</q>
All which, as he observes, came to pass soon after their death, when <hi>Vespasian</hi> came upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> and extinguished both their <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi> And what <hi>Peter</hi> here foretold at <hi>Rome,</hi> we need not question but he had done before to those <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom he wrote this Epistle. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he especially antidotes them against those corrupt and poisonous principles, wherewith many, and especially the followers of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> And this but a little time before his death, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from that passage in it, where he tells them,<note place="margin">Chap. 1. v. 14.</note>

No foundation for it in the</hi> History <hi>of the</hi> Apostolick Acts. <hi>No mention of it in</hi> S.

S.</hi> Peter'<hi>s first being at</hi> Rome <hi>inconsistent with the time of the</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Synod <hi>at</hi> Jerusalem. <hi>And with an Ancient</hi> Tradition, <hi>that the Apostles were commanded to stay Twelve years in</hi> Judaea <hi>after</hi> Christ'<hi>s death. A passage out of</hi> Clemens Alexandrinus <hi>noted and corrected to that purpose. Difference among the Writers of the</hi> Romish <hi>Church in their Accounts.</hi> Peter<hi>'s being</hi> XXV <hi>years Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>no solid foundation for it in Antiquity. The Planting and Governing that Church equally attributed to</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul. <hi>S.</hi> Peter <hi>when (probably) came to</hi> Rome. <hi>Different dates of his Martyrdom assigned by the Ancients. A probable account given of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THOUGH it be not my purpose to swim against the Stream and Current of Antiquity, in denying S. <hi>Peter</hi> to have been at <hi>Rome,</hi> an Assertion easilier perplexed and entangled, than confuted and disproved; yet may we grant the main, without doing any great service to that Church, there being evidence enough to every impartial and considering man, to spoil that smooth and plausible Scheme of Times, which <hi>Baronius</hi> and the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98271:81"/>
Writers of that Church have drawn with so much care and diligence. And in order to this we shall first enquire, whether that Account which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> give us of <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome</hi> be tolerably reconcileable with the History of the <hi>Apostles Acts</hi> recorded by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> which will be best done by briefly presenting S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Acts in their just <hi>Series</hi> and order of Time, and then seeing what countenance and foundation their Account can receive from hence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. AFTER our Lord's Ascension, we find <hi>Peter,</hi> for the first year at least, staying with the rest of the Apostles at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> In the next year he was sent, together with S. <hi>John,</hi> by the command of the Apostles, to <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> to preach the Gospel to that City, and the parts about it. About three years after S. <hi>Paul</hi> meets him at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with whom he staid some time. In the two following years he visited the late planted Churches, preached at <hi>Lydda</hi> and <hi>Joppa,</hi> where having <hi>tarried many days,</hi> he thence removed to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> where he preached to, and baptized <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Family. Whence after some time he returned to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where he probably staid; till cast into prison by <hi>Herod,</hi> and delivered by the Angel. After which we hear no more of him, till three or four years after we find him in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> After which he had the contest with S. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Antioch.</hi> And thence forward the Sacred Story is altogether silent in this matter. So that in all this time, we find not the least footstep of any intimation that he went to <hi>Rome.</hi> This <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ad An.</hi> 39. <hi>num.</hi> 12. <hi>ad An.</hi> 34. <hi>n.</hi> 285.</note> 
                        <hi>Baronius</hi> well foresaw, and therefore once and again inserts this caution, that S. <hi>Luke</hi> did not design to record all the Apostles Acts, and that he has omitted many things which were done by <hi>Peter.</hi> Which surely no man ever intended to deny. But then that he should omit a matter of such vast moment and importance to the whole Christian World, that not one syllable should be said of a Church planted by <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; a Church that was to be Paramount, the seat of all Spiritual Power and Infallibility, and to which all other Churches were to vail and do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; nay, that he should not so much as mention that ever he was there, and yet all this said to be done within the time he designed to write of, is by no means reasonable to suppose. Especially considering, that S. <hi>Luke</hi> records many of his journeys and travels, and his preaching at several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of far less consequence and concernment. Nor let this be thought the worse of, because a <hi>negative</hi> Argument, since it carries so much rational evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence along with it, that any man who is not plainly byassed by Interest, will be satisfied with it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. BUT let us proceed a little further to enquire, whether we can meet any probable footsteps afterwards. About the year <hi>Fifty three,</hi> towards the end of <hi>Claudius</hi> his Reign S. <hi>Paul</hi> is thought to have writ his Epistle to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein he spends the greatest part of one Chapter in saluting particular persons that were there; amongst whom it might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably have been expected, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> should have had the first place. And supposing with <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ad. An.</hi> 58. <hi>n.</hi> 51.</note> 
                        <hi>Baronius,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> at this time might be absent from the City, preaching the Gospel in some parts in the <hi>West,</hi> yet we are not sure that S. <hi>Paul</hi> knew of this, and if he did, it is strange that in so large an Epistle, wherein he had occasion enough, there should be neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect nor indirect mention of him, or of any Church there founded by him. Nay, S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself intimates,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.10, 11, 12.</note> what an earnest desire he had to come thither, that he might <hi>impart unto them some spiritual gifts, to the end they might be established in the Faith,</hi> for which there could have been no such apparent cause had <hi>Peter</hi> been there so lately, and so long before him. Well, S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself not many years after is sent to <hi>Rome, Ann. Chr.</hi> LVI, or as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98271:82"/>
                        <hi>Eusebius,</hi> LVII, (though <hi>Baronius</hi> makes it two years after) about the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year of <hi>Nero</hi>; when he comes thither, does he go to sojourn with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as 'tis likely he would, had he been there? No, but dwelt by himself in his own hired house.<note place="margin">Acts 28.17.</note> No sooner was he come, but he called the chief of the <hi>Jews</hi> together, acquainted them with the cause and end of his coming, explains the doctrine of Christianity, which when they rejected, he tells them, That <hi>henceforth the Salvation of God was sent unto the Gentiles</hi> who would hear it, to whom he would now address himself. Which seems to intimate, that however some few of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might have been brought over, yet that no such harvest had been made before his coming, as might reasonably have been expected from S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s having been so many years amongst them. Within the two first years after S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> he wrote Epistles to several Churches, to the <hi>Colossians, Ephesians, Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> and one to <hi>Philemon,</hi> in none whereof there is the least mention of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or from whence the least probability can be derived, that he had been there.<note place="margin">Chap. 4.10, 11</note> In that to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> he tells them, that of the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> he had had <hi>no other fellow-workers unto the Kingdom of God, which had been a comfort unto him,</hi> save only <hi>Aristarchus, Marcus,</hi> and <hi>Jesus</hi> who was called <hi>Justus,</hi> which evidently excludes S. <hi>Peter.</hi> And in that to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which <hi>Baronius</hi> confesses to have been written a little before his <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> (though probably it was written the same time with the rest above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) he tells him,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.16.</note> That <hi>at his first answer at Rome, no man stood with him, but that all men forsook him.</hi> Which we can hardly believe S. <hi>Peter</hi> would have done, had he then been there. He further tells him, That <hi>only Luke was with him,</hi> that <hi>Crescens</hi> was gone to this place, <hi>Titus</hi> to that, and <hi>Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> left at another. Strange! that if <hi>Peter</hi> was at this time gone from <hi>Rome,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> should take no notice of it as well as the rest. Was he so inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a person, as not to be worth the remembring? or his errand of so small importance, as not to deserve a place in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s account, as well as that of <hi>Crescens</hi> to <hi>Galatia,</hi> or of <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Dalmatia?</hi> Surely, the true reason was, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> as yet had not been at <hi>Rome,</hi> and so there could be no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. IT were no hard matter, further to demonstrate the inconsistency of that Account which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> give us of <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome,</hi> from the time of the <hi>Apostolical Synod</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> For if S. <hi>Paul</hi> went up to that Council <hi>Fourteen years</hi> after his own Conversion, as he plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates;<note place="margin">Gal. 2.1.</note> and that he himself was converted <hi>Ann.</hi> XXXV, somewhat less than two years after the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> then it plainly appears, that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was holden <hi>Ann.</hi> XLVIII, in the sixth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> if not somewhat sooner, for S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

This being granted (and if it be not, it is easie to make it good) then three things amongst others will follow from it. First, That whereas, according to <note n="*" place="margin">

Secondly, That when they tell <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Orosius</hi> does not only affirm, but prove it from <hi>Josephus,</hi> that <hi>Claudius</hi> his Decree was published in the Ninth Year of his Reign, or <hi>Ann. Chr.</hi> LI,

Three Years at least after the Celebration of the Council. Thirdly, That when <note n="‖" place="margin">

                        <hi>Baronius</hi> tells us, that the Reason why <hi>Peter</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> after the breaking up of the <hi>Synod,</hi> was because <hi>Claudius</hi> was now dead, he not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to go before for fear of the Decree, this can be no reason at all, the Council being ended at least Three Years before that Decree took place: so that he might safely have gone thither without the least danger from it. It might further be shewed (if it were necessary) that the account which even they themselves give us, is not very consistent with it self. So fatally does a bad cause draw Men whether they will or no into Errors and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes.</p>

And therefore <hi>Alexander Jannaeus,</hi> when he lay a dying, wisely advised his Queen by all means to comply with them, and to seem to Govern by their counsel and direction, affirming, that this had been the greatest cause of his fatal miscarriage, and that which had derived the <hi>odium</hi> of the Nation upon him, that he had offended this sort of men. Certain it is, that they were infinitely proud and insolent, surly and ill-natured, that they hated all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind but themselves, and censured whoever would not be of their way, as a Villain and a Reprobate: greatly zealous to gather <hi>Proselytes</hi> to their party, not to make them more religious, but more fierce and cruel, more carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and censorious, more heady and high-minded, in short, <hi>twofold more the children of the Devil, than they were before.</hi> All Religion and kindness was confined within the bounds of their own party, and the first principles wherewith they inspired their new converts were, That none but they were the godly party, and that all other persons were slaves and sons of the Earth: and therefore especially endeavoured to inspire them with a mighty zeal and fierceness against all that differed from them, so that if any one did but speak a good word of our Saviour, he should be presently excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and cast out, persecuted and devoted to the death. To this end they were wont, not only to separate, but discriminate themselves from the herd
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98271:86"/>
and community, by some peculiar notes and badges of distinction; such as their <hi>long Robes, broad Phylacteries,</hi> and their <hi>large Fringes</hi> and Borders of their Garments, whereby they made themselves known from the rest of men. These dogged and ill-natured principles, together with their seditious, unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, unjust, unmerciful, and uncharitable behaviour, which otherwise would have made them stink above-ground in the nostrils of men, they sought to palliate and varnish over with a more than ordinary pretence and profession of Religion: but were especially active and diligent in what cost them little, the outward instances of Religion, such duties especially as did more immediately refer to God, as frequent fasting, and praying, which they did very often, and very long, with demure and mortified looks, in a whining and an affected tone, and this almost in every corner of the streets: and indeed so contrived the <hi>scheme</hi> of their Religion, that what they did, might appear above-ground, where they might be seen of men to the best advantage.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. THOUGH this seems to have been the general temper and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the party, yet doubtless there were some amongst them of better and honester principles than the rest. In which number we have just reason to reckon our Apostle: who yet was deeply leavened with the active and fiery <hi>genius</hi> of the Sect; not able to brook any opposite party in Religion, especially if late and novel. Insomuch that when the <hi>Jews</hi> were resolved to do execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon <hi>Stephen,</hi> he stood by and kept the cloaths of them that did it. Whether he was any further engaged in the death of this innocent and good man, we do not find. However this was enough loudly to proclaim his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and consent. And therefore elsewhere we find him indicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for this fact, and pleading guilty.<note place="margin">Acts 22.20.</note> 
                        <hi>When the blood of thy Martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.</hi> God chiefly inspects the heart, and if the vote be passed there, writes the man guilty, though he stir no farther. 'Tis easie to murder another by a silent wish, or a passionate desire. In all moral acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons God values the will for the deed, and reckons the man a companion in the sin, who, though possibly he may never actually joyn in it, does yet inwardly applaud and like it. The storm thus begun, encreased a pace, and a violent persecution began to arise, which miserably afflicted and dispersed the Christians at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> In which our Apostle was a prime Agent and Minister, raging about in all parts with a mad and ungovernable zeal, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Saints, beating them in the Synagogues, compelling many to blaspheme, imprisoning others, and procuring them to be put to death. Indeed he was a kind of <hi>Inquisitor Haereticae pravitatis</hi> to the High-Priest, by whom he was employed to hunt and find out these upstart <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who preached against the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Traditions of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Accordingly having made strange havock at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 9.1.</note> he addressed himself to the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and there took out a Warrant and Commission to go down and ransack the Synagogues at <hi>Damascus.</hi> How eternally insatiable is fury and a misguided zeal! how restless and unwearied in its designs of cruelty! it had already sufficiently harassed the poor Christians at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> but not content to have vexed them there, and to have driven them thence, it persecuted them unto <hi>strange Cities,</hi> following them even to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus</hi> it self, whither many of these persecuted Christians had fled for shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, resolving to bring up those whom he found there to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in order to their punishment and execution. For the <hi>Jewish Sanhedrim</hi> had not only power of seizing and scourging offenders against their Law within the bounds of their own Country, but by the connivence and favour of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>

might send into other Countries, where there were any Synagogues that acknowledged a dependence in Religious matters upon the Council at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to apprehend them; as here they sent <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Damascus</hi> to fetch up what Christians he could find, to be arraigned and sentenced at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

For while he was together with his company travelling on the Road, not far from <hi>Damascus,</hi> on a sudden a gleam of light beyond the splendor and brightness of the Sun, was darted from Heaven upon them, whereat being strangely amazed and confounded, they all fell to the ground, a Voice calling to him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> To which he replied, <hi>Lord, who art thou?</hi> Who told him, That <hi>he was Jesus whom he persecuted,</hi> that what was done to the members was done to the head, that it was hard for him to <hi>kick</hi> against the <hi>pricks,</hi> that he now appeared to him, to make choice of him for a <hi>Minister,</hi> and a <hi>Witness</hi> of what he had now seen, and should after hear; that he would stand by him, and preserve him, and make him a great instrument in the conversion of the <hi>Gentile</hi> World.

                        <hi>heard</hi> the voice, but <hi>saw</hi> not him that spoke to him: though elsewhere the Apostle himself affirms, that they <hi>saw</hi> the light, but <hi>heard not</hi> the voice of him that spake, that is, they heard a confused sound, but not a distinct and articulate voice; or, more probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being ignorant of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, wherein our Lord spake to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> they heard the words, but knew not the sence and the meaning of them.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. S. <hi>PAUL</hi> by this time was gotten up, but though he found his feet, yet he had lost his eyes, being stricken blind with the Extraordinary bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the light, and was accordingly led by his companions into <hi>Damascus.</hi> In which condition he there remained fasting three days together.

                        <hi>but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ.</hi> There was at this time at <hi>Damascus</hi> one <hi>Ananias,</hi> a very devout and religious man, (one of the <hi>seventy Disciples,</hi> as the Ancients inform us, and probably the first planter of the Christian Church in this City) and though a Christian, yet of great reputation amongst all the <hi>Jews.</hi> To him our Lord appeared, commanding him to go into such a street, and to such an house, and there enquire for <hi>one Saul of Tarsus,</hi> who was now at Prayer, and had seen him in a Vision coming to him, to lay his hands upon him, that he might receive his sight. <hi>Ananias</hi> startled at the name of the man, having heard of his bloudy temper and practices, and upon what errand he was now come down to the City. But our Lord to take off his fears, told him, that he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stook the man, that he had now taken him to be a <hi>chosen vessel,</hi> to preach the Gospel both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and before the greatest Potentates upon Earth, acquainting him with what great things he should both do and suffer for his sake, what chains and imprisonments, what racks and scourges, what hunger and thirst, what shipwracks and death, he should undergo. Upon this <hi>Ananias</hi> went, laid his hands upon him, told him that our Lord had sent him to him, that he might receive his sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, which was no sooner done, but thick films like scales

fell from his eyes, and his sight returned. And the next thing he did was to be baptized, and solemnly initiated into the Christian Faith. After which he joyned himself to the Disciples of that place, to the equal joy and wonder of the Church: that the <hi>Wolf</hi> should so soon lay down its fierceness, and put on the meek nature of a <hi>Lamb</hi>; that he who had lately been so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a persecutor, should now become not a professor only, but a preacher of that Faith, which before he had routed and destroyed,</p>

blessings which God had heaped upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the first Originals of that Nation; that he had crowned them all with the sending of his Son, to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> and the Saviour, that though the <hi>Jews</hi> had ignorantly cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified this just, innocent Person, yet that God according to his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions had raised him up, from the dead, that through Him they preached forgiveness of sins, and that by Him alone it was that Men, if ever, must be justified and acquitted from that Guilt and Condemnation, which all the pompous Ceremonies, and Ministeries of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law could never do away: That therefore they should do well to take heed lest by their opposing this way of Salvation, they should bring upon themselves that prophetical curse, which God had threatned to the <hi>Jews</hi> of old for their great contumacy and neglect. This Sermon wanted not its due effects. The <hi>Proselyte-Jews</hi> desired the Apostles to discourse again to them of this matter the next <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day, the Apostles also perswading them to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue firm in the belief of these things. The Day was no sooner come, but the whole City almost flocked to be their Auditors, which when the <hi>Jews</hi> saw, acted by a spirit of envy, they began to blaspheme, and to contradict the Apostles, who nothing daunted, told them that our Lord had charged them <hi>first</hi> to preach the Gospel to the <hi>Jews,</hi> which since they so obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected, they were now to address themselves to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who hearing this exceedingly rejoyced at the good news, and magnified the Word of God, and <hi>as many of them</hi> as were thus prepared and disposed towards <hi>eternal life,</hi> heartily closed with it and embraced it; the Apostles preaching not there only, but through the whole Country round about. The <hi>Jews</hi> more exasperated than before, resolved to be rid of their company, and to that end perswaded some of the more devout and honourable Women, to deal with their Husbands, Persons of prime rank and quality in the City, by whose means they were driven out of those parts. Whereat <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> shaking off the dust of their Feet, as a Testimony against their ingratitude and infidelity, departed from them.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Acts 14.1.</note> where at first they found kind entertainment, and good success, God setting a Seal to their Doctrine by the Testimony of his Miracles. But here the <hi>Jewish</hi> malice began again to ferment, exciting the People to sedition and a mutiny against them. Insomuch that hearing of a design to stone them, they seasonably withdrew to <hi>Lystra:</hi> where they first made their way by a miraculous cure.

Which they no sooner understood, but in detestation of those undue honours offered to them, they rent their clothes, and told them that they were Men of the same make and temper,

of the same passions and infirmities with themselves, that the design of their Preaching was to convert them from these vain Idolatries and superstitions, to the worship of the true God, the great Parent of the World, who though heretofore he had left Men to themselves, to go on in their own ways of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous</hi> worship, yet had he given sufficient evidence of himself in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant returns of a gracious and benign providence in crowning the Year with fruitful Seasons, and other acts of common kindness and bounty to Mankind.</p>

Whence are the great Orbs of Heaven kept in continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, always going in the same tract, but because there's a Superiour power that keeps these great wheels a going?

Who can consider the admirable thinness and purity of the Air, its immediate subserviency to the great ends of the Creation; its being the treasury of vital breath to all living Creatures, without which the next moment must put a period to our days, and not reflect upon that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wisdom that contrived it? If we come down upon the Earth, there we discover a Divine providence, supporting it with the pillars of an invisible power, <hi>stretching the North over the empty space,</hi> and <hi>hanging the Earth upon nothing</hi>; filling it with great variety of admirable and useful Creatures, and maintaining them all according to their kinds at his own cost and charges.

What but an Almighty arm can shut in the Sea with doors, bind it by a <hi>perpetual decree</hi> that it cannot pass, and tye up its wild raging waves with no stronger cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage than ropes of Sand? Who but he commands the storm, and stills the tempest? and brings the Mariner, when at his wits-end in the midst of the greatest dangers, to his desired Haven? <hi>They that go down to the Sea in ships, and do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.</hi> So impossible is it for a man to stand in any part of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein he may not discern evidences enough of an infinitely wise, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Omnipotent Being. Thus much I thought good to add, to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the <hi>Apostles</hi> argument; whence he strongly infers, that 'tis very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that we should worship and adore this great Creator and Benefactor, and not transfer the honours due to him alone upon men of frail and sinful passions, and much less upon dumb Idols, unable either to make or to help themselves. An argument, which though very plain and plausible, and adapted to the meanest understandings, yet was all little enough to restrain the people from offering Sacrifice to them. But how soon was the wind turned into another corner? The old spirit of the <hi>Jews</hi> did still haunt and pursue them: Who coming from <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Iconium,</hi> exasperated and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the multitude.

declared to the Brethren, as they went along, what success they had had in the conversion of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Being come to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they first addressed themselves to <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the pillars and principal persons in that place: By whom they were kindly entertained, and admitted to the <hi>right hand of fellowship.</hi> And perceiving by the account which S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave them, that the Gospel of the <hi>uncircumcision</hi> was committed to him, as that of the <hi>circumcision</hi> was to <hi>Peter</hi>; they ratified it by compact and agreement, that <hi>Peter</hi> should preach to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> unto the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Council was summoned, wherein <hi>Peter</hi> having declared his sence of things, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> acquainted them what great things God by their Ministery had done among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> A plain evidence, that though uncircumcised, they were accepted by God as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> with all their legal Rites and Priviledges. The issue of the debate was, That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not under the obligation of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and that therefore some persons of their own should be joyned with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> to carry the <hi>Canons</hi> and decrees of the Council down to <hi>Antioch,</hi> for their fuller satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this matter.

                     <p>SAINT <hi>Paul</hi> and his Companions having received the <hi>Decretal</hi> Epistle, returned back to <hi>Antioch</hi>; where they had not been long before <hi>Peter</hi> came thither to them. And according to the Decree of the Council freely and inoffensively conversed with the <hi>Gentiles</hi>: Till some of the <hi>Jews</hi> coming down thither from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he withdrew his converse, as if it were a thing unwarrantable and unlawful. By which means the minds of many
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98271:91"/>
were dissatisfied, and their Consciences very much ensnared. Whereat S. <hi>Paul</hi> being exceedingly troubled, publickly rebuked him for it, and that as the case required,<note place="margin">Acts 15.36.</note> with great sharpness and severity. It was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> resolved upon visiting the Churches, which they had lately planted among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> To which end <hi>Barnabas</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take his cousin <hi>Mark</hi> along with them. This, <hi>Paul</hi> would by no means agree to, he having deserted them in their former journey. A little spark, which yet kindled a great feud and dissention between these two good men, and arose to that height, that in some discontent they parted from each other. So natural is it for the best of men sometimes to indulge an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable passion, and so far to espouse the interest of a private and particular humour, as rather to hazard the great Law of Charity, and violate the bands of friendship, than to recede from it. The effect was, <hi>Barnabas</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Nephew, went for <hi>Cyprus,</hi> his native Country, S. <hi>Paul</hi> made choice of <hi>Silas,</hi> and the success of his undertaking being first recommended to the Divine care and goodness, they set forwards on their journey.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. THEIR first passage was into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> confirming the Churches as they went along. And to that end they left with them Copies of the <hi>Synodical</hi> Decrees, lately ordained in the Council at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Hence we may suppose it was that he set sail for <hi>Crete,</hi> where he preached and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated Christianity, and constituted <hi>Titus</hi> to be the first Bishop and Pastor of that Island, whom he left there, to settle and dispose those affairs, which the shortness of his own stay in those parts would not suffer him to do. Hence he returned back unto <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and came to <hi>Lystra,</hi> where he found <hi>Timothy,</hi> whose Father was a <hi>Greek,</hi> his Mother a <hi>Jewish</hi> convert, by whom he had been brought up under all the advantages of a pious and religious education, and especially an incomparable skill and dexterity in the holy Scriptures. S. <hi>Paul</hi> designed him for the companion of his travels, and a special instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Ministery of the Gospel, and knowing that his being uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised would be a mighty prejudice in the opinion and estimation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> caused him to be circumcised; being willing in lawful and indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (such was Circumcision now become) to accommodate himself to mens humors and apprehensions for the saving of their Souls.</p>

FROM hence with his company he passed through <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Galatia,</hi> where he was entertained by them with as mighty a kindness and veneration, as if he had been an Angel immediately sent from Heaven. And being by Revelation forbidden to go into <hi>Asia,</hi> by a second Vision he was commanded to direct his journey for <hi>Macedonia.</hi> And here it was that S. <hi>Luke</hi> joyned himself to his company, and became ever after his inseparable companion. Sailing from <hi>Troas,</hi> they arrived at the Island <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothracia,</hi> and thence to <hi>Neapolis,</hi> from whence they went to <hi>Philippi,</hi> the chief City of that part of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony: where he staid some considerable time to plant the Christian Faith, and where his Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had more particular success on <hi>Lydia,</hi> a Purple-seller, born at <hi>Thyatira,</hi> baptized together with her whole Family; and with her the Apostle so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed during his residence in that place.

The <hi>Jews</hi> had three sorts of places for their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worship: The Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was like the <hi>Cathedral,</hi> or Mother-Church, where all Sacrifices and Oblations were offered, and

where all Males were bound three times a year personally to pay their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Their Synagogues (many whereof they had almost in every place,<note place="margin">Acts 15.21.</note> not unlike our Parochial Churches) where the Scriptures were read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the people taught their duty. <hi>Moses of old time hath in every City them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath-day.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. AS they were going to this <hi>Oratory,</hi> they were often followed by a <hi>Pythonesse,</hi> a Maid-servant, acted by a spirit of Divination, who openly cried out, That <hi>these men were the servants of the most high God, who came to shew the way of Salvation</hi> to the World. So easily can Heaven extort a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony from the mouth of Hell. But S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to shew how little he needed <hi>Satan</hi> to be his witness, commanded the <hi>Daemon</hi> to come out, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately left her. The evil Spirit thus thrown out of possession, presently raised a storm against the Apostles; for the Masters of the Damsel, who used by her Diabolical arts to raise great advantages to themselves, being sensible that now their gainful Trade was spoil'd, resolved to be revenged on them that had spoiled it. Accordingly they laid hold upon them, and drag'd them before the Seat of Judicature, insinuating to the Governours, that these men were <hi>Jews,</hi> and sought to introduce different customs and ways of worship, contrary to the Laws of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and People were soon agreed, the one to give Sentence, the other to set upon the Execution. In fine, they were stript, beaten, and then commanded to be thrown into Prison; and the Jaylor charged to keep them with all possible care and strictness. Who to make sure of his charge, thrust them into the Inner-Dungeon, and made their feet fast in the Stocks. But a good man can turn a <hi>Prison</hi> into a <hi>Chappel,</hi> and make a <hi>den of Thieves</hi> to be <hi>an house of Prayer.</hi> Our feet cannot be bound so fast to the Earth, but that still our hearts may mount up to Heaven. At midnight the Apostles were over-heard by their fellow-prisoners, praying, and singing Hymns to God. But after the still voice came the Tempest. An Earthquake sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shook the foundations of the Prison, the Doors flew open,<note place="margin">

The Jaylor awaking with this amazing accident, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with himself, that the Prisoners were fled, and to prevent the Sentence of publick Justice, was going to lay violent hands upon himself, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> espying, called out to him to hold his hand, and told him they

were all there: Who thereupon came in to them with a greater Earthquake in his own Conscience, and falling down before them, asked them, <hi>What he should do to be saved?</hi> They told him there was no other way of Salvation for him or his, than an hearty and sincere embracing of the Faith of <hi>Christ.</hi> What a happy change does Christianity make in the minds of men! How plain does it smooth the roughest tempers, and instill the sweetest principles of civility and good nature! He who but a little before had tyrannized over the Apostles with the most merciless and cruel usage, began now to treat them with all the arts of kindness and charity, bringing them out of the Dungeon, and washing their stripes and wounds, and being more fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the principles of Christianity, was together with his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, immediately baptized by them. Early in the morning the Magistrates sent Officers privately to release them: Which the Apostles refused, telling them, That they were not only innocent persons, but <hi>Romans</hi>; that they had been illegally condemned and beaten, that therefore their delivery should be as publick, as the injury, and an open vindication of their innocency, and that they themselves,<note place="margin">

Whereupon going to <hi>Lydia</hi>'s house, and having saluted and encouraged the Brethren, they departed from that place.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. LEAVING <hi>Philippi,</hi> they came next to <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Macedonia</hi>; where <hi>Paul,</hi> according to his custom, presently went to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Synagogue, for three Sabbath days, reasoning and disputing with them, proving from the predictions of the Old Testament, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to suffer, and to rise again, and that the blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> was this <hi>Messiah.</hi> Great numbers, especially of religious <hi>Proselytes,</hi> were converted by his preaching: while like the Sun that melts wax, but hardens clay, it wrought a quite contrary effect in the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> who presently set themselves to blow up the City into a tumult and an uproar, and missing <hi>S. Paul</hi> (who had withdrawn himself) they fell foul upon <hi>Jason,</hi> in whose house he lodged; representing to the Magistrates, that they were enemies to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and sought to undermine the peace and prosperity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. At night <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were conducted by the Brethren to <hi>Beraea.</hi> Where go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Synagogue, they found the People of a more noble and generous, a more pliable and ingenuous temper, ready to entertain the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but yet not willing to take it merely upon the Apostles word, till they had first compared his preaching with what the Scriptures say of the <hi>Messiah</hi> and his Doctrine. And the success was answerable, in those great numbers that came over to them. But the <hi>Jewish</hi> malice pursued them still, for hearing at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> what entertainment they had found in this place,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98271:92"/>
they presently came down, to exasperate and stir up the People. To avoid which, <hi>S. Paul</hi> leaving <hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> behind him, thought good to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himself from that place.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. AFTER his departure from <hi>Athens,</hi> he went to <hi>Corinth,</hi> the <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 18.1.</note> and the residence of the <hi>Proconsul</hi> of <hi>Achaia:</hi> where he found <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> lately come from <hi>Italy,</hi> banished out of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Decree of <hi>Claudius:</hi> And they being of the same trade and profession, wherein he had been educated in his youth, he wrought together with them, lest he should be unnecessarily burdensom unto any, which for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he did in some other places. Hither, after some time, <hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> came to him. In the Synagogue he frequently disputed with the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Proselytes,</hi> reasoning and proving, that <hi>Jesus</hi> was the true <hi>Messiah.</hi> They, according to the nature of the men, made head and opposed him, and what they could not conquer by argument and force of reason, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to carry by noise and clamour, mixed with blasphemies and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, the last refuges of an impotent and baffled cause. Whereat to testifie his resentment, he shook his Garments, and told them, since he saw them resolved to pull down vengeance and destruction upon their own heads, he for his part was guiltless and innocent, and would henceforth address himself unto the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Accordingly he left them, and went into the house of <hi>Justus,</hi> a religious Proselyte, where by his preaching and the many miracles which he wrought, he converted great Numbers to the Faith. Amongst which were <hi>Crispus,</hi> the Chief Ruler of the Synagogue, <hi>Gaius,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus,</hi> who together with their Families embraced the Doctrine of the Gospel, and were baptized into the Christian Faith. But the constant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of malice and ingratitude are enough to tire the largest charity, and cool the most generous resolution: therefore that the Apostle might not be discouraged by the restless attempts and machinations of his enemies, our Lord appeared to him in a Vision, told him that notwithstanding the bad suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess he had hitherto met with, there was a great Harvest to be gathered in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98271:95"/>
that place, that he should not be afraid of his enemies, but go on to preach confidently and securely, for that he himself would stand by him and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. ABOUT this time, as is most probable, he wrote his <hi>first Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians, Silas</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> being lately returned from thence, and having done the message for which he had sent them thither. The main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Epistle, is to confirm them in the belief of the Christian Religion, and that they would persevere in it, notwithstanding all the afflictions and persecutions, which he had told them would ensue upon their profession of the Gospel, and to instruct them in the main duties of a Christian and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life. While the Apostle was thus employed, the malice of the <hi>Jewes</hi> was no less at work against him, and universally combining together, they brought him before <hi>Gallio</hi> the <hi>Proconsul</hi> of the Province, elder Brother to the famous <hi>Seneca:</hi> Before him they accused the Apostle as an <hi>Innovator</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that sought to introduce a new way of worship, contrary to what was established by the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, and permitted by the <hi>Roman</hi> Powers. The Apostle was ready to have pleaded his own cause, but the <hi>Proconsul</hi> told them, that had it been a matter of right or wrong, that had fall'n under the cognizance of the Civil Judicature, it had been very fit and reasonable that he should have heard and determined the case, but since the controversie was only concerning the <hi>punctilio</hi>'s and niceties of their Religion, it was very improper for him to be a Judge in such matters. And when they still cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured about it, he threw out their Indictment, and commanded his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to drive them out of Court. Whereupon some of the Towns-men sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> one of the Rulers of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Consistory, a man active and busie in this Insurrection, and beat him even before the Court of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, the <hi>Proconsul</hi> not at all concerning himself about it. A year and an half Saint <hi>Paul</hi> continued in this place, and before his departure thence, wrote his <hi>second Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> to supply the want of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, which in his former he had resolved on, and for which, in a manner, he had engaged his promise. In this therefore he endeavours again to confirm their minds in the truth of the Gospel, and that they would not be shaken with those troubles which the wicked unbelieving <hi>Jewes</hi> would not cease to create them; a lost and undone race of men, and whom the Divine vengeance was ready finally to overtake. And because some passages in his former Letter, relating to this destruction, had been mis-understood, as if this day of the Lord were just then at hand, he rectifies those mistakes, and shews what must precede our Lord's coming unto Judgment.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. S. <hi>PAUL</hi> having thus fully planted and cultivated the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> resolved now for <hi>Syria.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 18.18.</note> And taking along with him <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> at <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> the Port and Harbour of <hi>Corinth, Aquila</hi> (for of him it is certainly to be understood) shaved his head, in performance of a <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>-Vow he had formerly made, the time whereof was now run out. In his passage into <hi>Syria</hi> he came to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where he preached a while in the Synagogue of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> And though desired to stay with them, yet having resolved to be at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at the <hi>Passeover</hi> (probably that he might have the fitter opportunity to meet his friends, and preach the Gospel to those vast numbers that usually flock'd to that great solemnity) he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that in his return he would come again to them. Sailing thence, he landed at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and thence went up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where having visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church, and kept the <hi>Feast,</hi> he went down to <hi>Antioch.</hi> Here ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving staid some time, he traversed the Countries of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Phrygia,</hi>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:98271:96"/>
confirming, as he went, the new-converted Christians, and so came to <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 19.1.</note> where finding certain Christian Disciples, he enquired of them, whether, since their conversion, they had received the miraculous gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost. They told him, that the Doctrine which they had received had nothing in it of that nature, nor had they ever heard that any such extraordinary Spirit had of late been bestowed upon the Church. Hereupon he further enquired, unto what they had been <hi>baptized</hi> (the <hi>Christian</hi> Baptism being administred in the name of the Holy Ghost?) They answered, they had received no more than <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism; which though it obliged men to repentance, yet did it explicitly speak nothing of the Holy Ghost, or its gifts and powers. To this the Apostle replied, That though <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism did openly oblige to nothing but Repentance, yet that it did implicitly acknowledge the whole Doctrine concerning <hi>Christ</hi> and the Holy Ghost. Whereto they assenting, were solemnly initiated by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Baptism, and the Apostle laying his hands upon them, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately received the Holy Ghost, in the gift of Tongues, Prophecy, and other miraculous powers conferred upon them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. AFTER this he entred into the <hi>Jewish</hi> Synagogues, where for the first three months he contended and disputed with the <hi>Jews,</hi> endeavouring with great earnestness and resolution to convince them of the truth of those things that concerned the Christian Religion. But when instead of success, he met with nothing but refractoriness and infidelity, he left the Synagogue, and taking those with him whom he had converted, instructed them, and others that resorted to him, in the School of one <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> a place where Scholars were wont to be educated and instructed. In this manner he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for two years together: In which time the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Proselytes</hi> of the whole <hi>Proconsular Asia</hi> had opportunity of having the Gospel preached to them. And because Miracles are the clearest evidence of a Divine commission, and the most immediate Credentials of Heaven, those which do nearliest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our senses, and consequently have the strongest influence upon our minds, therefore God was pleased to ratifie the doctrine which S. <hi>Paul</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by great and miraculous operations; and those of somewhat a more peculiar and extraordinary nature. Insomuch that he did not only heal those that came to him, but if Napkins or Handkerchiefs were but touched by him, and applied unto the sick, their diseases immediately vanished, and the <hi>Daemons</hi> and evil Spirits departed out of those that were possessed by them.</p>

And to let them see that he was really gone, he commanded the <hi>Daemon</hi> as he went out to overturn a cup full of water, which he had caused to be set in the room before them.

                     <p n="6">6. ABOUT this time it was that the Apostle writ his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> For he had heard, that since his departure, corrupt opinions had got in amongst them about the necessary observation of the <hi>legal</hi> Rites, and that several Impostors were crept into that Church, who knew no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way to undermine the Doctrine he had planted there, than by vilifying his person, slighting him as an Apostle only at the second hand, not to be compared with <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who had familiarly conversed with <hi>Christ</hi> in the days of his flesh, and been immediately deputed by him. In this Epistle therefore he reproves them with some necessary smartness and severity, that they had been so soon led out of that right way, wherein he had set them, and had so easily suffered themselves to be imposed upon by the crafty artifices of seducers. He vindicates the honour of his Apostolate, and the immediate receiving his Commission from <hi>Christ,</hi> wherein he shews, that he came not behind the very best of those Apostles. He largely refutes those <hi>Judaical</hi> opinions, that had tainted and infected them, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion instructs them in the rules and duties of an holy life. While the Apostle thus staid at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he resolved with himself to pass through <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> thence to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and so to <hi>Rome.</hi> But for the present altered his resolution, and continued still at <hi>Ephesus.</hi>

Enraged with this discourse, they cried out with one voice, that <hi>Great was Diana of the Ephesians.</hi> The whole City was presently in an uproar, and seizing upon two of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Companions, hurried them into the <hi>Theatre,</hi> probably with a design to have cast them to the wild Beasts.

And this doubtless he means, when elsewhere he tells us, that <hi>he fought with Beasts at Ephesus,</hi> probably intending what the People designed, though he did not actually suffer; though the brutish rage, the savage and inhumane manners of this People did sufficiently deserve that the censure and character should be fixed upon themselves.</p>

                        <hi>and greatly withstood his words,</hi> and <hi>whom he delivered over unto Satan</hi> for his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie, for <hi>blaspheming</hi> Christ, and reproaching Christianity. But the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude perceiving him to be a <hi>Jew,</hi> and thereby suspecting him to be one of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Associates, began to raise an out-cry for near two Hours together, wherein nothing could be heard, but <hi>Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</hi> The noise being a little over, the <hi>Recorder,</hi> a discreet and prudent Man, came out and calmly told them, That it was sufficiently known to all the World, what a mighty honour and veneration the City of <hi>Ephesus</hi> had for the great Goddess <hi>Diana,</hi> and the famous <hi>Image</hi> which fell from Heaven, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there needed not this stir to vindicate and assert it: That they had seized Persons, who were not guilty either of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> or <hi>Blasphemy</hi> towards their Goddess; that if <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his Company had any just charge against them, the Courts were sitting, and they might prefer their Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or if the Controversie were about any other matter, it might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to such a proper Judicature, as the Law appoints for the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such cases: That therefore they should do well to be quiet, having done more already than they could answer, if called in question, (as 'tis like they would) there being no cause sufficient to justifie that days riotous As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly. With which prudent discourse, he appeased and dismissed the Multitude.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. IT was about this time that S. <hi>Paul</hi> heard of some disturbance in the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> hatched and fomented by a pack of false heretical Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, crept in among them, who endeavoured to draw them into Parties and Factions, by perswading one Party to be for <hi>Peter,</hi> another for <hi>Paul,</hi> a third for <hi>Apollos,</hi> as if the main of Religion consisted in being of this or that Denomination, or in a warm active zeal to decry and oppose whoever is not of our narrow Sect. 'Tis a very weak and slender claim, when a Man holds his Religion by no better a title, than that he has joyned himself to this Man's Church, or that Man's Congregation, and is zealously earnest to maintain and promote it, to be childishly and passionately clamorous for one Man's mode and way of administration, or for some particular humour or opinion, as if Religion lay in nice and curious disputes, or in separating from our Brethren, and not rather <hi>in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</hi> By this means Schisms and Factions broke into the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church, whereby many wild and extravagant Opinions, and some of them such as undermined the fundamental Articles of Christianity, were planted, and had taken root there. As the envious Man never fishes more successfully than in troubled Waters. To cure these Distempers S. <hi>Paul</hi> (who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Account of all this by Letters which <hi>Apollos,</hi> and some others had brought to him from the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>) writes his first Epistle to them. Wherein he smartly reproves them for their Schisms and Parties, conjures them to peace and unity, corrects those gross corruptions that were introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among them, and particularly resolves those many cases and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, wherein they had requested his advice and counsel. Shortly after <hi>Apollos</hi> designing to go for <hi>Crete,</hi> by him and <hi>Zenas</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> sends his Epistle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> whom he had made Bishop of that Island, and had left there for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of the Gospel. Herein he fully instructs him in the execution of his Office, how to carry himself, and what directions he should give to

Wherein he endeavours to set right what his former Epistle had not yet effected, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his Apostleship from that contempt and scorn, and himself from those slanders and aspersions, which the seducers, who had found themselves lasht by his first Epistle, had cast upon him, together with some other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cases relating to them. Much about the same time he writ his first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom he had left at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> wherein at large he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels him, how to carry himself in the discharge of that great place and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church, which he had committed to him; instructs him in the particular qualifications of those whom he should make choice of, to be Bishops and Ministers in the Church. How to order the <hi>Deaconesses,</hi> and to instruct Servants, warning him withall of that pestilent generation of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and seducers, that would arise in the Church. During his three months stay in <hi>Greece,</hi> he went to <hi>Corinth,</hi> whence he wrote his famous Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which he sent by <hi>Phoebe,</hi> a <hi>Deaconess</hi> of the Church of <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> nigh <hi>Corinth</hi>: wherein his main design is fully to state and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the great controversie between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> about the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, and those main and material Doctrines of Christianity, which did depend upon it, such as of Christian liberty, the use of indifferent things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And which is the main end of all Religion, instructs them in, and presses them to the duties of an holy and good life, such as the Christian Doctrine does naturally tend to oblige men to.</p>

S. <hi>PAUL</hi> being now resolved for <hi>Syria,</hi> to convey the contributions to the Brethren at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was a while diverted from that resolution, by a design he was told of which the <hi>Jews</hi> had to kill and rob him by the way. Whereupon he went back into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and so came to <hi>Philippi,</hi> and thence went to <hi>Troas,</hi> where having staid a week, on the <hi>Lords-day</hi> the Church met together to receive the holy Sacrament. Here S. <hi>Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and continued his discourse till mid-night, the longer probably, being the next day to depart from them. The length of his discourse, and the time of the night had caused some of his Auditors to be overtaken with sleep and drowziness, among whom a young man called <hi>Eutychus</hi> being fast asleep, fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead, but whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> presently restored to life and health. How indefatigable was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of our Apostle! how close did he tread in his Masters steps, who <hi>went about doing good!</hi> He compassed Sea and Land, preached and wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles where-ever he came. In every place like a wise Master-builder, he either laid a foundation, or raised the superstructure. He was <hi>instant in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and out of season,</hi> and spared not his pains, either night or day, that he might do good to the Souls of men. The night being thus spent in holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the morning took his leave, and went on foot to <hi>Assos,</hi> a Sea-port Town, whither he had sent his company by Sea. Thence they set sail to <hi>Mytilene</hi>; from thence to <hi>Samos,</hi> and having staid some little time at <hi>Trogyllium,</hi> the next day came to <hi>Myletus,</hi> not so much as putting in at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> because the Apostle was resolved, if possible, to be at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at the Feast of <hi>Pentecost.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Acts 20.17.</note> to summon the Bishops and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, who being come, he put them in mind with what up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness and integrity, with what affection and humility, with how great trouble and danger, with how much faithfulness to their Souls he had been conversant among them, and had preached the Gospol to them, ever since his first coming into those parts: That he had not failed to acquaint them both publickly and privately with whatever might be useful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to them, urging both upon <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> repentance and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of life, and an hearty entertainment of the Faith of <hi>Christ:</hi> That now he was resolved to go to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where he did not know what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sufferings would befall him, more than this, That it had been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told him in every place by those who were endued with the Prophetical gifts of the Holy Ghost, that afflictions and imprisonment would attend him there: But that he was not troubled at this, no nor unwilling to lay down his life, so he might but successfully preach the Gospel, and faithfully serve his Lord in that place and station wherein he had set him: That he knew that henceforth they should see his face no more, but that this was his encouragement and satisfaction, that they themselves could bear him wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that he had not by concealing from them any parts of the Christian Doctrine, betray'd their Souls: That as for themselves, whom God had made Bishops and Pastors of his Church, they should be careful to feed, guide and direct those Christians under their inspection, and be infinitely tender of the good of Souls, for whose redemption <hi>Christ</hi> laid down his own life: That all the care they could use was no more than necessary, it being certain, that after his departure, Heretical Teachers would break in among them, and endanger the ruine of mens Souls; nay, that even among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, there would some arise, who by subtil and crafty methods, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and pernicious Doctrines would gain Proselytes to their party, and thereby make Rents and Schisms in the Church: That therefore they should watch, remembring with what tears and sorrow, he had for three years together warned them of these things: That now he recommended them to the Divine care and goodness, and to the rules and instructions of the Gospel, which if adhered to, would certainly dispose and perfect them for that state of happiness, which God had prepared for good men in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. In short, that he had all a-long dealt faithfully and uprightly with them, they might know from hence, that in all his preaching he had no crafty or covetous designs upon any man's Estate or Riches, having (as themselves could witness) industriously laboured with his own hands, and by his own work maintained both himself and his company: Herein leaving them an example, what pains they ought to take to support the weak, and relieve the poor, rather than to be themselves chargeable unto others; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that incomparable saying of our Saviour (which surely S. <hi>Paul</hi> had received from some of those that had conversed with him in the days of his flesh) <hi>It is more blessed to give, than to receive.</hi> This <hi>Concio ad Clerum,</hi> or <hi>Visitation-Sermon</hi> being ended, the Apostle kneeled down, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all with Prayer. Which done, they all melted into tears, and with the greatest expressions of sorrow attended him to the Ship, though that which made the deepest impression upon their minds was, that he had told them, <hi>That they should see his face no more.</hi>

the gift of Prophecy, that he should not go up to <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> with them he staid a week, and then going all together to the shore, he kneeled down and prayed with them, and having mutually embraced one another, he went on board, and came to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> where only saluting the Brethren, they came next day unto <hi>Caesarea.</hi> Here they lodged in the house of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> one of the seven <hi>Deacons</hi> that were at first set apart by the Apostles, who had four Virgin-daughters, all endued with the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. During their stay in this place, <hi>Agabus</hi> a Christian Prophet came down hither from <hi>Judaea,</hi> who taking <hi>Paul</hi>'s girdle, bound with it his own hands and feet, telling them, that by this external <hi>Symbol</hi> the Holy Ghost did signifie and declare, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> should be thus serv'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and be by them delivered over into the hands of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Whereupon they all passionately besought him, that he would divert his course to some other place. The Apostle ask'd them, what they meant, by these compassionate disswasives to add more affliction to his sorrow; that he was willing and resolved not only to be imprisoned, but, if need were to die at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for the sake of Christ and his Religion. Finding his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution fixed and immoveable, they importuned him no further, but left the event to the Divine will and pleasure, All things being in readiness, they set forwards on their journey, and being come to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> were kindly and joyfully entertained by the Christians there.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. THE next day after their arrival,<note place="margin">Acts 21.18.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> and his company went to the house of S. <hi>James</hi> the Apostle, where the rest of the Bishops and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church were met together; after mutual salutations, he gave them a particular account with what success God had blessed him in propagating Christianity among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for which they all heartily blessed God, but withall told him, that he was now come to a place, where there were many thousands of <hi>Jewish</hi> converts, who all retained a mighty zeal and veneration for the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and who had been informed of him, that he taught the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom he had converted, in every place, to renounce Circumcision, and the Ceremonies of the Law: That as soon as the multitude heard of his arrival, they would come together to see how he behaved himself in this matter; and therefore to prevent so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance, it was advisable, that there being four men there at that time, who were to accomplish a Vow (probably not the <hi>Nazarite-vow,</hi> but some other, which they had made for deliverance from sickness, or some other eminent danger and distress; for so <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Josephus</hi> tells us, they were wont to do in such cases, and before they came to offer the accustomed Sacrifices, to abstain for some time from Wine, and to shave their heads) he would joyn himself to them, perform the usual Rites and Ceremonies with them, and provide such Sacrifices for them, as the Law required in that case, and that in discharge of their Vow, they might shave their heads. Whereby it would appear, that the reports which were spread concerning him were false and groundless, and that he himself did still observe the Rites and Orders of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Institution: That as for the <hi>Gentile</hi> converts they required no such observances at their hands, nor expected any thing more from them in these indifferent matters, than what had been before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the <hi>Apostolical Synod</hi> in that place. S. <hi>Paul</hi> (who in such things was willing <hi>to become all things to all men, that he might gain the more</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the counsel which they gave him, and taking the persons along with him to the Temple, told the Priests, that the time of a Vow which they had made being now run out, and having purified themselves, as the nature
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98271:100"/>
of the case required, they were come to make their offerings according to the Law.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. THE seven days wherein those Sacrifices were to be offered being now almost ended, some <hi>Jews</hi> that were come from <hi>Asia</hi> (where, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, they had opposed S. <hi>Paul</hi>) now finding him in the Temple, began to raise a tumult and uproar, and laying hold of him, called out to the rest of the <hi>Jews</hi> for their assistance: Telling them, that this was the fellow, that every where vented. Doctrines derogatory to the prerogative of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, destructive to the Institutions of the Law, and to the purity of that place, which he had prophaned by bringing in uncircumcised <hi>Greeks</hi> into it: Positively concluding, that because they had seen <hi>Trophimus</hi> a <hi>Gentile</hi> convert of <hi>Ephesus</hi> with him in the City, therefore he had brought him also into the Temple. So apt is malice to make any premises, from whence it may infer its own conclusion. Hereupon the whole City was presently in an uproar, and seizing upon him, they dragged him out of the Temple, the doors being presently shut against him. Nor had they failed there to put a period to all his troubles, had not <hi>Claudius Lysias,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Roman</hi> Garrison in the Tower of <hi>Antonia,</hi> come in with some Souldiers to his rescue and deliverance, and supposing him to be a more than an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Malefactor, commanded a double chain to be put upon him, though as yet altogether ignorant, either who he, or what his crime was, and wherein he could receive little satisfaction from the clamorous multitude, who called for nothing but his death, following the cry with such crouds and numbers, that the Souldiers were forced to take him into their arms, to secure him from the present rage and violence of the people. As they were going up into the Castle, S. <hi>Paul</hi> asked the Governour, whether he might have the liberty to speak to him, who finding him to speak <hi>Greek</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, whether he was not that <hi>Egyptian,</hi> which a few Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had raised a Sedition in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and headed a party of Four Thousand debauched and profligate wretches. The Apostle replied, that he was a <hi>Jew</hi> of <hi>Tarsus,</hi> a Free-man of a rich and honourable City, and therefore begg'd of him, that he might have leave to speak to the People. Which the Captain readily granted, and standing near the Door of the Castle, and making signs that they would hold their peace, he began to address himself to them in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language: which when they heard, they became a little more calm and quiet, while he discoursed to them to this effect.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. HE gave them an account of himself from his Birth,<note place="margin">Acts 22.1.</note> of his education in his youth, of the mighty zeal which he had for the Rites and Customs of their Religion, and with what a passionate earnestness he persecuted and put to death all the Christians that he met with, whereof the High-Priest and the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> could be sufficient witnesses.

                        </note> it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to <hi>revile</hi> him, God himself having commanded, that <hi>no man should speak evil of the Ruler of the People.</hi> The Apostle, who as he never laid aside the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the <hi>Dove,</hi> so knew how, when occasion was, to make use of the wisdom of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> perceiving the Council to consist partly of <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees,</hi> and partly of <hi>Pharisees,</hi> openly told them,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98271:101"/>
that he was a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> and the Son of a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> and that the main thing he was questioned for, was his belief of a future Resurrection. This quickly divided the Council, the <hi>Pharisees</hi> being zealous Patrons of that Article, and the <hi>Sadducees</hi> as stifly denying, that there is either <hi>Angel</hi> (that is, of a spiritual and immortal nature, really subsisting of it self, for otherwise they cannot be supposed to have utterly denied all sorts of Angels, seeing they own'd the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> wherein there is frequent mention of them) or <hi>Spirit,</hi> or that humane Souls do exist in a separate state, and consequently that there is no Resurrection. Presently the Doctors of the Law, who were <hi>Pharisees,</hi> stood up to acquit him, affirming he had done nothing amiss, that it was possible he had received some intimation from Heaven by an Angel, or the revelation of the H. Spirit, and if so, then in opposing his Doctrine, they might fight against God himself.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. GREAT were the dissentions in the Council about this matter, in so much that the Governour fearing S. <hi>Paul</hi> would be torn in pieces, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Souldiers to take him from the Bar, and return him back into the Castle. That night to comfort him after all his frights, and fears, God was pleased to appear to him in a vision, encouraging him to constancy and resolution, assuring him that as he had born witness to his cause at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so in despite of all his enemies he should live to bear his testimony even at <hi>Rome</hi> it self. The next Morning the <hi>Jews,</hi> who could as well cease to be, as to be mischievous and malicious, finding that these dilatory proceedings were not like to do the work, resolved upon a quicker dispatch. To which end above Forty of them entred into a wicked confederacy, which they rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Oath and Execration, never to eat or drink till they had killed him: and having acquitted the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> with their design, they entreated them to importune the Governour, that he might again the next day be brought down before them, under pretence of a more strict trial of his case, and that they themselves would lye in ambush by the way, and not fail to dispatch him, But that Divine providence that peculiarly superintends the safety of good men, <hi>disappoints the devices of the crafty.</hi> The design was discovered to S. <hi>Paul</hi> by a Nephew of his, and by him imparted to the Governour, who immediately commanded two Parties of Foot and Horse, to be ready by Nine of the Clock that Night, and provision to be made for S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to <hi>Foelix</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour of that Province: To whom also he wrote, signifying whom he had sent, how the <hi>Jews</hi> had used him, and that his enemies also should appear before him to manage the charge and accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Accordingly he was by Night conducted to <hi>Antipatris,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> where the Letters being delivered to <hi>Foelix,</hi> the Apostle was presented to him: and finding that he belonged to the Province of <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> he told him, that as soon as his Accusers were arrived he should have an hearing, commanding him in the mean time to be secured in the place called <hi>Herod's Hall.</hi>

To all which the <hi>Jews</hi> that were with him gave in their Vote and Testimony. S. <hi>Paul</hi> having leave from <hi>Foelix</hi> to defend himself, and having told him, how much he was satisfied that he was to plead before one, who for so many years had been Governour of that Nation, distinctly answered to the several parts of the Charge.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. AND first for <hi>Sedition,</hi> he point-blank denied it, affirming that they found him behaving himself quietly and peaceably in the Temple, not so much as disputing there, nor stirring up the people either in the Synagogues, or any other place of the City. And though this was plausibly pretended by them, yet were they never able to make it good. As for the charge of <hi>Heresie,</hi> that he was a <hi>ring-leader of the Sect of the Nazarenes,</hi> he ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously acknowledged, that after the way which they counted <hi>Heresie,</hi> so he worshipped God, the same way in substance wherein all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation had worshipped God before him, taking nothing into his <hi>Creed,</hi> but what the Authentick writings of the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves did own and justifie: That he firmly believed, what the better of themselves were ready to grant, another Life, and a future Resurrection: In he hope and expectation whereof he was careful to live unblameable, and conscientiously to do his duty both to God and men. As for the third part of the Charge,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98271:102"/>
his <hi>Prophaning of the Temple,</hi> he shews how little foundation there was for it, that the design of his coming to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was to bring charitable contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions to his distressed Brethren, that he was indeed in the Temple, but not as some <hi>Asiatick Jews</hi> falsely suggested, either with tumult or with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but only purifying himself according to the rites and customs of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law: And that if any would affirm the contrary, they should come now into open Court, and make it good. Nay, that he appealed to those of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> that were there present, whether he had not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by their own great Council at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where nothing of moment had been laid to his charge, except by them of the <hi>Sadducean</hi> party, who quarrelled with him only for asserting the Doctrine of the Resurrection. <hi>Foelix</hi> having thus heard both parties argue, refused to make any final deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in the case, till he had more fully advised about it, and spoken with <hi>Lysias,</hi> Commander of the Garrison, who was best able to give an account of the Sedition and the Tumult; commanding in the mean time that S. <hi>Paul</hi> should be under guard, but yet in so free a custody, that none of his friends should be hindred from visiting him, or performing any office of kindness and friendship to him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. IT was not long after this before his Wife <hi>Drusilla</hi> (a <hi>Jewess,</hi> Daughter of the elder <hi>Herod,</hi> and whom <hi>Tacitus,</hi> I fear by a mistake for his former Wife <hi>Drusilla,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Juba</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> makes Niece to <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi>) came to him to <hi>Caesarea.</hi> Who being present, he sent for S. <hi>Paul</hi> to appear before them, and gave him leave to discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the doctrine of Christianity. In his discourse he took occasion par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to insist upon the great obligation, which the Laws of Christ lay upon men to Justice and Righteousness toward one another, to Sobriety and Chastity both towards themselves and others, withall urging that severe and impartial account, that must be given in the Judgment of the other World, wherein men shall be arraigned for all the actions of their past life, and be eternally punished or rewarded according to their works. A dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course wisely adapted by the Apostle to <hi>Foelix</hi> his state and temper. But cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosives are very uneasie to a guilty mind: Men naturally hate that which <hi>brings their sins to their remembrance,</hi> and sharpens the sling of a violated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. The Prince was so netled with the Apostles reasonings, that he fell a trembling, and caused the Apostle to break off abruptly, telling him, he would hear the rest at some other season. And good reason there was that <hi>Foelix</hi> his conscience should be sensibly alarmed with these reflexions, being a man notoriously infamous for rapine and violence. <note n="*" place="margin">

To these qualities he had added bribery and covetousness, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore frequently sent for S. <hi>Paul</hi> to discourse with him, expecting that he should have given him a considerable summ for his release; and the rather proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, because he had heard that S. <hi>Paul</hi> had lately brought up great summs of money to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> But finding no offers made, either by the Apostle or his friends, he kept him prisoner for two years together, so long as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self continued <hi>Procurator</hi> of that Nation, when being displaced by <hi>Nero,</hi>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98271:103"/>
the great stir and trouble that had been made about him, and how for his safety and vindication he had immediately appealed to <hi>Caesar. Agrippa</hi> was very desirous to see and hear him, and accordingly the next day the King and his Sister accompanied with <hi>Festus</hi> the Governour, and other persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, came into the Court with a pompous and magnificent retinue, where the Prisoner was brought forth before him. <hi>Festus</hi> having acquainted the King and the Assembly, how much he had been solicited by the <hi>Jews</hi> both at <hi>Caesarea</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> concerning the Prisoner at the Bar, that as a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Malefactor he might be put to death, but that having found him guilty of no capital crime, and the Prisoner himself having appealed to <hi>Caesar,</hi> he was resolved to send him to <hi>Rome,</hi> but yet was willing to have his case again discussed before <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that so he might be furnished with some material instructions to send along with him, since it was very absurd to send a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, without signifying what crimes were charged upon him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. HEREUPON <hi>Agrippa</hi> told the Apostle, he had liberty to make his own defence.<note place="margin">Acts 26.1.</note> To whom, after silence made, he particularly addressed his speech; he tells him in the first place what a happiness he had, that he was to plead before one so exactly versed in all the rites and customs, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and the controversies of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, that the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves knew what had been the course and manner of his life, how he had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated under the Institutions of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> the strictest Sect of the whole <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion, and had been particularly disquieted and arraigned for what had been the constant belief of all their Fathers, what was sufficiently credible in it self, and plainly enough revealed in the Scripture, the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead. He next gave him an account with what a bitter and implacable zeal he had formerly persecuted Christianity, told him the whole story and method of his conversion, and that in compliance with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Vision from Heaven, he had preached repentance and reformation of life first to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then after to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> That it was for no other things than these that the <hi>Jews</hi> apprehended him in the Temple, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to murder him; but being rescued and upheld by a Divine power, he continued in this testimony to this day, asserting nothing but what was perfectly agreeable to <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, who had plainly foretold that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should both be put to death, and rise again, and by his doctrine enlighten both the <hi>Jewish</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> World. While he was thus discoursing, <hi>Festus</hi> openly cried out, that he talked like a mad-man, that his over-much study had put him besides himself. The Apostle calmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, he was far from being transported with idle and distracted humours, that he spake nothing but what was most true and real in it self, and what very well became that grave sober Auditory. And then again addressing himself to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> told him, that these things having been open and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, he could not but be acquainted with them, that he was confident that he believed the Prophets, and must needs therefore know that those Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were fulfilled in Christ. Hereat <hi>Agrippa</hi> replied, That he had in some degree perswaded him to embrace the Christian Faith. To which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle returned, that he heartily prayed, that not only he, but the whole Auditory were, not only in some measure, but altogether, though not Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, yet as much Christians as he himself was. This done, the King and the Governour, and the rest of the Council withdrew a-while, to confer pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately about this matter. And finding by the accusations brought against him, that he was not guilty by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws of any capital offence, no nor of any that deserved so much as imprisonment, <hi>Agrippa</hi> told <hi>Festus,</hi> that he might have been released, if he had not appealed unto <hi>Caesar.</hi> For the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98271:103"/>
Appeal being once made, the Judge had then no power either to absolve or condemn, the cause being intirely reserved to the cognizance of that Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, to whom the Criminal had appealed.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. IT was now finally resolved that S. <hi>Paul</hi> should be sent to <hi>Rome:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 27.1.</note> in order whereunto he was, with some other Prisoners of remarque, committed to the charge of <hi>Julius,</hi> Commander of a Company belonging to the <hi>Legion</hi> of <hi>Augustus</hi>; accompanied in this Voyage by <hi>S. Luke, Aristarchus, Trophimus,</hi> and some others. In <hi>September, Ann. Chr.</hi> LVI. or as others, LVII. they went on board a Ship of <hi>Adramyttium,</hi> and sailed to <hi>Sidon,</hi> where the Captain civilly gave the Apostle leave to go a-shoar to visit his Friends, and refresh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: Hence to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> till they came to the <hi>Fair-Havens,</hi> a place near <hi>Myra,</hi> a City of <hi>Lysia.</hi> Here, Winter growing on, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> foreseeing it would be a dangerous Voyage, perswaded them to put in, and winter. But the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain preferring the judgment of the Master of the Ship, and especially because of the incommodiousness of the Harbour, resolved, if possible, to reach <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> a Port of <hi>Crete,</hi> and to winter there. But it was not long before they found themselves disappointed of their hopes: For the calm southerly Gale that blew before, suddainly changed into a stormy and blustring <hi>North-East Wind,</hi> which so bore down all before it, that they were forced to let the Ship drive at the pleasure of the Wind; but as much as might be, to prevent splitting, or running a ground, they threw out a great part of their Lading, and the Tackle of the Ship. Fourteen Days they remained in this desperate and uncomfortable condition, neither Sun nor Stars appearing for a great part of the time; the Apostle putting them in mind how ill advised they were in not taking his counsel: Howbeit they should be of good chear, for that that God whom he served and worshipped, had the last Night purposely sent an Angel from Heaven, to let him know, that notwithstanding the present danger they were in, yet that he should be brought safe before <hi>Nero</hi>; that they should be shipwrack'd indeed, and cast upon an Island, but that for his sake God had spared all in the Ship, not one whereof should miscarry, and that he did not doubt, but that it would accordingly come to pass. On the Fourteenth Night upon sounding they found themselves nigh some Coast; and therefore to avoid Rocks, thought good to come to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, till the Morning might give them better information. In the mean time the Sea-men (who best understood the danger) were preparing to get into the Skiff, to save themselves: which S. <hi>Paul</hi> espying, told the Captain, that unless they all staid in the Ship, none could be safe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Souldiers cut the Ropes, and let the Skiff fall off into the Sea. Between this and Day-break the Apostle advised them to eat and refresh themselves, having all this time kept no ordinary and regular Meals, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring them they should all escape. Himself first taking Bread, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving blessed God for it before them all, the rest followed his example, and chearfully fell to their Meat: which done, they lightned the Ship of what remained, and endeavoured to put into a Creek, which they discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not far off. But falling into a place where two Seas met, the fore-part of the Ship ran a-ground, while the hinder-part was beaten in pieces with the violence of the Waves. Awakened with the danger they were in, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers cried out to kill the Prisoners, to prevent their escape: which the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, desirous to save <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and probably in confidence of what he had told them, refused to do; commanding, that every one should shift for himself: the issue was, that part by swimming, part on planks, part on pieces of the broken Ship, they all, to the number of two hundred threescore and sixteen (the whole number in the Ship) got safe to shore.</p>

Paul</hi> was throwing sticks upon the Fire, a Viper dislodged by the heat, came out of the Wood, and fastned on his Hand. This the People no sooner espyed, but presently concluded, that surely he was some notorious Murderer, whom though the Divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance had suffered to escape the Hue-and-Cry of the Sea, yet had it only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served him for a more publick and solemn execution.

                     <p n="1">1. THE first thing S. <hi>Paul</hi> did after he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> was to summon the Heads of the <hi>Jewish Consistory</hi> there, whom he acquainted with the cause and manner of his coming, that though he had been guilty of no violation of the Law of their Religion, yet had he been delivered by the <hi>Jews</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Roman</hi> Governours, who would have acquitted him once and again as innocent of any capital offence, but by the pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Jews</hi> he was forced, not with an intention to charge his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (already sufficiently odious to the <hi>Romans</hi>) but only to vindicate and clear himself, to make his <hi>Appeal</hi> to <hi>Caesar</hi>; that being come, he had sent for them, to let them know, that it was for his constant asserting the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> the hope of all true <hi>Israelites,</hi> that he was bound with that <hi>Chain</hi> which they saw upon him. The <hi>Jews</hi> replied, that they had received no advice concerning him, nor had any of the Nation that came from <hi>Judaea,</hi> brought any Charge against him: only for the Religion which he had espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, they desired to be a little better informed about it, it being every where decried both by <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi> Accordingly upon a day appointed he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed to them from morning to night concerning the Religion and Doctrine of the Holy <hi>Jesus,</hi> proving from the promises and predictions of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, that he was the true <hi>Messiah.</hi> His discourse succeeded not with all alike, some being convinced, others persisted in their infidelity: And as they were departing in some discontent at each other, the Apostle told them, it was now too plain, God had accomplished upon them the Prophetical curse, of being left to their own wilful hardness and impenitency, to be blind at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and to run themselves against all means and methods into irrecoverable ruine: That since the case was thus with them, they must expect, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth he should turn his Preaching to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who would be most ready to entertain, what they had so scornfully rejected, the glad tidings of the Gospel.</p>

IT was not, probably, long after this, that he was brought to his first hearing before the Emperor, where those friends, whom he most expected should stand by him, plainly deserted him, afraid it seems of appearing in so ticklish a cause before so unreasonable a Judge, who governed himself by no other measures, than the bruitish and extravagant pleasure of his lust or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. But God stood by him, and encouraged him; as indeed Divine consolations are many times then nearest to us, when humane assistances are farthest from us.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.16.</note> This cowardise of theirs the Apostle had a charity large enough to cover, heartily praying, that it might not be brought in against them in the Accounts of the great Day.

                     <p n="4">4. THE Christians at <hi>Philippi</hi> having heard of <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s imprisonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> and not knowing what straits he might be reduced to, raised a contribution for him, and sent it by <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> their Bishop, who was now come to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he shortly after fell dangerously sick: But being reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and upon the point to return, by him <hi>S. Paul</hi> sent his Epistle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> wherein he gives them some account of the state of affairs at <hi>Rome,</hi> gratefully acknowledges their kindness to him, and warns them of those dangerous opinions, which the Judaizing Teachers began to vent among them. The Apostle had heretofore for some Years liv'd at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and perfectly understood the state and condition of that place; and therefore now by <hi>Tychicus</hi> writes his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> endeavouring to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the principles and practices both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to confirm them in the belief and obedience of the Christian doctrine, to represent the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite riches of the Divine goodness in admitting the <hi>Gentile</hi>-World to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable Treasures of Christianity, especially pressing them to express the life and spirit of it in the general duties of Religion, and in the duties of their particular relations. Much about the same time, or a little after, he wrote his Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> where he had never been, and sent it by <hi>Epaphras,</hi> who for some time had been his fellow-prisoner at <hi>Rome.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of it is for the greatest part the same with that to the <hi>Ephesians</hi>; to settle and confirm them in the faith of the Gospel, against the errors both of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism,</hi> and the superstitious observances of the Heathen World, some whereof had taken root amongst them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. IT is not improbable but that about this, or rather some consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time before, <hi>S. Paul</hi> wrote his second Epistle to <hi>Timothy.</hi> I know <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> and the Ancients, and most Moderns after them, will have it written a little before his Martyrdom, induced thereunto by that passage in it, that he was then <hi>ready to be offered, and that the time of his departure was at hand.</hi> But surely it's most reasonable to think, that it was written at his first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that at his first coming thither, presently after his Trial before <hi>Nero.</hi> Accordingly the passage before mentioned may import no more, than that he was in imminent danger of his life, and had received the sentence of death in himself, not hoping to escape out of the paws of <hi>Nero:</hi> But that <hi>God had delivered him out of the mouth of the Lion, i. e.</hi> the great danger he was in at his coming thither: Which exactly agrees to his case
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98271:106"/>
at his first being at <hi>Rome,</hi> but cannot be reconciled with his last coming thither; together with many more circumstances in this Epistle, which render it next door to certain. In it he appoints <hi>Timothy</hi> shortly to come to him, who accordingly came, whose name is joyned together with his in the front of several Epistles, to the <hi>Philippians, Colossians,</hi> and to <hi>Philemon.</hi> The only thing that can be levelled against this is, that in this Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he tells him, that he had sent <hi>Tychicus</hi> to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> by whom 'tis plain that the Epistles to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> and <hi>Philippians</hi> were dispatched, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this to <hi>Timothy</hi> must be written after them. But I see no inconvenience to affirm, that <hi>Tychicus</hi> might come to <hi>Rome</hi> presently after <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val there, be by him immediately sent back to <hi>Ephesus</hi> upon some emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent affair of that Church; and after his return to <hi>Rome</hi> be sent with those two <hi>Epistles.</hi> The design of the Epistle was to excite the holy man to a mighty zeal and diligence, care and fidelity in his office, and to antidote the People against those poisonous principles that in those parts especially began to debauch the minds of men.</p>

And great need there was for the Apostle severely to urge them to it, heavy persecutions both from <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> pressing in upon them on every side, besides those trains of specious and plausible insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations that were laid to reduce them to their Ancient Institutions.

Indeed he seemed to have been furnished out on purpose to be the <hi>Doctor of the Gentiles,</hi> to contend with, and confute the grave and the wise, the acute and the subtil, the sage and the learned of the Heathen World, and to wound them (as <hi>Julian</hi>'s word was) with arrows drawn out of their own Quiver.

THESE were great accomplishments, and yet but a shadow to that Divine temper of mind that was in him, which discovered it self through the whole course and method of his life. He was humble to the lowest step of abasure and condescension, none ever thinking better of others, or more meanly of himself. And though when he had to deal with envious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious adversaries, who by vilifying his person, sought to obstruct his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, he knew how to <hi>magnifie his office,</hi> and to let them know, that the was <hi>no whit inferiour to the very chiefest Apostles</hi>; yet out of this case he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly declared to all the World, that he looked upon himself as an <hi>Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and an untimely Birth, as <hi>the least of the Apostles, not meet to be called an Apostle</hi>; and as if this were not enough, he makes a word on purpose to express his humility, stiling himself <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>less than the least of all Saints,</hi> yea, <hi>the very chief of sinners.</hi> How freely, and that at every turn does he confess what he was before his conversion, a <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> a <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and <hi>Injurious</hi> both to God and Men? Though honoured with peculiar Acts of the highest grace and favour, taken up to an immediate converse with God in Heaven, yet did not this swell him with a supercilious loftiness over the rest of his brethren: Intrusted he was with great power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church, but never affected <hi>dominion over men's Faith,</hi> nor any other place, than to be an <hi>helper of their joy,</hi> nor ever made use of his power, but to the <hi>edification,</hi> not <hi>destruction</hi> of any. How studiously did he decline all honours and commendations that were heaped upon him? When some in the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> cried him up beyond all measures, and under the patronage of his name began to set up for a party, he severely rebuked them,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98271:109"/>
told them, that it was <hi>Christ,</hi> not he, that was crucified for them, that they had <hi>not been baptized into his name,</hi> which he was so far from, that he did not remember that he had baptized above three or four of them, and was heartily glad he had baptized no more, left a foundation might have been laid for that suspicion; that this <hi>Paul,</hi> whom they so much extolled, was no more than a <hi>minister of Christ,</hi> whom our Lord had appointed to plant and build up his Church.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. GREAT was his temperance and sobriety, so far from going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of regularity, that he abridged himself of the conveniences of lawful and necessary accommodations; frequent his hungrings and thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not constrained only, but voluntary; it's probably thought that he very rarely drank any Wine; certain, that by abstinence and mortification he <hi>kept under and subdued his body,</hi> reducing the extravagancy of the sensual appetites to a perfect subjection to the laws of Reason. By this means he easily got above the World, and its charms and frowns, had his mind continually conversant in Heaven, his thoughts were fixed there, his desires always ascending thither, what he taught others, he practised himself, his <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation was in Heaven,</hi> and his <hi>desires were to depart, and to be with Christ</hi>; this World did neither arrest his affections, nor disturb his fears, he was not taken with its applause, nor frighted with its threatnings; he <hi>studied not to please men,</hi> nor valued the censures and judgments which they passed upon him; he was not greedy of a great estate, or titles of honour, or rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents from men, not <hi>seeking theirs, but them</hi>; food and raiment was his bill of fare, and more than this he never cared for; accounting, that the less he was clogged with these things, the lighter he should march to Heaven, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially travelling through a World over-run with troubles and persecutions. Upon this account it's probable he kept himself always within a single life, though there want not some of the Ancients who expresly reckon him in the number of the married Apostles, as <note n="*" place="margin">

HIS kindness and charity was truly admirable, he had a compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate tenderness for the poor, and a quick sense of the wants of others: To what Church soever he came, it was one of his first cares, to make provision for the poor, and to stir up the bounty of the rich and the wealthy, nay, himself worked often with his own hands, not only to maintain himself, but to help and relieve them. But infinitely greater was his charity to the Souls of men, fearing no dangers, refusing no labours, going through good and evil report, that he might gain men over to the knowledge of the truth, reduce them out of the crooked paths of vice and idolatry, and set them in the right way to eternal life. Nay, so insatiable his thirst after the good of Souls, that he affirms, that rather than his Country-men the <hi>Jews</hi> should miscarry by not believing and entertaining the Gospel, he could be content, nay wished, that <hi>himself might be accursed from Christ for their sake, i. e.</hi> that he might be anathematized and cut off from the Church of Christ, and not only lose the honour of the Apostolate, but be reckoned in the number of the abject and execrable persons, such as those are who are separated from the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98271:109"/>
communion of the Church. An instance of so large and passionate a charity, that lest it might not find room in mens belief, he ushered it in with this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn appeal and attestation, that <hi>he said the truth in Christ, and lied not, his conscience bearing him witness in the Holy Ghost.</hi> And as he was infinitely so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to gain men over to the best Religion in the World, so was he not less careful to keep them from being seduced from it, ready to suspect every thing that might <hi>corrupt their minds from the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city that is in Christ.</hi>

Nor was his charity to men greater than his zeal for God, endeavouring with all his might to promote the honour of his Master. Indeed zeal seems to have had a deep foundation in the natural forwardness of his temper. How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly zealous was he, while in the <hi>Jews</hi> Religion, of the Traditions of his Fathers, how earnest to vindicate and assert the Divinity of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> dispensation, and to persecute all of a contrary way, even to rage and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And when afterwards turned into a right chanel, it ran with as swift a current; carrying him out against all opposition to ruine the kingdom and the powers of darkness, to beat down idolatry, and to plant the World with right apprehensions of God, and the true notions of Religion. When at <hi>Athens</hi> he saw them so much over-grown with the grossest superstition and idolatry, giving the honour that was alone due to God to Statues and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, his zeal began to ferment, and to boil up into <hi>Paroxysms</hi> of indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he could not but let them know the resentments of his mind, and how much herein they dishonoured God, the great Parent and Maker of the World.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. THIS zeal must needs put him upon a mighty diligence and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry in the execution of his office, warning, reproving, entreating, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>preaching in season, and out of season,</hi> by night, and by day, by Sea and Land; no pains too much to be taken, no dangers too great to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. For five and thirty years after his Conversion, he seldom staid long in one place, from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> through <hi>Arabia, Asia, Greece,</hi> round about to <hi>Illyricum,</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and even to the utmost bounds of the <hi>Western</hi>-world, <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preaching the Gospel of Christ</hi>: Running (says S. <hi>Hierom</hi>) from Ocean to Ocean, like the Sun in the Heavens, of which 'tis said, <hi>His going forth is from the end of the Heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it</hi>; sooner wanting ground to tread on, than a desire to propagate the Faith of <hi>Christ.</hi>

A thousand times was his life at stake, in every suffering he was a Martyr, and what fell but in parcels upon others, came all upon him, while they skirmished only with single parties, he had the whole Army of sufferings to contend with. All which he generously underwent with a Soul as calm and serene as the morning-Sun, no spite or rage, no fury or storms could ruffle and discompose his spirit: Nay, those sufferings, which would have broken the back of an ordinary patience, did but make him rise up with the greater eagerness and resolution for the doing of his duty.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. HIS patience will yet further appear from the consideration of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the last of those virtues we shall take notice of in him, his constancy and fidelity in the discharge of his place, and in the profession of Religion. Could the powers and policies of Men and Devils, spite and oppositions, torments and threatnings have been able to baffle him out of that Religion wherein he had engaged himself, he must have sunk under them, and left his station. But his Soul was steel'd with a courage and resolution that was impenetrable, and which no temptation either from hopes or fears could make any more impression upon, than an arrow can, that's shot against a wall of marble. He wanted not solicitation on either hand, both from <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and questionless might in some degree have made his own terms, would he have been false to his trust, and have quitted that way, that was then every-where spoken against. But alas! these things weighed little with our Apostle, who <hi>counted not his life to be dear unto him, so that he might finish his course with joy, and the ministry which he had received of the Lord Jesus.</hi> And therefore when under the sentence of death in his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, could triumphingly say, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the Faith:</hi> and so indeed he did, kept it inviolably, undauntedly to the last minute of his life. The summ is, He was a man, in whom the Divine life did eminently manifest and display it self; he lived pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and devoutly, soberly and temperately, justly and righteously, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>alway to keep a conscience void of offence both towards God and Man.</hi> This he tells us was his support under suffering, this the foundation of his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.12.</note> and his firm hopes of happiness in another World; <hi>This is our rejoycing, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we have had our conversation in the World.</hi>

IT is not the least instance of his care and fidelity in his office, that he did not only preach and plant Christianity in all places whither he came, but what he could not personally do, he supplied by writing. XIV Epistles he left upon record, by which he was not only instrumental in propagating Christian Religion at first, but has been useful to the World ever since in all Ages of the Church. We have all along in the History of his Life taken particular notice of them in their due place and order: We shall here only make some general observations and remarks upon them, and that as to the stile and way wherein they are written, their Order, and the Subscriptions that are added to them. For the Apostle's stile and manner of writing it is plain and simple, and though not set off with the elaborate artifices, and affected additionals of humane eloquence, yet grave and majestical, and that by the confession of his very enemies,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.10.</note>

                        <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us, that by these methods he acted like a skilful Archer, hitting the mark, before his adversaries were aware of it; by words misplaced making the frame of his discourse seem ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and entangled, while in it self it was not only most true, but elaborate, and not difficult to be understood; that to careless and trifling Readers it might sometimes seem dissonant and incoherent, but to them that are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and will take their reason along with them, it would appear full of truth, and to be disposed with great care and order.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. AS for the <hi>order</hi> of these Epistles, we have already given a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account of the times when, and the places whence they were written. That which is here considerable, is the Order according to which they are disposed in the sacred <hi>Ganon.</hi> Certain it is that they are not plac'd according to the just order of time, wherein they were written, the two Epistles to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> being on all hands agreed to have been first written, though set almost last in order. Most probable therefore it is, that they were plac'd according to the dignity of those to whom they were sent: the reason, why those to whole Churches have the precedency of those to particular persons: and among those to Churches, that to the <hi>Romans</hi> had the first place and rank assigned to it, because of the majesty of the Imperial City, and the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and honourable respect which that Church derived thence: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the same reason do not hold in others, though I will not positively as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, yet I think none will over-confidently deny. The last enquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>subscriptions</hi> added to the end of these Epistles; which, were they authentick, would determine some doubts concerning the time and place of their writing. But alas, they are of no just value and authority, not the same in all Copies, different in the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Versions, nay whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanting in some ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of the New Testament; and were doubtless at first added at best upon probable conjectures. When at any time they truly represent the place whence, or the Person by whom the Epistle was sent, 'tis not that they are to be relied upon in it, but because the thing is either intimated or expressed in the body of the Epistle. I shall add no more but this observation, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was wont to subscribe every Epistle with his own hand,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3.17.</note> 
                        <hi>which is my token in every Epistle; so I write.</hi> Which was done (says <note n="*" place="margin">

By these and such like principles and practices (many whereof might be reckoned up) they corrupted the Faith of Christians, distracted the peace of the Church, stained and defiled the honour and purity of the best Religion in the World.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. BUT the greatest and most famous Controversie that of all others in those times exercised the Christian Church, was concerning the obligation that Christians were under to observe the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as necessary to their Justification and Salvation. Which because a matter of so much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and which takes up so great a part of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, and the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof will reflect a great light upon them, we shall consider more at large: In order whereunto three things especially are to be enquired after, the true state of the Controversie, what the Apostles determined in this matter, and what respect the most material passages in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles about Justification and Salvation bear to this Controversie. First we shall enquire into the true state and nature of the Controversie; and for this we are to know, that when Christianity was published to the World, it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevailed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> they being generally the first Converts to the Faith. But having been brought up in a mighty reverence and veneration for the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Institutions, and looking upon that <hi>Oeconomy</hi> as immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived by God himself, delivered by Angels, settled by their great Master <hi>Moses,</hi> received with the most solemn and sensible appearances of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power and majesty, ratified by miracles, and entertained by all their forefathers as the peculiar prerogative of that Nation for so many Ages and Generations, they could not easily be brought off from it, or behold the Gospel but with an evil eye, as an enemy that came to supplant and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this ancient and excellent Institution. Nay, those of them that were prevailed upon by the convictive power and evidence of the Gospel, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Christian Religion, yet could not get over the prejudice of educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but must still continue their observance of those legal rites and customs, wherein they had been brought up. And not content with this, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan magisterially to impose them upon others, even all the <hi>Gentile</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, as that without which they could never be accepted by God in this, or rewarded by him in another World. This controversie was first started at <hi>Antioch,</hi> a place not more remarkable for its own greatness, than the vast numbers of <hi>Jews</hi> that dwelt there,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Joseph. de Bell. Jud. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 21. <hi>p.</hi> 973.</note> enjoying great immunities granted them by the Kings of <hi>Syria.</hi> For after that <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> had destroyed <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and laid waste the Temple, the <hi>Jews</hi> generally flocked hither, where they were courteously entertained by his successors, the spoils of the Temple restored to them for the enriching and adorning of their Synagogue,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98271:113"/>
and they made equally with the <hi>Greeks</hi> free-men of that City. By which means their numbers encreased daily, partly by the resort of others from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> partly by a numerous conversion of <hi>Proselytes,</hi> whom they gained over to their Religion. Accordingly Christianity at its first setting out found a very successful entertainment in this place. And hither it was that some of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Converts being come down from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 15.1.</note> taught the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that unless they observed Circumcision, and the whole Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> they could not be saved. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> then at <hi>Antioch,</hi> observing the ill influence that this had upon the minds of men (disturbing many at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and causing the Apostasie of some afterwards) began vigorously to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this growing error; but not able to conjure down this Spirit, that had been raised up, they were dispatched by the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> to consult the Apostles and Governours at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> about this matter: Whither being come, they found the quarrel espoused among others by some Converts of the Sect of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> (of all others the most zealous assertors of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick</hi> rites) stifly maintaining, that besides the Gospel or the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it was necessary for all Converts, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to keep to Circumcision, and the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> So that the state of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between the Orthodox, and these <hi>Judaizing</hi> Christians was plainly this, <q>Whether Circumcision and the observation of the Mosaick Law, or, only the belief and practice of Christianity be necessary to Salvation?</q> The latter part of the question was maintained by the Apostles, the former asserted by the <hi>Judaizing</hi> Zelots, making the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> equally necessary with the Law of <hi>Christ</hi>; and no doubt pretending that whatever these men might preach at <hi>Antioch,</hi> yet the Apostles were of another mind; whose sentence and resolution it was therefore thought necessary should be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately known.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. WE are then next to consider what determination the <hi>Apostolick Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> made of this matter. For a Council of the Apostles and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers being immediately convened, and the question by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> brought before them, the case was canvassed and debated on all hands, and at last it was resolved upon by their unanimous sentence and suffrage, that the <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts were under no obligation to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, that God had abundantly declared his acceptance of them, though strangers to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical</hi> Oeconomy, that they were sufficiently secured of their happiness and salvation by the grace of the Gospel, wherein they might be justified and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without Circumcision or legal Ceremonies, a yoke from which <hi>Christ</hi> had now set us free. But because the Apostles did not think it prudent in these circumstances, too much to stir the exasperated humour of the <hi>Jews</hi> (lest by straining the string too high at first, they should endanger their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting from the Faith) therefore they thought of some indulgence in the case, S. <hi>James</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and probably President of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, propounding this expedient, that for the present the <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts should so far only comply with the humour of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as to <hi>abstain from meats offered to Idols, from bloud, from things strangled, and from fornication.</hi> Let us a little more distinctly survey the ingredients of this imposition. <hi>Meats offered to Idols,</hi> or as S. <hi>James</hi> in his discourse stiles them <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap> properly denoting the meats that were polluted by being consecrated to the Idol. Thus we read of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (as the LXX render it) <hi>polluted bread upon God's Altar, i. e.</hi> such probably as had been before offered to Idols.<note place="margin">Mat. 1.7.</note> So that these meats offered to the <hi>Idols</hi> were parts of those Sacrifices which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98271:114"/>
the Heathens offered to their Gods, of the remaining portions whereof they usually made a Feast in the <hi>Idol-Temple,</hi> inviting their friends thither, and sometimes their Christian friends to come along with them. This God had particularly forbidden the <hi>Jews</hi> by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 34.14, 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou shalt worship no other God: lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and go a whoring after their Gods, and do sacrifice unto their Gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice.</hi> And the not observing this prohibition cost the <hi>Jews</hi> dear,<note place="margin">Num. 25.2.-4.</note> when invited by the <hi>Moabites</hi> to the Sacrifices of their Gods, <hi>they did eat with them, and bowed down to their Gods.</hi> Sometimes these remaining portions were sold for common use in the Shambles, and bought by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Both which gave great offence to the zealous <hi>Jews,</hi> who looked upon it as a participation in the Idolatries of the Heathen: Of both which our Apostle discourses elsewhere at large, pressing Christians to <hi>abstain from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> both as to the Idol-feasts, and the remainders of the Sacrifice: From the former as more immediately unlawful, from the latter, the Sacrificial meats sold in the Shambles, as giving offence to weak and undiscerning Christians. For though in it self <hi>an Idol was nothing in the world,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no honour could be done it by eating what was offered to it, yet was it more prudent and reasonable to abstain, partly because flesh-meats have no peculiar excellency in them to commend us to God; partly because all men were not alike instructed in the knowledge of their liberty, their minds ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily puzled, and their consciences entangled, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by this means hardned in their idolatrous practices, weak brethren offended; besides, though these things were in their own nature indifferent, and in a mans own power to do, or to let alone, yet was it not convenient to make our liberty a snare to others, and to venture upon what was lawful, when it was plainly unedifying and inexpedient. <hi>From bloud</hi>: This God forbad of old, and that some time before the giving of the Law by <hi>Moses,</hi> that <hi>they should not eat the flesh with the bloud,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 9.4.</note> 
                        <hi>which was the life thereof.</hi> The mystery of which prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was, to instruct men in the duties of mercy and tenderness even to brute beasts, but (as appears from what follows after) primarily designed by God as a solemn fence and bar against murther, and the effusion of humane bloud. A Law afterwards renewed upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> and inserted into the body of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> precepts. <hi>From things strangled</hi>: that is, that they should abstain from eating of those Beasts that died without letting bloud, where the bloud was not throughly drained from them; a prohibition grounded upon the reason of the former, and indeed was greatly abominable to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lev. 17.10, 11 12, &amp;c.</note> being so expresly forbidden in their Law. But it was not more offensive to the <hi>Jews,</hi> than acceptable to the <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <q>That (besides the temporary observation of those few indifferent rites before mentioned) the belief and practice of the Christian Religion was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly sufficient to Salvation, without Circumcision, and the observation of the Mosaick Law.</q> This <hi>Synodical</hi> determination allayed the controversie for a while, being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received by the <hi>Gentile</hi>-Christians. But alas, the <hi>Jewish</hi> zeal began again to ferment and spread it self, they could not with any patience endure to see their beloved <hi>Moses</hi> deserted, and those venerable Institutions trodden down, and therefore laboured to keep up their credit, and still to assert them as necessary to Salvation. Than which nothing created <hi>S. Paul</hi> greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at every turn, being forced to contend against these <hi>Judaizing</hi> teachers almost in every Church where he came, as appears by that great part that they bear in all his Epistles, especially that to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> where this leaven had most diffused it self, whom the better to undeceive, he discourses at large of the nature and institution, the end and design, the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quating and abolishing of that <hi>Mosaick</hi> Covenant, which these men laid so much stress and weight upon.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. HENCE then we pass to the third thing considerable for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this matter, which is to shew, that the main passages in <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s Epistles, concerning Justification and Salvation, have an immediate refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this controversie. But before we enter upon that, something must necessarily be premised for the explicating some terms and phrases frequently used by our Apostle in this question, these two especially, what he means by <hi>Law,</hi> and what by <hi>Faith.</hi> By <hi>Law</hi> then 'tis plain he usually understands the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, which was a complex body of Laws, containing <hi>Moral, Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Judicial</hi> precepts, each of which had its use and office as a great instrument of duty: The <hi>Judicial</hi> Laws being peculiar Statutes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the state of the <hi>Jew</hi>'s Commonwealth, as all civil constitutions, restrained men from the external acts of sin: The <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Laws came somewhat nearer, and besides their <hi>Typical</hi> relation to the <hi>Evangelical</hi> state, by external and symbolical representments signified and exhibited that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual impurity, from which men were to abstain: The <hi>Moral</hi> Laws, founded in the natural notions of mens minds concerning good and evil, directly urged men to duty, and prohibited their prevarications. These three made up the intire <hi>Code</hi> and <hi>Pandects</hi> of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Statutes; all which our Apostle comprehends under the general notion of <hi>the Law,</hi> and not the moral Law singly and separately considered, in which sence it never appears that the <hi>Jews</hi> expected justification and salvation by it, nay rather, that they looked for it meerly from the observance of the ritual and ceremonial Law: so that the moral Law is no further considered by him in this question, than as it made up a part of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> constitution, of that National and <hi>Political</hi> Covenant, which God made with the <hi>Jews</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle all along in his discourses constantly opposes the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the observation of the one to the belief and practice of the other, which surely he would not have done, had he simply intended the moral Law, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more expresly incorporated into the Gospel, than ever it was into the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And that the Apostle does thus oppose the Law and Gospel, might be made evident from the continued series of his discourses; but a few places shall suffice.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.27.</note> 
                        <hi>By what Law</hi> (says the Apostle) <hi>is boasting excluded? by the Law of works:</hi> i. e. by the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law, in whose peculiar priviledges and prerogatives the <hi>Jews</hi> did strangely flatter and pride themselves? <hi>Nay, but by the Law of Faith:</hi> i. e. by the Gospel, or the Evangelical way of God's dealing with us.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.15, 16.</note> And elsewhere giving an account of this very controversie
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98271:115"/>
between the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts, he first opposes their Persons, <hi>Jews by nature,</hi> and <hi>sinners of the Gentiles,</hi> and then infers, <hi>that a man is not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the works of the Law,</hi> by those legal observances, whereby the <hi>Jewes</hi> expected to be justified, <hi>but by the faith of Christ,</hi> by a hearty belief of, and compliance with that way, which <hi>Christ</hi> has introduced, <hi>for by the works of the Law,</hi> by legal obedience, <hi>no flesh,</hi> neither <hi>Jew,</hi> nor <hi>Gentile, shall</hi> now <hi>be justified. Fain would I learn,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3.2-5.</note> 
                        <hi>whether you received the spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> that is, whether you became partakers of the miraculous powers of the Holy Ghost, while you continued under the legal dispensation, or since you embraced the Gospel, and the faith of <hi>Christ:</hi> and speaking afterwards of the state of the <hi>Jews</hi> before the revelation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, says he, <hi>before faith came, we were kept under the Law,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">V. 23.</note> i. e. before the Gospel came, we were kept under the Discipline of the legal Oeconomy, <hi>shut up unto the faith,</hi> reserved for the discovery of the Evangelical dispensation, <hi>which should afterwards</hi> [in its due time] <hi>be revealed</hi> to the World. This in the following Chapter he discourses more at large.<note place="margin">Gal. 4.21. &amp; seq.</note> 
                        <hi>Tell me ye that desire to be under the Law,</hi> i. e. Ye <hi>Jews</hi> that so fondly dote upon the legal state, <hi>Do ye not hear the Law?</hi> i. e. Understand what your own Law does so clearly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate? and then goes on to unriddle what was wrapt up in the famous <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s two Sons by his two Wives. The one, <hi>Ishmael,</hi> born of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> the Bond-woman, who denoted the <hi>Jewish</hi> Covenant made at Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> which according to the representation of her condition was a servile state: The other <hi>Isaac,</hi> born of <hi>Sarah,</hi> the Free-woman, was the Son of the promise, denoting <hi>Jerusalem that is above, and is free, the mother of us all</hi>; i. e. The state and covenant of the Gospel, whereby all Christians, as the spiritual chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are set free from the bondage of the <hi>Mosaic</hi> dispensation. By all which it is evident, that by Law and the works of the Law, in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, the Apostle understands the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and that obedience which the legal dispensation required at their hands.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. WE are secondly to enquire, what the Apostle means by <hi>Faith</hi>; and he commonly uses it two ways. 1. More generally for the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or that Evangelical way of justification and salvation, which Christ has brought in, in opposition to Circumcision, and the observation of those Rites, by which the <hi>Jews</hi> expected to be justified: and this is plain from the preceding op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, where <hi>Faith,</hi> as denoting the Gospel, is frequently opposed to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses.</hi> 2. Faith is taken more particularly for a practical belief, or such an assent to the <hi>Evangelical</hi> revelation as produces a sincere obedience to the Laws of it, and indeed as concerned in this matter is usually taken not for this or that single virtue, but for the intire condition of the New Covenant, as comprehending all that duty that it requires of us: than which nothing can be more plain and evident; <hi>In Christ Jesus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> i. e. under the Gospel, <hi>neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Uncircumcision</hi>; 'tis all one to Justification whether a Man be circumcised or no; What then? <hi>but Faith, which worketh by love</hi>;<note place="margin">Gal. 6.15.</note> which afterwards he explains thus, <hi>In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature,</hi> a renewed and divine temper of mind, and a new course and state of life. And lest all this should not be thought plain enough,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.19.</note> he elsewhere tells us, that <hi>circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping the Commandments of God.</hi> From which places there needs no skill to infer, that that Faith whereby we are justified, contains in it a new disposition and state both of heart and life, and an observation of the Laws of Christ; in which respect the Apostle does in the very same Verse expound <hi>believing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 10.16.</note> by <hi>obeying of the Gospel.</hi> Such he assures us was that very Faith by which <hi>Abraham</hi>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:98271:116"/>
was justified, who against all probabilities of reason believed in God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong, &amp;c.</hi> that is, he so firmly believed what God had promised, that he gave him the glory of his truth and faithfulness, his infinite power and ability to do all things. And how did he that? by acting suitably in a way of intire resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and sincere obedience to the divine will and pleasure: so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle elsewhere more expresly,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.8.</note> 
                        <hi>by Faith he obeyed, and went out, not knowing whither he went.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4.22.</note> This Faith (he tells us) <hi>was imputed to Abraham for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> that is, God by vertue of the New Covenant made in <hi>Christ</hi> was graciously pleased to look upon this obedience (though in it self imperfect) as that for which he accounted him, and would deal with him as a just and a righteous Man. And upon this account we find <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith opposed to a perfect and unsinning obedience,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.2, 3, &amp;c.</note> for thus the Apostle tells us, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was justified by faith, in opposition to his being justified by such an absolute and compleat obedience, as might have enabled him to challenge the reward by the strict Laws of Justice: whereas now his being pardoned and accepted by God in the way of a mean and imperfect obedience, it could not claim impunity, much less a reward, but must be intirely owing to the Divine grace and favour.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. HAVING thus cleared our way, by restoring these words to their genuine and native sence, we come to shew, how the Apostle in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses does all along refer to the Original controversie between the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi>-Converts, whether Justification was by the observation of the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law, or by the belief and practice of the Gospel: and this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we consider the persons that he has to deal with, the way and manner of his arguing, and that there was then no other controversie on foot, to which these passages could refer. The Persons whom he had to deal with, were chiefly of two sorts, pure <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Jewish</hi> Converts. Pure <hi>Jews</hi> were those that kept themselves wholly to the Legal Oeconomy, and expected to be justified and saved in no other way, than the observation of the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> Indeed they laid a more peculiar stress upon <hi>Circumcision,</hi> because this having been added as the Seal of that Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the discriminating badge whereby they were to be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from all other Nations, they looked upon it as having a special efficacy in it to recommend them to the Divine acceptance. Accordingly we find in their Writings that they make this the main Basis and Foundation of their hope and confidence towards God. For they tell us, that the Precept of Circumcision is greater than all the rest, and equivalent to the whole Law, that the reason why God hears the Prayers of the <hi>Israelites,</hi>

However nothing is more evident, than that Circumcision was the Fort and Sanctuary wherein they ordinarily placed their security, and accordingly we find <hi>S. Paul</hi> frequently disputing against Circumcision, as virtually comprizing, in their notion, the keeping of the whole <hi>Jewish</hi> Law. Besides, to these literal impositions of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> had added many vain <hi>Traditions</hi> and several superstitious usages of their own contrivance, in the observance whereof the People plac'd not a little confidence, as to that righteousness upon which they hoped to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98271:116"/>
stand clear with Heaven. Against all these our Apostle argues, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by arguments peculiar to them alone. <hi>Jewish</hi> Converts were those, who having embraced the Christian Religion, did yet out of a veneration to their ancient Rites, make the observance of them equally necessary with the belief and practice of Christianity both to themselves and others. These last were the Persons, who as they first started the controversie, so were those against whom the Apostle mainly opposed himself, endeavouring to dismount their pretences, and to beat down their Opinions level with the ground.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. THIS will yet further appear from the way and manner of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles arguing, which plainly respects this controversie, and will be best seen in some particular instances of his reasonings. And first, he argues, that this way of justification urged by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Jewish</hi> Converts was inconsistent with the goodness of God, and his universal kindness to Mankind, being so narrow and limited, that it excluded the far greatest part of the World. Thus in the three first Chapters of his Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> having proved at large that <hi>the whole World,</hi> both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile were under a state of guilt,</hi> and consequently liable to the Divine sentence and condemnation, he comes next to enquire by what means they may be delivered from this state of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and shews that it could not be by legal observances,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.20, 21, &amp;c.</note> but that now there was a way of righteousness or justification declared by <hi>Christ</hi> in the Gospel (intimated also in the Old Testament) extending to all, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whereby God with respect to the satisfaction and expiation of Christ is ready freely to pardon and justifie all penitent believers: That therefore there was a way revealed in the Gospel, whereby a man might be justified, without being beholden to the rites of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would argue that God had very little care of the greatest part of men. <hi>Is he God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: Seeing it is one God, which shall justifie the Circumcision by Faith, and the uncircumcision through Faith, Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> in the same Evangelical way. The force of which argument lies in this, That that cannot be necessary to our Justification, which excludes the greatest part of Mankind from all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of being justified (and this justification by the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law plainly does) a thing by no means consistent with God's universal love and kindness to his Creatures. Hence the Apostle magnifies the grace of the Gospel, that it has broken down the partition-wall, and made way for all Nations to come in, that <hi>now there is neither Greek nor Jew, Circumcision nor uncircumcision,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3.28.</note> 
                        <hi>Barbarian nor Scythian,</hi> no difference in this respect, but <hi>all one in Christ Jesus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 3.11.</note> all equally admitted to terms of pardon and justification,<note place="margin">Act. 10.35.</note> 
                        <hi>in every Nation he that feareth God, and worketh righteousness being accepted with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. SECONDLY, He argues, that this <hi>Jewish</hi> way of Justification could not be indispensibly necessary, in that it had not been the constant way whereby good men in all Ages had been justified and accepted with Heaven. This he eminently proves from the instance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom the Scripture sets forth as <hi>the Father of the faithful,</hi> and the great Exemplar of that way, wherein all his spiritual seed, all true Believers were to be justified. Now of him 'tis evident, that he was justified and accepted with God upon his practical belief of God's power and promise, before ever Circumcision, and much more before the rest of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Institution was in being. <hi>Cometh this blessedness then upon the Circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? For we say that Faith was reckoned unto Abraham for righteousness.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4.9, 10, 11, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>How was it then reckoned, when he was in Circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in Circumcision, but in uncircumcision. And he received the sign of Circumcision,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98271:117"/>
a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had being yet uncircumcised,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning whereof is plainly this, That pardon of sin cannot be entailed upon the way of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, it being evident, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified and approved of God, before he was Circumcised, which was only added as a seal of the Covenant between God and him, and a testimony of that acceptance with God, which he had obtained before. And this way of God's dealing with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him with all his spiritual children, the legal Institution could not make void, it being impossible that that dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which came so long after should disannul the Covenant which God had made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his spiritual seed CCCCXXX.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.17.</note> Years before. Upon this account,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11, 12.</note> as the Apostle observes, the Scripture sets forth <hi>Abraham</hi> as the great type and pattern of Justification, as <hi>the Father of all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though they be not Circumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also, and the father of Circumcision, to them who are not of the Circumcision only,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3.7, 8, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>but also walk in the steps of that Faith of our Father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised. They therefore that are of Faith, the same are the children of Abraham:</hi> And <hi>the Scripture foreseeing that God would justifie the Heathen through Faith, preached before the Gospel</hi> (this Evangelical way of justifying) <hi>unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all Nations be blessed, So then they which be of Faith,</hi> who believe and obey, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>shall be blessed,</hi> pardoned and saved, <hi>with faithful Abraham.</hi> It might further be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that this has ever been God's method of dealing with Mankind, our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the eleventh Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> proving all along by particular instances, that it was by such a Faith as this, without any relation to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that good men were justified and accepted with God in all Ages of the World.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. THIRDLY, He argues against this <hi>Jewish</hi> way of Justification from the deficiency and imperfection of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Oeconomy, not able to justifie and save sinners. Deficient, as not able to assist those that were under it with sufficient aids to perform what it required of them,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>This the Law could not do, for that it was weak through the flesh,</hi> till <hi>God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,</hi> to enable us, <hi>that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>could the Law have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the Law:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3.21.</note> But alas! the Scripture having concluded all Mankind, <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> under sin, and consequently incapable of being justified upon terms of perfect and intire obedience, there is now no other way but this, That <hi>the promise by the Faith of Christ be given to all them that believe, i. e.</hi> this Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical method of justifying sincere believers. Besides, the <hi>Jewish</hi> Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was deficient in pardoning sin, and procuring the grace and favour of God, it could only awaken the knowledge of sin, not remove the guilt of it: <hi>It was not possible that the blood of Bulls and Goats should take away sin</hi>; all the sacrifices of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law were no further available for the pardon of sin,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.4.</note> than merely as they were founded in, and had respect to that great sacrifice and expiation, which was to be made for the sins of Mankind by the death of the Son of God.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ibid.</hi> v. 11, 12.</note> 
                        <hi>The Priests, though they daily ministred, and oftentimes offered the same sacrifices, yet could they never take away sins:</hi> No, that was reserved for a better and a higher sacrifice, even that of our Lord himself, who <hi>after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God,</hi> having completed that, which the repeated sacrifices of the Law could never effect. So that all Men being under guilt, and no justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where there was no remission, the <hi>Jewish</hi> Oeconomy being in it self unable to pardon, was incapable to justifie. This <hi>S. Paul</hi> elsewhere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98271:117"/>
in an open Assembly before <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles; Be it known unto you,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 13.38, 39.</note> 
                        <hi>men and brethren, that through this man</hi> [Christ Jesus] <hi>is preached unto you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. FOURTHLY, He proves that Justification by the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law could not stand with the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> the necessity of whose death and sufferings it did plainly evacuate and take away. For if righteousness come by the Law, then <hi>Christ</hi> is dead in vain:<note place="margin">Gal. 2.21.</note> If the <hi>Mosaical</hi> performances be still necessary to our Justification, then certainly it was to very little purpose, and altogether unbecoming the wisdom and goodness of God, to send his own Son into the World, to do so much for us, and to suffer such exquisite pains and tortures. Nay, he tells them, that while they persisted in this fond obstinate opinion, all that <hi>Christ</hi> had done and suffered could be of no advantage to them. <hi>Stand fast in the liberty,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> wherewith Christ has made us free, and be not again intangled in the yoke of bondage,</hi> the bondage and servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> rites; <hi>Behold I Paul</hi> solemnly <hi>say unto you, That if you be Circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing: For I testifie again to every man that is Circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole Law; Christ is become of none effect to you; whosoever of you are justified by the Law, ye are fallen from grace.</hi> The sum of which argument is, That whoever lay the stress of their Justification upon Circumcision, and the observances of the Law, do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declare themselves to be under an obligation of perfect obedience to all that the Law requires of them, and accordingly supersede the vertue and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of <hi>Christ</hi>'s death, and disclaim all right and title to the grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Gospel. For since <hi>Christ</hi>'s death is abundantly sufficient to attain its ends, whoever takes in another, plainly renounces that, and rests upon that of his own chusing. By these ways of reasoning 'tis evident what the Apostle drives at in all his discourses about this matter. More might have been observed, had I not thought, that these are sufficient to render his design, especially to the unprejudiced and impartial, obvious and plain enough.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. LASTLY, That <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s discourses about Justification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do immediately refer to the controversie between the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing</hi> Christians, appears hence, that there was no other controversie then on foot, but concerning the way of Justification, whether it was by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or only of the Gospel and the Law of <hi>Christ.</hi> For we must needs suppose, that the Apostle wrote with a primary respect to the present state of things, and so as they whom he had to deal with, might, and could not but understand him: Which yet would have been impossible for them to have done, had he intended them for the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies which have since been bandied with so much zeal and fierceness, and to give countenance to those many nice and subtil propositions, those curious and elaborate schemes which some Men in these later Ages have drawn of these matters.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. FROM the whole discourse two <hi>Consectaries</hi> especially plainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. I, <hi>Consect. That works of Evangelical obedience are not opposed to Faith in Justification.</hi> By works of <hi>Evangelical obedience,</hi> I mean such Christian duties, as are the fruits, not of our own power and strength, but God's Spirit, done by the assistance of his grace. And that these are not opposed to <hi>Faith,</hi> is undeniably evident, in that (as we observed before) Faith as including the new nature, and the keeping God's commands, is made the usual condition of Justification. Nor can it be otherwise, when other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and virtues of the Christian life are made the terms of pardon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98271:118"/>
with Heaven, and of our title to the merits of <hi>Christ</hi>'s death, and the great promise of eternal life. Thus Repentance, which is not so much a single Act,<note place="margin">Acts 2.38.</note> as a complex body of Christian duties, <hi>Repent and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost</hi>;<note place="margin">Acts 3.17.</note> 
                        <hi>Repent and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.</hi> So Charity and forgiveness of others,<note place="margin">Mark 11.25, 26.</note> 
                        <hi>Forgive, if ye have ought against any, that your Father also which is in Heaven may forgive you your trespasses: For if ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give men their trespasses,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 6.14, 15.</note> 
                        <hi>your heavenly Father also will forgive you: But if ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive yours.</hi> Sometimes Evangelical obedience in general;<note place="margin">Acts 10.34, 35.</note> 
                        <hi>God is no respecter of persons, but in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness is accepted with him. If we walk in the light,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.7.</note> 
                        <hi>as God is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the bloud of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin.</hi> What priviledge then has Faith above other graces in this matter? are we justified by Faith? We are pardoned and accepted with God upon our repentance, charity, and other acts of Evangelical obedience. Is Faith opposed to the works of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law in Justification? so are works of Evangelical obedience; <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision is nothing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.19.</note> 
                        <hi>and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God.</hi> Does Faith give glory to God, and set the crown upon his head? Works of Evangelical obedience are equally the effects of Divine grace, both preventing and assisting of us, and indeed are not so much our works, as his: So that the glory of all must needs be intirely resolved into the grace of God, nor can any man in such circumstances with the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reason lay claim to merit, or boast of his own atchievments. Hence the Apostle magnifies the Evangelical method of Justification above that of the Law, that it wholly excludes all proud reflections upon our selves; <hi>Where is boasting then?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 3.27.</note> 
                        <hi>it is excluded. By what Law? of works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> The <hi>Mosaical</hi> Oeconomy softered men up in proud and high thoughts of themselves, they looked upon themselves as a peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, honoured above all other Nations of the World, the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> invested with mighty priviledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas the Gospel proceeding upon other principles, takes away all foundations of pride, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our acceptance with God, and the power whereby we are enabled to make good the terms and conditions of it, to be the mere result of the Divine grace and mercy, and that the whole <hi>scheme</hi> of our Salvation, as it was the contrivance of the Divine wisdom, so is the purchase of the merit and satisfaction of our crucified Saviour. Nor is Faith it self less than other graces an act of Evangelical obedience, and if separated from them, is of no moment or value in the accounts of Heaven:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.2.</note> 
                        <hi>Though I have all Faith, and have no Charity, I am nothing. All Faith,</hi> be it of what kind soever. To this may be added, that no tolerable account can be given, why that which is on all hands granted to be the condition of our Salvation (such is Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical obedience) should not be the condition of our Justification: And at the great Day Christians shall be acquitted or condemned according as in this World they have fulfilled or neglected the conditions of the Gospel: The decretory sentence of absolution that shall then be passed upon good men, shall be nothing but a publick and solemn declaration of that private sentence of Justification that was passed upon them in this World; so that upon the same terms that they are justified now, they shall be justified and acquitted then, and upon the same terms that they shall then be judged and acquitted, they are justified now, <hi>viz.</hi> an hearty belief, and a sincere obedience to the Gospel. From all which, I hope, 'tis evident, that when S. <hi>Paul</hi> denies men to be justified by the works of the Law; by works he either means works
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98271:118"/>
done before conversion, and by the strength of Mens natural powers, such as enabled them to pride and boast themselves, and lay claim to merit, or (which most-what includes the other) the works of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law. And indeed though the controversies on foot in those times did not plainly determine his reasonings that way, yet the considerations which we have now suggested; sufficiently shew that they could not be meant of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sence.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>CONSECT.</hi> II. <hi>That the doctrines of S.</hi> Paul <hi>and S.</hi> James <hi>about Justification are fairly consistent with each other.</hi> For seeing <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s design in excluding works from Justification, was only to deny the works of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, or those that were meritorious, as being wrought by our own strength, and in asserting that in opposition to such works we are <hi>justified by Faith,</hi> he meant no more than that either we are justified in an Evangelical way, or more particularly by Faith intended a practical-belief, including Evangelical obedience: And seeing on the other hand <hi>S. James</hi> in affirming <hi>that we are justified by Works, and not by Faith only</hi>; by works, means no more than Evangelical obedience, in opposition to a naked and an empty Faith; these two are so far from quarrelling, that they mutually embrace each other, and both in the main pursue the same design. And indeed if any disagreement seem between them, 'tis most reasonable that <hi>S. Paul</hi> should be expounded by <hi>S. James,</hi> not only because his propositions are so express and positive, and not justly liable to ambiguity, but because he wrote some competent time after the other, and consequently as he perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood his meaning, so he was capable to countermine those ill principles, which some men had built upon <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s assertions. For 'tis evident from several passages in <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s Epistles, that even then many began to mistake his doctrine, and from his assertions about Justification by Faith, and not by works, to infer propositions that might serve the purposes of a bad life; <hi>They slanderously reported him to say, that we might do evil, that good might come</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 3.8.</note> 
                        <hi>that we might continue in sin, that the grace of the Gospel might the more abound</hi>:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.1.</note> They thought that so long as they did but believe the Gospel in the naked notion and speculation of it, it was enough to recommend them to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and to serve all the purposes of Justification and Salvation, however they shaped and steered their lives. Against these men 'tis beyond all question plain, that <hi>S. James</hi> levels his Epistle, to batter down the growing doctrines of Libertinism and Prophaneness, to shew the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of a naked Faith, and an empty profession of Religion,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid.</hi> Chap. 2. v. 14, 15, <hi>&amp; seqq.</hi>
                        </note> that 'tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to recommend us to the Divine acceptance, and to justifie us in the sight of Heaven, barely to believe the Gospel, unless we really obey and practise it; that a Faith destitute of this Evangelical obedience is fruitless and unprofitable to Salvation; that 'tis by these works that Faith must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be vital and sincere; that not only <hi>Rahab,</hi> but <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful, was justified not by a bare belief of God's promise, but an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty obedience to God's command, in the ready offer of his Son, whereby it appears that his Faith and Obedience did co-operate and conspire together, to render him capable of God's favour and approbation, and that <hi>herein the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith, That Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness,</hi> (whence by the way nothing can be clearer, than that both these Apostles intend the same thing by <hi>Faith</hi> in the case of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Justification, and its being <hi>imputed to him for righteousness, viz.</hi> a practical belief and obedience to the commands of God) that it follows hence, that Faith is not of it self sufficient to justifie and make us acceptable to God, unless a proportionable Obedience be joyned with it; without
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98271:119"/>
which Faith serves no more to these ends and purposes, than a Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of the Soul to animate and enliven it, is capable to exercise the functions and offices of the natural life. His meaning in short being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, than that good works, or Evangelical obedience is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Divine appointment, the condition of the Gospel-Covenant, without which 'tis in vain for any to hope for that pardon which <hi>Christ</hi> hath purchased, and the favour of God, which is necessary to Eternal Life.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THE Sacred Story, which has hitherto been very large and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in describing the Acts of the two first Apostles, is hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward very sparing in its accounts, giving us only now and then a few oblique and accidental remarks concerning the rest, and some of them no further mentioned, than the mere recording of their Names. For what reasons it pleased the Divine wisdom and providence, that no more of their Acts should be consigned to Writing by the Pen-men of the Holy story, is to us unknown. Probably, it might be thought convenient, that no more account should be given of the first plantations of Christianity in the World, than what concerned <hi>Judaea,</hi> and the Neighbour-countries, at least the most eminent places of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that so the truth of the Prophetical Predictions might appear, which had foretold, that the <hi>Law</hi> of the Messiah <hi>should come forth from Sion, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that a particular relation of the Acts of so many Apostles, done in so many several Countries, might have swell'd the Holy Volumes into too great a bulk, and rendred them less serviceable and accommodate to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary use of Christians. Among the Apostles that succeed we first take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of S. <hi>Andrew.</hi> He was born at <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> a City of <hi>Galilee,</hi> standing upon the banks of the Lake of <hi>Gennesareth,</hi> Son to <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Jonas</hi> a Fisherman of that Town; Brother he was to <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> but whether Elder or Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Ancients do not clearly decide, though the major part intimate him to have been the younger Brother, there being only the single authority of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> on the other side, as we have formerly noted. He was brought up to his Father's Trade, whereat he laboured, till our Lord called him from catching <hi>Fish,</hi> to be a <hi>Fisher of men,</hi> for which he was fitted by some prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Institutions, even before his coming unto <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>JOHN</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> was lately risen in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, a Person whom for the efficacy and impartiality of his Doctrine, and the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strictness and austerities of his Life, the <hi>Jews</hi> generally had in great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. He trained up his <hi>Proselytes</hi> under the Discipline of Repentance, and by urging upon them a severe change and reformation of life, prepared them to entertain the Doctrine of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whose approach, he told them, was now near at hand, representing to them the greatness of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the importance of the design that he was come upon. Beside the multitudes that promiscuously flock'd to the <hi>Baptists</hi> discourses, he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Masters some peculiar and select Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, who more constantly attended upon his Lectures, and for the most part waited upon his Person. In the number of these was our Apostle, who was then with him about <hi>Jordan,</hi> when our Saviour, who some time since had been baptized, came that way: upon whose appraoch the <hi>Baptist</hi> told them, that this was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the great Person whom he had so often spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, to usher in whose appearing his whole Ministry was but subservient, that this was <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> the true Sacrifice that was to expiate the sins of Mankind. Upon this testimony <hi>Andrew</hi> and another Disciple (probably S. <hi>John</hi>) follow our Saviour to the place of his abode.<note place="margin">

After some converse with him, <hi>Andrew</hi> goes to acquaint his Brother <hi>Simon,</hi> and both together came to <hi>Christ.</hi> Long they stayed not with him, but returned to their own home, and to the exercise of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, wherein they were employed, when somewhat more than a Year after our Lord passing through <hi>Galilee,</hi> found them fishing upon the Sea of <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> where he fully satisfied them of the Greatness and Divinity of his Person by the convictive evidence of that miraculous draught of Fishes, which they took at his command. And now he told them he had other work for them to do, that they should no longer deal in <hi>Fish,</hi> but with <hi>Men,</hi> whom they should catch with the efficacy and influence of that Doctrine, that he was come to deliver to the World; commanding them to follow him, as his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Disciples and Attendants, who accordingly left all and followed him. Shortly after S. <hi>Andrew</hi> together with the rest was called to the Office and Honour of the Apostolate, made choice of to be one of those that were to be <hi>Christ</hi>'s immediate Vicegerents for planting and propagating the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church.

Having here converted and baptized many, ordered their publick Meeting, and ordained them Priests, he went next to <hi>Trapezus,</hi> a maritime City upon the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, whence after many other places he came to <hi>Nice,</hi> where he staid two Years, Preaching and working Miracles with great success: thence to <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and so to <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> whence sailing through the <hi>Propontis</hi> he came by the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea to <hi>Heraclea,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Amastris:</hi> in all which places he met with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and discouragements, but overcame all with an invincible patience and resolution. He next came to <hi>Sinope,</hi> a City situate upon the same Sea, a place famous both for the birth and burial of the great King <hi>Mithridates</hi>; here, as my Author reports from the <hi>Ancients</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

The Inhabitants of this City were most <hi>Jews,</hi> who partly through zeal for their Religion, partly through the barbarousness of their manners, were quickly exasperated against the

Apostle, and contriving together attempted to burn the House, wherein he sojourned: however they treated him with all the instances of savage cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, throwing him to the ground, stamping upon him with their Feet, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and dragging him from place to place, some beating him with Clubs, others pelting him with stones, and some the better to satisfie their revenge, biting off his Flesh with their Teeth; till apprehending they had fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched him, they cast him out of the City. But he miraculously recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and publickly returned into the City, whereby and by some other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which he wrought amongst them, he reduced many to a better mind, converting them to the Faith. Departing hence, he went again to <hi>Amynsus,</hi> and then to <hi>Trapezus,</hi> thence to <hi>Neocaesarea</hi>; and to <hi>Samosata</hi> (the birth-place of the witty but impious <hi>Lucian</hi>) where having baffled the acute and wise Philosophers, he purposed to return to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Whence after some time he betook himself to his former Provinces, travelling to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Abasgi,</hi> where at <hi>Sebastople,</hi> situate upon the <hi>Eastern</hi> shore of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, between the influx of the Rivers <hi>Phasis</hi> and <hi>Apsarus,</hi> he success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Preached the Gospel to the Inhabitants of that City. Hence he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Country of the <hi>Zecchi,</hi> and the <hi>Bosphorani,</hi> part of the <hi>Asiatick Scythia</hi> or <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> but finding the Inhabitants very barbarous and intract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he staid not long among them, only at <hi>Cherson,</hi> or <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> a great and populous City within the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> he continued some time, instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confirming them in the Faith. Hence taking Ship he sailed cross the Sea to <hi>Sinope,</hi> to encourage and confirm the Churches which he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly planted in those parts, and here he ordained <hi>Philologus,</hi> formerly one of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Disciples, Bishop of that City.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

To him the Apostle resolutely makes his address, calmly puts him in mind, that he being but a judge of men should own and revere him, who was the supreme and impartial Judge of all, that he should give him that Divine honour that was due to him, and leave off the impieties of his false Heathen-worship. The <hi>Proconsul</hi> derided him as an Innovator in Religion, a propagator of that superstition, whose Author the <hi>Jews</hi> had infamously put to death upon a Cross. Hereat the Apostle took occasion to discourse to him of the infinite love and kindness of our Lord, who came into the World to purchase the Salvation of mankind, and for that end did not disdain to die upon the Cross. To whom the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consul</hi> answered, that he might perswade them so, that would believe him; for his part, if he did not comply with him in doing sacrifice to the Gods, he would cause him to suffer upon that Cross, which he had so much extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and magnified. S. <hi>Andrew</hi> replied, That he did sacrifice every day to God, the only true and omnipotent Being, not with fumes and bloudy offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but in the sacrifice of the immaculate Lamb of God. The issue was, the Apostle was committed to prison, whereat the people were so enraged, that it had broken out into a mutiny, had not the Apostle restrained them, perswading them to imitate the mildness and patience of our meek humble Saviour, and not to hinder him from that crown of Martyrdom that now waited for him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. THE next day he was again brought before the <hi>Proconsul,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him that he would not foolishly destroy himself, but live and enjoy with him the pleasures of this life. The Apostle told him, that he should have with him eternal joys, if renouncing his execrable idolatries, he would heartily entertain Christianity, which he had hitherto so successfully preached amongst them. That, answered the <hi>Proconsul,</hi> is the very reason, why I am so earnest with you to sacrifice to the Gods, that those whom you have every where seduced, may by your example be brought to return back to that ancient Religion, which they have forsaken: Otherwise I'le cause you with exquisite tortures to be crucified. The Apostle replied, That now he saw it was in vain any longer to deal with him, a person incapable of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber counsels, and hardned in his own blindness and folly; that as for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he might do his worst, and if he had one torment greater than another, he might heap that upon him: The greater constancy he shewed in his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for <hi>Christ,</hi> the more acceptable he should be to his Lord and Master. <hi>Aegeas</hi> could now hold no longer, but passed the sentence of death upon him; and <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Nicephorus</hi> gives us some more particular account of the <hi>Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul</hi>'s displeasure and rage against him, which was, that amongst others he had converted his wife <hi>Maximilla,</hi> and his brother <hi>Stratocles</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, having cured them of desperate distempers that had seized upon them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98271:122"/>
Cross, he saluted it with this kind of address, That he had long desired and expected this happy hour, that the Cross had been consecrated by the body of <hi>Christ</hi> hanging on it, and adorned with his members as with so many inestimable Jewels, that he came joyful and triumphing to it, that it might receive him as a disciple and follower of him, who once hung upon it, and be the means to carry him safe unto his Master, having been the instrument upon which his Master had redeemed him. Having prayed, and exhorted the people to constancy and perseverance in that Religion which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to them, he was fastned to the Cross, whereon he hung two days, teaching and instructing the people all the time, and when great importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the mean while were used to the <hi>Proconsul</hi> to spare his life, he earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begged of our Lord, that he might at this time depart and seal the truth of his Religion with his bloud.

For my part, if any ground of truth in the story, I believe it no more, than that it was an exhalation and sweating forth at some times of those rich costly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes and ointments, wherewith his Body was embalmed after his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion. Though I must confess this conjecture to be impossible, if it be true what my <hi>Author</hi> adds, that some years the Oil burst out in such plenty, that the stream arose to the middle of the Church.

the blessings of Heaven meet men in the way of an honest and industrious diligence, it was in the exercise of this calling, when our Saviour passing by the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> saw him and his brother in the Ship, and called them to be his Disciples. A Divine power went along with the word, which they no sooner heard, but chearfully complied with it, immediately leaving all to follow him. They did not stay to dispute his commands, to argue the probability of his promise, solicitously to enquire into the minute conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the undertaking, what troubles and hazards might attend this new employment, but readily delivered up themselves to whatever services he should appoint them. And the chearfulness of their obedience is yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther considerable, that they left their aged Father in the Ship behind them.<note place="margin">Luk. 9.59-61.</note> For elsewhere we find others excusing themselves from an immediate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon Christ, upon pretence that they must go bury their Father, or take their leave of their kindred at home. No such slight and trivial preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could stop the resolution of our Apostles, who broke through these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, and quitted their present interests and relations. Say not it was unnaturally done of them to desert their Father, an aged person, and in some measure unable to help himself. For, besides that they left servants with him to attend him, it is not cruelty to our Earthly, but obedience to our Heavenly Father, to leave the one, that we may comply with the call and summons of the other. It was the triumph of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, when God called him to leave his kindred and his Father's house, <hi>to go out,</hi> and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ in a foreign Country, <hi>not knowing whither he went.</hi> Nor can we doubt but that <hi>Zebedee</hi> himself would have gone along with them, had not his Age given him a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> from such an active and ambulatory course of life. But though they left him at this time, it's very reasonable to suppose, that they took care to instruct him in the doctrine of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and to acquaint him with the glad tidings of Salvation, especially since we find their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Salome</hi> so hearty a friend to, so constant a follower of our Saviour:<note place="margin">

                  <p n="3">3. IT was not long after this, that he was called from the station of an ordinary Disciple, to the Apostolical Office, and not only so, but honoured with some peculiar acts of favour beyond most of the Apostles, being one of the three, whom our Lord usually made choice of to admit to the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate transactions of his life, from which the others were excluded. Thus with <hi>Peter</hi> and his Brother <hi>John</hi> he was taken to the miraculous raising of <hi>Jairus</hi> his Daughter; admitted to <hi>Christ</hi>'s glorious transfiguration upon the Mount, and the discourses that there passed between him and the two great Ministers of Heaven; taken along with him into the Garden, to be a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator of those bitter Agonies, which the Holy <hi>Jesus</hi> was to undergo as the preparatory sufferings to his Passion. What were the reasons of our Lord's admitting these three Apostles to these more special acts of favour than the rest, is not easie to determine: though surely our Lord, who governed all his actions by Principles of the highest prudence and reason, did it for wise and proper ends; whether it was that he designed these three to be more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and peculiar witnesses of some particular passages of his life, than the other Apostles, or that they would be more eminently useful and service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in some parts of the Apostolick Office, or that hereby he would the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepare and encourage them against suffering, as intending them for some more eminent kinds of Martyrdom or suffering, than the rest were to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo.</p>

NOR was it the least instance of that particular honour which our Lord conferr'd upon these three Apostles, that at his calling them to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolate</hi> he gave them the addition of a new Name and Title.

                  <p n="5">5. HOWEVER it was, our Lord, I doubt not, herein had respect to the furious and resolute disposition of those two Brothers, who seem to have been of a more fierce and fiery temper than the rest of the Apostles: whereof we have this memorable instance. Our Lord being resolved upon his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> sent some of his Disciples as Harbingers to prepare his way, who coming to a Village of <hi>Samaria,</hi> were uncivilly rejected, and refused entertainment; probably, because of that old and inveterate quarrel that was between the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> and more especially at this time, because that our Saviour seemed to slight Mount <hi>Gerizim</hi> (where was their staple and solemn place of worship) by passing it by, to go worship at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>; the reason in all likelihood why they denied him those common cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies and conveniences due to all Travellers. This piece of rudeness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity was presently so deeply resented by S. <hi>James,</hi> and his Brother, that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98271:125"/>
they came to their Master to know, whether as <hi>Elias</hi> did of old,<note place="margin">Luke 9.54.</note> they might not pray down Fire from Heaven to consume these barbarous and inhospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table People. So apt are Men for every trifle to call upon Heaven, to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to the extravagances of their own impotent and unreasonable passions. But our Lord rebukes their zeal, tells them they quite mistook the case, that this was not the frame and temper of his Disciples and Followers, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and design of that Evangelical dispensation, that he was come to set on foot in the World, which was a more pure and perfect, a more mild and gentle Institution, than what was under the Old Testament in the times of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias, the Son of Man being come not to destroy mens lives, but to save them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. THE Holy <hi>Jesus</hi> not long after set forwards in his Journy to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in order to his crucifixion, and the better to prepare the minds of his Apostles for his death and departure from them, he told them what he was to suffer, and yet that after all he should rise again. They, whose minds were yet big with expectations of a temporal power and monarchy, understood not well the meaning of his discourses to them. However S. <hi>James</hi> and his Brother supposing the Resurrection that he spoke of, would be the time, when his Power and Greatness would commence,<note place="margin">Matth. 20.20.</note> prompted their Mother <hi>Salome</hi> to put up a Petition for them. She, presuming probably on her relation to <hi>Christ,</hi> and knowing that our Saviour had promised his Apostles, <hi>that when he was come into his Kingdom, they should sit upon twelve Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of Israel</hi>; and that he had already honoured her two Sons with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate familiarity, after leave modestly asked for her address, begg'd of him, that when he took possession of his Kingdom, her two Sons <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> might have the principal places of honour and dignity next his own Person, the one sitting on his <hi>right hand,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> on his <hi>left,</hi> as the Heads of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> had the first places among the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>Tribes</hi> in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation. Our Lord directing his discourse to the two Apostles, at whose sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion he knew their Mother had made this address, told them, they quite mistook the nature of his Kingdom, which consisted not in external grandeur and soveraignty, but in an inward life and power, wherein the highest place would be to take the greatest pains, and to undergo the heaviest troubles and sufferings; that they should do well to consider, whether they were able to endure, what he was to undergo, to drink of that bitter <hi>Cup</hi> which he was to drink of, and to go through that <hi>Baptism,</hi> wherein he was shortly to be baptized in his own bloud. Our Apostles were not yet cured of their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humour, but either not understanding the force of our Saviour's reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or too confidently presuming upon their own strength, answered, that they could do all this. But he, the goodness of whose nature ever made him put the best and most candid interpretation upon mens words and actions, yea even those of his greatest enemies, did not take the advantage of their hasty and inconsiderate reply, to treat them with sharp and quick reproofs, but mildly owning their forwardness to suffer, told them, that as for suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they should indeed suffer as well as he (and so we accordingly find they did, S. <hi>James</hi> after all dying a violent death, S. <hi>John</hi> enduring great miseries and torments, and might we believe <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and <hi>Theophylact,</hi> Martyrdom it self, though others nearer to those times assure us, he died a natural death) but for any peculiar honour or dignity he would not by an absolute and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory favour of his own dispose it any otherwise, than according to those rules and instructions which he had received of his Father. The rest of the Apostles were offended with this ambitious request of <hi>the Sons of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedee</hi>; but our Lord to calm their passions, discoursed to them of the nature
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98271:126"/>
of the Evangelick state, that it was not here, as in the Kingdoms and <hi>seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories</hi> of this World, where the great ones receive homage and fealty from those that are under them, but that in his service humility was the way to honour, that who ever took most pains, and did most good, would be the greatest Person, pre-eminence being here to be measured by industry and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and a ready condescension to the meanest offices that might be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to the Souls of Men, and that this was no more than what he suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently taught them by his own Example, being come into the World, not to be served himself with any pompous circumstances of state and splendor, but to serve others, and to lay down his life for the redemption of Mankind.

In seven days they arrived at a Port in <hi>Spain,</hi> where landing, the Corps was suddenly taken from them, and with great appearances of an extraordinary light from Heaven, conveyed they knew not whither, to the place of its interment. The men you may imagine were exceedingly troubled, that so great a treasure should be ravished from them; but upon their prayers and tears they were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Angel to the place where the Apostle was buried, twelve miles from the Sea. Here they addressed themselves to a rich Noble <hi>Matron,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Luparia,</hi> who had a great Estate in those parts, but a severe Idolatress, begging of her, that they might have leave to entomb the bones of the holy Apostle within her jurisdiction. She entertained them with contempt and scorn, with curses and execrations, bidding them go and ask leave of the King of the Country. They did so, but were by him treated with all the instances of rage and fury, and pursued by him, till himself perished in the attempt. They returned back to their <hi>Gallaecian</hi> Matron, whom by many miracles, and especially the destroying a <hi>Dragon</hi> that miserably infested those parts, they at last made Convert to the Faith, who thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her Images to be broken, the Altars to be demolished, and her own <hi>Idol-Temple,</hi> being cleansed and purged, to be dedicated to the honour of S. <hi>James,</hi> by which means Christianity mightily prevailed, and triumphed over Idolatry in all those Countries. This is the summ of the Account, call it Romance or History, which I do not desire to impose any further upon the Readers faith, than he shall find himself disposed to believe it.

                     <hi>S.

But the nobility of his Family, and especially that it should be such as to procure him so much respect from persons of the highest rank and quality, seems not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with the meanness of his Father's Trade, and the privacy of his fortunes. And for his acquaintance with the High-Priest, I should rather put it upon some other account, especially if it be true what <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Nicephorus</hi> relates, That he had lately sold his Estate left by his Father in <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Annas</hi> the High-Priest, and had therewith purchased a fair house at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> about Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> whence he became acquainted with him. Before his coming to <hi>Christ,</hi> he seems for some time to have been Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> being probably that <hi>other disciple</hi> that was with <hi>Andrew,</hi> when they left the <hi>Baptist</hi> to follow our Saviour, so particularly does he relate all circumstances of that transaction, though modestly, as in other parts of his Gospel, concealing his own name. He was at the same time with his Brother called by our Lord both to the Discipleship and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolate, by far the youngest of all the Apostles, as the Ancients generally affirm, and his great Age seems to evince, living near LXX years after our Saviour's suffering.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. THERE is not much said concerning him in the Sacred story, more than what is recorded of him in conjunction with his Brother <hi>James,</hi> which we have already remarked in his life. He was peculiarly dear to his Lord and Master, being <hi>the Disciple whom Jesus loved,</hi> that is, treated with more freedom and familiarity than the rest. And indeed he was not only one of the Three, whom our Saviour made partakers of the private
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98271:129"/>
passages of his life, but had some instances of a more particular kindness and favour conferred upon him. Witness his lying in our Saviour's <hi>bosom</hi> at the <hi>Paschal</hi> Supper, it being the custom of those times to lie along at meals upon Couches, so that the second lay with his head in the bosom of him that was before him; this honourable place was not given to any of the Aged, but reserved for our Apostle: Nay, when <hi>Peter</hi> was desirous to know, which of them our Saviour meant, when he told them that one of them should betray him, and durst not himself propound the question, he made use of <hi>S. John</hi> (whose familiarity with him might best warrant such an enquiry) to ask our Lord; who thereupon made them understand, 'twas <hi>Judas</hi> whom he designed by the <hi>Traitor.</hi> This favour our Apostle endeavoured in some measure to answer by returns of particular kindness and constancy to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, staying with him, when the rest deserted him. Indeed upon our Lord's first apprehension he fled after the other Apostles, it not being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some probabilities of reason, that the Ancients conceive him to have been that <hi>young man</hi> that followed after <hi>Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 14.51.</note> having a linnen cloath cast about his naked body, whom when the Officers laid hold upon, he left the linnen cloath, and fled naked from them. This in all likelihood was that garment that he had cast about him at Supper (for they had peculiar Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for that purpose) and being extremely affected with the Treason, and our Lord's approaching Passion, had forgot to put on his other garments, but followed him into the Garden in the same habit wherewith he arose from the Table, it being then night, and so less liable to be taken notice of either by himself or others. But though he fled at present to avoid that sudden violence that was offered to him, yet he soon recovered himself, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back to seek his Master, confidently entred into the High-Priests Hall, and followed our Lord through the several passages of his Trial, and at last waited upon him (and for any thing we know, was the only Apostle that did so) at his Execution, owning him, as well as being own'd by him, in the midst of arms and guards, and in the thickest crowds of his most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemies. Here it was that our Lord by his last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament</hi> made upon the Cross, appointed him <hi>Guardian</hi> of his own Mother, the Blessed <hi>Virgin; When he saw his Mother,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 19.26, 27.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Disciple standing by whom he loved, he said unto his Mother, Woman, behold thy Son,</hi> see, here is one that shall supply my place, and be to thee instead of a Son, to love and honour thee, to provide and take care for thee: <hi>and to the Disciple he said, Behold thy Mother</hi>; Her, whom thou shalt henceforth deal with, treat and observe with that duty and honourable regard, which the relation of an indulgent Mother challenges from a pious and obedient Son: whereupon <hi>he took her into his own House,</hi> her Husband <hi>Joseph</hi> being some time since dead, and made her a principal part of his charge and care. And certainly the Holy <hi>Jesus</hi> could not have given a more honourable testimony of his particular respect and kindness to <hi>S. John,</hi> than to commit his own Mother, whom of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Relations he held most dear and valuable, to his trust and care, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute him to supply that duty which he himself paid her while he was here below.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. AT the first news of our Lord's return from the dead, he, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with <hi>Peter,</hi> presently hasted to the Sepulchre. Indeed there seems to have been a mutual intimacy between these two Apostles more than the rest. 'Twas to <hi>Peter</hi> that <hi>S. John</hi> gave the notice of <hi>Christ</hi>'s appearing, when he came to them at the Sea of <hi>Tiberias</hi> in the habit of a stranger; and it was for <hi>John</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> was so solicitously inquisitive to know what should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him. After <hi>Christ</hi>'s Ascension, we find these two going up to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98271:130"/>
the <hi>Temple</hi> at the Hour of Prayer, and miraculously healing the poor impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Cripple; both Preaching to the People, and both apprehended together by the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Sadducees,</hi> and thrown into Prison, and the next Day brought forth to plead their cause before the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> These were the two chosen by the Apostles to send down to <hi>Samaria,</hi> to settle and confirm the Plantations which <hi>Philip</hi> had made in those Parts, where they confounded and baffled <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Magician,</hi> and set him in an hopeful way to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. To these <hi>S.

Which being done, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Grave to be immediately dug, and having instructed them in the more recondite mysteries of <hi>Theologie,</hi> the most excellent Precepts of a good Life, concerning Faith, Hope, and especially Charity, confirmed them in the practice of Religion, commended them to the care and blessing of our Saviour, and solemnly taking his leave of them, he signed himself with the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and before them all went down into the Grave; strictly charging them, to put on the Grave-stone, and to make it fast, and the next day to come and open it, and take a view of it. They did so, and having opened the Sepulchre, found nothing there but the Grave-clothes which he had left behind him.

These words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his, his disciples and followers misunderstanding, and perverting things to the worst sence imaginable, began to let loose the reins, and hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwards to give themselves over to the greatest filthiness, the most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and impudent uncleanness, throwing down all inclosures, making the most promiscuous mixtures lawful, and pleasure the ultimate end and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of Man. Such were their principles, such their practices; whereas <hi>Nicolas,</hi> their pretended Patron and Founder, was (says <hi>Clemens</hi>) a sober and a temperate Man, never making use of any but his own Wife, by whom he had one <hi>Son,</hi> and several Daughters, who all liv'd in perpetual Virginity.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. THE last instance that we shall remark of our Apostles care for the good of the Church, is the Writings which he left to Posterity. Whereof the first in time, though plac'd last, is his <hi>Apocalypse</hi> or Book of <hi>Revelations,</hi> written while confined in <hi>Patmos.</hi> It was of old not only rejected by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but controverted by many of the Fathers themselves. <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Alexandria</hi> has a very large discourse concerning it; he tells us, that many plainly disowned this Book, not only for the matter, but the Author of it, as being neither Apostle, no nor any Holy or Ecclesiastical Person; that <hi>Cerinthus</hi> prefixed
<hi>S. John</hi>'s name to it, to give the more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible title to his Dream of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Reign upon Earth, and that sensual and carnal state that should attend it: that for his part he durst not reject it, looking upon it as containing wise and admirable mysteries, though he could not fathom and comprehend them, that he did not measure them by his own line, nor condemn, but rather admire what he could not understand; that he owned the Author to have been an holy, and <hi>divinely-inspired</hi> Person, but could not believe it to be <hi>S. John</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>Evangelist,</hi> neither stile, matter, nor method agreeing with his other Writings; that in this he frequently names himself, which he never does in any other; that there were several <hi>Johns</hi> at that time, and two buried at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the <hi>Apostle,</hi> and another, one of the Disciples that dwelt in <hi>Asia,</hi> but which the Author of this Book, he leaves uncertain. But though doubted of by some, it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the far greater part of the Ancients as the genuine work of our <hi>S. John.</hi> Nor could the setting down his Name be any reasonable excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for whatever he might do in his other Writings, especially his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, where it was less necessary, Historical matters depending not so much upon his authority, yet it was otherwise in Prophetick Revelations, where the Person of the Revealer adds great weight and moment, the reason why some of the Prophets under the Old Testament did so frequently set down
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98271:133"/>
their own Names. The diversity of the stile is of no considerable value in this case, it being no wonder, if in arguments so vastly different the same Person did not always observe the same tenor and way of writing; whereof there want not instances in some others of the Apostolick Order. The truth is, all circumstances concur to intitle our Apostle to be the Author of it, his name frequently expressed, its being written in the Island of <hi>Patmos</hi> (a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance not competible to any but <hi>S.

That which seems to have given ground to doubt concerning both its Author and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, was its being long before it was usually joyned with the other Books of the holy <hi>Canon:</hi> for containing in it some passages directly levell'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Seat of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, others which might be thought to symbolize with some <hi>Jewish</hi> dreams and figments, it might possibly seem fit to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of those Times for a while to suppress it.

Two causes especially contributed to the writing of it; the one, that he might obviate the early heresies of those times, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus,</hi> and the rest of that crew, who began openly to deny <hi>Christ</hi>'s Divinity, and that he had any existence before his Incarnation; the reason why our Evangelist is so express and copious in that subject. <note n="‖" place="margin">

make use of <hi>S. John</hi> for its Pen-man and Secretary, in the composure whereof though his stile and character be not florid and elegant, yet is it grave and simple, short and perspicuous. <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> tells us, that in his Gospel and first Epistle his phrase is more neat and elegant, there being an accuracy in the contexture both of words and matter, that runs through all the reasonings of his discourses; but that in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> the stile is nothing so pure and clear, being frequently mixed with more barbarous and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per phrases. Indeed his <hi>Greek</hi> generally abounds with <hi>Syriasms,</hi> his discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses many times abrupt, set off with frequent <hi>antitheses,</hi> connected with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulatives, passages often repeated, things at first more obscurely propounded, and which he is forced to enlighten with subsequent explications, words pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to himself, and phrases used in an uncommon sence. All which concur to render his way of Writing less grateful, possibly, to the Masters of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and an elaborate curiosity. <note n="*" place="margin">

The Country it self, because bordering upon the Idolatrous uncircumcised Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, called <hi>Galilee of the Gentiles</hi>; the people generally beheld as more rude and boisterous, more unpolished and barbarous than the rest, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable either for Civility or Religion.<note place="margin">John 4.45.</note> 
                     <hi>The Galileans received him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the Feast, for they also went up unto the Feast</hi>; as if it had been a wonder, and a matter of very strange remark, to see so much devotion in them as to attend the solemnity of the <hi>Passeover.</hi> Indeed both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> conspired in this, that they thought they could not fix a greater title of reproach upon our Saviour and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, than that of <hi>Galilean.</hi>

                     <hi>Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?</hi> a City in this Province,<note place="margin">John 7.52.</note> said <hi>Nathanael</hi> concerning <hi>Christ. Search and look</hi> (say the <hi>Pharisees</hi>) <hi>for out of Galilee ariseth no Prophet</hi>; as if nothing but briars and thorns could grow in that soil. But there needs no more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this ill-natured opinion, than that our Lord not only made choice of it as the seat of his ordinary residence and retreat, but that hence he chose those excellent persons, whom he made his Apostles, the great instruments to convert the World. Some of these we have already given an account of, and more are yet behind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. OF this number was S. <hi>Philip,</hi> born at <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> a Town near the Sea of <hi>Tiberias, the City of Andrew and Peter.</hi> Of his Parents and way of life the History of the Gospel takes no notice, though probably he was a Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Trade general of that place. He had the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the honour of being <hi>first</hi> called to the Discipleship, which thus came to pass. Our Lord soon after his return from the wilderness having met with <hi>Andrew</hi> and his brother <hi>Peter,</hi> after some short discourse parted from them: And the very next day,<note place="margin">John 1.44.</note> as he was passing through <hi>Galilee,</hi> he found <hi>Philip,</hi> whom he presently commanded to <hi>follow him,</hi> the constant form which he used in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king choice of his Disciples, and those that did inseparably attend upon him. So that the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or prerogative of being first called, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently belongs to <hi>Philip,</hi> he being the first-fruits of our Lord's Disciples. For though <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were the first that came to, and conversed with <hi>Christ,</hi> yet did they immediately return to their Trade again, and were not called to the Discipleship till above a whole year after, when <hi>John</hi> was cast into prison. <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> tells us, that it was <hi>Philip,</hi> to whom our Lord said (when he would have excused himself at present, that he must go bury his Father) <hi>Let the dead bury their dead, but follow thou me.</hi> But besides that he gives no account, whence he derived this intelligence, it is plainly inconsistent with the time of our Apostle's call, who was called to be a Disciple a long time before that speech and passage of our Saviour. It may seem justly strange that <hi>Philip</hi> should at first sight so readily comply with our Lord's command, and turn himself over into his service, having not yet seen any miracle, that might evince his <hi>Messiah-ship,</hi> and Divine Commission, nor probably so much as heard any tidings of his appearance; and especially being a <hi>Galilean,</hi> and so of a more rustick and unyielding temper. But it cannot be doubted but that he was admirably versed in the writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets.</hi>

                     <hi>Metaphrastes</hi> assures us (though how he came to know it otherwise than by conjecture, I cannot imagine) that from his childhood he had excellent education, that he frequently read over <hi>Moses</hi> his Books, and considered the Prophecies that related to our
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98271:136"/>
Saviour: And was no question awakened with the general expectations that were then on foot among the <hi>Jews</hi> (the date of the Prophetick Scriptures concerning the time of <hi>Christ</hi>'s coming being now run out) that the <hi>Messiah</hi> would immediately appear. Add to this, that the Divine grace did more immediately accompany the command of <hi>Christ,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and dispose him to believe, that this person was that very <hi>Messiah</hi> that was to come.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. NO sooner had Religion taken possession of his mind, but like an active principle it began to ferment, and diffuse it self. Away he goes, and finds <hi>Nathanael,</hi> a person of note and eminency, acquaints him with the tidings of the new-found <hi>Messiah,</hi> and conducts him to him. So forward is a good man to draw and direct others in the same way to happiness with himself. After his call to the Apostleship much is not recorded of him in the Holy story: 'Twas to him that our Saviour propounded the question, What they should do for so much bread in the wilderness,<note place="margin">John 6.5.</note> as would feed so vast a multitude, to which he answered, That so much was not easily to be had; not considering, that to feed two or twenty thousand are equally easie to Almighty Power, when pleased to exert it self.<note place="margin">John 12.22.</note> 'Twas to him that the <hi>Gentile Proselytes</hi> that came up to the <hi>Passeover</hi> addressed themselves, when desirous to see our Saviour, a person of whom they had heard so loud a fame. 'Twas with him that our Lord had that discourse concerning himself a little before the last <hi>Paschal</hi> Supper. The holy and compassionate <hi>Jesus</hi> had been fortifying their minds with fit considerations against his departure from them, had told them, that he was going to prepare room for them in the Mansions of the Blessed, that he himself was <hi>the way, the truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and the life,</hi> and <hi>that no man could come to the Father but by him,</hi> and that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, <hi>they both knew and had seen the Father. Philip</hi> not duly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the force of our Saviour's reasonings, begged of him, that he would <hi>shew them the Father,</hi> and then this would abundantly convince and satisfie them. We can hardly suppose he should have such gross conceptions of the Deity, as to imagine the Father vested with a corporeal and visible nature; but <hi>Christ</hi> having told them that they had seen him, and he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God of old was wont frequently to appear in a visible shape, he only desired that he would manifest himself to them by some such appearance. Our Lord gently reproved his ignorance, that after so long attendance upon his instructions, he should not know, that he was the Image of his Father, the express characters of his infinite wisdom, power and goodness appearing in him, that he said and did nothing but by his Father's appointment, which if they did not believe, his miracles were a sufficient evidence: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such demands were unnecessary and impertinent, and that it argued great weakness after more than three years education under his discipline and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution to be so unskilful in those matters. God expects improvement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mens opportunities, to be old and ignorant in the School of <hi>Christ,</hi> deserves both reproach and punishment, 'tis the character of very bad persons, that <hi>they are ever learning,</hi>

By the constancy of his

preaching, and the efficacy of his Miracles he gained numerous Converts, whom he baptized into the Christian Faith, at once curing both Souls and Bodies, their Souls of Error and Idolatry, their Bodies of infirmities and distempers, healing diseases, dispossessing <hi>Daemons,</hi> settling Churches, and appointing them Guides and Ministers of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. HAVING for many years successfully managed his Apostolical Office in all those parts, he came in the last periods of his life to <hi>Hierapolis</hi> in <hi>Phrygia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Metaphr. &amp; Niceph. ibid.</note> a City rich and populous, but answering its name in its Idolatrous Devotions.

S. <hi>Philip</hi> was troubled to see the people so wretchedly enslaved to error, and therefore continually solicited Heaven, till by prayer and calling upon the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> he had procured the death, or at least vanishing of this famed and beloved Serpent: Which done, he told them, how unbecoming it was to give Divine honours to such odious creatures, that God alone was to be worshipped as the great Parent of the World, who had made man at first after his own glorious Image, and when fallen from that innocent and happy state, had sent his own Son into the World to redeem him, who died, and rose from the dead, and shall come again at the last day, to raise men out of their Graves, and to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and reward them according to their works. The success was, that the people were ashamed of their fond Idolatry, and many broke loose from their chains of darkness, and ran over to Christianity. Whereupon the great enemy of mankind betook himself to his old methods, cruelty and persecution. The Magistrates of the City seize the Apostle, and having put him into prison, caused him to be severely whipp'd and scourg'd. This preparatory cruelty passed, he was led to execution, and being bound, was hanged up by the neck against a pillar, though others tell us, that he was crucified. We are further told, that at his execution the Earth began sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to quake, and the ground whereon the people stood, to sink under them, which when they apprehended and bewailed as an evident act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vengeance pursuing them for their sins, it as suddenly stopt, and went no further. The Apostle being dead, his body was taken down by S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew,</hi> his fellow-sufferer, though not finally executed, and <hi>Mariamne,</hi> S. <hi>Philip</hi>'s Sister, who is said to have been the constant companion of his travels, and decently buried, after which having confirmed the people in the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> they departed from them.</p>

                     <hi>The-silence concerning this Apostle in the History of the Gospel. That he is the same with</hi> Nathanael, <hi>proved by many probable arguments. His title of</hi> Bar-Tholmai, <hi>whence. The School of the</hi> Tholmaeans. <hi>An objection against his being</hi> Nathanael <hi>answered. His descent and way of life. His first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to</hi> Christ, <hi>and converse with him. In what parts of the World he planted the Christian Faith. His preaching in</hi> India, <hi>and leaving S.</hi> Matthew<hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel there. His return to</hi> Hierapolis, <hi>and deliverance there from Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. His removal to</hi> Albanopolis <hi>in</hi> Armenia, <hi>and suffering Martyrdom there for the Faith of</hi> Christ. <hi>His being first flead alive, and then crucified. The fabulous</hi> Gospel <hi>attributed to him.</hi>

                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:98271:139"/>1. THAT S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> was one of the Twelve Apostles, the Evangelical History is most express and clear, though it seems to take no further notice of him, than the bare mention of his name. Which doubtless gave the first occasion to many, both anciently and of later time, not without reason to suppose, that he lies concealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some other name, and that this can be no other than <hi>Nathanael,</hi> one of the first Disciples that came to <hi>Christ.</hi> Accordingly we may observe, that as S. <hi>John</hi> never mentions <hi>Bartholomew</hi> in the number of the Apostles, so the other Evangelists never take notice of <hi>Nathanael,</hi> probably because the same person under two several names: And as in <hi>John, Philip</hi> and <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nael</hi> are joyned together in their coming to <hi>Christ,</hi> so in the rest of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew</hi> are constantly put together without the least variation; for no other reason, I conceive, than because as they were joyntly called to the Discipleship, so they are joyntly referred in the <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Catalogue; as afterwards we find them joynt companions in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Church. But that which renders the thing most specious and probable is, that we find <hi>Nathanael</hi> particularly reckoned up with the other Apostles, to whom our Lord appeared at the Sea of <hi>Tiberias</hi> after his Resurrection, where there were together <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Nathanael</hi> of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 21.1, 2.</note> and the two sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> and two other of his Disciples, who probably were <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Philip.</hi> That by <hi>Disciples</hi> is here meant <hi>Apostles,</hi> is evident, partly from the names of those that are reckoned up,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ib.</hi> v. 14.</note> partly because it is said, that <hi>this was the third time that Jesus appeared to his Disciples,</hi> it being plain that the two foregoing appearances were made to none but the Apostles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. HAD he been no more than an ordinary Disciple, I think no tolerable reason can be given, why in filling up the vacancy made by the death of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> he being so eminently qualified for the place, should not have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as well as either <hi>Barsabas</hi> or <hi>Matthias,</hi> but that he was one of the Twelve already. Nor indeed is it reasonable to suppose, that <hi>Bartholomew</hi> should be his proper name, any more than <hi>Bar-Jona</hi> the proper name of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> importing no more than his relative capacity, either as a Son, or a Scholar. As a <hi>Son,</hi> it notes no more than his being <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>the son of Tholmai,</hi> a name not uncommon amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> it being customary among them for the son thus to derive his name, so <hi>Bar-Jona, Bartimeus, the son of Timeus,</hi> &amp;c. and to be usually called rather by this relative, than his own proper name, thus <hi>Joseph</hi> was called <hi>Barsabas,</hi> thus <hi>Barnabas</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly so stiled, though his right name was <hi>Joses.</hi> Or else it may relate to him as a <hi>Disciple</hi> of some particular Sect and Institution among the <hi>Jews,</hi> it being a custom for Scholars out of a great reverence for their Masters, or first Institutors of that way, to adopt their names, as <hi>Ben-Ezra, Ben-Uziel,</hi> &amp;c. And this will be much more evident, if the observation which <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Bolduc. de Eccles. post. Leg. c.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 45. <hi>vid. de Eccl. ante Leg. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> one makes be true (which yet I will not contend for) that as several Sects in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church denominated themselves from some famous person of that Nation, the <hi>Essenes</hi> from <hi>Enosh,</hi> the <hi>Sadducees</hi> from <hi>Sadock,</hi> so there were others that called themselves <hi>Tholmaeans,</hi> from <hi>Thalmai,</hi> Scholar to <hi>Heber</hi> the ancient Master of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who was of the race or institution of the <hi>Enakim,</hi> who flourished in <hi>Debir</hi> and <hi>Hebron,</hi> with whom <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>confederate,</hi> that is, joyned himself to their society. And of this Order and Institution, he tells us, <hi>Nathanael</hi> seems to have been, hence called <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew,</hi>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:98271:139"/>
the <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Scholar</hi> of the <hi>Tholmaeans</hi>; hence said to be <hi>an Israelite indeed,</hi> that is, one of the ancient race of the Schools and Societies of <hi>Israel.</hi> This, if so, would give us an account of his skill and ability in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, wherein he is generally supposed to have been a <hi>Doctor</hi> or Teacher. But which soever of these two accounts of his denomination shall find most favour with the Reader, either of them will serve my purpose, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the difference that seems to be between S. <hi>John</hi> and the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists about his name, the one stiling him by his proper name, the other by his relative and paternal title. To all this, if necessary, I might add the consent of Learned men, who have given in their suffrages in this matter, that it is but the same person under several <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> names. But hints of this may suffice. These arguments, I confess, are not so forcible and convictive as to command assent, but with all their circumstances considered, are sufficient to incline and sway any mans belief. The great and indeed only reason brought against it, is what <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Tract.</hi> VII. <hi>in Joan. Col.</hi> 68. <hi>Tom.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp; in Psalm.</hi> LXV. <hi>Col.</hi> 671. <hi>Tom.</hi> 8.</note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> objected of old, that it is not probable that our Lord would chuse <hi>Nathanael,</hi> a <hi>Doctor</hi> of the Law, to be one of his Apostles, as designing to confound the wisdom of the World by the preaching of the Ideot and the unlearned. But this is no reason to him that considers, that this objection equally lies against S. <hi>Philip,</hi> for whose skill in the Law and Prophets there is as much evidence in the History of the Gospel, as for <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael</hi>'s; and much stronglier against S. <hi>Paul,</hi> than whom (besides his abilities in all humane Learning) there were few greater Masters in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. THIS difficulty being cleared, we proceed to a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our Apostle. By some he is thought to have been a <hi>Syrian,</hi> of a noble extract, and to have derived his pedigree from the <hi>Ptolomies</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon no other ground, I believe, than the mere analogy and sound of the name. 'Tis plain, that he, as the rest of the Apostles, was a <hi>Galilean,</hi> and of <hi>Nathanael</hi> we know it is particularly said, that he was of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee.</hi> The Scripture takes no notice of his Trade or way of life, though some cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances might seem to intimate that he was a Fisherman, which <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> affirms of the Apostles in general, and another particularly reports of our Apostle. At his first coming to <hi>Christ</hi> (supposing him still the same with <hi>Nathanael</hi>) he was conducted by <hi>Philip,</hi> who told him that now they had found the long-look'd for <hi>Messiah,</hi> so oft foretold by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets,<note place="margin">John 1.45.</note> 
                     <hi>Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph</hi>: And when he objected that the <hi>Messiah</hi> could not be born at <hi>Nazareth, Philip</hi> bids him come and satisfie himself. At his first approach our Lord entertains him with this honourable chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, that he was an <hi>Israelite indeed,</hi> a man of true simplicity and integrity; as indeed his simplicity particularly appears in this, that when told of <hi>Jesus,</hi> he did not object against the meanness of his Original, the low condition of his Parents, the narrowness of their fortunes, but only against the place of his birth, which could not be <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the Prophets having peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretold, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be born at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> By this therefore he appeared to be a <hi>true Israelite,</hi> one that <hi>waited for redemption in Israel,</hi> which from the date of the Scripture-predictions he was assured did now draw nigh. Surprized he was at our Lord's salutation, wondring how he should know him so well at first sight, whose face he had never seen before. But he was answered, that he had seen him while he was yet under the <hi>Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> before <hi>Philip</hi> called him. Convinc'd with this instance of our Lord's
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98271:140"/>
Divinity, he presently made this confession, That now he was sure, that <hi>Jesus</hi> was the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Son of God, whom he had appointed to be the King and Governour of his Church. Our Saviour told him, that if upon this inducement he could believe him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> he should have far greater arguments to confirm his faith, yea, that ere long he should behold the Heavens opened to receive him thither, and the Angels visibly appearing to wait and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. CONCERNING our Apostles travels up and down the World to propagate the Christian Faith, we shall present the Reader with a brief account, though we cannot warrant the exact order of them.

                     <hi>Eusebius</hi> gives a more particular relation: That when <hi>Pantaenus,</hi> a man famous for his skill in Philosophy, and especially the Institutions of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> but much more for his hearty affection to Christianity, in a devout and zealous imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apostles, was inflamed with a desire to propagate the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion unto the <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries, he came as far as <hi>India</hi> it self. Here amongst some that yet retained the knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> he found S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Gospel, written in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> left here (as the tradition was) by S. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> one of the twelve Apostles, when he preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel to these Nations.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. AFTER his labours in these parts of the World, he returned to the more <hi>Western</hi> and <hi>Northern</hi> parts of <hi>Asia.</hi> At <hi>Hieropolis</hi> in <hi>Phrygia</hi> we find him in company with S. <hi>Philip,</hi> instructing that place in the principles of Christianity, and convincing them of the folly of their blind Idolatries. Here by the enraged Magistrates he was at the same time with <hi>Philip</hi> designed for Martyrdom; in order whereunto he was fastned upon the Cross, with an intent to dispatch him; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a sudden conviction that the Divine Justice would revenge their death, he was taken down again and dismissed.

it being but the same name expressed in different Languages. The History of the Gospel takes no particular notice either of the Country or Kindred of this Apostle. That he was a <hi>Jew</hi> is certain, and in all probability a <hi>Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>: He was born (if we may believe <note n="*" place="margin">

He was together with the rest called to the Apostleship, and not long after gave an eminent instance of his hearty willingness to undergo the saddest fate that might attend them. For when the rest of the Apostles disswaded our Saviour from going into <hi>Judaea</hi> (whither he was now resolved for the raising his dear <hi>Lazarus</hi> lately dead) lest the <hi>Jews</hi> should stone him, as but a little before they had attempted it, S. <hi>Thomas</hi> desires them not to hinder <hi>Christ</hi>'s journey thither, though it might cost their lives, <hi>Let us also go that we may die with him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 11.16.</note> probably concluding, that instead of raising <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, they themselves should be sent with him to their own Graves. So that he made up in pious affections, what he seemed to want in the quickness and <hi>acumen</hi> of his understanding, not readily apprehending some of our Lord's discourses, nor over-forward to believe more than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had seen. When the holy <hi>Jesus</hi> a little before his fatal sufferings had been speaking to them of the joys of Heaven, and had told them that he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prepare, that they might follow him, that they knew both the place whither he was going,<note place="margin">John 14.5.</note> and the way thither: Our Apostle replied, that they knew not <hi>whither</hi> he went, and much less the <hi>way</hi> that led to it. To which our Lord returns this short but satisfactory answer, That he was the <hi>true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way,</hi> the person whom the Father had sent into the World to shew men the paths of Eternal life, and that they could not miss of Heaven, if they did but keep to that way, which he had prescribed and chalked out before them.</p>

                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:98271:146"/>2. OUR Lord being dead, 'tis evident how much the Apostles were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted between hopes and fears concerning his Resurrection, not yet fully satisfied about it: Which engaged him the sooner to hasten his appearance, that by the sensible manifestations of himself he might put the case beyond all possibilities of dispute.<note place="margin">John 20.19.</note> The very day whereon he arose he came into the house where they were, while for fear of the <hi>Jews</hi> the doors were yet fast shut about them, and gave them sufficient assurance that he was really risen from the dead. At this meeting S. <hi>Thomas</hi> was absent, having probably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recovered their company, since their last dispersion in the Garden, when every ones fears prompted him to consult his own safety. At his return they told him that their Lord had appeared to them; but he obstinately refused to give credit to what they said, or to believe that it was he, presuming it rather a <hi>phantasm</hi> or mere apparition, unless he might see the very prints of the Nails, and feel the Wounds in his hands and sides. A strange piece of infidelity! Was this any more than what <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> had long since foretold? had not our Lord frequently told them in plain terms that he must rise again the third day? could he question the possibility of it, who had so often seen him do the greatest miracles? was it reasonable to reject the testimony of so many eye-witnesses, ten to one against himself, and of whose fidelity he was assured? or could he think that either themselves should be deceived, or that they would jest and trifle with him in so solemn and serious a matter? A stubbornness that might have betrayed him into an eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity. But our compassionate Saviour would not take the advantage of the mans refractory unbelief, but on that day sevennight again came to them, as they were solemnly met at their devotions, and calling to <hi>Thomas,</hi> bad him look upon his hands, put his fingers into the prints of the Nails, and thrust his hand into the hole of his side, and satisfie his faith by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration from sense. The man was quickly convinced of his error and obstinacy, confessing that he now acknowledged him to be his very Lord and Master, a God omnipotent, that was thus able to rescue himself from the powers of death. Our Lord replied no more, than that it was well he believed his own senses, but that it was a more noble and commendable act of Faith to acquiesce in a rational evidence, and to entertain the doctrines and relations of the Gospel upon such testimonies and assurances of the truth of things, as will satisfie a wise and sober man, though he did not see them with his own eyes.</p>

The <hi>Brachmans,</hi> who plainly perceived that this would certainly spoil their Trade, and in time extirpate the Religion of their Country, thought it high time to put a stop to this growing <hi>Novelism,</hi> and resolved in Council, that some way or other the Apostle must be put to death. There was a Tomb not far from the City, whither the Apostle was wont to retire to his solitudes and private devotions; hither the <hi>Brachmans</hi> and their arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed followers pursue the Apostle, and while he was intent at prayer, they first load him with darts and stones, till one of them coming nearer, ran him through with a <hi>Lance.</hi> His Body was taken up by his Disciples, and buried in the Church which he had lately built, and which was afterwards improved into a fabrick of great stateliness and magnificence. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">

But whether Travellers might not herein be imposed upon by the crafty artifices of the Priests, or those who did attend the Church; or if true, whether it might not be performed by art, I leave to others to enquire.

Doubted it has been by some, whether this was the same with that S. <hi>James</hi> that was Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> three of this Name being presented to us, S. <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> this S. <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Less</hi> (both Apostles) and a third sirnamed the <hi>Just,</hi> distinct (say they) from the former and Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> But this (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pretending to some little countenance from antiquity) is a very great mistake, and built upon a sandy bottom. For besides that the Scripture mentions no more than two of this Name, and both Apostles, nothing can be plainer, than that that S. <hi>James</hi> the Apostle, whom <hi>S. Paul</hi> calls <hi>our Lord's Brother,</hi> and reckons with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> one of the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the Church, was the same that presided among the Apostles (no doubt by vertue of his place, it being his Episcopal Chair) and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Nor do either <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>

And this seems most genuine and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, the Evangelists seeming very express and accurate in the account which they give of them: <hi>Is not this the Carpenter's Son?

He directed it to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Converts, dispersed up and down those <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries, to comfort them under sufferings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them against Error. He saw a great degeneracy and declension of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners coming on, and that the purity of the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith began to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the loose doctrines and practices of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> who under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of zeal for the legal rites generally mixed themselves with the <hi>Jewes:</hi> he beheld Libertinism marching on a-pace, and the way to Heaven made soft and easie, Men declaiming against good works as useless and unnecessary, and asserting a naked belief of the Christian doctrine to be sufficient to salvation. Against these the Apostle opposes himself, presses Purity, Patience, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and all the Vertues of a good Life, and by undeniable Arguments evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that that faith only that carries along with it obedience and an holy life can justifie us before God, and intitle us to eternal Life.

They abrogated the succession of ancient Families, thrusting obscure and ignoble persons into the High-Priests office, that so they might oblige the most infamous villains to their party; and as if not content to injure men, they affronted Heaven, and proclaimed defiance to the Divinity it self, breaking into and prophaning the most holy place.

Having confessed that they were of the Race and posterity of <hi>David,</hi> he asked what possessions and estate they had: they told him that they had but a very few acres of land, out of the improvement whereof they both paid him Tribute, and maintained themselves with their own hard labour, as by the hardness and callousness of their hands (which they then shewed him) did appear. He then enquired of them concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> and the state of his Kingdom, what kind of Empire it was, and when and where it would commence.

How little does kindness work upon a disingenuous mind! It was not the honour of the place, to which when thousands of other were passed by, our Lord had called him, the admitting him into a free and intimate fellowship with his person, the taking him to be one of his peculiar domesticks and attendants, that could divert the wretch from his wicked purpose.

And that the business might proceed with the greater regularity and success, they first solemnly make their address to Heaven, that the Omniscient Being that governed the World, and perfectly understood the tempers and dispositions of men, would immediately guide and direct the choice, and shew which of these two he would appoint to take that part of the Apostolick charge, from which <hi>Judas</hi> was so lately fallen.

Their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses were usually mystical and allegorical, seeking hidden sences under plain words, and of such an <hi>allegorical Philosophy</hi> consisted the Books of their Religion, left them by their Ancestors: The Law they compared to an <hi>Animal,</hi> the Letter of it resembling the Body, while the Soul of it lay in those abstruse and recondite notions, which the external veil and surface of the words concealed from vulgar understandings. He tells us also, that they took very little care of the Body, perfecting their minds by Precepts of Wisdom and Religion; the day they intirely spent in Pious and Divine Meditations, in reading and expounding the Law and the Prophets, and the Holy Volumes of the ancient Founders of their Sect, and in singing Hymns to the honour of their Maker; absolutely temperate and abstemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, neither eating nor drinking till Night, the only time they thought fit to refresh and regard the Body, some of them out of an insatiable desire of growing in knowledge and vertue, fasting many days together. What Diet they had was very plain and simple, sufficient only to provide against hunger and thirst, a little Bread, Salt and Water being their constant bill of fare: their clothes were as mean as their food, designed only as a present security against cold and nakedness. And this not only the case of men, but of pious and devout Women that lived (though separately) among them; that they religiously observed every Seventh Day, and especially the <hi>preparatory</hi> Week to the <hi>great solemnity,</hi> which they kept with all expressions of a more severe abstinence and devotion.

Among other things he gives us a particular account of those great miracles which the Apostles did for the confirmation of their doctrine. And this (as <note n="*" place="margin">
