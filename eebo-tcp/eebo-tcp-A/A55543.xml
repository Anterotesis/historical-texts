            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO <hi>Sam. Briscoe,</hi> Bookseller.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. BRISCOE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SVre none can prove a Warmer Patron to a Book, than the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller for whom 'tis Printed; nor can any one have a juster Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Dedication of a Play, than he who uses to pay so largely most Dedicators. You promis'd to stand Godfather to this Off-spring of a Nameless Parent; and, as 'tis like to make some Figure in the World; we hope it will soon Recompence your Liberality to those who usher it into it: For, while other Patrons often purchase nothing but empty Air, and are swell'd with it, to the Decay of their more solid Parts; but you are for more substantial Gain, and get Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for Paper, while they get nothing but Paper for Money.</p>
            <p>Most Readers rather judge of the Worth of a Book, by the Name of the Bookseller that Prints it, than by that of the Great Man to whom 'tis Inscrib'd; and this must needs be thought the better, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only Printed for you, but Dedicated to you, who are fam'd for Printing few Things but what are Vseful and Entertaining, and who hate a dull Scribler, as much as he hates a severe Critick; or we, both Scribles and Criticks, a thin Pit, or a long Vacation. And, indeed, this Opera will require no less powerful an Interest, than yours Mr. <hi>Briscoe</hi>: For you know, that many Books are only thought bad, through the Prejudice of most Readers against their Nameless Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as if those Works were not worth owning; and many are thought good only for the sake of the Author's Fame. 'Thus, let the best Master of Poetry, but publish a Poem without owning it, great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Faults will be found, which otherwise wou'd perhaps pass as Beauties. Now your Recommendation-Name, Mr. <hi>Briscoe,</hi> will infallibly supply the Want of the Authors; and thus his Modesty will only prove like those Shades that add strength to Pictures, and set the Beauties in a truer Light. For who can be supposed to understand
<pb facs="tcp:60071:3"/>
Plays better than you, whose Business they have been so long, and who wholly Converse with the Ingenious and <hi>Bookish</hi>-Part of the World? Who but knows, what a kind Influence depends on you, from the Superior Orbs of Wit, with which you are so often in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction? And 'tis but just it shou'd be so; for while most Libraries are made up of the Outcasts of Booksellers Shops, yours, Mr. <hi>Briscoe,</hi> chear'd by the Beams darted from the Neighbouring Spheres, is like a flourishing Garden, where every Day springs new Variety of the choicest Productions of Nature improv'd by Art; and thence the whole <hi>Letter'd World</hi> receives constant Supplies of the <hi>Useful</hi> and the <hi>Pleasing,</hi> without which it <hi>can no more subsist, than without the daily Concourse of Providence.</hi> There we borrow'd this <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile,</hi> Mr. <hi>Briscoe,</hi> which, by the way, confirms our Assertion; and there many others borrow, who do not so much care to acknowledge it: There from the Grave Politician, to the frothy <hi>Sonneter,</hi> from the Courtly Critick on Cloths, to the implacable Critick on Sence; from the All-Contemning Lord of Rhyme, to the All-admiring Country Wit, All-Wits, and Wou'd-be-Wits, are seen; too happy many of 'em, in finding something too Read in the Morning, that may enable 'em to Chat over their Tea in the Evening, without being reduc'd to pass six long Hours in a Balcony, in making Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms upon the Mobb. But we forgot that you and we are Men of Business; nor need we say any more to Recommend this Piece to you, and the Town, to whose Generous Indulgence we leave it; heartily wishing, you may sell off as many Impressions of it, as we wish our selves Benefactors on <hi>Wednesday,</hi> and <hi>Saturday</hi> next, the Visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Days of,</p>

               <p>It was that Ape in White, that Boy <hi>Seraphino,</hi> made us turn Religious.</p>

               <speaker>Her.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, a dissembling little Hypocrite, he told us the finest Tales of <hi>Paradice,</hi> and what fine Lives we shou'd lead when we came there, that, I'gad, 'twou'd have made a <hi>Turk</hi> turn'd Toper, to have heard him; and now all our promis'd Pleasures are turn'd to Tears and Grimmaces.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Spun.</speaker>
               <p>I wonder, Brother <hi>Hersius,</hi> what the Pleasures of <hi>Elizium</hi> are?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Her.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I fancied you must know that in every Corner there, I shou'd have found a Young Handsome Wench ready to have devour'd me; but there's no such Pleasure in Religion as I can find.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Spun,</speaker>
               <p>Why 'tis a Liquor the God's drink when they mean to make Merry; and when their Hands are in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they make no more of Dusting of a Tub of <hi>Nectar,</hi> then we do of a Tub of <hi>Greek</hi> Wine: But when shall I come to those Delicious Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures?

               <p>Ay, marry, I believe the best of 'em all wou'd be glad to be secur'd that; in the mean time they are glad to be secur'd with fat Livings, whose Trade it is to tell us of <hi>Elizium</hi>; for I observe, they are much more afraid of Dying, than we Whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Drinkers, Brother <hi>Spungius.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Her.</speaker>
               <p>That is to make us Obedient, and them Rich; that what Pleasures they doubt of in th' other World, they may take in this before they go <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
